The lake sediments were sampled in summer stagnation in the surface layer at two stands in each lake: in littoral zone and in profundal zone at maximum depth of the lake. Results of the investigations show that Zn, Cu and Mn contents in the investigated bottom sediments were low and ranged within geochemical background limits or slightly exceeded them. Presence of the metals in the sediments was spatially differential. Zn, Cu and Mn contents were significantly higher in most cases in the profundal zone of each investigated lake than they were in the litoral zone. Another factor which significantly differs the heavy metals content was level of thermal stratification.																			1898-6188	2084-4530					2011	18	9-10					1293	1299																WOS:000420346800016
J	Olsson, IC; Greenberg, LA				Olsson, IC; Greenberg, LA			Partial migration in a landlocked brown trout population	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Population densities of landlocked lake-migratory brown trout Salmo trutta were estimated in two distinct lotic sections, separated by a lentic segment, in the Greana River, Sweden, and individual growth and habitat use were monitored for 835 tagged brown trout from September 1998 to June 2000. Residency dominated in the upstream section where density of 0+ and 1+ year brown trout was low and growth rate high. In contrast, >90% of the brown trout that migrated to the lake originated from the downstream section, where density was high and growth rate low. For >2+ year individuals, growth rate was similar between the two stream sections, but densities were higher in the upstream than in the downstream section. Lake-migrants had higher growth rates than non-migrants (residents) during the autumn of both years. From September to May, migrants increased their body mass by >35%, whereas nonmigrants increased by <5%. Approximately 70% of the brown trout moved <10m and <2% moved between the two stream sections, indicating that the lentic habitat might function as a barrier for juveniles. Differences in migratory behaviour, density and growth between the upstream and the downstream section might indicate that environmental factors influence the decision to migrate. It cannot be excluded, however, that the observed differences are genetically programmed, selected by migration costs that favour migratory behaviour downstream and residency upstream.

DISTRIBUTION OF TESTATE AMOEBAE (THECAMOEBIANS) IN A DESICCATING LAKE, INDIA	JOURNAL OF THE PALAEONTOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA												Distinct assemblages of testate amoebae can be correlated to a variety of environmental and climatic parameters. Among these factors, the substrate type, trophic status, dissolved oxygen and water table fluctuations are crucial for the proliferation of testate amoebae. Most of the research on testate amoebae has long been focused on a variety of ecosystems at mid-high latitudes; there is little data from the tropics in comparison. The purpose of this research is to contribute to this insufficient database by documenting testate amoebae in lake associated with Eichhornia crassipes macrophyte affected by annual extreme conditions of desiccation during summers in northern part of India. Fifteen species of testate amoebae belonging to six genera were identified. Centropyxis laevigata are in abundance and are excellent indicators of lake ecosystem stressed by seasonal desiccation and expansion facilitated by excess evapotranspiration from aquatic macrophyte mat over the lake surface. Arcella artocrea, A. vulgaris from the sediment-water interface beneath the Eichhornia mat shows its hydrophilous nature and hence are the markers of permanently wet oligotrophic conditions. Testate amoebae are one of the detrivores that indicate the trophic status of aquatic ecosystem, climate induced ecology and therefore, have potentials for monitoring (paleo) environmental conditions. It is inferred C. laevigata is cosmopolitan and not restricted geographically but may be distinguished by its ecological preferences and the biotope in the high seasonality region.

Routine crime in exceptional times: The impact of the 2002 Winter Olympics on citizen demand for police services	JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE												Despite their rich theoretical and practical importance, criminologists have paid scant attention to the patterns of crime and the responses to crime during exceptional events. Throughout the world large-scale political, social, economic, cultural, and sporting events have become commonplace. Natural disasters such as blackouts, hurricanes, tornadoes, and tsunamis present similar opportunities. Such events often tax the capacities of jurisdictions to provide safety and security in response to the exceptional event, as well as to meet the "routine" public safety needs. This article examines "routine" crime as measured by calls for police service, official crime reports, and police arrests in Salt Lake City before, during, and after the 2002 Olympic Games. The analyses suggest that while a rather benign demographic among attendees and the presence of large numbers of social control agents might have been expected to decrease calls for police service for minor crime, it actually increased in Salt Lake during this period. The implications of these findings are considered for theories of routine activities, as well as systems capacity. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Dissolved Iron and Organic Matter in Boreal Rivers across a South-North Transect	ENVIRONMENTS												Iron (Fe) is one of the main nutrients present in dissolved, suspended, and colloidal states in river water. Predicting the composition and size of dissolved Fe compounds is crucial for assessing water quality. In this stud, we used a combination of physical methods (filtration), chemical techniques (ion exchange chromatography), and thermodynamic modeling (Visual MINTEQ) to characterize dissolved Fe speciation in boreal organic-rich rivers across a sizable south-north transect. We chose contrasting rivers with a predominance of either allochthonous or autochthonous organic compounds. We found that the dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the studied rivers varies in molecular weights and the degree of humification. Regardless of the climate parameters of the river watershed, the dominant status of dissolved Fe during the summer low-water period was essentially colloidal and dominated by anionic complexes of the type [MeL]n-.

However, algal blooms repeated in the Qiantang River estuary, a typical macro-tidal estuary, which has seriously influenced the aquatic environment and water supply in Hangzhou. A coupled hydrodynamic-ecological model was established to explore controlling factors of algal blooms in Qiantang River estuary. Environmental variables were carried to study algal growth in which nutrients, water temperature and river runoff affect algal growth strongly in Qiantang River estuary according to the modeling. High nutrient concentration and temperature promote algal growth, and river runoff inversely. Substantially reducing on nutrient inputs is required to mitigate algal blooms due to high nutrient background concentration in the estuary, among which phosphorus reduce is more effective than nitrogen. In addition, more water should be discharged from the upstream reservoirs to suppress algal blooms in the drinking water source area of Hangzhou in summer.																			1755-1307						2020	569								012080	10.1088/1755-1315/569/1/012080	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/569/1/012080													WOS:000654254300080

Previous studies have shown that TEP concentrations can significantly contribute to the organic carbon pool in both marine and freshwater. Despite the relevance of TEP as a microbial substrate in aggregate formation, their fate within the hypolimnion has not been studied in deep lakes. This work is the first extensive analysis on the TEP space-time distribution and their role in the carbon cycle of Lake Maggiore, a subalpine deep lake where the presence of TEP became macroscopically evident in recent times. Our study demonstrated that in oligotrophic Lake Maggiore, characterized by low total organic carbon (TOC) concentration (summer max similar to 1.8 mg L-1), TEP can reach 36% of TOC in the photic layer while its weighted average in the hypolimnion below 100 m depth is 1.7%. We therefore hypothesised that most TEP is recycled in the upper layers, and that its contribution as carbon burial in the sediment may be lower than expected. TEP concentration exhibited a clear seasonal variability mirroring that of the autotrophic plankton. The models explain TEP variability as a function of chlorophyll a, a proxy for phytoplankton biomass, and a weaker effect of picocyanobacteria. TOC, but not TEP, influenced the abundance of bacterial aggregates, leaving open the role of bacteria and phytoplankton association in TEP formation.

QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The onset of the Holocene has been generally considered rapid and uninterrupted in the circum-Atlantic region. Loss-on-ignition (LOI - an index of organic carbon) profiles from 18 lateglacial-aged lakes in Nova Scotia, Canada, together with chironomid-inferred temperature reconstructions at 5 sites, demonstrate that the rapid warming from the Younger Dryas (GS-1) to the Holocene was interrupted by a cooling of 1.6-6.4 degrees C in summer surface lake water temperature. The resulting inflection or reversal on the rising temperature curve has, also been identified at 35 sites outside Nova Scotia from terrestrial and marine settings, indicating that this cool step is a robust feature throughout the North Atlantic and is likely the result of major oceanic and atmospheric reorganization of the Holocene climate system.

J	Troy, CD; Ahmed, S; Hawley, N; Goodwell, A				Troy, Cary D.; Ahmed, Sultan; Hawley, Nathan; Goodwell, Allison			Cross-shelf thermal variability in southern Lake Michigan during the stratified periods	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Results from a field experiment in southern Lake Michigan are used to quantify the cross-shelf nearshore variability in Great Lakes temperatures during the stratified season. The experiment was conducted along the Indiana coast of southern Lake Michigan, with temperature and velocity moorings arranged in a cross-shelf transect that extended to approximately 20 km from shore (40 m depth). The field site is noteworthy because of its location at the end of a major axis of an elliptical Great Lake, the relatively mild bathymetric slope, and local shoreline orientation that is perpendicular relative to the dominant summer winds. Measurements demonstrate that the location of the thermocline-bottom intersection is highly variable, causing a wide zone of extreme thermal variability in the nearshore region with time scales of variability ranging from hours to months. Near-inertial internal Poincare waves are shown to cause large thermocline excursions but primarily only during periods of elevated activity. Several full upwelling events were observed, but in general, they were brief, lasting only 1-2 days, and had very limited spatial extent (2.5 km or less). Nonetheless, the offshore extent of the upwelling front was shown to be reasonably estimated with a simple estimate of the cross-shelf transport caused by alongshore wind events. A persistent feature that determined the zone of elevated thermal variability (the thermocline-shelf intersection point) was the strongly tilted thermocline, which resulted in the thermocline being located very close to shore. No evidence was found to support the hypothesis that internal Kelvin waves affect thermal variability at the study location.

As the burial depth was increased the number of emerging shoots as well as the above-ground biomass per unit area decreased. The dry weight per shoot increased with increasing burial depth only during 1980. The plants emerged from a maximum depth of about 100-120 cm of sand. This emergence was primarily by elongation of stem internodes. However, there was an increase in the number of nodes on shoots emerging from .gtoreq. 60 cm of sand. Stem elongation brought the apical meristem to about 6-15 cm below the sand surface. Then the leaves grew upwards until they emerged from the sand surface. After emergence, the longest shoots were equally high regardless of depth of burial.																			0022-0477	1365-2745					1984	72	3					827	839		10.2307/2259534	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2259534													WOS:A1984TT13600008

In this research, the performance of quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA) was evaluated for deriving water total absorption coefficient a(lambda), from remote sensing reflectance R-rs(lambda), using in situ data sets collected in typically turbid waters including Chagan Lake, Songhua Lake, and Shitoukoumen and Xinlicheng reservoirs in Northeast China. A better performance of algorithm was observed when the calculation parameter of reference wavelength was shifted from 670 nm to 700 or 740 nm. In particular, the accuracy of estimated absorption coefficients at 550 and 675 nm for Songhua Lake in the summer was much improved when using 700 nm as reference band. In general, the QAA typically underestimated a(nw)(lambda) (nonwater absorption) for all the waters in different seasons with regression slope lower than one especially at 400 nm. However, longer reference wavelength leads to more uncertainties in deriving a(nw)(lambda) with higher root-mean-square error (RMSE) and absolute percentage difference (APD) at 440 nm. It was found that if the average contribution of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption at 440 nm dominates over the nonwater absorption, QAA achieved a better predicted result. Under the premise of that, the larger the contribution rate of particulate absorption at 440 nm, the poorer the predicted results were derived. The relationship could be established between a(nw)(lambda) and R-rs(lambda) through QAA algorithm, but it is not an optimal algorithm for turbid case 2 waters and large amounts of in situ data sets in different seasons are needed to calibrate the algorithm to achieve better performances.

Both approaches revealed the dominance of bacteria belonging to the genus Thioalkalimicrobium, which are common inhabitants of soda lakes. A dense population of Thioalkalimicrobium (up to 10(7) cells/ml) was found at the chemocline, which is characterized by a steep oxygen-sulfide gradient. Twelve Thioalkalimicrobium strains exhibiting three different phenotypes were isolated in pure culture from various locations in Soap Lake. The isolates fell into two groups according to 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. One of the groups was closely related to T. cyclicum, which was isolated from Mono Lake (California), a transiently meromictic, haloalkaline lake.

A $400 million flood risk reduction project is now complete providing protection against a flood with an annual probability of occurrence of 0.4%. The primary geotechnical design challenge was to determine a cost-effective, stable, flood barrier alignment in a region where landslides are a common occurrence. The Red River of the north meanders through the lakebed deposits of Glacial Lake Agassiz creating riverbank instability. Determining those areas affected by prior landslide activity and developing slope stability models that accurately define soil shear strength and groundwater conditions proved difficult. Some of the geotechnical design difficulties encountered and lessons learned over the course of this project will be discussed. An overview of the design and construction of a slope stabilization project utilizing prefabricated vertical drains and staged embankment construction will be presented.																			0895-0563		978-0-7844-8281-0				2020		318					838	850																WOS:000565225300087

Larval long-toed salamanders incur nonconsumptive effects in the presence of nonnative trout	ECOSPHERE												Predators can influence prey directly through consumption or indirectly through nonconsumptive effects (NCEs) by altering prey behavior, morphology, and life history. We investigated whether predator-avoidance behaviors by larval long-toed salamanders (Ambystoma macrodactylum) in lakes with nonnative trout result in NCEs on morphology and development. Field studies in lakes with and without trout were corroborated by experimental enclosures, where prey were exposed only to visual and chemical cues of predators. We found that salamanders in lakes with trout were consistently smaller than in lakes without trout: 38% lower weight, 24% shorter body length, and 29% shorter tail length. Similarly, salamanders in protective enclosures grew 2.9 times slower when exposed to visual and olfactory trout cues than when no trout cues were present. Salamanders in trout-free lakes and enclosures were 22.7 times and 1.48 times, respectively, more likely to metamorphose during the summer season than those exposed to trout in lakes and/or their cues. Observed changes in larval growth rate and development likely resulted from a facultative response to predator-avoidance behavior and demonstrate NCEs occurred even when predation risk was only perceived. Reduced body size and growth, as well as delayed metamorphosis, could have ecological consequences for salamander populations existing with fish if those effects carry-over into lower recruitment, survival, and fecundity.

These organisms have been observed in a number of lakes but the conditions under which active growth occurred have not been defined. A population of Ochrobium sp. developed in the anoxic hypolimnion of Esthwaite Water, a eutrophic lake in the English Lake District. Direct counts and experimental evidence obtained with this population suggested that the organism was capable of anaerobic growth. Inhibition of growth by chloramphenicol provided further evidence of its prokaryotic organization. The population overwintered in the sediment and at the onset of summer stratification, with deoxygenation of the hypolimnion, migrated into the water column. There was insufficient evidence to implicate Ochrobium sp. in ferric iron deposition.																			0022-1287						1981	125	JUL					85	93																WOS:A1981ME98300011

Cyanobacteria have become increasingly dominant in summer in Lake Sevan, reflecting the eutrophication of the lake and formed a massive bloom event in 2018. These recent observations mark the transition of this previously oligotrophic high mountain lake into an eutrophic lake with scum-forming cyanobacterial blooms. A bloom ofDolichospermumin July caused a sudden increase in chlorophyll-aconcentrations up to, on average, 20 mu g/L and a strong decrease in water transparency. The cyanobacterial generaDolichospermum,Aphanizomenon,Anabaena,Cyanobium, andSynechococcuswere detected by metagenomic analysis of the lake bacterioplankton. A qualitative and quantitative assessment of peptide-based secondary metabolites revealed the first detection of cyanotoxins in Lake Sevan. Ten types of microcystin congeners were found in Lake Sevan. The total concentration of microcystins in the phytoplankton varied from 0.34 to 2.49 mu g/L. This first record of cyanotoxins in the largest lake in the Caucasus region calls for an urgent need for sustainable nutrient management and a systematic assessment of the ultimate causes that lead to the reoccurrence of scum-forming Cyanobacteria in this large Alpine lake.					; /J-3464-2018; Potapov, Sergey/J-3360-2018; Belykh, Olga/L-6880-2019; Rinke, Karsten/E-6163-2016; Schultze, Martin/D-4985-2015; Sorokovikova, Ekaterina/D-8694-2012; Belykh, Olga/J-3406-2018; Khachikyan, Termine/GRJ-8562-2022; Fedorova, Galina/I-3479-2012; Mamyan, Armine/GRJ-5442-2022; Aghayan, Sargis/L-7219-2015	Gevorgan, Gor/0000-0003-1870-9643; Schultze, Martin/0000-0003-3526-2919; Sorokovikova, Ekaterina/0000-0002-1431-6546; Belykh, Olga/0000-0002-1188-7351; Gevorgyan, Gor/0000-0002-3450-4405; Aghayan, Sargis/0000-0001-8516-2778; Khachikyan, Termine/0009-0001-1341-331X; Mamyan, Armine/0009-0008-4678-7589													1434-2944	1522-2632				NOV	2020	105	5-6					131	142		10.1002/iroh.202002060	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.202002060		JUL 2020											WOS:000544713500001

Littoral microcrustacean (Ctenopoda, Anomopoda, Onchyopoda) samples, aquatic macrophyte data and chemical measurements were collected from 51 freshwater lochs in the Isle of Skye, Scotland, during the summer of 1989. 2. Canonical correspondence analysis was employed to investigate correlations between the environmental data, the microcrustacean assemblages, and the aquatic macrophyte community types used for floristic classification of standing waters. Cluster analysis was used to classify lochs based on their microcrustacean assemblages. 3. The major trends in microcrustacean distributions were related to pH, catchment area, macrophyte diversity and the distance from the sea. 4. There was little correlation between the plant community types and microcrustacean assemblages. 5. These results support the case for the development of an integrated approach to lake surveys so that correlations can be made between environmental variables and the distribution and abundance patterns of the plant and animal taxa of conservation interest.																			1052-7613					DEC	1994	4	4					307	331		10.1002/aqc.3270040404	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.3270040404													WOS:A1994QA89300003

Since the perch occupied many different habitats within the ecosystem throughout their 1st yr of life, a number of techniques were required to sample the population. The early larvae and post larvae were planktonic and their distribution could be related to the effect of the winds. As soon as the young perch developed fins an inshore migration began. Virtually all the fish had completed this migration by the time they reached a total length of 19 mm, but the majority of the population reached the shoreline before attaining this size. During June and Aug. the 0+ perch formed large shoals around the shoreline, especially in sheltered areas in water less than 3 m deep. At the end of Aug., probably in response to falling lake temperatures, the perch fry migrated into deeper water.																			0022-1112	1095-8649					1981	18	1					15	30		10.1111/j.1095-8649.1981.tb03755.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1981.tb03755.x													WOS:A1981LD38700003
J	Wickham, SA; Nagel, S; Hillebrand, H				Wickham, SA; Nagel, S; Hillebrand, H			Control of epibenthic ciliate communities by grazers and nutrients	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Four in situ experiments were conducted to examine the potential top-down and bottom-up control of epibenthic ciliate communities. The experiments were run in the littoral of Lake Erken and at a brackish water site on the island of Vaddo on the Baltic coast of Sweden, during the spring of 2000. The experimental manipulations were the presence/absence of the natural macro-zoobenthos grazer community, cross-classified with the presence/absence of additional nutrients. Epibenthic ciliates responded to both manipulation of grazers and resources, but the response was group specific. Total ciliate abundance decreased when macrozoobenthos (largely chironomids, gastropods, trichopteran larvae, isopods and amphipods) were removed, thus excluding a direct predation effect of the macrozoobenthos community on ciliates. Total ciliate biomass, but not abundance, tended to increase in the presence of additional nutrients; an effect weakly dependent on season and site. The disparity between effects of nutrients on biomass and abundance was due to effects on heterotrichs, a group of large but relatively rare algivorous ciliates. The manipulations altered the ciliate community composition, and between lakes there were differences in species richness and diversity and experiments. However, neither the removal of macrozoobenthos nor the addition of nutrients changed species richness or diversity. This runs counter to work with other taxonomic groups, which shows maximal diversity at an intermediate level of resources or predation. This can only be partially explained by the lack of direct predation effects and the open nature of the experimental system.

We performed three, 1-week in situ experiments in March-April (expt 1), May (expt 2) and August (expt 3) 2003 in order to assess protozoan and virus- induced mortality of heterotrophic bacteria in a French lake. Viral and bacterial abundances were obtained using flow cytometry (FCM) while protozoa were counted using epifluorescence microscopy (EFM). 2. A dilution approach, applied to pretreated grazer-free samples, allowed us to estimate that viral lysis could be responsible for 60% (expt 1), 35% (expt 2) and 52% (expt 3) of daily heterotrophic bacterial mortality. Flagellate (both mixotrophic and heterotrophic) grazing in untreated samples, was responsible for 56% (expt 1), 63% (expt 2) and 18% (expt 3) of daily heterotrophic bacteria removal. 3. These results therefore suggest that both viral lysis and flagellate grazing had a strong impact on bacterial mortality, and this impact varied seasonally. 4. From parallel transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, we found that the burst size (i.e. the number of viruses potentially released per lysed cell) ranged from nine to 25 (expt 1), 10 to 35 (expt 2) and eight to 25 (expt 3). The percentage of infected heterotrophic bacteria was 5.7%(expt 1), 3.4%(expt 2) and 5.7%(expt 3) so that the calculated percentage of bacterial mortality induced by viruses was 6.3%(expt 1), 3.7%(expt 2) and 6.3%(expt 3). 5. It is clear that the dilution-FCM and TEM methods yielded different estimates of viral impact, although both methods revealed an increased impact of viruses during summer.

J	de Vicente, I				de Vicente, Inmaculada			Biogeochemistry of Mediterranean Wetlands: A Review about the Effects of Water-Level Fluctuations on Phosphorus Cycling and Greenhouse Gas Emissions	WATER												Although Mediterranean wetlands are characterized by extreme natural water level fluctuations in response to irregular precipitation patterns, global climate change is expected to amplify this pattern by shortening precipitation seasons and increasing the incidence of summer droughts in this area. As a consequence, a part of the lake sediment will be exposed to air-drying in dry years when the water table becomes low. This periodic sediment exposure to dry/wet cycles will likely affect biogeochemical processes. Unexpectedly, to date, few studies are focused on assessing the effects of water level fluctuations on the biogeochemistry of these ecosystems. In this review, we investigate the potential impacts of water level fluctuations on phosphorus dynamics and on greenhouse gases emissions in Mediterranean wetlands. Major drivers of global change, and specially water level fluctuations, will lead to the degradation of water quality in Mediterranean wetlands by increasing the availability of phosphorus concentration in the water column upon rewetting of dry sediment. CO2 fluxes are likely to be enhanced during desiccation, while inundation is likely to decrease cumulative CO2 emissions, as well as N2O emissions, although increasing CH4 emissions. However, there exists a complete gap of knowledge about the net effect of water level fluctuations induced by global change on greenhouse gases emission. Accordingly, further research is needed to assess whether the periodic exposure to dry-wet cycles, considering the extent and frequency of the cycles, will amplify the role of these especial ecosystems as a source of these gases and thereby act as a feedback mechanism for global warming. To conclude, it is pertinent to consider that a better understanding about the effect of water level fluctuations on the biogeochemistry of Mediterranean wetlands will help to predict how other freshwater ecosystems will respond.					de Vicente, Inmaculada/S-2067-2016; De Vicente Alvarez Manzaneda, Inmaculada/S-2067-2016	De Vicente Alvarez Manzaneda, Inmaculada/0000-0002-1449-5740														2073-4441				JUN	2021	13	11							1510	10.3390/w13111510	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13111510													WOS:000660836300001

The Water Framework Directive (WFD) provides a mechanism through which progress can be made on this issue. The Directive requires a classification of the ecological status of phytoplankton, which includes an assessment of taxonomic composition. In this paper, we present a composition metric, the plankton trophic index, that was developed in the WISER EU FP7 project and demonstrate how it has been used to compare national phytoplankton classification systems in Northern and Central Europe. The metric was derived from summer phytoplankton data summarised by genus from 1,795 lakes, covering 20 European countries. We show that it is significantly related to total phosphorus concentrations, but that it is also sensitive to alkalinity, lake size and climatic variables. Through the use of country-specific reference values for the index, we demonstrate that it is significantly related to other national phytoplankton assessment systems and illustrate for a single European (intercalibration) lake type how it was used to intercalibrate WFD boundaries from different countries.					; Morabito, Giuseppe/I-6633-2013; Drakare, Stina/ABF-1259-2020; Free, Gary/IUO-8431-2023; Carvalho, Laurence/D-3276-2009; Mischke, Ute/H-2147-2011; Drakare, Stina/D-4532-2016	Jarvinen, Marko/0000-0002-8107-8066; Morabito, Giuseppe/0000-0002-8223-3259; PHILLIPS, GEOFFREY/0000-0003-4415-7010; Carvalho, Laurence/0000-0002-9768-9902; Skjelbred, Birger/0000-0002-3338-7294; Drakare, Stina/0000-0002-7389-2105													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR	2013	704	1					75	95		10.1007/s10750-012-1390-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-012-1390-8													WOS:000314693600006

SOD activity increased toward the end of the spring algal bloom in Lake Kinneret simultaneously with maximal photosynthetic activity and conditions of elevated ambient stress such as high irradiance. Activity staining of native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels of bloom samples showed a similar pattern to the spectrophotometrically measured SOD. Both Mn SOD and CuZn SOD were present, however no Fe SOD was found in Peridinium. One of three isoenzymes of Mn SOD showed marked differential regulation of activity under stress. An increase in the quantity of the 32-kDa Mn SOD polypeptide during the bloom was found to be unrelated to senescence; it was assumed that this polypeptide was induced by stress. Thus, SOD in Peridinium undergoes physiological and molecular acclimation to seasonal environmental changes. When Peridinium was exposed to various O-2 and CO2 concentrations in culture, CuZn SOD significantly increased under high CO2 concentrations and normoxic conditions (20% O-2). However, at high irradiances, Peridinium cultures exposed to low and high CO2 concentrations also had similar CuZn SOD activity. It was concluded that stressful irradiance is the overriding cause of increased SOD activity in both lake samples and in cultures of Peridinium.																			0022-3646					OCT	1997	33	5					787	793		10.1111/j.0022-3646.1997.00787.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0022-3646.1997.00787.x													WOS:A1997YE65900010

Production of microbially-derived fulvic acid from photolysis of quinone-containing extracellular products of phytoplankton	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Photochemical and microbial processes in surface waters can result in changes in the chemical quality of dissolved organic matter (DOM), which may in turn influence other ecosystem processes. Microbially-derived non-humic DOM can enter the aquatic ecosystem through extracellular release. Further, it has been hypothesized that microbially-derived fulvic acid can form through condensation reactions involving non-humic DOM. We used spectroscopic measurements and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) modeling to characterize whole water and fulvic acid fractions of DOM at the outlet of an alpine lake in the Colorado Rocky Mountains during snowmelt through the summer growing season. Monitoring of the biogeochemical conditions at the outlet of the lake and conservative transport modeling of the PARAFAC components showed that quinone-like moieties of the microbially-derived non-humic DOM became more oxidized than the quinone-like moieties of the microbially-derived fulvic acid. Our findings suggest that while both microbial activity and photochemical processes play an important role in DOM cycling in lakes, some process directly correlated with hydraulic residence time may be particularly important for the redox active fraction of the non-humic DOM. Furthermore, biological monitoring results indicate that temporal changes in DOM chemistry cannot be attributed to changes in the biovolume of any one group of phytoplankton or the total number of bacteria. We present a conceptual model of biogeochemical processes influencing the production and decay of quinone-like moieties associated with the microbially-derived non-humic and fulvic acid fractions of the DOM in the lake. Additionally, we propose that the formation of microbially-derived fulvic acid is driven by photolysis of the microbially derived non-humic DOM pool and possibly associated condensation reactions.

J	PERSSON, L				PERSSON, L			FOOD-CONSUMPTION AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF DETRITUS AND ALGAE TO INTRASPECIFIC COMPETITION IN ROACH RUTILUS-RUTILUS IN A SHALLOW EUTROPHIC LAKE	OIKOS												In a shallow eutrophic lake in southern Sweden, 75% of the food consumed by 2 age classes of roach R. rutilus consisted of detritus and algae. The extensive use of these food items was probably caused by a shortage of animal food, a result of intraspecific competition. Food overlap between the age classes was high, but in summer they segregated with respect to animal food resources. High blue-green algal production in eutrophic lakes increases carrying capacity for roach, in relation to species not feeding on algae and detritus. Due to the poor nutritional value of detritus/algae, individual growth rates were low. Intraspecific competition has resulted in a population with small individuals, and length and age class diversity of the population is low. High intraspecific competition in fish populations probably reduces the variation in food resources used by the population.

Roles of Nutrient Limitation on Western Lake Erie CyanoHAB Toxin Production	TOXINS												Cyanobacterial harmful algal bloom (CyanoHAB) proliferation is a global problem impacting ecosystem and human health. Western Lake Erie (WLE) typically endures two highly toxic CyanoHABs during summer: a Microcystis spp. bloom in Maumee Bay that extends throughout the western basin, and a Planktothrix spp. bloom in Sandusky Bay. Recently, the USA and Canada agreed to a 40% phosphorus (P) load reduction to lessen the severity of the WLE blooms. To investigate phosphorus and nitrogen (N) limitation of biomass and toxin production in WLE CyanoHABs, we conducted in situ nutrient addition and 40% dilution microcosm bioassays in June and August 2019. During the June Sandusky Bay bloom, biomass production as well as hepatotoxic microcystin and neurotoxic anatoxin production were N and P co-limited with microcystin production becoming nutrient deplete under 40% dilution. During August, the Maumee Bay bloom produced microcystin under nutrient repletion with slight induced P limitation under 40% dilution, and the Sandusky Bay bloom produced anatoxin under N limitation in both dilution treatments. The results demonstrate the importance of nutrient limitation effects on microcystin and anatoxin production. To properly combat cyanotoxin and cyanobacterial biomass production in WLE, both N and P reduction efforts should be implemented in its watershed.

J	Tian, LL; Cai, YJ; Akiyama, H				Tian, Linlin; Cai, Yanjiang; Akiyama, Hiroko			A review of indirect N2O emission factors from agricultural nitrogen leaching and runoff to update of the default IPCC values	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Indirect N2O emissions from agricultural nitrogen (N) leaching and runoff in water bodies contribute significantly to the global atmospheric N2O budget. However, considerable uncertainty regarding this source remains in the bottom-up N2O inventory. Indirect N2O emission factor associated with N leaching and runoff (EF5: kg N2O-N per kg of NO3--N) incorporate three components for groundwater and surface drainage (EF5g), rivers (EF5r), and estuaries (EF5e). The 2006 IPCC default EF5 value was based on a small number of studies available at the time. Here we present the synthesis of 254 measurements of EF5, dissolved N2O, and nitrate from 106 studies. Our results do not support the further downward revision of EF5g by the IPCC and suggest an upward revision of EF5g of 0.0060. The emission factors for groundwater and springs (0.0079) was higher than that for surface drainage (0.0040). The emission factor for lakes, ponds, and reservoirs was 0.0012, whereas that for rivers was 0.0030, and a combined EF5r was 0.0026. Estimated EF5r and EF5e (0.0026) values from the study were close to the current IPCC default values (0.0025 each). We estimated an updated default EF5 value of 0.01 for the refinement of IPCC guidelines. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Castañeda, C; Herrero, J; Casterad, MA				Castañeda, C; Herrero, J; Casterad, MA			Facies identification within the playa-lakes of the Monegros desert, Spain, from field and satellite data	CATENA												The Monegros desert and its saline wetlands, called saladas (literally translated as "the salties"), are a unique European landscape of great scientific and ecological value. The saladas (i.e., playa-lakes and other small saline depressions) are dynamic environments; changing their surface morphology on a seasonal-diurnal basis in response to both climate and groundwater fluxes. To depict changes in these natural systems, we have identified five surface facies classes which are detectable both in the field and from remote sensing data. These facies are crucial for describing and promoting the protection of these habitats. Remote sensing has provided worthwhile historical data and additional information that compensate for scarce field records. Combined field and satellite criteria are used to catalog these facies with a new conceptual integration that manages the asynchronism between the field and satellite data. The catalog of facies is intended to be helpful for monitoring these wetlands, and for understanding the current hydrological patterns and trends in the playa-lakes. This work will serve as a baseline for studying the future evolution of the saladas which may soon fall under manmade environmental forces such as increased water input from adjacent newly irrigated lands. It is hoped that identification of these facies will be useful, with minor adaptations, in using more advanced sensors or in studying similar habitats. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

J	Zuo, YG; Zhang, K; Zhou, S				Zuo, Yuegang; Zhang, Kai; Zhou, Si			Determination of estrogenic steroids and microbial and photochemical degradation of 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) in lake surface water, a case study	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS												In this study, a GC-MS technique was applied to determine 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), an active ingredient of oral contraceptives, and its fate in Lake Quinsigamond, Massachusetts, USA. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first study of EE2 and its microbial and photochemical degradation in a lake ecosystem. EE2 was detected at a concentration up to 11.1 ng L-1. At this concentration EE2 may affect the reproduction of fish and other aquatic organisms in the lake due to its high estrogenic activity. EE2 was persistent to the biodegradation by the microorganisms in the lake. Under aerobic conditions a long lag phase (42 days) was observed before the biodegradation of EE2 and a half-life of 108 days was estimated. Under anaerobic conditions, EE2 experienced even a longer acclimation stage (63 days) and a slower microbial degradation in the lake water. The photodegradation of EE2 was rapid in the lake surface water under natural sunlight, with a half-life of less than 2 days in summer sunny days. Compared to biodegradation, photodegradation may represent a predominant removal mechanism for EE2 in natural surface waters.																			2050-7887	2050-7895					2013	15	8					1529	1535		10.1039/c3em00239j	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3em00239j								23788286					WOS:000322177300006
J	Lowerre-Barbieri, SK; Vose, FE; Whittington, JA				Lowerre-Barbieri, SK; Vose, FE; Whittington, JA			Catch-and-release fishing on a spawning aggregation of common snook: Does it affect reproductive output?	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Interactions between fishing and the reproductive biology of an exploited stock are broader than the parameters historically considered (e.g., spawning seasonality, spawning biomass, and size or age at maturity). However, few studies address these broader interactions. Here we characterize a spawning aggregation of common snook Centropomus undecimalis, evaluate the feasibility of acoustic telemetry for monitoring the movement of released fish out of the spawning aggregation, and determine whether the stress of capture and release affects reproductive output. A spawning aggregation of common snook was studied in Lake Worth Inlet, Florida, during summer 1998 and 1999. The aggregation was made up of large, mature fish that were actively spawning, as indicated by females with hydrated oocytes or postovulatory follicles and males with flowing milt. Individual courtship behaviors by a few fish were observed by divers, but no spawning events were observed. Acoustic telemetry indicated that the stress of capture and release did not cause fish to immediately leave the aggregation. However, some individual movement into and out of the aggregation site was observed during the spawning season. Fish implanted with either live or dummy ultrasonic tags continued to spawn. Histological evidence suggested that the stress of being caught on hook and line and then released did not cause females to interrupt or terminate spawning. Released females were consistently recaptured from the aggregation, and levels of ovarian atresia and spawning activity were similar for both recaptured and control fish.

The RGM concentrations (4.2 +/- 6.4, 5.7 +/- 9.2, 6.0 +/- 10.8 pg m(-3) at the Potsdam, Stockton, and Sterling sites, respectively) were about 0.2-3% of the total gaseous phase mercury concentration (TGM: 1.84 +/- 1.24, 1.83 +/- 1.32, 3.02 +/- 2.14 ng m(-3), respectively) at the three monitoring sites. Standard deviations of RGM concentrations indicate that their daily variation was larger than that of TGM at all sites. This larger variation is probably because RGM is influenced by local sources to a greater extent than elemental mercury, which makes up to majority of TGM. There was no significant correlation between ozone and mercury concentrations. However, there was a significant positive correlation between water vapor mixing ratio and elemental mercury concentrations, suggesting that reduction of Hg2+ to Hg-0 occurred in liquid water contained in clouds and fogs near the three monitoring sites. TGM concentrations had a. generally negative correlation with ambient temperature, whereas RGM concentrations had a positive relationship. The negative relationship between TGM and temperature may be due to seasonal differences in emission rates of coal-fired power plants (winter maximum) in the northern hemisphere. This assumption was supported by a positive correlation between TGM and sulfur concentration, one of the major pollutants emitted from coal-fired power plants.

On the basis of integrated monitoring of internal and external nutrient fluxes, a progressing eutrophication was detected (similar to 3.5-fold increase in phosphorus (P) concentration in the lake over the past century). The lake is fortunately still oligotrophic, with high concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO) in the deep water that are requisite for the unique endemic bottom fauna. Hypolimnetic DO is not only very sensitive to changes in anthropogenic P load-via mineralization of organic material-but also to global warming via decrease of vertical mixing and less frequent complete deep convection. Moreover, these two human effects amplify each other. To keep DO from falling below currently observed minimal levels-given the predicted atmospheric warming of 0.04 degrees C yr(-1)-the P load must be decreased by 50% in coming decades. However, even with such a reduction in P load, anoxia is still expected toward the end of the century if the rate of warming follows predictions.

Of cultural significance are lakes, springs, soaks and watercourses that feature in Dreamtime creation narratives. Perth is experiencing major water shortages and many Nyungars feel that the degradation of the freshwater supply is a result of mismanagement and unsustainable development by non-Aboriginal people. Proposals for dealing with the issue are seen as equally out of balance with the natural order of things. Water regulators have much to learn from indigenous Australians about water and environmental management. Although water continues to be central to Nyungar identity, the study on which this article is based found evidence of attenuated knowledge about the Dreaming, with discontinuities evident in the way significance is increasingly being read in everyplace rather than in specific 'story places'.																			0029-8077					MAR	2008	78	1					62	75		10.1002/j.1834-4461.2008.tb00028.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/j.1834-4461.2008.tb00028.x													WOS:000256229700006

The longear sunfish occurred only in lakes with marl sediments and regions of sparse vegetation cover. The pumpkinseed occurred in all lakes surveyed and increased in abundance in lakes with greater vegetation density and/or more organic sediments. Quantitative measurements of habitat and food use were made in 5 lakes with sympatric populations. Data from underwater transects indicated that large (> 75 mm standard length) longear sunfish occurred primarily in shallow regions containing moderate to low vegetation cover whereas large pumpkinseeds were concentrated in deeper areas with heavy vegetation cover. The smaller size-classes of both species occupied the vegetation in deeper areas of the littoral zone. Large longears consumed predominantly large, sediment-dwelling mayfly or odonate nymphs regardless of the lake or habitat types. Pumpkinseeds consumed mainly gastropods and other prey from the vegetation. Preliminary studies of seasonal food use indicated that the pumpkinseed and longear sunfish both consumed more food in the spring and exhibited greater overlap in diet during this period. The relationship between foraging behaviors of these 2 spp., the types of prey consumed and the complications of assessing competition between species when food and habitat use are dependent on size were discussed.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1980	37	9					1411	1420		10.1139/f80-180	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f80-180													WOS:A1980KK67300009

Snail densities were much lower and size distributions depressed in lakes where trout were present. During the summer of 1986, lake trout were introduced into an arctic lake to test the effects of their predation on the dominant snail Lymnaea elodes. During July and early August, snail densities in the experimental lake remained stable in the deepwater areas of the lake, but increased significantly in the deepwater areas of an adjacent, troutless control lake, probably due to snail migration from the lake periphery in the absence of predation pressure. These experimental results suggest that the observed pattern of snail distribution and size in lakes containing trout is due to lake trout predation.																			0706-652X					MAR	1991	48	3					498	502		10.1139/f91-064	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f91-064													WOS:A1991EZ78800019
J	RITCHIE, JC				RITCHIE, JC			LATE-QUATERNARY CLIMATIC AND VEGETATIONAL CHANGE IN THE LOWER MACKENZIE BASIN, NORTHWEST CANADA	ECOLOGY												A 355-cm sediment sequence from Twin Tamarack Lake near Inuvik, Northwest Territories, Canada, provides a 14,500-yr record of pollen percentages and accumulation rates, interpretable in terms of climatic change and plant community dynamics. Four distinct pollen assemblage zones are recognized: a Gramineae-Artemisia-Cyperaceae-Salix zone from 14,500 to 11,800 BP; a Betula glandulosa zone from 11,800 to 84,00 BP, subdivided into 4 subzones (Gramineae-herb, Populus, Salix and Juniperus); a Picea-Betula zone, from 8400 to 5900 BP; and a Picea-Betula-Alnus zone from 5900 to 0 BP. The vegetation during the late-glacial at this site (14,500-11,800 BP) was relatively stable, consisting of sparse herb tundra on uplands in a slowly warming climate. Dwarf birch increased during this phase. The early Holocene period of maximum summer radiation produced thermal conditions .apprxeq. 10% warmer than present, intiating a change from tundra to woodland at most sites, effected by the efficiently dispersed Populus (chiefly P. balsamifera). Relatively rapid changes in regional vegetation occurred during this period (11,800 to 6500 BP); Juniperus invaded the poplar woodlands, occupying well-drained, favorable sites, and later the slower-dispersed Picea (chiefly P. glauca) arrived and formed stands on alluvial sites, largely replacing poplar. At .apprxeq. 7500 BP, B. papyrifera spread on to the uplands; the accumulation of fuel, accelerated by the spread of conifer woodlands, likely caused an increase in fire frequency, which in turn maintained arboreal birch in the area. Fire opened up the woodlands locally and promoted the spread of A. crispa, expressed in the pollen record as a prominent rise in both percentage and PAR [pollen accumulation rate] values. P. mariana and other species adapted to mire habitats spread at this time (.apprxeq. 7000 BP) as paludification, peat growth and permafrost aggradation occurred in the extensive lowlands. The termination of summers warmer than at present (.apprxeq. 6000 BP) initiated the development of a relatively stable vegetation that has persisted to the present.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1985	66	2					612	621		10.2307/1940410	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1940410													WOS:A1985AEV8400029

A Natural History of Northern Maine, USA, since Deglaciation	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST												We present a multi-proxy, postglacial paleorecord from Chase Lake, a 1.63-km(2) drainage lake in northern Maine. This record, along with published paleorecords from several smaller lakes and hollows allow us to synthesize a long-term natural history of the area. Northern Maine is unique in the northeastern USA as it was the last part to be deglaciated and has maintained a relatively cold climate and boreal flora. The diverse lake/catchment sites differed in dates of deglaciation (13,700 to 13,200 cal yr BP) and the duration of the ensuing tundra period (1700 to 2900 cal yr). A dry. cold climate slowed plant establishment. Chase Lake had low aquatic productivity until the end of the tundra period. The Chase record shows that afforestation began similar to 10,600 cal yr BP, similar to 1000 years after the end of the Younger Dryas, and 700-1400 years later than at the other sites, and was completed by 9200 cal yr BP. Initial open woodlands of Picea (spruce) (largely P. mariana [Black Spruce]), Abies balsamea (Balsam Fir), Larix laricina (American Larch), Pinus (pines), Betula papyrifera (Paper Birch), and Populus (poplars) gradually became closed forest. Climate substantially warmed at the outset of afforestation. Despite evidence of an increasingly wetter climate, as indicated by rising water levels at 2 seepage lakes, fire was common for the first 2000-3000 years of woodland and forest history, probably enabled by summer droughts. This fire period is not matched in intensity and duration later in the paleorecords. At Chase, afforestation was accompanied by an increase in insect remains including microlepidopteran defoliators, and these remained abundant for the rest of the record. Major increases of aquatic biota accompanied afforestation. Spruce greatly decreased by similar to 7500 cal yr BP as northern hardwoods and Tsuga canadensis (Eastern Hemlock) increased, but hemlock abundance remained low compared to farther south in the Northeast. From 7500 to 1300 cal yr BP. temperate tree taxa were at maximum abundances. Spruce and fir were at postglacial minima 6250-4400 cal yr BP. A relatively dry period 5300-3300 cal yr BP nearly eliminated hemlock at the outset. when it was replaced largely by Fagus (beech). Hemlock's partial recovery late in that period was accompanied by increasing Thuja (cedar) and decreasing Quercus (oak), the beginning of climate cooling and resumption of wetter conditions. This climate trend intensified after 3300 cal yr BP, resulting in further increases of cedar. spruce (largely Picea rubens [Red Spruce] and Black Spruce) and fir, which reached greatest postglacial abundances in the most recent 1000-1500 years. Long-term natural histories of selected woody taxa provide insights on ecological factors accounting for changes in species abundances. For example, the flourishing of cedar in the late-Holocene could have been abetted by increasing winter severity that eliminated Odocoileus virginianus (White-tailed Deer), heavy browsers on cedar. The geochemical history of the Chase catchment demonstrates ongoing weathering and depletion of several metals, resulting in enrichment of soils with silica. Several changes in metal concentrations are linked to afforestation, including increased transport to the lake sediment of Ca, K, Al. Fe. Cu, and Zn in/on increased organic detritus. Accumulation rates of metals and organic materials in the Chase Lake sediment were probably heavily influenced by physical processes including catchment erosion, shifts in sediment sources, and in-lake focusing.																			1092-6194	1938-5307				FEB	2021	28						1	76		10.1656/045.028.m1901	http://dx.doi.org/10.1656/045.028.m1901													WOS:000618622500001

Age-specific survival and recruitment of piping plovers Charadrius melodus in the Great Lakes region	JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY												Juvenile survival and age at first breeding (i.e. recruitment) are critical parameters affecting population dynamics in birds, but high levels of natal dispersal preclude measurement of these variables in most species. We used multi-state capture-recapture models to measure age-specific survival and recruitment probabilities of piping plovers Charadrius melodus in the Great Lakes region during 1993-2012. This federally endangered population is thoroughly monitored throughout its entire breeding range, minimizing concerns that measures of survival and recruitment are confounded by temporary or permanent emigration. First-year survival (+/- SE) averaged 0.284 +/- 0.019 from mean banding age (9 d) and 0.374 +/- 0.023 from fledging age (23 d). Factors that increased first-year survival during the pre-fledging period (9-23 d) included earlier hatching dates, older age at banding, greater number of fledglings at a given site, and better body condition at time of banding. However, when chicks that died prior to fledging were excluded from analysis, only earlier hatching dates improved first-year survival estimates. Females had a higher probability (0.557 +/- 0.066) of initiating breeding at age one than did males (0.353 +/- 0.052), but virtually all plovers began breeding by age three. Adult survival was reduced by increased hurricane activity on the southeast U.S. Atlantic coast where Great Lakes piping plovers winter and by higher populations of merlins Falco columbarius. Mean annual adult survival declined from 1993 to 2012, and did not differ between males and females. Enhanced body condition led to higher survival to fledge and early breeding led to improved first-year survival; therefore, management actions focused on ensuring access to quality feeding habitat for growing young and protecting early nests may increase recruitment in this federally endangered population.					; Saunders, Sarah/KHT-7861-2024; Arnold, Todd/H-6945-2019	Saunders, Sarah/0000-0002-2688-9528; Arnold, Todd/0000-0002-7920-772X													0908-8857	1600-048X				SEP	2014	45	5					437	449		10.1111/jav.00319	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jav.00319													WOS:000341706400004

Paul			Sensitivity of Caspian sea-ice to air temperature	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												Caspian sea ice concentration from satellite passive microwave data and surface daily air temperatures are analysed from 1978 to 2009. Relationships between mean winter air temperatures, cumulative freezing degree days (CFDD) and the sum of daily ice area (cumulative ice area) are found. These show that mean monthly air temperature of less than 5.5-9.5 degrees C, and a minimum CFDD of 3.6 +/- 11.2 degrees C, are required for ice formation in the northern Caspian. Examination of climate projections from multi-model ensembles of monthly mean air temperatures suggest that the northern Caspian may be largely ice-free by 2100 for the highest emission scenario. An ocean-ice-atmosphere model of the Caspian shows weak sensitivities of the minimum CFDD to varied sea ice albedo and ice compressive strength. Sea level decline is found to reduce the minimum CFDD as well as promote the formation of higher concentration or closed ice'.																			0035-9009	1477-870X				OCT	2015	141	693	B				3088	3096		10.1002/qj.2592	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/qj.2592													WOS:000366860500013

J	Hofmann, N; Fischer, P				Hofmann, N; Fischer, P			Impact of temperature on food intake and growth in juvenile burbot	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The effect of temperature on food consumption, food conversion and somatic growth was investigated with juvenile burbot Lota Iota (age 0 years). Juvenile burbot showed a significant dome shaped relationship between relative daily food consumption (C-R) and temperature (T) with C-R = - 0(.)00044 T-2 + 0(.)01583 T - 0(.)06010; (n = 90, r(2) =0(.)61). Maximum C-R was at 17(.)9degreesC (95% CL 17(.)2-18(.)6degrees C). The temperature related instantaneous growth rate (G) also followed a dome shaped function with G = - 0(.)000063 T-2 + 0(.)002010 T - 0(.)007462; (n = 95, r(2) = 0(.)57), with maximum growth rate at 16(.)0degrees C (95% CL 15(.)3-16(.)6degrees C). A significant linear relationship was found between the water temperature and the conversion coefficient (C-C) with C-C = - 1(.)63 T + 59(.)04; (n = 80, r(2) = 0(.)74). The results indicate that juvenile burbot in large lakes benefit from higher water temperatures in the littoral zone, by increased food uptake and growth, especially during the warm summer months. Because profundal water temperatures do not reflect the optimal temperature for food consumption in large burbot, temperature is unlikely to be the main proximate factor for the obligate littoral-profundal migration of juvenile burbot observed in many lake populations.

This study deployed advanced monitoring instrumentation, utilized innovative analytical techniques, and applied state-of-the-art statistical receptor models. This paper presents wet deposition data and source apportionment modeling results from daily event precipitation samples collected during the calendar years 2003-2004. The volume-weighted mean mercury concentrations for 2003 and 2004 were 14.0 and 13.5 ng L-1, respectively, and total annual mercury wet deposition was 13.5 and 19.7 mu g m(-2), respectively. Two new EPA-implemented multivariate statistical models, positive matrix factorization (PMF) and Unmix, were applied to the data set and six sources were identified. The dominant contributor to the mercury wet deposition was found by both models to be coal combustion (similar to 70%). Meteorological analysis also indicated that a majority of the mercury deposition found at the Steubenville site was due to local and regional sources.

J	Gu, XZ; Chen, KN; Zhang, L; Fan, CX				Gu, Xiao-zhi; Chen, Kai-ning; Zhang, Lei; Fan, Cheng-xin			Preliminary evidence of nutrients release from sediment in response to oxygen across benthic oxidation layer by a long-term field trial	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												In aquatic ecosystems, ecological processes such as organic matter mineralization and nutrient cycling are regulated by benthic O-2 in sediments, and application of in situ techniques in field environments has the potential to better define the links between O-2 dynamics and the unique biogeochemical phenomena occurring in these regions. The effects of benthic O-2 on sediment nutrients release were identified on the basis of field specific observations conducted over one and a half years at Taihu Lake. Sediment dredging (SD) practices have sharply reworked the benthic boundary oxidation layer, and the oxygen penetration depth (OPD) in the SD responded as expected to the new-born surface, increasing immediately (7.5 +/- 0.8 - 10.5 +/- 0.6 mm) after dredging, then further increasing with an unusually high heterogeneity when a significant submersed macrophytes (SM) coverage of about 40% was implemented. Multiple correlation analysis revealed that OPD was responsible for PO43- and NH4+ release. A lower benthic oxygen flux was immediately observed in dredging-related sediments in the case of dredging compared to SM or the control (CK), which suggested that oxygen demand is low in the uppermost sediments because of the degradable fresh organic carbon removal. SD and SDSM implementation was most successful at continuously reducing the size of PO43- released from sediments over one and a half years, and a significant seasonal-dependent release was also observed. The direction of flux was consistent among SD and SDSM, suggesting the potential to reduce internal PO43- release even further with the invasion of SM communities. Our results indicated that ecological engineering practices could alleviate internal nutrient loads from the contaminated bottom sediment, which was probably in positive response to benthic oxygen changes.

Daytime distribution of adult vendace was restricted to hypolimnion (minimum 5.degree. C). During nocturnal vertical migrations, adults moved into the metalimnion, but temperatures greater than 18.degree.C were avoided. In contrast, juvenile vendace were often found in the warmer and more shallow water of the metalimnion during the day. At night, the juveniles experienced a temperature change of 10.degree. as they migrated into the epilimnion. All age classes had a nocturnal/crepescular diel rhythm. The diel vertical distribution of vendace is interpreted as a response to temperature stratification and to diel changes in light intensities. The different responses of the age classes are influenced by ontogenetic changes in temperature and light preferences as well as by size-related intraspecific interactions.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				AUG	1986	43	8					1617	1625		10.1139/f86-200	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f86-200													WOS:A1986D371100017
J	Chang, KH; Hanazato, T				Chang, KH; Hanazato, T			Seasonal and spatial distribution of two Bosmina species (B-longirostris and B-fatalis) in Lake Suwa, Japan:: its relation to the predator Leptodora	LIMNOLOGY												In Lake Suwa, Japan, two Bosmina species, B. fatalis and B. longirostris, coexist and show different seasonal succession patterns. To determine the relative importance of factors affecting their succession, the seasonal and spatial distribution of the two Bosmina species and their relation to environmental variables were studied at six near-shore sites on Lake Suwa from May to October 2000, with measurements at each site made at 20 and 80m from the shore. We analyzed the seasonal and spatial distribution patterns of Bosmina, rotifers, and the major invertebrate predators, cyclopoid copepods and Leptodora kindti. A range of variables (water temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, and chlorophyll a concentration) was also measured. Multiple stepwise regression analysis was performed between Bosmina and the measured biotic and abiotic variables. Two species of Bosmina showed a marked pattern of seasonal succession, B. longirostris being dominant in May and October and B. fatalis exceeding B. longirostris in summer. However, the densities of both species and their density ratio differed between sites. The ratio of B. fatalis density to total Bosmina density, which indicates the dominance of B. fatalis, was correlated positively with water temperature and Leptodora density and negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen and cyclopoid cope-pod density. The results suggest that invertebrate predators play an important role in regulating the succession of Bosmina species in Lake Suwa.						chang, Kwang-Hyeon/0000-0002-7952-4047													1439-8621					APR	2003	4	1					47	52		10.1007/s10201-002-0085-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-002-0085-7													WOS:000185159100007

The rate and location of adoption of these technologies on residential distribution systems introduce operational uncertainties for which traditional utilities may not be prepared. This paper proposes a user-defined, data-driven risk assessment method to quantify the severity and likelihood of transformer and secondary conductor overload conditions posed by high levels of EV charging demand coupled with rooftop solar PV. The stochasticity inherent in the operation of a distribution secondary system is captured by employing data-driven probability distribution functions for residential loading, EV charging, rooftop solar generation and ambient temperature. Samples then are repeatedly drawn from each function as inputs to a Monte-Carlo, multi-period power fiowanalysis to calculate secondary line currents, total loading and accelerated transformer aging. The proposed approach is utilized to study transformer and secondary conductor overload risk as well as transformer loss-of-life for multiple EV and PV penetration scenarios using historical EV charging profiles and residential Salt Lake City load profile data for a peak summer load day.

Location: The Great Lakes-St. Lawrence forest of Canada. Methods: We characterized the recent (1959-1999) regime of large (>= 200 ha) fires in 26 deciduous-dominated landscapes and analysed these data in an information-theoretic framework to compare six hypotheses that related fire occurrence and area burned to fire weather severity, climate normals, population and road densities, and enduring landscape characteristics such as surficial deposits and large lakes. Results: 392 large fires burned 833 698 ha during the study period, annually burning on average 0.07% +/- 0.42% of forested area in each landscape. Fire activity was strongly seasonal, with most fires and area burned occurring in May and June. A combination of antecedent-winter precipitation, fire season precipitation deficit/surplus and percent of landscape covered by well-drained surficial deposits best explained fire occurrence and area burned. Fire occurrence varied only as a function of fire weather and climate variables, whereas area burned was also explained by percent cover of aspen and pine stands, human population density and two enduring characteristics: percent cover of large water bodies and glaciofluvial deposits. Conclusion: Understanding the relative role of these variables may help design adaptation strategies for forecasted increases in fire weather severity by allowing ( 1) prioritization of landscapes according to enduring characteristics and ( 2) management of their composition so that substantially increased fire activity would be necessary to transform landscape structure and composition.

Wetlands as long-term sources of metals to receiving waters in mining-impacted landscapes	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Wetlands are prevalent in the Sudbury, Ontario region and often operate at the interface between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, modifying water chemistry and potentially affecting the recovery of impacted lakes. The deposition of metals and sulphur in Sudbury in 2010-2012 was far below that reported in the 1970's, but still higher than background values. Wetlands in the area have accumulated large quantities of metals, and high concentrations of these metals in streams occurred primarily in response to SO4-related acidification events or associated with high dissolved organic carbon production in early summer. Concentrations of most metals in streams exceeded provincial guidelines and fluxes of some metals from catchments exceeded deposition inputs to lakes by as much as 12 times. The release of metals long after emissions reductions have been achieved must be considered in ecosystem recovery studies, particularly as dry conditions may become more prevalent in boreal regions affected by mining.

J	Ballantyne, CK				Ballantyne, Colin K.			The Loch Lomond readvance on North Arran, Scotland: Glacier reconstruction and palaeoclimatic implications	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												Geomorphological mapping of northern Arran provides evidence for two advances of locally nourished glaciers, the younger being attributable to the Loch Lomond Stade (LLS) of ca. 12.9-11.5 k yr BP, primarily through the mutually exclusive relationship between glacial limits and Lateglacial periglacial features. The age of the earlier advance is unknown. inferred LLS glacier 2 cover comprised two small icefields and eight small corrie or valley glaciers and totalled 11.1 km(2). ELAs reconstructed using area-altitude balance ratio methods range from 268 m to 631 m for individual glaciers, with an area-weighted mean ELA of 371 m. ELAs of individual glaciers are strongly related to snow-contributing areas. The area-weighted mean ELA is consistent with a north-south decline in LLS ELAs along the west coast of Great Britain. This decline has an average latitudinal gradient of 70 m 100 km(-1), equivalent to a mean southwards ablation-season temperature increase of ca. 0.42 degrees C 100 km(-1). Mean June-August temperatures at the regional climatic ELA, estimated from chironomid assemblages in SE Scotland, lay between 5.7 +/- 0.1 degrees C and 4.1 +/- 0.2 degrees C. Empirical relationships between temperature and precipitation at modern glacier ELAs indicate equivalent mean annual precipitation at the ELA lay between 2002 +/- 490 mm and 2615 +/- 449 mm. These figures suggest that stadial precipitation on Arran fell within a range between +8% and -33% of present mean annual precipitation.

Integrated Multisatellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) is the main high-resolution precipitation product, which is available to supplement measured missing data. To evaluate the applicability of this product in the Dongting Lake basin at multiple spatial and temporal scales, this paper analyzes daily, monthly, seasonal, annual, and extreme precipitation events of the three latest IMERG precipitation products (IPPs) (IMERG-F, IMERG-E, and IMERG-L) using eight statistical evaluation metrics. We find that the spatial and temporal performance of IMERG precipitation products varies over different time scales and topographic conditions. However, all three metrics (CC, RMSE, and RB) of the IMERG-F precipitation products outperform the IMERG-E and IMERG-L precipitation products for the same period. In the comparison of IMERG and TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) precipitation products on monthly and seasonal scales, IMERG-F performed the best. IPPs can capture precipitation more accurately on seasonal scales and perform better in winter, indicating good detection of trace precipitation. Both high and low altitudes are not favorable for the satellite detection of extreme precipitation in both general and extreme precipitation events. Overall, the accuracy of IMERG-F with correction delay is slightly better than that of IMERG-E and IMERG-L without correction under near-real-time conditions, which is applicable in the Dongting Lake basin. However, the correction process also exacerbates overestimation of the precipitation extent.					li, chuannan/HMD-1522-2023	Li, Shanshan/0000-0001-9279-8539; NING, Zihao/0009-0000-5149-4256														2073-4433				OCT	2022	13	10							1735	10.3390/atmos13101735	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos13101735													WOS:000872374700001

Myristoyl and palmitoyl astaxanthin esters were the most abundant pigments of T. sanguinea, whereas other carotenoids, considered to be diagnostic markers for dinoflagellates, were present here only in relatively low amounts. This is the first report where astaxanthin esters have been found as the major pigments in the taxon Dino-flagellata and largely over-expressed in comparison to the light-harvesting carotenoid peridinin. A plausible biogenetic route for the ketocarotenogenesis of T. sanguinea pigments is proposed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Noise-Reduced Quantitative Fluorine NMR Spectroscopy Reveals the Presence of Additional Per- and Polyfluorinated Alkyl Substances in Environmental and Biological Samples When Compared with Routine Mass Spectrometry Methods	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												Per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) are ubiquitous throughout the environment. Analysis of PFAS is commonly performed using both targeted and nontargeted mass spectrometry methods. However, it has been demonstrated that measurements of fluorinated compounds in the environment by mass spectrometry often fall short of the total fluorine concentration. In the present study, we employ a F-19 NMR technique, which is capable of detailing fluorinated compounds in a sample while providing both quantitative and structural information. Inclusion of a noise-reduction strategy involving the acquisition of arrays of spectra with an increasing number of transients addresses the sensitivity challenges of environmental nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), improving signal to noise. When this technique is applied to environmental and biological samples including rainwater, lake water, wastewater effluent, serum, and urine, the presence of PFAS, which may have been missed by routine mass spectrometric methods, is revealed. Important resonances in the F-19 NMR spectrum such as that of trifluoroacetic acid are brought above the limit of quantification in all samples, allowing detection limits as low as 389 pg/L in rainwater. A liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method, which was used to analyze 47 PFAS compounds, accounts for only 3.7-27% of the total fluorine concentration as determined by the NMR strategy in the present study.

In situ experiments were conducted in eutrophic Lake Mendota (Wisconsin, USA) during the summer of 1988, where phytoplankton were limited by N and P, but periods of nutrient limitation were transitory. Increased zooplankton biomass and the consequent increased excretion of nutrients by zooplankton reduced P limitation (as measured by specific alkaline phosphatase activity) in all experiments. Excretion of nutrients also reduced N limitation (as measured by ammonium enhancement response) in one of three experiments. In additional experiments in the more highly eutrophic Lake Wingra, excretion of nutrients by zooplankton reduced both N and P limitation. These results support the hypothesis that zooplankton have potentially important indirect effects on phytoplankton communities through recycling of nutrients.																			0142-7873					MAY	1991	13	3					573	588		10.1093/plankt/13.3.573	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/13.3.573													WOS:A1991FH42200009

According to histological analysis, under the natural conditions in the lower Odra River, ruffe's spawning season usually begins in April and lasts till the end of May. The fish from Lake Dbie started their spawning season in a similar period, while the fish from Warm Canal started their spawning season in March, a month earlier, and also finished their spawning season earlier. The size of oocytes from the ruffe collected in the Warm Canal at the beginning stage of vitellogenesis was smaller (mean diameter of 184.3m) and at the end of vitellogenesis larger (755.3m) than the size of oocytes from the fish collected at the other two sites (p < 0.05), although their sizes were within the typical range. In the gonads of the fish caught from June to September at all the sites, the presence of degenerating oocytes was confirmed. Folliculi atresia at the beginning of summer was observed in the last not-laid portion of oocytes, while the degeneration of a part of newly produced vitellogenic September oocytes was caused by a high temperature of the lower Odra River water, of over 20 degrees C at that time. Both types of oocyte degeneration are the natural adaptations to the conditions of a changing natural environment.

Seasonal invasive pneumococcal disease in children: Role of preceding respiratory viral infection	PEDIATRICS												OBJECTIVE. Our objective was to demonstrate correlations between invasive pneumococcal disease in children and circulating respiratory viruses. METHODS. This retrospective study included 6 winter respiratory viral seasons (2001 2007) in Intermountain Healthcare, an integrated health system in the Intermountain West, including Primary Children's Medical Center in Salt Lake City, Utah. Children < 18 years of age who were hospitalized with either invasive pneumococcal disease in any Intermountain Healthcare facility or culture-confirmed invasive pneumococcal disease at Primary Children's Medical Center were included. We analyzed the correlation between invasive pneumococcal disease and circulating respiratory viruses. RESULTS. A total of 435 children with invasive pneumococcal disease and 203 with culture-confirmed invasive pneumococcal disease were hospitalized in an Intermountain Healthcare facility or Primary Children's Medical Center during the study period. During the same period, 6963 children with respiratory syncytial virus, 1860 with influenza virus, 1459 with parainfluenza virus, and 818 with adenoviruses were evaluated at Primary Children's Medical Center. A total of 253 children with human metapneumovirus were identified during the last 5 months of the study. There were correlations between invasive pneumococcal disease and seasonal respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and human metapneumovirus activity. The correlation with invasive pneumococcal disease was strong up to 4 weeks after respiratory syncytial virus activity. For influenza virus and human metapneumovirus, the correlations were strong at 2 weeks after activity of these viruses. Pneumonia was the most common clinical disease associated with culture-confirmed invasive pneumococcal disease, mostly attributable to serotypes 1, 19A, 3, and 7F. CONCLUSIONS. In the post-pneumococcal conjugate vaccine era, seasonal increases in respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and human metapneumovirus infections in children were associated with increased pediatric admissions with invasive pneumococcal disease, especially pneumonia caused by nonvaccine serotypes.					; Kumar, Praveen/KHC-7586-2024; Sheng, Xin/JXN-1844-2024	Sheng, Xiaoming/0000-0001-6576-3699; Byington, Carrie/0000-0002-7350-9495; 													0031-4005					AUG	2008	122	2					229	237		10.1542/peds.2007-3192	http://dx.doi.org/10.1542/peds.2007-3192								18676537					WOS:000258142500001

Vegetation communities of western substeppe ilmens of the Volga delta	PHYTOCOENOLOGIA												A region adjacent to the west of the Volga river delta is known as "western substeppe ilmens" (WSI). Ilmens are elongated water bodies appearing during the spring floods and stretching from east to west. The Volga waters used to reach dozens of kilometres deep into the Precaspian desert, but due to various natural and human-induced impacts, many of them have become isolated from the Volga fresh waters which resulted in their drying-up and salinization. The vegetation cover of the western substeppe ilmens is characterized by a great diversity which can be attributed to extreme variations in moisture content and soil salinization levels. Thus, the moisture gradient ranges from aquatic to desert-like habitats, and the salinization gradient from almost non-saline soils to lakes with salt layer instead of water. Some new halophytic communities which were distinguished during the WSI investigations are discussed in the present paper.

Interspecific habitat associations of juvenile salmonids in Lake Ontario tributaries: implications for Atlantic salmon restoration	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												Diel variation in habitat use of subyearling Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), subyearling coho salmon (O. kisutch), yearling steelhead (O. mykiss), and yearling Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) was examined during the spring in two tributaries of Lake Ontario. A total of 1318 habitat observations were made on juvenile salmonids including 367 on steelhead, 351 on Chinook salmon, 333 on Atlantic salmon, and 261 on coho salmon. Steelhead exhibited the most diel variation in habitat use and Chinook the least. Juvenile salmonids were generally associated with more cover and larger substrate during the day in both streams. Interspecific differences in habitat use in both streams occurred with Atlantic salmon (fast velocities) and coho salmon (pools) using the least similar habitat. Chinook salmon and Atlantic salmon used similar habitat in both streams. These findings should help guide future management actions specific to habitat protection and restoration of Atlantic salmon in Lake Ontario tributaries.																			0175-8659	1439-0426				OCT	2014	30	5					853	861		10.1111/jai.12456	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jai.12456													WOS:000342991000003

Here, we firstly carry out multiple C-14 dating (plant remains, authigenic carbonate and bulk organic matter) and multi-proxy analyses (mineralogy, major elements, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), total inorganic carbon (TIC), carbon isotopic composition of bulk organic matter (delta C-13(org)) and inorganic matter (delta C-13(inorg)), and oxygen isotopic composition of inorganic matter (delta C-13(inorg))) on a 3.5 m-long core (QH1) in Lake Qinghai to illustrate the C-14 reservoir effects and paleoclimate changes during the last 6000 yr. The C-14 age-depth linear regressions of plant remains, authigenic carbonate and bulk organic matter present similar sediment accumulation rates of 17.59 +/- 0.21, 17.74 +/- 0.17 and 17.07 +/- 0.22 yr cm(-1) but different reservoir effects of 910 +/- 41, 1661 +/- 35 and 1031 +/- 49 yr, respectively. This evidence suggests that the new C-14 age-depth model used in this study is valid to estimate sediment accumulation rate and to distinguish different reservoir effects between multiple dating materials. Combing with the geochemical proxies, the paleoclimate fluctuated with a light drying trend from similar to 6,000 to similar to 4,000 cal yr BP. After the abrupt shift at similar to 4,000 cal yr BP, the paleoclimate became colder and drier. Since the Mid-Holocene millennial-timescale warm and humid periods occurred at similar to 5,900, similar to 4,800, similar to 4,000, similar to 1,800, similar to 1,100, similar to 600 and similar to 100 cal yr BP and relative droughts occurred at similar to 5,200, similar to 4,600, 4,000-2,000, similar to 1,500, similar to 900 and similar to 300 cal yr BP. These features can be attributed to the rapid strengthening and weakening of the summer monsoon circulation in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau.

J	St Esprit, C; Smith, L				St Esprit, Cory; Smith, Langdon			The Green State Parks Initiative: Utilizing Pennsylvania State Parks as a Case Study	JOURNAL OF PARK AND RECREATION ADMINISTRATION												State parks have long lived under the shadow of national parks, although most Americans have spent more time at these "lesser" recreational areas. In 2009, more than 725 million people visited state parks across the country-more than twice the number who went to national parks (DCNR, 2009b). In some cases, generations have grown up making pilgrimages to their favorite lake on summer weekends, which in all likelihood was developed as a state park. The value of state parks is even more obvious in the eastern United States, because of the lack of federal public lands. The benefits to society as a whole from such natural settings has been well documented and some have argued that visitors to these protected areas develop bonds with these places that extend far beyond the public land management paradigm centered on resource extraction and recreation activities (Davenport, Baker, Leahy, & Anderson, 2010, p. 53). Unfortunately, many state park facilities are experiencing the dual threats of decreased visitation and heavy budget cuts. Nationwide, state park visitation declined by roughly one million annual visitors between 2004 and 2009 (DCNR, 2009b). In Pennsylvania, for example, the number of visitors to the Commonwealth's 117 state park facilities dropped from 36.3 million visitors per year to 34.1 million visitors between 2005 and 2008 (Dysinger, 2010). With state governments facing challenging budget shortfalls, many state park agencies have witnessed severe budget cuts. Pennsylvania's budget for state parks was slashed from $219 million per year in 2008 to $157 million in 2010. These cuts have led to cancelation of environmental education programs, reduction of seasonal staff, and shortened summer seasons (DCNR, 2009b). As park managers struggle with both declining visitor numbers and budget cuts, some help may come from embracing components within the rapidly growing sustainability movement. "Sustainability" and "green" have become worldwide buzzwords. The concept of sustainability has emerged in the past thirty years as a leading framework for understanding economic development, community development, and natural resource management around the world (Schlossberg & Zimmerman, 2003), and state park agencies should not be independent from this movement. By playing a more active role in sustainability, through demonstration projects and education programs, state parks have an opportunity to become more relevant to solving problems that concern Americans today. Embracing methods to conserve energy through green building design or policy changes, and working to develop alternative sources of energy, such as wind and solar projects, also have the added benefit of saving scarce budget dollars. The purpose of this case study was to examine sustainability initiatives that are in place within Pennsylvania state parks. The Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR), is currently implementing a number of sustainable building design techniques, alternative and renewable energy projects, sustainable park planning methods, and sustainability education programs and workshops. These initiatives have been used as an attempt to both increase visitation, and to decrease park expenditures. Through these efforts, DCNR has emerged as a leader in the green parks initiative and has become a valuable resource to other state park agencies on how to develop their own sustainability programs (K. Bisbee, personal communication, January 29, 2010). There are numerous ways in which recreation and park facilities can implement sustainability practices to educate visitors on personal practices, encourage visitation to the parks, and decrease the park's operating costs on an already decreased budget.																			0735-1968	2160-6862				FAL	2011	29	3			SI		86	100																WOS:000442884300007

METHANE PRODUCTION AND EMISSION IN A TEXAS RICE FIELD	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												To refine estimates of source strengths from agricultural wetlands and to study the process of methane production and emission, this study was carried out in rice fields at the Texas A&M University Agricultural Research and Extension Center, Beaumont, Texas, during the summer of 1989. It focussed on two fields on different soil types (Lake Charles clay and Beaumont clay) and spanned a period from shortly after permanent field flooding (June 6, 1989) until field draining prior to harvest (August 28, 1989). Integrated methane emission over 75 days ranged from 4.5 to 15.9 g m(-2) . Aboveground biomass, net primary production, and root biomass were determined. Methane emission was strongly related to aboveground biomass in one of two fields studied. Laboratory incubations of soil cores show that methane production by soil bacteria is highest near the soil surface in the rice row and decreases with depth and distance from the plant. Much of the seasonal increase in total methane production is due to increasing activity at intermediate depths and distances from the plants. The temporal and spatial distribution of methane production was found to be related to root biomass. Seasonally integrated emission was 42% of methane production in both fields. Soil pore water methane and plant stem gas composition are related to the distribution in the soil of methane production and root biomass. Methane production ceased with field draining prior to harvest, even following prolonged anaerobic incubation. Methanogenesis rapidly resumed with added acetate substrate.

Average sulfate concentrations over most of ENA range from 1.5-3 mg l-1. Highest sulfate depositions (> 35 kg ha-1 y-1) occur over west Pennsylvania, the Virginias, east Michigan, and southern Ontario between Lakes Huron and Erie. Sulfate isopleths generally stretch along a SW-NE axis. In the northeast quadrant of ENA, 65-70% of the annual sulfate depositions occur in the April-September half year; some regions in southern Canada experience as much as 75% in that period. Average nitrate concentrations range from 1.sbd.2 mg l-1 throughout much of ENA. Peak nitrate depositions (> 20 kg ha-1 y-1) fall between Lakes Michigan and Ontario; 15 kg ha-1 y-1 or more cover most of the Midwest, New York, New England and south Ontario. Nitrate depositions are more evenly distributed throughout the year, with 55-65% occurring in the April-September half year. The average annual molar ratio of SO44- to NO3- varies from 0.8-1.5 over ENA. The ratio is highest at south-central receptors and lower at northern latitudes. Implications of these findings on strategies to mitigate acid deposition are discussed.																			1352-2310	1873-2844					1988	22	12					2751	2761		10.1016/0004-6981(88)90442-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0004-6981(88)90442-8													WOS:A1988R524000010

The species composition and number reflected the characteristics of both temperate and tropical areas in Lake SatTal. Copepod and rotifers showed their peak abundance from Aug. through Oct. and remain segregated in 3-5 m water column; whereas cladocerans which peaked during winter tended to be concentrated in the deeper strata (10-15 m) of the lake. The diversity was low due to dominance of only few species. The mean annual phytoplankton ratio to zooplankton biomass (P/Z) was 1.00 and 3.89 in western and eastern basins respectively. The rsource partitioning between 2nd and 1st trophic levels was not inefficient but energy transfer was more efficient between herbivores and primary carnivore.																			0003-9136						1985	102	4					519	535																WOS:A1985ADE2100009

Samples collected in the summer show that despite relatively tow airborne concentrations of particles with physical diameters >8 mu m, these particles account for the majority of the dry deposition mass flux. However, this sharp contrast is not found during January when particles with physical diameters of 4-8 mu m dominate both the airborne concentration and the flux. Dry deposition velocities (flux divided by airborne concentration) for particles are found to range from 0.0062 cm/s for 0.75-mu m particles to 5.4 cm/s far 24-mu m particles.

J	Zaibel, I; Zilberg, D; Groisman, L; Arnon, S				Zaibel, Inbal; Zilberg, Dina; Groisman, Ludmila; Arnon, Shai			Impact of treated wastewater reuse and floods on water quality and fish health within a water reservoir in an arid climate	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Treated wastewater (TWW) reuse for agricultural irrigation is a well-established approach to coping with water shortages in semi-arid and arid environments. Recently, additional uses of TWW have emerged, including streamflow augmentation and aquatic ecosystem restoration. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the water quality and fish health, in an artificial reservoir located in an arid climate (the Yeruham Reservoir, Israel), which regularly receives TWW and sporadic winter floods. The temporal distribution of water levels, nutrients and organic micropollutants (OMPs) were measured during the years 2013-2014. OMPs were also measured in sediment and fish tissues. Finally, the status of fish health was evaluated by histopathology. Water levels and quality were mainly influenced by seasonal processes such as floods and evaporation, and not by the discharge of TWW. Out of 16 tested OMPs, estrone, carbamazepine, diclofenac and bezafibrate were found in the reservoir water, but mostly at concentrations below the predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) for fish. Concentrations of PCBs and dioxins in fish muscle and liver were much lower than the EU maximal permitted concentrations, and similar to concentrations that were found in food fish in Israel and Europe. In the histopathological analysis, there were no evident tissue abnormalities, and low to moderate infection levels of fish parasites were recorded. The results from the Yeruham Reservoir demonstrated a unique model for the mixture effect between TWW reuse and natural floods to support a unique stable and thriving ecosystem in a water reservoir located in an arid region. This type of reservoir can be widely used for recreation, education, and the social and economic development of a rural environment, such as has occurred in the Yeruham region. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

China. In the last decades, several glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF) damaged infrastructure and claimed human lives along YarkantRiver in the TarimBasin. The spontaneous floods are a threat to over 1 Mio inhabitants in the floodplains of Yarkant River and are causing an annual monetary loss of approx. 10 Mio Euro. There are 33 recorded flood disasters between 1949 and 1999. The floods are provoked by melt-water, by rainstorms and - most violent and disastrous by glacial lake outbursts, effectuating peak discharges of more than 6'000 m(3)/s. The largest and most frequent glacial lake outbursts occur in the area of KeleqinRiver in the upper ShaksgamValley of the KarakoramMountains. Keleqin is one of several tributaries of YarkantRiver. The GLOFs originate from a remote ice-dammed glacier lake at 4'750 m a.s.l., approx. 560 km upstream of the floodplains. There, Kyagar Glacier tongueentirely blocks the riverbed. Based on a Memorandum of Understanding between the Ministry of Water Resources of P.R. China (MWRC) and the Swiss Federal Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications (DETEC), it was decided to initiate a Sino-Swiss project with the goal to implement an early warning system, allowing authorities and population to take the necessary measures in order to avoid victims, to raise the safety of settlements and livestock and to minimize damages to infrastructure and agricultural land. A further goal is to assess the long-term development of the flood hazard situation in the catchment area of YarkantRiver by analyzing past and real-time information/data on the glacier lake situation. In addition, scenario based forecasts of the future glacial lake developments are elaborated, considering on-going climate change. As a first step, a GLOF Early Warning System (EWS) was implemented combining satellite remote sensing and two automatic terrestrial observation and warning stations. The first automatic gauge and warning station is situated approx. 200 km downstream of KyagarGlacierLake and is operational since autumn 2011. Both water level fluctuations and EWS functionality are continuously monitored. The second automatic observation station is located directly at the glacier lake and is fully operational since autumn 2012. Based on camera images, the GLOF hazard potential can be identified. Both terrestrial stations are equipped with weather sensors for the monitoring of the local climate. Because the volume of KyagarGlacierLake is directly linked to its blocking icedam, an assessment of glacier dynamics and ice meltis crucial. Such calculations and climate change monitoring are needed to define future hazard scenarios and to plan protection measures. Flood modelling, the elaboration of a hazard indication map and an emergency risk management plan are other key issues of the on-going project.

Late Quaternary stratigraphy and luminescence geochronology of the northeastern Mojave Desert	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					Conference on Dating Quaternary Sediments and Landforms in Drylands	MAR, 2005	Zzyzx, CA	INQUA Dryland Dating Sub Commiss				The chronology of the Holocene and late Pleistocene deposits of the northeastern Mojave Desert have been largely obtained using radiocarbon ages. Our study refines and extends this framework using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) to date deposits from Valjean Valley, Silurian Lake Playa, Red Pass, and California Valley. Of particular interest are eolian fine silts incorporated in groundwater discharge (GWD) deposits bracketed at 185-140 and 20-50 ka. Alluvial fan deposits proved amenable for OSL by dating both eolian sand lenses and reworked eolian sand in a matrix-of gravel that occurs within the fan stratigraphy. Lacustrine sand in spits and bars also yielded acceptable OSL ages. These OSL ages fill gaps in the geochronology of desert deposits, which can provide data relevant to understanding the responses of several depositional systems to regional changes in climate. This study identifies the most promising deposits for future luminescence dating and suggests that for several regions of the Mojave Desert, sediments from previously undated landforms can be more accurately placed within correct geologic map units.

The distribution and concentrations of total mercury (THg) and particulate mercury (PHg) showed that algae had a large capacity to bind mercury in late spring (e.g, in May). It is shown that dissolved gaseous mercury (DGM) concentrations may also be affected by algae activities. The MeHg profile in the water column at a highly eutrophied site in Hongfeng Reservoir demonstrated that most of the MeHg was produced in the hypolimnion, whereas the MeHg profile pattern at another site with less eutrophication indicated that MeHg in water was largely ascribed to release from sediment. In September, the outflow of the reservoir was enriched with MeHg, which was 5.5 times higher than that in the inflows. The discharge of MeHg-concentrated water from the anoxic hypolimnion in the reservoir may pose a risk to downstream fauna. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The survival of 1st-year seedlings of P. trifoliata was very low (10.5%). Second-year seedlings had a 50% survival rate. The mortality was attributed to 2 environmental factors: insufficient soil moisture and illegal vehicular traffic. The slow elongation of the root makes the soil moisture a very critical factor. Shaded habitats within a Ptelea stand provide physical protection for the seedlings from vehicular traffic and have higher soil moisture: consequently, seedling survival is greater in shaded habitats than in open habitats. Because of the high mortality rate of young seedlings, seed production must be large to maintain the present population size.																			0003-0031	1938-4238					1977	97	2					350	362		10.2307/2425099	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2425099													WOS:A1977DE81000008

Pre-2010 historical seismicity near Christchurch, New Zealand: the 1869 MW 4.7-4.9 Christchurch and 1870 MW 5.6-5.8 Lake Ellesmere earthquakes	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS												The 5 June 1869 (NZMT), 4 June 1869 (UT) Christchurch earthquake has long been known to have caused chimney and structural damage, to Modified Mercalli intensity MM7, in central Christchurch. On 31 August 1870, another strong earthquake shook the city causing widespread contents damage and the cracking and fall of a few chimneys. These two events represent the most significant near-field earthquakes in Christchurch's historical record prior to the 2010 M-W 7.1 Darfield and 2011 M-W 6.2 Christchurch earthquakes. Comprehensive data on the effects of 1869 and 1870 events now provide reasonable constraint on their locations and magnitudes. The 1869 earthquake, known as the New Brighton earthquake prior to 1999, occurred at shallow depth (upper crustal) about 3 kilometres southwest of Christchurch Central Business District, within the aftershock zone of the 2010 and 2011 events.

J	Bida, MR; Tyler, AC; Pagano, T				Bida, Morgan R.; Tyler, Anna Christina; Pagano, Todd			Quantity and composition of stream dissolved organic matter in the watershed of Conesus Lake, New York	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a complex mixture of soluble organic compounds that plays important roles in stream ecosystem function. We examined temporal and spatial variation in stream DOM characteristics in the small watersheds draining into Conesus Lake, New York, USA. While all watersheds were impacted by human activity, our study sites spanned multiple land uses, with distinct differences in the proportion of agriculture and natural land cover. Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and inorganic and organic nitrogen and phosphorus were measured seasonally, with a more detailed analysis during the growing season. DOM composition was assessed with a suite of optical indices and multidimensional fluorescence with parallel factor analysis. Seasonal shifts in the composition and quantity of DOM, characterized by increased protein-like fluorescence in the growing season and maximum DOC concentrations in the fall, were consistent with abiotic seasonal controls and the seasonal influx of allochthonous organic matter to all streams. However, agriculturally dominated streams had higher inorganic nutrients, along with less-humifled, less-molecularly complex, and more protein-like fluorescent DOM than those with less agriculture, suggesting that nutrients may be stimulating greater in-stream DOM production. Stream order also played a strong role, with more similarity in the DOM pools in second order streams, consistent with high in-stream processing of both allochthonous and autochthonous DOM.

The Boron Budget in Waters of the Mono Basin, California	HYDROLOGY												Mono Lake in eastern California has the highest natural boron concentrations measured in a natural water body. Inputs to Mono Lake are from creeks that drain from the Sierra Nevada, accounting for over 80% of the total water input, and springs account for most of the rest of the water budget. We measured boron concentrations and isotope compositions of water sources in the lake and lake water collected over several seasons. The d(11)B offset of at least +2.5% between Mono Lake water compared to its inputs suggests that, like seawater, the boron isotopic composition of the lake is influenced by the removal of light boron by coprecipitation and/or sorption of borate. Given the alkalinity of the lake, boron fractionation likely occurs before or as the water sources enter the lake. The famous tufa towers around the lake are a physical representation of a 'chemical delta' that alters the boron isotopic composition of the source fluids as they enter the lake. Based on different combinations of the measured end members, the residence time of boron in Mono Lake is estimated to be within the range of 5 similar to 80 ka.

J	Yang, JP; Ding, YJ; Chen, RS				Yang, Jianping; Ding, Yongjian; Chen, Rensheng			Climatic causes of ecological and environmental variations in the source regions of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers of China	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY												In the source regions of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers of China, glaciers, frozen ground, the hydrological system, and alpine vegetation have changed over the past decades years. Climatic causes of these variations have been analyzed using mean monthly air temperature and monthly precipitation between 1956 and 2000, and monthly evaporation from phi 20 evaporation pans between 1961 and 1996. In the source region of the Yangtze River, lower temperature and plentiful precipitation during the 1960s and continuing into the early 1980s triggered a glacier advance that culminated in the early 1990s, while a robust temperature increase and precipitation decrease since 1986 has forced glaciers to retreat rapidly since 1995. Permafrost degradation is another consequence of the climatic warming. The variations in the hydrological system and alpine vegetation are controlled mainly by the climate during the warm season. Warmer and drier summer climate is the major cause of a degradation of the vegetation, desiccation of the high-cold marshland, a decrease in the areas and numbers of lakes and rivers in the middle and north source regions of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, and a reduction in surface runoff in the source region of the Yangtze River for the last 20 years. The causes of eco-environmental change in Dari area, near the outlet from the source area of the Yellow River, are different from those elsewhere in the study area. A noticeable reduction in runoff in the source region of the Yellow River and degradation of alpine vegetation in Dari area are closely related to the permafrost degradation resulting from climate warming.

J	Cáceres, CE				Cáceres, CE			Interspecific variation in the abundance, production, and emergence of Daphnia diapausing eggs	ECOLOGY												Despite the ubiquity of dormancy among invertebrates, the demographic ties between the active and dormant stages remain largely unexplored in most systems. Nevertheless, dormant stages could potentially have significant impacts on the ecology and evolution of the active population. In Oneida Lake, New York, populations of the suspension-feeding crustaceans Daphnia galeata mendotae and Daphnia pulicaria produce large numbers of long-lived diapausing eggs, which accumulate in the sediments to densities of over 2.5 x 10(4) eggs/m(2) for D. galeata mendotae and 8.0 x 10(4) eggs/m(2) for D. pulicaria. Sedimentation rates obtained by Pb-210 dating suggest that these eggs can remain viable for > 125 yr and that these two Daphnia populations have persisted in this system for > 200 yr. Total annual production of new diapausing eggs can range from 0 to over 10(4) new eggs/ m(2) of sediment. Annual emergence rates back to the water column are also variable but only range between 0 and 25 Daphnia/m(2). Because annual variation in the size of the overwintering water-column population ranges between 0 and 2.5 individuals/L, the contribution of emergence to the development of the spring population is considerable in some years and negligible in others. Despite similar maximum water-column densities, D. pulicaria produces and stores more eggs and has a higher rate of emergence than D. galeata mendotae, suggesting differences in the benthic-pelagic link of these two species. Diapausing eggs greatly increase the generation time of the populations that produce them and therefore have the potential to substantially alter the outcome of community interactions.																			0012-9658					JUL	1998	79	5					1699	1710		10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[1699:IVITAP]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[1699:IVITAP]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000074853000020

It goes with the flow: Size mediated plankton attenuation through the Niagara River connecting channel	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The Niagara River connecting channel provides a unique system in which to examine the impact of a rapid lentic-lotic-lentic transition on a freshwater ecosystem, particularly on plankton community composition. From June to October 2014, six monitoring sites (three in the upper river and three in the lower river) were sampled monthly for water chemistry, phytoplankton and/or zooplankton composition. Zooplankton biomass decreased exponentially with distance downstream, as expected within a high flow lotic environment. The rapid attenuation of zooplankton occurring within 10 km of the river mouth was likely due to predation by large populations of planktivorous fishes in the river. Densities of phytoplankton, rotifers and bacteria also declined but were less strongly impacted by the lentic-lotic transition. Plankton communities were dominated by species common to Lake Erie, the source waterbody, and also by taxa more resilient to the highly turbulent conditions of the river. These species included siliceous diatoms, filamentous algae, small zooplankters, dreissenid veligers and loricated rotifers. Furthermore, the seasonality of species composition in the Niagara River is the same as its source water body, suggesting no impact from the river on plankton succession. Niagara Falls and the two hydroelectric facilities were not found to be a significant cause of plankton mortality down river. There is some evidence however that entrainment time in the hydroelectric reservoirs may slightly enhance phytoplankton and zooplankton densities, thus contributing to plankton populations downstream of the turbine discharges.

The studied lakes provide domestic, industrial and agricultural water supply, and are major attractions for tourism, thus playing a significant role in the Polish economy. Study focus: The expected impact of future climate change on lake surface water temperature (LSWT) was predicted using the air2water model, which relies solely on daily air temperature (AT) as model input. LSWT and AT observations for the period 1987-2016 were used for model calibration and validation. Then, historical (1987-2005) and future (2006-2100) AT time series from nine EURO-CORDEX climate models were used to project future LSWT under emission scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. New hydrological insights for the region: The results showed that air2water can well reproduce daily LWST with root mean square errors lower than 1 degrees C on average. The warming trends of both AT and LSWT are expected to be lower than those observed in the past decades (after the 1980s), and ice cover and weak stratification conditions are expected to partially buffer the LSWT response to the high AT warming expected in future winters. However, the overall enduring warming will substantially alter future thermal dynamics, leading to a shortening of ice cover and inverse stratification periods, possibly leading to serious consequences for lake water quality and ecosystem health.

Variations in physical features of lake systems such as surface area and water level are very helpful in understanding regional responses to global warming in recent decades. In this study, multi-source remote sensing data were used to retrieve the surface area and water level time series of five inland lakes in the south-central part of the Tibetan Plateau over the past decades. Changes in water level and surface area of the lakes were investigated. The results showed that the water level of three lakes (Puma Yumco, Taro Co, Zhari Namco) increased, with expanding surface area, while the water levels of the other two lakes (Paiku Co, Mapam Yumco) fell, with shrinking area. The water levels of the lakes experienced remarkable changes in 2000-2012 as compared with 1976-1999. Spatially, lakes located at the southern fringe of the Tibetan Plateau showed consistency in water level changes, which was different from lakes in the central Tibetan Plateau.

J	Helmens, KF				Helmens, Karin F.			The Last Interglacial Glacial cycle (MIS 5-2) re-examined based on long proxy records from central and northern Europe	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Current multi-proxy studies on a long sediment sequence preserved at Sokli (N Finland), i.e. in the central area of Fennoscandian glaciations, are drastically changing classic ideas of glaciations, vegetation and climate in northern Europe during the Late Pleistocene. The sediments in the Sokli basin have escaped major glacial erosion due to non-typical bedrock conditions. In this review, the Sokli record is compared in great detail with other long proxy records from central, temperate and northern, boreal Europe. These comprise the classic records of La Grande Pile (E France) and Oerel (N Germany) and more recently obtained records from Horoszki Duke (E Poland) and Lake Yamozero (NW Russia). The focus of the review is on pollen, lithology and macrofossil- and insect-based temperature inferences. The long records are further compared with recent proxy data from nearby terrestrial sites as well as with the rapidly accumulating high-resolution proxy data from the ocean realm. The comparison allows a re-examination of the environmental history and climate evolution of the Last Interglacial Glacial (LI-G) cycle (MIS 5-2). It shows that environmental and climate conditions during MIS 5 (ca 130-70 ka BP) were distinctly different from those during MIS 4-2 (ca 70-15 ka BP). MIS 5 is characterized by three long forested intervals (broadly corresponding to MIS 5e, 5c, 5a), both in temperate and northern boreal Europe. These mild periods were interrupted by two short, relatively cold and dry intervals (MIS 5d and 5b) with mountain-centered glaciation in Fennoscandia. Millennial scale climate events were superimposed upon these longer lasting climate fluctuations. The time interval encompassing MIS 4-2 shows open vegetation. It is characterized by two glacial maxima (MIS 4 and 2) with sub-continental scale glaciation over northern Europe and dry conditions in strongly continental eastern European settings. High amplitude climate oscillations of millennial duration characterized the climate variability of MIS 3. Mild climate conditions in early MIS 3 caused large-scale deglaciation of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet, and ice-free conditions with Betula-dominated vegetation (including tree birch) persisted over large parts of Fennoscandia, possibly interrupted by glaciation, during major part of MIS 3 till ca 35 ka BP. Overall, MIS 5 was mostly mild with warmest or peak interglacial conditions at the very start during MIS 5e. MIS 4-2 was mostly cold with most extreme or peak glacial conditions in the closing phase during MIS 2. This points to a subdivision of the last climate cycle into an early, overall mild interglacial half and a late, overall cold glacial half, each with duration of ca 50 ka. This review also shows that the climate variability in central and northern Europe during the LI-G cycle was mostly in degrees of continentality with major shifts in winter temperature and precipitation values; summer temperatures, on the other hand, remained largely unchanged. It points to the waxing and waning of sea-ice over the North Atlantic Ocean as a possible characteristic feature of the Late Pleistocene. The present compilation, based on long terrestrial sequences, high-resolution multi-proxy data from the oceans, and quantified paleo-climate data, strongly favors a definition of entire Marine Oxygen Isotope Stage 5 as the Last Interglacial similar as in the original marine stratigraphy and the stratigraphy at La Grande Pile in France. The proxy-based climate data places the start of the Last Glacial at the base of MIS 4 and the northwest European Pleniglacial. It shows that the division between the Eemian (MIS 5e) and the Early Weichselian (MIS 5d-a) is not useful, as not relevant from a climate point of view. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Calcification prevents detrimental pH rise, but causes greater decrease of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). Concurrent DIC replenishment is therefore essential to maintain high photosynthesis. Here we show a mean daily DIC loss of 40% (26% to photosynthesis and 14% to calcification) in surface waters during summer periods in a shallow charophyte-lake and replenishment of the DIC pool by respiration and carbonate dissolution in the bottom waters followed by nocturnal mixing. The daytime DIC assimilation in organic matter relative to oxygen production in surface waters was close to 1.0 (molar ratio), while total DIC loss markedly exceeded oxygen production because of calcification. Our results suggest that photosynthesis would rapidly become carbon limited if permanent stratification prevented transfer of DIC from bottom waters to surface waters or if permanent mixing prevented CO2 accumulation conducive to carbonate dissolution in bottom waters. This vertical transport of DIC effectively functions as a physical and biological pump supporting high metabolism in charophyte-dominated shallow lakes with recurring daily stratification and mixing.

Inter-annual and seasonal variations of the water discharge and sediment exchange processes between Changjiang River and Poyang Lake are systematically explored to determine the influence of climate change as well as human impact (especially the Three Gorges Dam (TGD)). Results indicate that climate variation for the Changjiang catchment and Poyang Lake watershed is the main factor determining the changes of water exchanges between Changjiang River and Poyang Lake. However, human activities (including the emplacement of the TGD) accelerated this rate of change. Relative to previous years (1956-1989), the water discharge outflow from Poyang lake during the dry season towards the Changjiang catchment increased by 8.98 km(3) y(-1) during 2003-2010. Evidently, the water discharge flowing into Poyang Lake during late April late May decreased. As a consequence, water storage of Poyang Lake significantly reduced during late April late May, resulting in frequent spring droughts after 2003. The freshwater flux of Changjiang River towards Poyang Lake is less during the flood season as well, significantly lowering the magnitude and frequency of the backflow of the Changjiang River during 2003-2010. Human activities, especially the emplacement and operation of the TGD and sand mining at Poyang Lake impose a major impact on the variation of sediment exchange between Changjiang main river and Poyang Lake. On average, sediments from Changjiang River deposited in Poyang Lake before 2000. After 2000, Changjiang River no longer supplied sediment to Poyang Lake. As a consequence, the sediment load of Changjiang River entering the sea increasingly exists of sediments from Lake Poyang during 2003-2010. As a result, Poyang Lake converted from a depositional to an erosional system, with a gross sediment loss of 120.19 Mt y(-1) during 2001-2010, including sand mining. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Many studies have shown that rivers surrounding urban landscapes can be hotspots for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Here we investigated the variability of diffusive GHG (methane [CH4] and carbon dioxide [CO2]) emissions from rivers in different landscapes (i.e., urban, agricultural and mixed) and from lakes in Suzhou, a highly urbanized region in eastern China. GHG emissions in the Suzhou metropolitan water network followed a typical seasonal pattern, with the highest fluxes in summer, and were primarily influenced by temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration. Surprisingly, lakes were emission hotspots, with mean CH4 and CO2 fluxes of 2.80 and 128.89 mg m- 2 h-1, respectively, translating to a total CO2- equivalent flux of 0.21 g CO2-eq m- 2 d-1. The global warming potential of urban and mixed rivers (0.19 g CO2- eq m- 2 d-1) was comparable to that for lakes, but about twice the value for agricultural rivers (0.10 g CO2-eq m- 2 d-1). Factors related to the high GHG emissions in lakes included hypoxic water conditions and an adequate nutrient supply. Riverine CH4 emissions were primarily associated with the concentrations of total dissolved solids (TDS), ammonia-nitrogen and chlorophyll a. CO2 emissions in rivers were mainly closely related to TDS, with suitable conditions allowing rapid organic matter decomposition. Compared with other types of rivers, urban rivers had more available organic matter and therefore higher CO2 emissions. Overall, this study em- phasizes the need for a deeper understanding of the impact of GHG emissions from different water types on global warming in rapidly urbanizing regions. Flexible management measures are urgently needed to mitigate CO2 and CH4 emissions more effectively in the context of the shrinking gap between urban and rural areas with growing socio-economic development.					; Xu, Ligang/HHZ-1943-2022; Wu, Yakun/L-3663-2018; Fan, Hongxiang/AAC-7159-2022; Cheng, Junxiang/S-4125-2018	Fan, Hongxiang/0000-0001-7626-1344; Cheng, Junxiang/0000-0001-8717-9215													0048-9697	1879-1026				MAR 25	2024	918								170689	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170689	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170689		FEB 2024						38320709					WOS:001184085200001

Until now, the number and frequency of past explosive eruptions at Corbetti has been unknown, due to limited studies of frequently incomplete and patchy outcrop sequences. Here we use volcanic ash layers preserved in sediments from three Main Ethiopian Rift lakes to provide the first detailed record of volcanism for the Corbetti caldera. We show that lake sediments yield more comprehensive, stratigraphically resolved dossiers of long-term volcanism than often available in outcrop. Our eruptive history for Corbetti spans the past 10 k.y. and reveals eruptions at an average return period of similar to 900 yr. The threat posed by Corbetti has until now been underestimated. Future explosive eruptions similar to those of the past 10 k.y. would blanket nearby Awassa and Shashamene, currently home to similar to 260,000 people, with pumice-fall deposits, and would have significant societal impacts. A lake sediment tephrostratigraphic approach shows significant potential for application throughout the East African Rift system, and will be essential to better understanding volcanic hazards in this rapidly developing region.					; Schäbitz, Frank/ABE-5116-2020; Viehberg, Finn/F-4984-2010; Pearce, Nicholas/B-5295-2009; Asrat, Asfawossen/KBB-6085-2024; Lane, Christine/G-7998-2015; Frank, Ute/AAS-1157-2021; Smith, Victoria/P-6317-2016; Pearce, Nicholas J G/B-5295-2009	Brown, Maxwell/0000-0003-0753-397X; Schaebitz, Frank/0000-0003-3879-9308; Smith, Victoria/0000-0003-0878-5060; Viehberg, Finn/0000-0003-0253-2222; Asrat, Asfawossen/0000-0002-6312-8082; Martin-Jones, Catherine/0000-0003-1823-9784; Lamb, Henry Francis/0000-0003-0025-0766; Pearce, Nicholas J G/0000-0003-3157-9564													0091-7613	1943-2682				DEC	2017	45	12					1127	1130		10.1130/G39594.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/G39594.1													WOS:000416486200020

Although all ponds were eutrophic, based upon high chlorophyll a or dissolved nutrient concentrations, relatively large shallow ponds generally exhibited higher specific conductivity and dissolved phosphorus concentrations than small deep ponds, which exhibited greater water transparency and total dissolved nitrogen concentrations. Using multiple gear types, 13 688 fishes comprising 23 species were collected. All ponds were dominated by alien fishes; only three native species contributing <1% of the total number of individuals and <3% of overall biomass were captured.

J	REICHARDT, W; OVERBECK, J; STEUBING, L				REICHARDT, W; OVERBECK, J; STEUBING, L			FREE DISSOLVED ENZYMES IN LAKE WATERS	NATURE												The concentration of free enzymes in lake water is apparently correlated with the amounts of phytoplankton and bacteria. The activity of dissolved phosphomonoesterases of filtered lake water is compared with the total activity of unfiltered water. In the chief zone of destruction of phytoplankton (4-5 m deep) mineralization is obviously coupled with a sudden release of enzymes, indicated by a striking decrease of the quotient a/b [unfiltered/filtered lake water]. At other depths this quotient had a medium value. Total and specific activities of lake phosphatases are almost exclusively restricted to the epllimnion rich in phytoplankton (chief phytoplankton of the Pluss-See are Oscillatoria agardhii O. redekei van Goor and Aphanizomenon gracile). Very high activities of lake water phosphatases in the extremely stratified lake at the end of the summer stratification, were detected. Further work is in progress.																			0028-0836	1476-4687					1967	216	5122					1345	+		10.1038/2161345a0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/2161345a0													WOS:A1967A411900050

In this study, we investigated the germination of phytoplankton in the laboratory from resting cells in sediments collected during spring from four tributary and littoral zones of Lake Taihu (east, south, west, and north), the season before HABs typically occur. We evaluated the potential for germinated phytoplankton to contribute to HABs. We found that 26 species from three phyla including Cyanobacteria, Bacillariophyta, and Chlorophyta germinated from the sediment during the 15-day incubation experiment. The germinated phytoplankton species from the sediments collected in most areas were moderately or very similar, but dominant species exhibited different temporal and spatial distributions. The densities of germinated cells for different phytoplankton species varied at different times during the incubation period. Cyanobacteria Microcystis spp. (1,511 cells g(-1) wet weight) and Bacillariophyta Melosira sp. (2,865 cells g(-1) wet weight) had the highest cell densities after 10-day incubation, whereas Chlorophyta had the highest cell density (54 cells g(-1) wet weight) after 15-day incubation. There was a high number of Cyanobacteria resting cells that could germinate from the seed bank preserved in the sediments, suggesting potential risks of HABs throughout Lake Taihu.					; Liu, Xin/AAE-9053-2021	Liu, Xin/0000-0002-6660-4486; Zhao, Min/0000-0001-7950-5279; 													1568-9883	1878-1470				FEB	2025	142								102780	10.1016/j.hal.2024.102780	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2024.102780		DEC 2024						39947870					WOS:001377498800001

A unique analysis of 439 active substances and 17 metabolites was carried out on surface waters and one effluent wastewater as the only direct discharge into Lake Balaton from June 2017 until August 2020. Altogether 203 water- and 85 sediment samples were collected and analysed during the 3-year monitoring period. To determine the environmental risks of the detected pesticides to aquatic ecosystems, environmental risk assessment (ERA) was carried out using two approaches (worst- and general-case scenarios). Results Fifty-two pesticides and one insect repellent were detected, of which 26 belonged to herbicides (24 active substances and two metabolites), 15 to fungicides (15 active substances), and 11 to insecticides (eight active substances and three metabolites), of which only nine of the total analysed compounds are listed to be monitored in surface waters with threshold limit values (TLVs). The most frequently detected compounds were terbuthylazine, diethyltoluamide (DEET), desethyl-atrazine, and metolachlor. Glyphosate, aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), and DEET were found with the highest concentrations of 3.0, 2.0, and 1.57 mu g/L, respectively. The pesticide exposures were higher during the summer periods indicating a stable seasonal pattern. According to the performed ERA, the calculated Risk Quotients (RQs) indicated 18 compounds with a high level of risk including nine that had been banned for at least a decade. Discussion This study expands knowledge on the spatiotemporal occurrence of pesticides in inland surface waters and highlights the need to consider widening the number of analysed pesticides beyond the European Water Framework Directive (EWFD). According to our results, additional authority and legislation procedures should come into force for pesticides not indexed in the priority European Union Watch List.					; Kaszab, Edit/ITU-0950-2023; Szabó, István/JND-7921-2023; Toth, Gergo/Q-1133-2019; Hahn, Judit/AGZ-0185-2022	Toth, Gergo/0000-0002-0302-2681; Szabo, Istvan/0000-0002-3954-799X; Farkas, Milan/0000-0002-7807-4750; Kaszab, Edit/0000-0002-5917-0464; Hahn, Judit/0000-0003-1787-5359; Rado, Julia/0000-0003-1093-7094													2190-4707	2190-4715				DEC	2022	34	1							50	10.1186/s12302-022-00630-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12302-022-00630-2													WOS:000809560400001

Changes in gross oxygen production, net oxygen production, and air-water gas exchange during seasonal ice melt in Whycocomagh Bay, a Canadian estuary in the Bras d'Or Lake system	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Sea ice is an important control on gas exchange and primary production in polar regions. We measured net oxygen production (NOP) and gross oxygen production (GOP) using near-continuous measurements of the O-2/Ar gas ratio and discrete measurements of the triple isotopic composition of O-2, during the transition from ice-covered to ice-free conditions, in Whycocomagh Bay, an estuary in the Bras d'Or Lake system in Nova Scotia, Canada. The volumetric gross oxygen production was 5.4(-1.6)(+2.8) mmol O-2 m(-3) d(-1), similar at the beginning and end of the time series, and likely peaked at the end of the ice melt period. Net oxygen production displayed more temporal variability and the system was on average net autotrophic during ice melt and net heterotrophic following the ice melt. We performed the first field-based dual tracer release experiment in ice-covered water to quantify air-water gas exchange. The gas transfer velocity at > 90% ice cover was 6% of the rate for nearly ice-free conditions. Published studies have shown a wide range of results for gas transfer velocity in the presence of ice, and this study indicates that gas transfer through ice is much slower than the rate of gas transfer through open water. The results also indicate that both primary producers and heterotrophs are active in Whycocomagh Bay during spring while it is covered in ice.

Persistence and Microbial Source Tracking of Escherichia coli at a Swimming Beach at Lake of the Ozarks State Park, Missouri	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												The Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) has closed or posted advisories at public beaches at Lake of the Ozarks State Park in Missouri because of Escherichia coli (E.coli) concentration exceedances in recent years. Spatial and temporal patterns of E.coli concentrations, microbial source tracking, novel sampling techniques, and beach-use patterns were studied during the 2012 recreational season to identify possible sources, origins, and occurrence of E.coli contamination at Grand Glaize Beach (GGB). Results indicate an important source of E.coli contamination at GGB was E.coli released into the water column by bathers resuspending avian-contaminated sediments, especially during high-use days early in the recreational season. Escherichia coli concentrations in water, sediment, and resuspended sediment samples all decreased throughout the recreational season likely because of decreasing lake levels resulting in sampling locations receding away from the initial spring shoreline as well as natural decay and physical transport out of the cove. Weekly MDNR beach monitoring, based solely on E.coli concentrations, at GGB during this study inaccurately predicted E.coli exceedances, especially on weekends and holidays. Interestingly, E.coli of human origin were measured at concentrations indicative of raw sewage in runoff from an excavation of a nearby abandoned septic tank that had not been used for nearly two years.					; Burken, Joel/C-2099-2016	Wilson, Jordan/0000-0003-0490-9062; Burken, Joel/0000-0002-7774-5364													1093-474X	1752-1688					2016	52	2					508	522		10.1111/1752-1688.12404	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.12404													WOS:000373808800016

During the early 1990s a decrease in acidic deposition resulted in slight improvement of water quality of the lake. This was followed by recovery of the reproduction of perch starting in 1991. A mark and recapture experiment in spring 1995 indicated a hundred fold increase in the population size of perch in a four year period. A decrease in the abundance of aquatic invertebrates was recorded during 1989-1996. This decrease well coincided with the recovery of the perch population, suggesting that increased predation by fish was responsible for the decrease. The occurrence of goldeneye young also dropped in L. Vaha Valkjarvi since 1993. This was thought to be due to increased food competition with perch.

Chemical variables, chlorophyll a, seston concentration and sediment composition point out Lake Thingvalla as a medium oligotrophic lake, allochthonous inputs being negligible. In the early cycle 2 periods can be distinguished. The spring, when a limited pool of nutrients (calculated to 7 g N m2 per yr) was converted into organic matter, of which 2-3% sedimented per d [day], diminished the nutrient pool and generating N depleted growth. From late August 1979 the nutrient pool was successively reestablished by faster mixing of the lake. This created new growth conditions, and the beginning of a period where pelagic mineralization rather than sedimentation predominated.

J	DeMott, WR; Edington, JR; Tessier, AJ				DeMott, WR; Edington, JR; Tessier, AJ			Testing zooplankton food limitation across gradients of depth and productivity in small stratified lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We examined the significance of vertical structure in lake plankton to grazer-resource coupling by quantifying how the intensity and mechanism of grazer food limitation varies with depth. We used Daphnia growth assays and also sampled resources (chlorophyll, particulate carbon, and phosphorus) and the day/night depth distributions of Daphnia spp. during summer in four depth strata of lakes that differ in trophic state. The growth assays included treatments with natural seston and seston supplemented with phosphate or Synechococcus, an energy- and P-rich cyanobacterium highly deficient in essential fatty acids and sterols. Results from growth assays and measurements of Daphnia P balance indicate strong energy limitation and weak and sporadic P limitation, despite seston C:P ratios in the upper depth strata above the predicted threshold for Daphnia P limitation. Growth improved with depth and was very high with resources collected from a deep layer of sulfur bacteria that was partially protected from grazing by low dissolved oxygen. Strong positive responses to Synechococcus supplements and high growth with resources from the sulfur bacteria layer are both contrary to limitation by essential lipids. The intensity of food limitation was independent of lake trophic state but was influenced by the quality of the deep-water refuge. Across depths and lakes, food limitation was dependent on Daphnia density; strong food limitation was associated with high Daphnia biomass (>100 mug L-1) and Daphnia grazing >20% per day.																			0024-3590					JUL	2004	49	4	2				1408	1416		10.4319/lo.2004.49.4_part_2.1408	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2004.49.4_part_2.1408													WOS:000224979800018
J	Interlandi, SJ; Crockett, CS				Interlandi, SJ; Crockett, CS			Recent water quality trends in the Schuylkill River, Pennsylvania, USA: a preliminary assessment of the relative influences of climate, river discharge and suburban development	WATER RESEARCH												Climate, flow rate and land use are all known drivers of water quality in river systems, but determining the relative influences of these factors remains a significant challenge for aquatic science and management. Long-term data from the Schuylkill River at Philadelphia is assessed here in an attempt to ascertain the separate and combined influence of these major drivers on water quality in a developed watershed. Water quality measures including nutrients, conservative solutes and bacteria all elicited distinct seasonal patterns driven primarily by river discharge. Mass transport rates of sodium and chloride have increased with time, and were elevated in winter., presumably as a function of road salt deposition. A steady increase in developed land area in the watershed has occurred in recent decades, which allowed the use of time as a surrogate parameter for regional development in the construction of multiple factor linear models predicting the relative influences of precipitation, river discharge and developed land area on river water quality. Linear models predicting annually averaged water quality measures showed the effects of precipitation, discharge and developed land area to be of nearly equal importance in regulating levels of conductivity, alkalinity, sodium, and chloride in the river. Models predicting water quality variables for discrete samples demonstrated that river flow was the major determinant of daily variability in alkalinity, conductivity, hardness and calcium levels, while still resolving the highly significant influence of watershed development on water quality. Increases in solute transport in the Schuylkill River in recent decades appear to be the direct result of modern suburban development in the watershed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Pilskaln, CH				Pilskaln, CH			Seasonal and interannual particle export in an African Rift Valley Lake: A 5-yr record from Lake Malawi, southern East Africa	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												A time-sequencing sediment trap was deployed at 300-350 m in Lake Malawi, East Africa, from 1987 to 1992 to measure particulate export to the deep, anoxic hypolimnion in the northern and central lake regions. The monthly settling particulate samples provide a data set of seasonal and interannual export fluxes of organic carbon, biogenic opal, calcium carbonate, and lithogenic material. Maximum total particle fluxes (similar to50-400 mg m(-2) d(-1)) occurred primarily during the dry, windy season (April through October) when algal productivity is high because of wind-induced upwelling of nutrient-enriched metalimnion and hypolimnion waters. Peak-flux particulates contained an abundance of Aulacoseira and Stephanodiscus diatom valves and chains. The total particle mass flux during the wet, austral summer months (November through March) was consistently one to three orders of magnitude less than that measured during the dry months and consisted of mineral shards, terrestrial plant debris, and scattered diatom tests. The 5-yr trap data provide support for the claim that the light-dark lamination couplets, abundant in northern and central lake cores, reflect seasonal delivery to the sediments of diatom-rich particulates during the windy months and diatom-poor material during the wet season. However, interannual and spatial variability in upwelling and productivity patterns, as well as El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-related rainfall and drought cycles, appears to exert a strong influence over the magnitude and geochemical composition of particle export to the deep hypolimnion of Lake Malawi.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	2004	49	4					964	977		10.4319/lo.2004.49.4.0964	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2004.49.4.0964													WOS:000224979700008

Comparison of fossil assemblages with the contemporary distribution of diatoms in the Aral Sea Suggests that considerable changes occurred in water level as well as salinity. Deposits with high diatom concentrations and dominance of the marine species Actinocyclus octonarius EHRENBERG are interpreted as periods of high water level, whereas replacement by Tryblionella compressa (BAILEY) BOYER is considered to indicate lake level fall. On the other hand sediments with low diatom concentration represent higher freshwater input and therefore salinity decrease. This interpretation is supported by estimates of siliciclastic and chemogenic sediment components.

The aim of this paper was to answer three questions regarding the breakdown of leaf litter in calcite depositing environment: (i) Does leaf decomposition hinder calcite deposition and vice versa?; (ii) What role do other environmental factors play?, and (iii) How long does leaf litter persist in these habitats? Leaves of beech (Fagus sylvatica) and butterbur (Petasites hybridus) were exposed for 8 weeks in 8 microhabitats: 2 calcite deposition rates x 2 flow velocities x 2 seasons. A linear model was better at predicting leaf litter persistence but only for the period after the extreme loss of leaf mass occurring during the initial leaching of highly hydrosoluble compounds in the first week (11.6% of beech and 54.2% of butterbur regardless of the studied environmental factors). Higher flow velocity and calcite deposition rates stimulated the breakdown of both leaf species. During summer, breakdown was accelerated for butterbur leaves only. Since breakdown rates of both litter types were faster at high calcite depositing sites, it can be concluded that the breakdown process is not hindered by calcite deposition in general. The amount of deposited calcite per gram of leaf litter increased linearly over time (after the first week of exposure) on both leaf species. More calcite was deposited on the fast-decomposing butterbur leaves than on beech leaves.

We conducted a study on the variations of the stable isotopes of water, and the seasonal variations in water use of Cinnamomum camphora, in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum in a C. camphora woodland in Changsha, central-southern China, which lies within the monsoon region of East Asia. Stable isotopes were monitored in precipitation, soil water (0-130-cm depth), groundwater, twig xylem water of C. camphora, and at the same time relevant environmental variables (soil water content, and meteorological variables) were measured, from March 2017 to August 2019. The monitoring data were collated and analyzed to determine the variations of stable isotopes in different water pools and mutual exchanges. The results indicate that daily precipitation (P) greater than 3.7 mm (regarded as effective precipitation) contributed to soil water replenishment. Isotopic composition of soil water and twig xylem water fell below the LMWLP > 3.7 (the local meteoric water line eliminated rainfall events with P <= 3.7 mm). Isotopic composition of shallow soil water (0-60 cm) and twig xylem water was positively correlated with that of cumulative antecedent precipitation within two months. These patterns of precipitation isotopic signal propagation delineate a clear pathway of water transfer in this soil and plant continuum. The slope of the soil water line in the study area was higher than that of the LMWLP > 3.7 because of the situation that precipitation in warm season with a larger evaporative demand is more depleted with heavy isotopes (i.e., more negative delta values) than that in cold season when the evaporative demand is low. Therefore, it was not feasible to determine the strength of isotopic fractionation based on the isotopic water line method. According to the MixSIR model, C. camphora water uptake mainly sourced from shallow soil water during the observation period. However, in July-September when soil was dry, deep soil water (60-130 cm) contributed to C. camphora water uptake for similar to 50%. These findings improve our understanding of the water cycle of the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum in the East Asian monsoon region.

Simons sp. nov. is described as a new species belonging to the Erythropeltidales/ Compsopogonales, Erythrotrichiaceac. The thallus of E. setifera is a pseudoparenchymatic prostrate system of branched cell rows embedded in a gelatinous matrix. The central thallus cells a-re erect and cylindrical, and one monosporangium is formed at the top of each cell. In young thalli, gelatinous setae (up to 400 mum long) arise from the cell envelope. This alga has been collected in periphyton on aquatic macrophytes in two shallow lakes of The Netherlands. The accompanying periphyton flora was very rich, including 108 taxa, 64 of which were desmids in the Naardermeer lake, and the chaetophoralean alga Trichodiscus elegans (Chlorophyta)-the first record after its discovery in the UK in 1912. Erythrocladia setifera was collected in the summer from nutrient-poor hard water, with salinity up to 1000 mg Cl-1 l(-1).																			0031-8884					SEP	2001	40	5					475	482		10.2216/i0031-8884-40-5-475.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2216/i0031-8884-40-5-475.1													WOS:000172799200010

A salt lake extremophile, Paracoccus bogoriensis sp nov., efficiently produces xanthophyll carotenoids	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY RESEARCH												A Gram-negative obligate alkaliphilic bacterium (BOG6(T)) that secretes carotenoids was isolated from the outflow of Lake Bogoria hot spring located in the Kenyan Rift Valley. The bacterium is motile by means of a polar flagellum, and forms red colonies due to the production of xanthophyll carotenoid pigments. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed this strain to cluster phylogenetically within the genus Paracoccus. Strain BOG6(T) is aerobic, positive for both catalase and oxidase, and non-methylotrophic. The major fatty acid of the isolate is C18: 1 omega 7c. It accumulated polyhydroxybutyrate granules. Strain BOG6(T) gave astaxanthin yield of 0.4 mg/g of wet cells indicating a potential for application in commercial production of carotenoids. On the basis of its genotypic characteristics, fatty acid composition and physiological reaction profiles, it is proposed that the isolate may be assigned to the genus Paracoccus as Paracoccus bogoriensis sp. nov. The type strain is BOG6(T) (=DSM16578 =LMG22798). The GenBank 16S rDNA nucleotide sequence accession number is AJ580352.

Quantification of the changes in SW-GW interaction in spatial and temporal scale causing by the two driving sources could help to the understanding of the regional water cycle mechanism and the adjustment of the decision making. However, it is usually difficult to distinguish the impact of anthropogenic activities from the climatic variation on a regional scale. Here, by using a regional three-dimensional groundwater numerical model with long term monitoring of the hydrological dynamic in Poyang Lake Basin (PLB), China, we found that groundwater storage variation in the bank storage districts can be used as an indicator to quantify each source and sink in the process of SW-GW interactions. And surface water infiltration plays a more dominant role in constructing bank storage which is meant to preserve groundwater storage. Our research in PLB demonstrates that the hydrological change caused by the operation of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) since 2003 is mainly responsible for the autumn drought in PLB. The surface water recession due to the impoundment in TGD from September to October has an impact about 7 times stronger than the rainfall reduction. Moreover, the groundwater storage deficit caused by the insufficient recharge from the surface water infiltration would maintain the whole year, unlike the surface water system which would easily recover at the end of the year. The results demonstrate the chain interactions among lake-river-aquifer. Failing to distinguish the magnitude of each influence factor may lead to underestimating the impact on the whole water system. The results also highlight the function and the vulnerability of the groundwater system which might be vital to the riparian and estuarinewetl and ecosystem.

J	NEWCOMBE, CL; DWYER, PS				NEWCOMBE, CL; DWYER, PS			AN ANALYSIS OF THE VERTICAL DISTRIBUTION OF TEMPERATURE IN A DICHOTHERMIC LAKE OF SOUTHEASTERN MICHIGAN	ECOLOGY												This paper contains an analysis of the vertical water movements in Sodon Lake, s.-e. Michigan. The study is based upon temp. records obtained by C.L. Newcombe and J. V. Slater with a Foxboro resistance thermometer during the period May, 1947, to June, 1948. The procedures used follow those of Dr. G. E. Hutchinson for measuring the coeff. of turbulence and the extent of other mechanisms of temp. change at different levels in the lake. In Sodon L., from a mid-depth of approx. 30 ft., no warming or cooling effect from the atmosphere is directly observable. The stratum in which the value of the rate of change of temp. with time falls exponentially with increasing depth, is restricted to within the thermocline, namely 6-18 ft. Throughout a large part of the thermocline, the coeff. of turbulence is essentially constant, namely [mu]2 = 1.81 sq. m. per month. The effect of density differences induced by surface temps. during seasonal transitions probably penetrates to about the mid-depth, and in this connection wind action is believed to play a secondary role varying in importance with the season. An explanation of changes in the temps. of the deeper layers doubtless lies in certain internal properties of the lake environment.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1949	30	4					443	449		10.2307/1932447	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1932447													WOS:A1949XW60000004

These problems have a serious impact on aquatic ecosystems and drinking water safety and become one of the priorities of the water environment researches and managements. In the present study, genes associated with 2-MIB synthesis in cyanobacteria were studied by systematic investigation on molecular characterization and quantity of 2-MIBproducing cyanobacteria in China. Our results founded that Pseudoanabaena is an important 2-MIB-producing phytoplankton and predominant in summer in Qingcaosha reservoir, and the copy number of mic and 2-MIB concentration have strongly positive correlation. We also demonstrated that abundance of mic in water was significant correlation with that in sediment. These results will help us to understand the main taxa of the odoriferous cyanobacteria in the water bodies in China, understand the genetic basis of the odor substances in the cyanobacteria. Rapid, reliable monitoring and ecological research methods for the production of odor cyanobacteria in water bodies can be established based on these results.

Regression techniques are used to derive annual inputs to the water balance, based on lake rainfall data, measured and derived inflows and estimated evaporation during the historical period. This approach acknowledges that runoff is a nonlinear function of lake rainfall. A longer inflow series is produced here which is representative of the whole inflow to the lake, rather than just from individual tributaries. The results show a good simulation of annual lake levels and outflows and capture the high lake level in 1997-1998. Climate change scenarios, from a recent global climate model experiment, are applied to the lake rainfall inflow series and evaporation data to estimate future water balances of the lake. The scenarios produce a potential fall in lake levels by the 2030s horizon, and a rise by the 2080s horizon. A discussion of the application of climate change data to this complex hydrological system is presented.

Field observations revealed that the presence of the polynya causes a substantial reduction in average lake temperature when compared with a nearby lake left in its natural state. We extended a numerical model of the heat budget of a small ice-covered lake to incorporate the effects of the artificial circulation device. The model showed that during the cooling period the average heat lost from turbulent heat transfer between water and ice was three times that lost across the polynya surface. Lake temperature, polynya size, and snow depth were well represented by the model; however, there were discrepancies between early winter ice thickness predictions and observations.

These effects can enhance seasonally changing lake redox conditions that may concentrate potentially toxic elements. Here we report the results of a multi-method geochemical and sediment microfabric analysis applied to reconstruct the history of cultural eutrophication and pollution of the North and South Basins of Windermere, UK. Eutrophication developed from the mid-19th to the earliest 20th centuries. Enhanced lake productivity is indicated by increased sedimentary delta C-13, and increased pollution by a higher concentration of metals (Pb, Hg, and As) in the sediment, likely enhanced by incorporation and adsorption to settling diatom aggregates, preserved as sedimentary laminae. In the South Basin, increasing sediment delta N-15 values occur in step with Zn, Hg, and Cu, linking metal enrichment to isotopically heavy nitrate (N) from anthropogenic sources. From around 1930, decreases in Mn and Fe-rich laminae indicate reduced deep-water ventilation, whereas periods of sediment anoxia increased, being most severe in the deeper North Basin. Strongly reducing sediment conditions promoted Fe and Mn reduction and Pb-bearing barite formation, hitherto only described from toxic minewastes and contaminated soils. From 1980 there was an increase in indicators of bottomwater oxygenation, although not to before 1930. But in the South Basin, the continued impacts of sewage are indicated by elevated sediment delta N-15. Imaging and X-ray microanalysis using scanning electron microscopy has shown seasonal-scale redoxmineralisation of Mn, Fe, and Ba related to intermittent sediment anoxia. Elevated concentrations of these metals and As also occur in the surficial sediment and provide evidence for dynamic redox mobilisation of potentially toxic elements to the lake water. Concentrations of As (up to 80 ppm), exceed international Sediment Quality Standards. This process may become more prevalent in the future with climate change driving lengthened summer stratification.

Long-term assessment of ichthyoplankton in a large North American river system reveals changes in fish community dynamics	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Larval fishes are sensitive to abiotic conditions and provide a direct measure of spawning success. The St. Clair - Detroit River System, a Laurentian Great Lakes connecting channel with a history of environmental degradation, has undergone improvements in habitat and water quality since the 1970s. We compared 2006-2015 ichthyoplankton community data with those collected prior to remediation efforts (1977-1978) to identify patterns in spatial and temporal variability. Both assemblages exhibited a predictable phenology, with taxa from the subfamily Coregoninae dominant in early spring followed by families Osmeridae, Percidae, and Moronidae (May-June) and Cyprinidae and Clupeidae (June-August). While higher densities of larval fish were found in the Detroit River, greater taxa richness and Shannon diversity were observed in the St. Clair River. System wide, 14 new taxa were observed in the 2000s study period. In addition, relative densities of two nonnative species, alewife (Alosa pseutiohurengus) and rainbow smelt (Osmerus ntordux), declined since the 1970s. Increased larval fish richness and decreased densities of nonnative taxa in the 2000s are consistent with improvements to environmental conditions.					; Bennion, David/NQF-9490-2025	Tucker-Silva, Taaja/0000-0003-1534-4677; Roseman, Edward/0000-0002-5315-9838; DeBruyne, Robin L./0000-0002-9232-7937													0706-652X	1205-7533				DEC	2018	75	12					2255	2270		10.1139/cjfas-2017-0511	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2017-0511													WOS:000449791000014

Conservation of Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus) in North America: science, successes, and challenges	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												There are only about 8000 Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus Ord, 1834) in existence. Because they depend on environments that are under intense human pressures and controls in both their breeding and wintering grounds, these birds and their habitats are highly managed in many areas across their range. Efforts to recover this endangered and threatened species have engaged thousands of people from Newfoundland to the Caribbean, and have provoked a ground-swell of public support and, at times, fury, as well as a considerable body of research. Although populations have increased substantially in the U. S. Atlantic and U. S. Great Lakes, this is not true of all regions. Significant issues still exist with respect to the efficacy of predator management; need for more accurate model input information; effects of climate, pollutants, and water management; habitat loss and degradation from recreation and development; and whether the cost and effort of management for this species can be maintained or increased where needed.

Although two of the studied basins are meromictic and one is holomictic, chemical properties of the water are almost identical. Therefore, differences in both the spatial and temporal distribution, as well as in the composition of phototrophic bacterial communities, dominated by Chlorobium phaeobacteroides and Chromatium minus, are discussed on the basis of the structural and morphometric characteristics of each basin. Both species showed the same physiological adaptations to light intensity changes by modifying the carotenoid/bacteriochlorophyll ratio. Light reaching the oxic-anoxic boundary appears to be the most important factor controlling the growth of phototrophic bacteria in Lake Banyoles. The oxic-anoxic boundary becomes shallower as summer advances, until enough light is available for bacterial photosynthesis.																			0018-8158					OCT 2	1992	243						87	94		10.1007/BF00007023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007023													WOS:A1992JZ96300009

Dynamics of inorganic components in lake waters from Terra Nova Bay, Antarctica	CHEMOSPHERE												Water and Suspended Particulate Material (SPM) samples analysed in this work were collected in the austral summer 2011/12 from six shallow Antarctic lakes (Carezza, Edmonson Point 14 and 15a, Gondwana, Inexpressible Island 10b and Tarn Flat 20) of Terra Nova Bay (Northern Victoria Land, Antarctica). The total concentrations of a large suite of inorganic analytes were determined, in order to gain insight into the natural processes regulating species distribution, define natural background values and detect possible present or future local and/or global anthropogenic contamination. Lake water composition was found to be influenced by marine spray, lake geographical position and meltwater input. Seasonal variability was also evaluated for each analyte, and explained considering the natural transport processes involving each species. Multivariate chemometric techniques were used in order to identify groups of samples with similar characteristics and find out similarities and correlations among variables. The variability observed within the water samples is closely connected to the marine aerosol input; hence, it is primarily a consequence of geographical and meteorological factors, such as distance from the ocean and period of year. Higher element concentrations have been found in SPM than in water, suggesting that weathering plays an important role on the chemistry of these lakes or that adsorption processes take place. SPM samples were also examined with a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), and many diatoms belonging to different species were detected. No clear evidence of a relevant metal contamination was found in the investigated area. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We observed fish-eagle foraging behavior at nine lakes in western Madagascar from May to August 1996. We sampled the fish population at each lake using gill nets and recorded fish weights and species. Introduced tilapia, Oreochromis spp. and Tilapia spp., made up the majority of both the gill net (66.3%) and fish-eagle catch (64.7%) in similar proportion, suggesting that the fish-eagle is an opportunistic predator. Consequently, replacement of native fish species by exotics probably has not been detrimental to the island's fish-eagle population. Male fish-eagle foraging success was positively correlated (P < 0.001) with number of fish species, suggesting that fish species diversity may affect fish-eagle foraging effectiveness.

The comparison reveals: 11.5-5.5 ka BP, the water level of rivers and lakes in the middle Yangtze River appeared a rising trend, concurrently, under the development of Neolithic culture and rice agricultural activities, human occupation extended from piedmont plain to inner basin plain in the study area. The water level fell in 5.5-4.0 ka BP, meanwhile, the number of human settlements of Qujialing-Shijiahe culture rapidly increased, especially in the inner basin plain. The water level rose again around 4.0 ka B P, floods spread massively in this period, which led to the decline of Shijiahe culture. The main causes for hydro-environmental evolution in the study area are the fluctuation of sea level and the aggradation of fluvio-lacustrine sediments.																			1009-637X	1861-9568				MAR	2020	30	3					423	438		10.1007/s11442-020-1735-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11442-020-1735-6													WOS:000519447900004

Storage and release of road-salt contamination from a calcareous lake-basin fen, western Massachusetts, USA	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Road salt (NaCl) applications to highways have increased stream sodium and chloride concentrations due to retention within watersheds. The mechanisms for retention and export of Na+ and Cl- from different environments are not fully understood. This field study examines the hydrologic and cation exchange processes that store and release Na+ and Cl- from a calcareous fen adjacent to a highway. Despite high concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+, elevated salt concentrations enable Na+ to occupy up to 15% of the cation exchange capacity of shallow peat. Calculations of selectivity coefficients show that Na+ preferentially exchanges with Mg2+, and Na+ can be desorbed under more dilute conditions caused by precipitation and snowmelt. Detailed sampling of surface and ground waters during three snowmelt events illustrate early releases of Na+ and Cl-at the onset of melting, with maximum fluxes coinciding with peak discharge. From 7 March through 4 April 2005, the flux of dissolved salt exiting the wetland amounts to 13% (Na) and 17% (Cl) of annual rock salt applied to the highway. For all of 2005, the total salt mass leaving the wetland via Kampoosa Brook is similar to the amount of road salt applied; 50% of the annual salt efflux occurred during the snowmelt season of March through May. In general, exported Na+ and Cl- correlate with the number of lane miles of highway crossing the watershed. Large rain events outside of winter months are more effective than snowmelt with reducing dissolved salts because snowmelt also introduces contamination.

J	Fasola, L; Roesler, I				Fasola, Laura; Roesler, Ignacio			Invasive predator control program in Austral Patagonia for endangered bird conservation	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH												In 2011, the invasive American mink Neovison vison became the most acute threat to the globally critically endangered Hooded Grebe Podiceps gallardoi (global population < 800 individuals) when mink killed over 4 % of their global population. The Hooded Grebe is endemic to the Argentinean Austral Patagonia. In 2014, we established a control program in the Buenos Aires Lake Plateau area; the first attempt to systematically control mink in Patagonia. Our aim was to preserve the Hooded Grebes throughout the reproductive season by eradicating mink from the highland lakes and the rivers that mink use as corridors. We used a combination of methods (live trapping, lethal trapping and hunting) to maximize mink removal during the short climate window that permits work in the area. Control effort in the summer seasons of 2014 and 2015 involved 47-91 traps working for 128-137 days and we also hunted for mink along 186 km of river. No mink predation on grebes has been observed since the beginning of the control program and 71 mink were removed from the area. Percentage of sites occupied by mink decreased after the first control season (occupancy estimation decreased ca. 50 %). However, there was also a decline in the number of mink trapped, indicating that mink removal was more difficult in the second control season. We show that mink culling can be established successfully in an area with challenging logistics, avoiding negative impacts on non-target native species and providing positive outcomes for a species of global conservation importance.

Controls on Arctic glacier-fed river water temperature	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES												The impact of climate change on Arctic rivers is expected to be severe. There is therefore a need for greater understanding of Arctic river temperature processes. This study quantifies the spatio-temporal variability of water temperatures in the Karsa River, Sweden. Water temperature was monitored over two summers within the main proglacial channel and within braids fed by different sources. Longitudinal and lateral temperature patterns were assessed in relation to prevailing hydro-meteorology. Temperature metrics in the main channel increased with distance downstream but were moderated by a large lake, while temperatures in the braids were dependent upon channel source. The high temperature standard deviation and inter-site differences within the braids highlight the importance of braided channels for creating thermal habitat heterogeneity. Temperatures were dependent on hydro-meteorological conditions, with sensitivity to air temperature maximized during cooler, rainy conditions. These results shed new light on Arctic river temperature patterns and their controlling processes.

This study applies Andreyanov method for computation of runoff data and Mann-Kendall statistic method for assessing statistically significant or weak trends. The study reveals that the pattern of temperature for period of 1960-2020 and runoff for period of 1930-2019 has changed in the region. Mann-Kendall test result indicates a statistically significant increase in temperature at all meteorological stations (p < 0.01), while the fluctuations in precipitation trends are not meaningful (p > 0.05). Andreyanov method shows significant changes in intra-annual runoff trends, e.g., calculations for the period of 1965-2019 show a decrease of 5.3% in summer runoff in the Sarykan river, and the increase in runoff in the remaining months was 6.4% higher compared to the period of 1930-1965. Furthermore, the Mann-Kendall test confirms a significant positive trend in the change of seasonal runoff for the Sarykan, Byzhy, and Koktal rivers (p < 0.02). The precipitation is one of the main factors influencing river runoff and the correlation coefficient between river runoff and precipitation for Lepsy river is r = 0.81; for Byzhy river is r = 0.70; for Koktal river is r = 0.62; for Sarykan river is r = 0.60.					; Issaldayeva, Sabira/LOR-1401-2024; Alimkulov, Sayat/AGU-7764-2022; Raimbekova, Zhanar/AAY-8667-2021	Raimbekova, Zhanar/0000-0003-4377-0948; Alimkulov, Sayat/0000-0003-3236-2084; Issaldayeva, Sabira/0000-0002-6309-9920; 														2405-8440				JUL	2023	9	7							e17897	10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e17897	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e17897		JUL 2023						37456043					WOS:001039955100001
J	MACEINA, MJ; MURPHY, BR				MACEINA, MJ; MURPHY, BR			VARIATION IN THE WEIGHT-TO-LENGTH RELATIONSHIP AMONG FLORIDA AND NORTHERN LARGEMOUTH BASS AND THEIR INTRASPECIFIC F1-HYBRID	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Weight-length regression equations and relative weights (Wr, the ratio of measured weights to standard weights at length) were compared among 1,401 electrophoretically assayed Florida largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides floridanus, northern largemouth bass M. s. salmoides, and their first-generation (F1), intraspecific hybrid in Aquilla Lake, Texas [USA]. Small Florida largemouth bass (101-300 mm total length, TL) displayed lower Wr values than small northern largemouth bass. Differences in Wr were not apparent between 301 and 500 mm TL. Significant subspecific differences in the weight-length slope and intercept coefficients were consonant with observed variation in Wr values. Among four year classes, seasonal differences in subspecific Wr consistently varied five to nine units for fish of age 1 and younger. Relative weight values for small F1 hybrids (101-200 mm TL) were intermediate between those of the two subspecies; they were similar to those of northern largemouth bass but higher than values for the Florida subspecies at 201-300 mm TL. There was no evidence that lower winter temperatures in Aquilla Lake compared to those measured in Florida caused a decline in Florida largemouth bass condition. At smaller sizes, subspecific discrepancies in the weight-length relationship appeared to be genetically inherent. If condition indices are used to evaluate phenotypic performance in largemouth bass populations stocked with the alternative subspecies, these differences should be considered.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				MAY	1988	117	3					232	237		10.1577/1548-8659(1988)117<0232:VITWRA>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1988)117<0232:VITWRA>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1988T439400002
J	Shevnina, E; Kourzeneva, E				Shevnina, Elena; Kourzeneva, Ekaterina			Thermal regime and components of water balance of lakes in Antarctica at the Fildes peninsula and the Larsemann Hills	TELLUS SERIES A-DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Thermal regime and water balance components of 12 lakes located at two different parts of the Antarctic (the Fildes peninsula in the Maritime Antarctic and the Larsemann Hills in the continental Antarctica) were studied using the observations from three field campaigns in 2012-2014. The morphometric characteristics of the studied lakes were updated with GPS/echo-sounding surveys, and changes in the length, width and volume of the lakes were revealed in comparison with the previous surveys. The thermal regime of the lakes was also studied by modelling, applying the lake model FLake, which is widely used in different environmental applications but was tested for the first time in the Antarctic conditions. In contrast to boreal lakes, for lakes in Antarctica the modelling results by FLake appeared to be sensitive to the light extinction coefficient. According to simulations, all lakes were mixed down to the bottom for the whole summer; however, the reasons for this are different for shallow and deep lakes. The sensitivity of different methods to calculate evaporation, by the Dalton-type empirical equation and by the atmospheric surface layer block of FLake, was studied. For endorheic lakes, the sensitivity appeared to be large, up to 47% of the total seasonal water volume change, which assumes that FLake has the potential to be used in hydrological applications to calculate evaporation. Seasonal variations of the volume of the lakes in the continental Antarctica are larger than in the Maritime Antarctic. Usually, small and medium-sized lakes accumulate or redistribute water during the warm season. However, the systems of big lakes also release the stored water through the mechanism of abrupt jumps, which simultaneously cause the inflow into the sea of huge amounts of fresh water during short time intervals.

U/Th dating of river tufa dams indicates that wet conditions prevailed in the highlands as early as 15,000 BP. This is 4 to 5000 years before the first signs of post-last glacial maximum (LGM) humid conditions deduced from former lake extensions in the Ethiopian and Kenyan rift. Tufa build-up and the corresponding wet conditions in the highlands gradually came to an end from 5000 BP onwards. In the study area, environmental deterioration started around 3000 BP and is explained as a result of forest recession. Evidence is presented, showing that forest retreat and land degradation in the area is not climate-driven but the result of human activities. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, new mineral chemical data are reported for the Chelyabinsk LL5 ordinary chondrite fall for comparison with existing chondrite data and to investigate element sequestration into metal and mineral phases within some chondrites. The focus of the study is to link the variations observed in the HSE abundances and Re-Os isotopes with other isotopic and elemental data to explore the relative roles of sample sizes, terrestrial alteration and parent body processes more fully on chondrite meteorite compositions. Trace element variations in Chelyabinsk silicate, oxide and metal grains highlight the importance of geochemical heterogeneity imparted by mineralogical variations and mode effects, as well as sample size. Using a range of sample powder aliquot sizes, it is possible to show that this becomes significant for the HSE at <0.1 g. Variations in high field strength elements relative abundances (HFSE: Ti, Zr, Nb, Ta, Hf) are also identified within individual aliquots of carbonaceous chondrite Ivuna, emphasizing the importance of complete dissolution of refractory phases. The range of fall and find meteorites examined here demonstrates that terrestrial alteration effects revealed for trace elements (e.g., Ba, U, Sr) do not correlate particularly well with Re/Os variations. Instead, the Re/Os ratios of carbonaceous chondrites are susceptible to disturbance, more so than indicated by incompatible trace element systematics, with the Murchison CM2 carbonaceous chondrite showing significant Re/Os fractionation between sample aliquots. For sample aliquots measured that do not show significant mode or terrestrial alteration effects, parent body processes appear to be largely restricted to thermal metamorphism and dehydration. Including data for this study, the combined published dataset for Re-Os isotope and HSE abundances now extends to 33 ordinary, 39 carbonaceous, 27 enstatite and 6 Rumuruti chondrites. The range in absolute HSE abundances among these meteorite groups is-30%, with all chondrites having, within uncertainties, the same average Os, Ir, Ru, Pt and Pd abundances. Notably, carbonaceous chondrites have long-term Re/Os 8% lower than for the other chondrite groups. If chondrite groups are representative of early planetary feedstocks, then the measured Os-187/Os-188 of ordinary chondrites make them a close match to the composition of the bulk silicate Earth. Assuming-0.5% late accretion of ordinary chondrites to Earth, this would result in a long-term Rb/Sr ratio-0.6% higher than from late accretion of carbonaceous chondrites, indicating that ordinary chondrites are a potentially attractive source for moderately volatile enrichment.

J	Yamanaka, H; Minamoto, T				Yamanaka, Hiroki; Minamoto, Toshifumi			The use of environmental DNA of fishes as an efficient method of determining habitat connectivity	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												This study demonstrated the use of environmental DNA (eDNA) to determine habitat connectivity for migration of fishes between the sea and river. Environmental DNA is DNA fragments released by fishes in water, which can be used as a species-specific marker of the presence/absence of the target species. A year-round water sampling regime at 15 sites on the Yodo River, Japan, was conducted to determine whether three major man-made barriers on the river inhibited the migration of fishes using species-specific detection of DNA fragments from three target migrant species, temperate seabass, Lateolabrax japonicas, flathead grey mullet, Mugil cephalus, and ayu, Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis. The presence/absence of eDNA from target species was consistent with known patterns of species' seasonal migration. The detection of the DNA of temperate seabass and flathead grey mullet at sites upstream of the dam closest to the river mouth indicated successful upstream migration of these species via a fish ladder bypassing the dam. On the other hand, DNA of these two species was not detected from the upstream side of the two remaining dams, which are not equipped with fish ladders. Ayu is the only species among the three target species with a land-locked population in Lake Biwa located at the headwater of Yodo River. Ayu DNA was detected at most of the sites in the freshwater area during the warm months; however, in the coldest month of February, eDNA was only detected in the uppermost site of Yodo River at the southern tip of Lake Biwa. The eDNA we detected at this site suggests that it was derived from juvenile ayu spending their winter months in the lake. These results suggest that the eDNA analysis presented here can accurately track the seasonal migration of fishes in a river, demonstrating its application as an indicator of habitat connectivity for fishes in association with man-made barriers in a river. The sampling of eDNA involves merely scooping a tank full of water; therefore, it is a simple, rapid, and cost-effective method for long-term monitoring of habitat connectivity associated with the construction of barriers in a river.

Factor analysis (FA) is a powerful multivariate statistical technique widely used to evaluate environmental pollution. Seydisuyu Stream Basin is located in the Central Anatolia Region of Turkey and it is one of the most important branches of the Sakarya River. There is a globally important boron mine on the basin and the system is exposed to intensive agricultural, domestic, and industrial pollution. The aim of this study is to evaluate the sediment quality of Seydisuyu Stream Basin using FA. For this purpose, some micro and macro element accumulations including Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, B, Pb, Fe, K, Mn, and Mg in sediment were investigated by collected samples on the basin from 15 stations (including 3 from Catoren Dam Lake and 2 from the Kunduzlar Dam Lake) in summer 2012. According to FA results, three factors explained 90.95% of the total variance. The first factor (F1), the "urban-industrial factor," explained 47% of total variance; the second factor (F2), the "agricultural factor," explained 28.31% of total variance; and the third factor (F3), named the "geological-mining factor," explained 15.63% of total variance.

The functional extinction of Andean megafauna	ECOLOGY												Controversy exists over the cause and timing of the extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna. In the tropical Andes, deglaciation and associated rapid climate change began similar to 8,000years before human arrival, providing an opportunity to separate the effects of climate change from human hunting on megafaunal extinction. We present a paleoecological record spanning the last 25,000years from Lake Pacucha, Peru (3,100m elevation). Fossil pollen, charcoal, diatoms, and the dung fungus Sporormiella, chronicle a two-stage megaherbivore population collapse. Sporormiella abundance, the proxy for megafaunal presence, fell sharply at similar to 21,000years ago, but rebounded prior to a permanent decline between similar to 16,800 and 15,800years ago. This two-stage decline in megaherbivores resulted in a functional extinction by similar to 15,800years ago, 3,000years earlier than known human occupation of the high Andes. Decliningmegaherbivore populations coincided with warm, wet intervals. Climatic instability and megafaunal population collapse triggered an ecological cascade that resulted in novel floral assemblages, and increases in woody species, fire frequency, and plant species that were sensitive to trampling. Our data revealed that Andean megafaunal populations collapsed due to positive feedbacks between habitat quality and climate change rather than human activity.

Long-term dynamics of dissolved oxygen and isotopic composition in Lake Erie and Lake Ontario: Implications for eutrophication and ecosystem health	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												This study, focusing on Great Lakes Erie and Ontario, Canada, explores dissolved oxygen (DO) dynamics and its stable isotopic composition (618ODO) in the Great Lakes. Using historical dissolved oxygen data from 1965 to 2021, combined with synoptic isotopic data collected in the early 2000s, the research examined the spatiotemporal trends in DO and 618O-DO to assess the effects of biotic and abiotic processes such as photosynthesis, respiration, and atmospheric gas exchange. The study revealed significant seasonal and depth-related variations in DO levels, with hypolimnetic hypoxia and metalimnetic oxygen minima (MOM) observed in both lakes. With its comparatively shallow depth and higher nutrient loads, Lake Erie exhibited more pronounced dissolved oxygen fluctuations, with DO levels reaching as low as 3.65 mg L- 1 and 6 18 O DO values falling below +24.6 %o. These findings indicated Lake Erie's more dynamic metabolic environment, particularly during the thermally stratified season. In contrast, Lake Ontario showed more stable oxygen concentration levels, with occasional dissolved oxygen depletions down to 6.80 mg L- 1 and 6 18 O DO values up to +32.1 %o, suggesting more localised influences of external inputs and biological processes. This study provides a long-term perspective on dissolved oxygen status in these lakes and offers essential insights into their ecological health. This work contributes valuable data for managing and protecting the Great Lakes ecosystem.					Wassenaar, Leonard/B-5996-2013; Barth, Johannes/C-6723-2013; A.C. Barth, Johannes/C-6723-2013	A.C.

J	Bell, VA; George, DG; Moore, RJ; Parker, J				Bell, VA; George, DG; Moore, RJ; Parker, J			Using a 1-D mixing model to simulate the vertical flux of heat and oxygen in a lake subject to episodic mixing	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												A one-dimensional, two-layer lake model is used to simulate the daily temperature and oxygen profile of an English Lake in response to changes in wind, air temperature and radiation. The thermal model component derives from the TEMIX lake model originally developed by the Institute of Limnology in St. Petersburg [Mironov, D.V, Golosov, S.D., Zilitinkevitch, S.S., Kreiman, K.D., Terzhevik, A.Y, 1991. Seasonal changes of temperature and mixing conditions in a lake. In: Zilitinkevitch, S.S. (Ed.), Modelling Air-Lake Interactions. Springer-Verlag, pp. 74-90]. This paper describes the model's adaptation and its extension to incorporate dissolved oxygen to simulate periods of anoxia of short duration during summer stratification. The new oxygen model component, which is based on mass-balance principles, divides the lake into two layers in a similar way to the thermal model. Its primary purpose is to model periods of anoxia for use in studies of fish survival. The model has been tested over a 10-year period from 1991 to 1999 using daily weather data and fortnightly observations of chlorophyll a and secchi depth. Ten years of fortnightly oxygen measurements, together with 2 years of more detailed (hourly) oxygen data, indicate that simulated and observed oxygen levels are in reasonable agreement considering the sparseness of the chlorophyll observations. The balance between the relative effects of temperature and BOD on oxygen depletion is of particular importance to model accuracy. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Mussa, KR; Mjemah, IC				Mussa, Kassim Ramadhani; Mjemah, Ibrahimu Chikira			Using hydrogeochemical facies and signatures for groundwater characterization and evolution assessment in aquifers with contrasting climate and geology in Tanzania	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												This study aimed at characterizing groundwater evolution using hydrogeochemical facies and signatures in two basins with contrasting climate and geology, one in the central part and the other in the eastern coast of Tanzania. The Kimbiji (humid, unconsolidated) aquifer is covered by an unconfined layer in the upper parts and a confined layer in the lower parts, with strong artesian flow characteristics while groundwater in the Singida (semi-arid, consolidated) aquifer occurs in weathered shallow layers and in fractures of basement rocks. Fieldwork involved water sampling from precipitation, deep and shallow boreholes, springs and surface water from rivers and lakes in the two study areas. These were specifically conducted for hydrogeochemical analyses to unravel hydrogeochemical facies and signatures in the two aquifers. Physico-chemical water quality parameters [i.e., pH, electrical conductivity (EC) and total dissolved solids (TDS)] were measured in situ using HANNA HI 9829 Multiparameter Analyzer. Standard procedures for water sampling, preservation, transportation, and chemical analyses of major ions were conducted as documented in previous studies. Samples were carried and stored at 4 degrees C prior to their shipping and analyses at Water analysis and testing in environmental regions (WATER) laboratory in Iringa, Tanzania. The mechanism controlling groundwater geochemistry were revealed by assessing the reactions between groundwater and aquifer minerals. Chloro-Alkaline indices (CAIs) were used to study cation exchange processes between the groundwater and its host environment at stagnancy and/or during groundwater travel. The Gibbs ratio 1 values were found to range from 0.26 to 0.94 and Gibbs ratio 2 values ranged from 0.11 to 0.95. The majority of the samples irrespective of the contrast in climate and geology were observed to fall in the rock-water interaction zone. This is attributed to chemical weathering processes where the dissolution of rock forming minerals takes place. Some samples exhibited replacement of Na+ by Ca+ or Mg+ (S18), loss of Na+ through precipitation of evaporate rocks (S11, S13, S16, S19), and water flowing through crystalline rocks (S1, S2, S4, S6, S8, S10, S12, S13, S14, S21). The ratio Na+: Ca+> 1.0 (S1, S4, S8, S10, S12, S14, S17, S18, S19, S21) explains base ion exchange while the ratio < 1 implies a reverse ion exchange (S2, S6, S11, S13, S16).The Ca+: SO42- + HCO(3)(-)ratio < 1.0 connotes groundwater flowing through a normal hydrological cycle (S1, S4, S8, S10, S12, S14, S17, S18, S2, S6, S11, S13, S21) and a ratio greater than 1 is an indication of Ca2+-Cl- brines (S16, S19). The HCO3-: Cl- hydrogeochemical signatures divided the Singida aquifer into upper water flow course, where groundwater recharge occurs (S52, S54, S56, S57, and S58) and the discharge zone, (S53, S59, S60, S61) which is a lower groundwater flow course. Interestingly, the Mg2+ + Ca2+: Na+ + K+ ratios as well confirmed that the Singida aquifer is a lower groundwater flow course (discharge zone). The greater than 1 Na+: Ca2+ ratios confirm the dominance of base ion exchange in the Singida aquifer as it has been explained by the CAIs and the Piper diagram. The Gibbs diagrams revealed that the hydrochemistry of groundwater in the Kimbiji and Singida aquifers are mainly in the rock weathering region, affirming that there is high dissolution with rock forming minerals. This is thus one of the main controls of groundwater mineralization in the two study areas. The similarity of hydrogeochemical signatures between a distant surface water body, Lake Inkhanoda and Mwankoko borehole in the Singida aquifer is an indication that there is a discernible interaction between groundwater and surface water, further revealing that the Singida aquifer is fed by sub-regional and regional groundwater flow systems.

J	Alfreider, A; Tartarotti, B				Alfreider, Albin; Tartarotti, Barbara			Spatiotemporal dynamics of different CO2 fixation strategies used by prokaryotes in a dimictic lake	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle and the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate (HP/HB) cycle are two inorganic carbon assimilation pathways widely used by prokaryotic autotrophs in lakes. We investigated the effect of mixing periods and stable water stratification patterns on the trajectories of both CO2 fixation strategies in a dimictic lake (Piburger See), because information on the spatiotemporal dynamics of prokaryotes using these pathways in freshwater ecosystems is far from complete. Based on a quantitative approach (droplet digital PCR) of genes coding for key enzymes in different CO2 assimilation pathways, nine depths covering the entire water column were investigated on a monthly basis for one year. Our data show that the abundance of photoautotrophs and obligate chemolithoautotrophs preferentially using form IA RubisCO was determined by seasonal variations. Highest numbers were observed in summer, while a strong decline of prokrayotes using RubisCO form IA was measured between December and May, the period where the lake was mostly covered by ice. The spatiotemporal distribution patterns of genes coding for RubisCO form IC genes, an enzyme usually used by facultative autotrophs for CO2 assimilation, were less pronounced. Bacteria harboring RubisCO form II were dominating the oxygen limited hypolimnion, while nitrifying Thaumarchaeota using the HP/HB cycle were of minor importance in the lake. Our data reveal that the seasonal heterogeneity, which is determined by the dimictic thermal regime of the lake, results in pronounced spatiotemporal changes of different CO2 assimilation pathways with depth-dependent environmental parameters as key factors for their distribution.

J	Lepori, F; Roberts, JJ				Lepori, Fabio; Roberts, James J.			Past and future warming of a deep European lake (Lake Lugano): What are the climatic drivers?	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We used four decades (1972-2013) of temperature data from Lake Lugano, Switzerland and Italy, to address the hypotheses that: [i] the lake has been warming; [ii] part of the warming reflects global trends and is independent from climatic oscillations and [iii] the lake will continue to warm until the end of the 21st century. During the time spanned by our data, the surface waters of the lake (0-5 m) warmed at rates of 0.2-0.9 degrees C per decade, depending on season. The temperature of the deep waters (50-m bottom) displayed a rising trend in a meromictic basin of the lake and a sawtooth pattern in the other basin, which is holomictic. Long-term variation in surface-water temperature correlated to global warming and multidecadal variation in two climatic oscillations, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and the East Atlantic Pattern (EA). However, we did not detect an influence of the EA on the lake's temperature (as separate from the effect of global warming). Moreover, the effect of the AMO, estimated to a maximum of + 1 degrees C, was not sufficient to explain the observed temperature increase (+ 2-3 degrees C in summer). Based on regional climate projections, we predicted that the lake will continue to warm at least until the end of the 21st century. Our results strongly suggest that the warming of Lake Lugano is tied to global climate change. To sustain current ecosystem conditions in Lake Lugano, we suggest that management plans that curtail eutrophication and (or) mitigation of global warming be pursued.

The six images all are same season's data, the span of time fall short of one month, so we can ignore error due to seasonal aspect. After the NDVI was calculated, the land cover was divided into five types based on the light of NDVI's value: the water area, the bare land, the sparse vegetation area, the moderate vegetation area and the thick vegetation area. Counting the areas of each grade vegetation zone, and meanwhile combining the information of hydrological observation with through the comparison of the different grade vegetation area and lake area change before and after water division, the restoring effect of the vegetation in the downstream of Heihe can be found out, and this can supply the scientific foundation for the Heihe water-division plan of the next step. The monitoring results show that lake area shrink rapidly and the ecological environment of the downstream of Heihe kept deteriorating before 2002, but after eleven year water division from upper and middle reaches of Heihe river, lake area extension compare quickly, the increment of the sluice is also very obvious, the environment deteriorating was alleviated and vegetation was restoring stage by stage.

During the 1991-1992 austral summer, a joint Russian/American research effort was directed at studies of ice-covered lakes in the Bunger Hills Oasis, Antarctica (66 degrees S, 100 degrees E). The primary objective of the expedition was to investigate this ice-free area for features analogous to ancient martian environments that may have been capable of supporting life and to compare the ice-covered lakes of the Bunger Hills with those in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of southern Victoria Land (77 degrees S, 166 degrees E) as part of the continuing studies of Antarctic-Mars analogs.

Richard			Into the Holocene, anatomy of the Younger Dryas cold reversal and preboreal oscillation	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												During the most recent deglaciation, the upwards trend of warmer Northern Hemisphere (NH) temperatures was punctuated by a rapid and intense return to glacial conditions: the Younger Dryas (YD). The end of this event marks the beginning of the Holocene. Using the University of Toronto version of CCSM4, a model of the climate prior to the YD was created with correct boundary conditions. Various amounts of freshwater forcing were then applied to the Beaufort Gyre for forcing intervals ranging from 1 to 125 years. In several cases, this was sufficient to collapse the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and cause significant cooling over the NH. Crucially, after the forcing was ceased, the AMOC stayed in an off state for approximately a millennium before mounting a rapid recover to pre-YD levels. This recovery, which permanently reduced the extent of NH sea ice, occurred through the mechanism of a Polynya opening in the Irminger Sea during winter and led to a pronounced "overshoot" of the AMOC, during which NH temperatures were higher than before the YD.

This was apparently because microbial processes kept the pH at 6.0 or above, a few millimeters below the sediment surface even after lake water had been acidified for 8 yr. In laboratory studies where the pH of mixed, fresh lake sediment was controlled at reduced levels, decomposition rates of C that had been in the sediments for several months were unaffected at pH values as low as 4.0. Decomposition rates of newly sedimented material began to decrease at pH 5.25-5.0. Decomposition processes were less affected during the acidification of Lake 223 than were higher life forms.

J	Dworkin, SI				Dworkin, SI			The hydrogeochemistry of the Lake Waco drainage basin, Texas	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY												The origin of surface water chemistry in highly impacted drainage basins must be investigated on a drainage-basin scale if the causes of the pollution are to be elucidated. This study characterizes and deciphers the surface water chemistry of a nutrient polluted river system in central Texas. Four tributaries of the Lake Waco reservoir were chemically characterized temporally and spatially in order to gain a complete understanding of the nature and origin of dissolved solids being transported into the lake. Temporal chemical variations measured at the base of each of the drainage basins are repetitive and seasonal. The most periodic and well-defined variation is exhibited by nitrate concentrations although many of the other solutes show seasonal changes as well. These temporal chemical changes are controlled by seasonal precipitation. During rainy seasons, the shallow aquifer is recharged resulting in stream discharge that is high in nitrate, calcium, and bicarbonate. When the shallow flow system is depleted in the summer, stream waters are dominated by deeper groundwater and become rich in sodium. Spatial variations in the chemistry of South Bosque surface waters were characterized using the snapshot technique. The spatial distribution of nitrate in surface waters is controlled by fertilizer application to row crops and the location of a munitions factory. The concentrations of naturally derived solutes such as Ca+, Na+, Cl-, and SO(4)(-2)are controlled by underlying lithologies.																			0943-0105					DEC	2003	45	1					106	114		10.1007/s00254-003-0862-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-003-0862-6													WOS:000186953700011

Most non-endemics inhabit only eutrophic habitats, only Erpobdella octoculata is present also in the non-polluted littoral and in the Chara zone. Endemic Glossiphonia pulchella and Dina spp. occur as deep as 200 m and more. Population density of leeches increases towards the lower edge of the Chara zone and reaches 350 ind./m2; it is about 30 ind./m2 in depths greater than 50 m. Characteristic is the quantitative dominance of Erpobdellidae over Glossiphoniidae. An attempt has been made to explain the aberrant distribution pattern using some other data about the lake as well as in comparison with other Holarctic lakes. Endemic species are suggested to outcompete other species by having greater specialization and to reach higher population densities by having finer niche partitioning.																			0003-9136					APR	1992	124	2					225	237																WOS:A1992HQ16500007

The highly infected char population was characterized by slow growth and poor feeding conditions. Feeding behavior of char in the two lakes differed principally in the fall, when consumption of benthos significantly decreased in the highly infected population as char fed more on copepods or sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Presence of these two food items in char stomachs was associated with high abundance of D. ditremum. The availability of alternative foods, such as larval insects and amphipods, appears to prevent char from acquiring heavy infections of D. ditremum, even in circumstances where all potential hosts are present.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				AUG	1986	43	8					1626	1634		10.1139/f86-201	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f86-201													WOS:A1986D371100018

A Drinking Water Crisis in Lake Taihu, China: Linkage to Climatic Variability and Lake Management	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												In late May, 2007, a drinking water crisis took place in Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, China, following a massive bloom of the toxin producing cyanobacteria Microcystis spp. in Lake Taihu, China's third largest freshwater lake. Taihu was the city's sole water supply, leaving approximately two million people without drinking water for at least a week. This cyanobacterial bloom event began two months earlier than previously documented for Microcystis blooms in Taihu. This was attributed to an unusually warm spring. The prevailing wind direction during this period caused the bloom to accumulate at the shoreline near the intake of the water plant. Water was diverted from the nearby Yangtze River in an effort to flush the lake of the bloom. However, this management action was counterproductive, because it produced a current which transported the bloom into the intake, exacerbating the drinking water contamination problem. The severity of this microcystin toxin containing bloom and the ensuing drinking water crisis were attributable to excessive nutrient enrichment; however, a multi-annual warming trend extended the bloom period and amplified its severity, and this was made worse by unanticipated negative impacts of water management. Long-term management must therefore consider both the human and climatic factors controlling these blooms and their impacts on water supply in this and other large lakes threatened by accelerating eutrophication.

Acute mountain sickness in disability and adaptive sports: Preliminary data	JOURNAL OF REHABILITATION RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT												Acute mountain sickness (AMS) is a frequent complication for military personnel, veterans, athletes, and travelers at high altitudes. Symptoms may occur in individuals with less cerebrospinal fluid volume and less ability to accommodate increased brain volume. No studies on AMS exist in individuals with neurological impairments. We studied 64 subjects, including active and sedentary controls and those with tetraplegia, paraplegia, multiple sclerosis, and traumatic brain injury at the 2007 National Veterans Winter Sports Clinic in Snowmass, Colorado. Subjects completed three Lake Louise Score surveys to quantify symptoms. We found a higher than expected occurrence of AMS overall (51.6%) but no differences among groups, and few participants sought treatment. Fatigue and weakness were common symptoms. High subject activity levels may explain these findings.

Chemical composition and sources of organic aerosol on the Adriatic coast in Croatia	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT-X												Air pollution studies are still scarce in some areas in Europe like around the Adriatic Sea. Source apportionment of the fine particulate (PM2.5) organic aerosol (OA) was conducted near Rogoznica, a small touristic settlement on the Eastern Adriatic coast of Croatia, near Lake Rogoznica (43.53 & nbsp; N, 15.95 & nbsp; E). Filter-based offline analyses of PM by a high resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) and an extractive electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (EESI-TOF) were used to apportion OA to its sources. We quantified the contributions of fresh biomass burning OA (BBOA) and three oxygenated OA (OOA), denoted as background OOA (bkgOOA), summer OOA (SOOA), and sulfur-containing OOA (SC-OOA). The bkgOOA component correlates with anthropogenically influenced secondary inorganic aerosol constituents (e.g. sulfate) and dominates OA both during the warm and cold seasons (44%). It exhibits characteristics of regional SOA and there are indications that during the warm season SOA from wildfires could be a substantial contributor. EESI-TOF measurements of the levoglucosan related ion showed a high correlation with the BBOA factor. Secondary OA has a similar molecular composition during the cold and warm seasons - in line with the large contribution of bkgOOA throughout the investigated seasons. SOOA comprises 19% of total OA and increases exponentially with the local temperature, consistent with SOA production by oxidation of biogenic emissions. In addition to biogenic precursors, other precursors (alkanes and aromatic) may contribute to the OOA enhancement during the warm season. SC-OOA is a minor contributor to OA (6%) and is most likely linked to emissions from a close-by marine lake.					ciglenecki, irena/N-8792-2013; Frka, Sanja/JMP-7939-2023; Slowik, Jay Gates/F-4894-2011; Prevot, Andre/C-6677-2008; Manousakas, Manousos/B-9283-2013; Dällenbach, Kaspar/AAY-4521-2020; Bhattu, Deepika/S-1148-2016; Slowik, Jay/F-4894-2011; Baltensperger, Urs/AFM-8080-2022; Kroflič, Ana/AAW-9093-2021	Frka, Sanja/0000-0002-9018-6165; Slowik, Jay Gates/0000-0001-5682-850X; Kroflic, Ana/0000-0003-1722-8397; Bhattu, Deepika/0000-0003-3597-190X; Prevot, Andre/0000-0002-9243-8194; Manousakas, Manousos/0000-0003-1111-0881; Grgic, Irena/0000-0003-0893-2278; Casotto, Roberto/0000-0001-5990-8126; Ciglenecki, Irena/0000-0002-1873-6193; 														2590-1621				JAN	2022	13								100159	10.1016/j.aeaoa.2022.100159	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aeaoa.2022.100159													WOS:000784292700002

The main factors affecting total ice load (F) on a structure were investigated using data derived under systematic test conditions, using natural sea ice. The width (W) of the model structure, ice thickness (h), indentation speed (V) and uni-axial compressive strength (sigma c) are the major factors influencing ice load on a structure with a vertical face.

Production per unit surface area representative of the whole lake basin (P-area .hivin.x) was lower in the shallower lakes (3.3-6.4 g C/m2 per yr), while production expressed per unit volume representative of the whole lake basin (P-vol .hivin.x) was higher in the shallower lakes (0.6-4.1 g C/m3 per yr). Production efficiency varied from lake to lake and throughout the yr, but it remained stable in a shorter term. Production efficiency and insolation was used to estimate annual production. Lakes with higher summer concentration of total P had higher rates of C assimilation.																			0020-9309						1977	62	3					345	370		10.1002/iroh.1977.3510620303	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.1977.3510620303													WOS:A1977DQ71400003

Vital statistics and growth were similar to lacustrine and riverine stocks at similar latitude. Total annual mortality averaged 0.56 with 65% attributable to angler exploitation, principally in the river. Some 34% (after mortality) of river spawners returned upriver in subsequent years. Repeat spawners (65% female) comprised an average 19% of the spawning runs. Most adults moved downriver in late June and July when water temperatures approached 25.degree. C. Adults remaining in the spawning area experienced water temperatures to 29.degree. C before emigrating during freshets in July and Aug. Lake migrants intermingled on shoal areas with lacustrine and possibly other potamodromous stocks each summer.																									1977	34	1					142	147		10.1139/f77-019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f77-019													WOS:A1977CT39800019

Seasonal shifts in the relative importance of local versus upstream sources of phosphorus to individual lakes in a chain	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Water quality in the Yahara chain of lakes in southern Wisconsin has been degraded significantly since European settlement of the region, primarily as a result of anthropogenic nutrient inputs. While all four main lakes (Mendota, Monona, Waubesa, and Kegonsa) have undergone eutrophication, elevated phosphorus and chlorophyll concentrations are particularly pronounced in the smaller lakes at the bottom of the chain (Waubesa and Kegonsa). Due to their short water residence times (2-3 months), these lakes are more responsive to seasonal variability in magnitude and source of phosphorus loading compared with the larger upstream lakes. In 2014, more than 80 % of the phosphorus load to Lake Waubesa passed through the outlet of Lake Monona (situated immediately upstream). However, between mid-May and late October when phosphorus concentrations in Lake Monona were reduced as a result of thermal stratification the upstream load dropped to similar to 40 % of the total, with the majority of loading during this period coming from Lake Waubesa's local watershed. Correspondingly, seasonal phosphorus trends in Lake Waubesa during summer are correlated with precipitation, rather than phosphorus concentrations leaving upstream lakes. While phosphorus export from the local watersheds of Lakes Waubesa and Kegonsa is relatively small on an annual time scale, targeted loading reductions in these areas during the summertime will most effectively reduce summertime phosphorus concentrations in these fast-flushing lakes. Understanding the interaction of landscape position, water residence time, and mixing regime can help guide watershed management for water quality improvements in lake chains.

Holocene carbonate record of Lake Kivu reflects the history of hydrothermal activity	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												The sediment record of Lake Kivu reveals a complex volcanogenic and climatic Holocene history. Investigation of the inorganic carbonate record dates the onset of carbonate deposition in the mid-Holocene in Kivu's deep northern and eastern basins and identifies conditions enabling deposition. The magnitude and timing of carbonate-rich sedimentation is not so much controlled by climate but, instead, linked strongly to hydrothermal activity in the basin. Sublacustrine springs supply the vast majority of the calcium and carbonate ions required for supersaturation with respect to aragonite. This major hydrothermal activity that permanently stratifies Lake Kivu today was initiated similar to 3,100 y before present (3.1 ka), when carbonate-rich sediments first appeared in the Holocene record. Aragonite is the dominant CaCO3 mineral present in the lake deposits. Both delta C-13 and delta O-18 of the aragonite are enriched above the expected kinetic fractionation of meteoric waters, suggesting a volcanogenic influence on the formation waters. Repeated major fluctuations in the carbonate record after 3.1 ka therefore most likely reflect the historical variation in hydrothermal inputs.					; Johnson, Thomas/C-1423-2010	Johnson, Thomas/0000-0003-4630-6788; 													0027-8424					JAN 10	2017	114	2					251	256		10.1073/pnas.1609112113	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1609112113								28028207					WOS:000391439300034
J	Kankaala, P; Ojala, A; Käki, T				Kankaala, P; Ojala, A; Käki, T			Temporal and spatial variation in methane emissions from a flooded transgression shore of a boreal lake	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Variation of CH4 emissions over a three-year period was studied in a reed-dominated (Phragmites australis) littoral transect of a boreal lake undergoing shoreline displacement due to postglacial rebound. The seasonal variation in plant-mediated CH4 emissions during open-water periods was significantly correlated with sediment temperature. The highest plant-mediated emission rates (up to 2050 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) were found in the outermost reed zone, where culms of the previous growing seasons had accumulated and free-floating plants grew on the decomposing culms. In reed zones closer to the shoreline as well as in mixed stands of reed and cattail, the maximum daily rates were usually >500 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1). The total plant-mediated CH4 emission during the open-water period was significantly correlated with the seasonal maximum of green shoot biomass. This relationship was strongest in the continuously flooded (water depth >25 cm) outermost zones. In this area, emissions through ebullition were of greatest importance and could exceed plant-mediated emissions. In general, total emissions of the open-water periods varied from ca. 20 to 50 g CH4 m(-2) a(-1), but in the outermost reed zone, the plant-mediated emissions could be as high as 123 g CH4 m(-2) a(-1); ebullition emissions from this zone reached >100 g CH4 m(-2) a(-1). The proportion of CH4 released in winter was usually <10% of annual emissions. Emissions of CH4 were higher in this flooded transgression shore the than those measured in boreal peatlands, but the role of ancient carbon stores as a substrate supply compared with recent anthropogenic eutrophication is unknown.																			0168-2563	1573-515X				APR	2004	68	3					297	311		10.1023/B:BIOG.0000031030.77498.1f	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:BIOG.0000031030.77498.1f													WOS:000222606700002

Four biomass levels of submerged macrophyte were used. They are 25 g, 12.5 g, 6.25 g and 3.125 gin 4 L water and 200 g sediment were cultivated in decomposition experiment setting in order to simulate the temperature in Lake Taihu in spring. The 70-day decomposition experimental results showed that the overall decay process of the four biomass levels at 17 degrees C can be well described by the exponential model, with the average decomposition rate of 0.018 day(-1). The decomposition of H. verticillata increased total nitrogen and phosphorus mass in the whole environment including overlying water, air and sediment. The optimal biomass harvest rate is 75% to 87.5% for a fresh water lake with 6 kg m(-3) fresh biomass if the short-term negative effect on water quality is ignored. The present study could provide some scientific bases for aquatic macrophytes management. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Matveev, VF; Matveeva, LK				Matveev, VF; Matveeva, LK			Seasonal succession and long-term stability of a pelagic community in a productive reservoir	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												In Lake Hume, a reservoir located in an active agricultural zone of the Murray River catchment, Australia, time series for the abundances of phytoplankton and zooplankton taxa, monitored from 1991 through to 1996, were stationary (without trends), and plankton taxonomic composition did not change. This indicated ecosystem resilience to strong fluctuations in reservoir water level, and to other potential agricultural impacts, for example eutrophication and pollution. Although biological stressors such as introduced fish and invertebrate predators are known to affect planktonic communities and reduce biodiversity in lakes, high densities of planktivorous stages of alien European perch (Perca fluviatilis) and the presence of carp (Cyprinus carpio) did not translate into non-stationary time series or declining trends for plankton in Lake Hume. However, the seasonal successions observed in the reservoir in different years did not conform well to the Plankton Ecology Group (PEG) model. Significant deviations of the Lake Hume successional pattern from the PEG model included maxima for phytoplankton abundance being in winter and the presence of a clear water phase without large zooplankton grazers. The instability of the water level in Lake Hume probably causes the dynamics of most planktonic populations to be less predictable, but did not initiate the declining trends that have been observed in some other Australian reservoirs. Both the PEG model and the present study suggest that hydrology is one of the major drivers of seasonal succession.

Metal accumulation was found to be highest during the period just after the summer monsoon due to the flushing of previously deposited sediments from the Cochin backwaters; the weak coastal currents favoring deposition in the coastal environment. Cross-shelf transport was found to be insignificant during the other two seasons. The geochemical studies reveal two different processes regulating the regional distribution of trace elements in this environment; viz: (1) The increased monsoonal supply of materials through the Cochin backwaters causing increased metal deposition (2) Effective masking of these metals by incorporation into clay and organic association which follows immediately after the monsoon. As the season progresses, they are further impoverished in metals (normalized) through size segregation of marine sediments. The correlations between various sedimentary parameters are elucidated to interpret the coherence between metallic and carrier phases during each season. While organic associations for most of the metals with seasons are preferential, absence of any correlation for Zn and Mn with organic carbon and clay on all occasion is striking.																			0749-0208					SUM	2003	19	3					664	683																WOS:000184814000016
J	WHARTON, RA; CROSBY, JM; MCKAY, CP; RICE, JW				WHARTON, RA; CROSBY, JM; MCKAY, CP; RICE, JW			PALEOLAKES ON MARS	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Observational evidence such as outflow channels and valley networks suggest that in the past there was flowing water on Mars. The images of fluvial features on Mars logically suggest that there must exist downstream locations in which the water pooled and the sediment load deposited (i.e. lakes). Sediments and morphological features associated with the martian paleolakes are believed to occur in Valles Marineris, and several large basins including Amazonis, Chryse and Elysium planitia. As Mars became progressively colder over geological time, any lakes on its surface would have become seasonally, and eventually perennially ice-covered. We know from polar lakes on Earth that ice-covered lakes can persist even when the mean annual temperature falls below freezing. Thus, the most recent lacustrine sediments on Mars were probably deposited in ice-covered lakes. While life outside of the Earth's atmosphere has yet to be observed, there is a general consensus among exobiologists that the search for extraterrestrial life should be based upon liquid water. The inference that there was liquid water on Mars during an earlier epoch is the primary motivation for considering the possibility of life during this time. It would be of enormous interest from both an exobiological and paleolimnological perspective to discover lakes or the evidence of former lakes on another planet such as Mars. Limnology would then become an interplanetary science.

Because pond experiments showed that hybrids stocked at night experienced mortality rates as high as those released during the day, tiger muskellunge were stocked into lakes during the day. Mortality of stocked hybrids (estimated by catch per effort of electrofishing) exceeded 95% within 40 days in both lakes. Population estimates of largemouth bass M. salmoides coupled with stomach-content data revealed that these predators accounted for 26 and 45% of the numbers stocked in the 2 lakes. Some hybrids died from thermal stress. Improved survival of tiger muskellunge may result if they are stocked at lengths > 250 mm to reduce predation losses and late in fall when thermal stress is reduced.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1981	110	5					604	612		10.1577/1548-8659(1981)110<604:LBPOST>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1981)110<604:LBPOST>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1981MK11000005

Invasion and production of New Zealand mud snails in the Colorado River, Glen Canyon	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Species invasions are often associated with large-scale human alteration of ecosystems. One classic example is the increasing dominance of non-native taxa below and above dams on large rivers. These dams substantially alter the physical template of river ecosystems, and exotic taxa often proliferate with potentially large impacts on coexisting taxa and ecosystem processes. Here we document the invasion of New Zealand mud snails (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) in the Colorado River directly below Lake Powell in Glen Canyon, Arizona, USA. We also quantified the magnitude and variability in growth and secondary production of P. antipodarum during 2006-2007 to gain a functional measure of their role in the ecosystem. Snails were first detected in Glen Canyon in 1995, and have since become a dominant component of the invertebrate fauna. Throughout the invasion of P. antipodarum, biomass of other dominant taxa was variable and did not appear to be positively or negatively influenced by the presence of P. antipodarum. Specific growth rates of P. antipodarum were moderate (0.001-0.030 day(-1)) and strongly related to body size. Mean annual habitat-weighted biomass and production were relatively high (biomass: 4.4 g/m(2); secondary production: 13.3 g m(-2) year(-1)) and similar among habitats. Mean monthly biomass and daily secondary production were much more variable, with highest values occurring in autumn. We show that invasion of a productive aquatic consumer to a highly disturbed river ecosystem had little detectable influence on the biomass of other invertebrate taxa. However, additional research will be necessary to fully understand and predict effects of P. antipodarum on coexisting taxa.					; Rosi, Emma/F-1777-2011; Rosi-Marshall, Emma/F-1777-2011; Hall, Robert/OIR-9123-2025	Baxter, Colden/0000-0003-1383-1412; Rosi, Emma/0000-0002-3476-6368; Kennedy, Theodore/0000-0003-3477-3629													1387-3547	1573-1464				SEP	2010	12	9					3033	3043		10.1007/s10530-010-9694-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-010-9694-y													WOS:000280892600018

In Lake Tangxun, Dolichospermum decay released highly labile dissolved organic nitrogen into the water column. This induced bacterial organic nitrogen decomposition, as indicated by the increased abundance of gltB, gltD, gdh, and glnA as well as aminopeptidase activity. Genes associated with dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium further fueled ammonium accumulation, driving Microcystis blooms in the summer. In Lake Zhiyin, fish bait deposits (high nitrogen, similar to Dolichospermum detritus) also caused Microcystis blooms. Detritus from Microcystis decomposition then produced high levels of labile dissolved organic phosphorus, inducing phosphatase activity and increasing soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations from September to April in Lakes Tangxun and Zhiyin. The high refractory DOM from macrophytes in Lake Houguan led to insufficient nutrient availability, leading to nutrient mutualism between algae and bacteria. The high levels of labile dissolved organic carbon from terrestrial detritus in Lake Yandong increased bacterial biomass and production, resulting in low chlorophyll content due to the competitive relationship between algal and bacterial nutrient requirements. Therefore, different DOM compositions induce unique connections among available nutrients, algae, and bacteria in the microbial loop.						wan, lingling/0000-0001-5864-1570													0013-936X	1520-5851				JAN 10	2023	57	1					297	309		10.1021/acs.est.2c06912	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.2c06912		DEC 2022						36576880					WOS:000906596800001

Egg thiamine concentration affects embryo survival in Lake Erie walleye	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												We quantified thiamine in eggs of Lake Erie walleye to determine if differences exist between spawning stocks within the Maumee and Sandusky rivers, both of which drain into the Western Basin. In spring 2004, eggs of walleye were collected in the Maumee River at three occasions (early, peak and late of the spawning run) and in the Sandusky River during the spawning run. After collection, eggs were fertilized with a known amount of milt, incubated and embryo survival was determined at the pigmented eyed stage. Thiamine and its derivatives were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography. Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) was the most abundant form of vitamin B(1) present in eggs (60-95% of the total vitamin B(1) concentration). Total thiamine concentrations in walleye eggs from the Maumee and Sandusky rivers at the peak of the spawning run averaged 6.1 +/- 1.6 nmol g(-1) and 5.0 +/- 2.9 nmol g(-1), respectively. Our results also indicated that Maumee River stock survival to the eyed stage embryo declined as the spawning season progressed (72%, 59% and 37% in the early, middle and late of spawning run, respectively) as well as the total thiamine and TPP concentrations. At the peak of the spawning run, survival to the eyed stage embryo did not differ significantly between stocks 59% versus 65% in the Maumee and Sandusky rivers, respectively, and thiamine concentrations were not significantly different between sites.

Associated mollusks included Sphaerium striatinum, Pisidium compressum, Valvata humeralis, V. utahensis, Helisoma newberryi, and Vorticifex effusa. This information was compared to an undated mollusk record from Point Bartlett and provides evidence concerning the late Pleistocene environments at Owens Lake. Based on the mollusks identified, the Dolomite site contains an assemblage indicative of deeper-water conditions than that of the Point Bartlett site. Evidence from the Dolomite site indicates that the maximum surface elevation of Owens Lake during the latest Pleistocene was at least +1097 m MSL. During the waning stages of the last glaciation, wetter than present conditions existed, because a Utah juniper woodland existed in Owens Valley.																			0042-3211					OCT 2	1995	38	4					312	318																WOS:A1995TC89800005

The Inferred Formation of a Subice Platelet Layer Below the Multiyear Landfast Sea Ice in the Wandel Sea (NE Greenland) Induced by Meltwater Drainage	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Oceanographic and ice-mass-balance records are presented from two moorings deployed on landfast multiyear ice in the Wandel Sea (North Greenland) during June-August 2015. Here we show that the melting and drainage of > 1 m of snow from June 14 to July 14 created a double-diffusive vertical stratification which resulted in supercooling of water and enabled the formation of platelet crystals below the sea ice. Although the effect of supercooling, with temperatures up to 0.58 degrees C below the freezing point, might be overestimated considerably in our records, this process led to the formation of similar to 1.1-1.2 m-thick subice platelet layer. While warm water temperatures lead to the complete loss of this layer at one mooring site, the layer persisted through summer and became incorporated into the congelation ice at the second site. The warm water that melted out the platelet layer can be ascribed to two different sources: (1) in situ heating from solar radiation resulting in a temperature increase up to 0.8 degrees C in late July and (2) advection of warm surface water (with temperatures up to 3-4 degrees C) from the ice-free coastal regions in mid-August. The combination of processes causing the seasonal growth of a platelet layer and either its subsequent ablation or incorporation into congelation ice is discussed with respect to the ice-mass balance and stability of the landfast ice cover in the Wandel Sea. Furthermore, this study provides evidence for the formation of a platelet layer in the Arctic, a phenomenon that historically has only been observed in the Antarctic.

Annual, seasonal, and diel surface energy partitioning in the semi-arid Sand Hills of Nebraska, USA	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study Region: The Nebraska Sand Hills consisting of four major land cover types: (1) lakes and wetlands (similar to 5% for both), (2) subirrigated meadows (similar to 10%), (3) dry valleys (similar to 20%), and (4) upland dunes (similar to 65%). Study Focus: Examination of surface energy and water balances on multiple temporal scales with primary focus on latent heat flux (lambda E), and evapotranspiration (ET), to gain a better understanding of the annual, seasonal, and diel properties of surface energy partitioning among different Sand Hills ecosystems to improve regional water resource management. New Hydrological Insights for the Region: Based on surface energy and water balance measurements using Bowen ratio energy balance systems at three locations during 2004, we find a strong spatial gradient between sites in latent (lambda E) and sensible (H) heat flux due to differences in topography, soils, and plant community composition on all timescales. Seasonally, all land covers show the greatest lambda E in summer. Our results show that subirrigated meadows, dry valleys, and upland dunes allocate roughly 81%, 50%, and 41% of available energy to lambda E, respectively, during the growing season. The subirrigated meadow was the only cover type where cumulative annual ET surpassed cumulative annual precipitation (i.e. net loss of water to the atmosphere). Therefore, the dry valleys and upland dunes are where net groundwater recharge to the High Plains Aquifer is occurring.

Andrew; Phong Nguyen			A Regional Evaluation of Suwannee Bass and Largemouth Bass Exploitation in North Florida Rivers	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Suwannee Bass Micropterus notius are a riverine species inhabiting a restricted range within the states of Florida and Georgia. However, little is known about exploitation of Suwannee Bass, which are currently managed in Florida under a single harvest regulation with black basses ( genus Micropterus). Regional exploitation of Suwannee Bass in Florida has never been examined in comparison with Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides, though such a comparison would allow fisheries managers to assess the efficacy of the current regulation. We estimated regionwide exploitation of both Suwannee Bass and Largemouth Bass in rivers, as facilitated via high-reward ($100), plastic-tipped dart tags. In fall 2013, we tagged 108 legal-sized Suwannee Bass (>= 305 mm) across 7 rivers and 160 legal-sized Largemouth Bass across 10 rivers in northern Florida. At the end of 1 year, we found that exploitation rates of Suwannee Bass (0.15) and Largemouth Bass (0.10) in rivers were similar. These estimates were also similar to estimates of Largemouth Bass exploitation in lakes across northern and central Florida.																			0275-5947	1548-8675					2016	36	4					958	963		10.1080/02755947.2016.1176970	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2016.1176970													WOS:000381683600023

This study, conducted from June 2022 to July 2023 in the Yuqiao Reservoir's ponds in China, explored phytoplankton dynamics across ponds under different biomanipulation strategies. The study included a pond (BL) without fish stocking, a pond (CH) stocked with carnivorous and herbivorous fish, and another pond (CFD) incorporating a mix of carnivorous, filter-feeding, and detritus-feeding fish. Substantial seasonal variations in phytoplankton density and biomass were observed. In the BL pond, phytoplankton density ranged from 0.23 x 107 to 3.21 x 107 ind/L and biomass from 0.71 to 7.10 mg/L, with cyanobacteria predominantly in warmer seasons and a shift to cryptophytes and chrysophytes in winter. The CH pond exhibited a density range from 0.61 x 107 to 8.04 x 107 ind/L and biomass of 1.11 to 7.58 mg/L. Remarkably, the CFD pond demonstrated a significant reduction in both density (0.11 x 107 to 2.36 x 107 ind/L) and biomass (0.27 to 5.95 mg/L), indicating the effective implementation of its biomanipulation strategy. Key environmental factors including total nitrogen, water temperature, pH, chlorophyll-a, and total phosphorus played a significant role in shaping phytoplankton communities. The study highlights the importance of tailored biomanipulation strategies in aquatic ecosystem management, emphasizing long-term monitoring for sustainable management of eutrophication.

The largest species, C. vicinus, inhabits deep water layers, both at noon and midnight, while the smaller species, T. crassus and M. leuckarti, inhabit upper water layers. In all three species, copepodites and males live closer to the water surface than females. In summer, abundance of the smallest species (T.crassus) is highest, although finite birth rates are lowest. The distribution patterns and population characteristics suggest that the vertical distribution of cyclopoid copepods in Dreiangel Lake is mainly governed by fish predation; different temperature tolerances and preferences of the three species may also be of significance.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				SEP	1993	15	9					1097	1102		10.1093/plankt/15.9.1097	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/15.9.1097													WOS:A1993LY83300007

The resultant data were subjected to multivariate techniques-Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). Analyses of water parameters with PCA revealed that the first PC axis (PC1) accounts for maximum variance in the seasonal data, explaining a variability of 91%. The PCA revealed that the seasonal variability in water parameters was due to the wet and dry cycle of seasons and the stations were distinguished on the basis of transparency and turbidity. Zooplankton abundance was dominated by copepods followed by cladocerans. Temporally, abundance of copepods reached a maximum during Post-monsoon (POM) (3 880 ind./L). Spatially, S6 was found to be most abundant of the other stations in zooplankton. Copepodites and nauplii larvae were the major components of zooplankton. The Rotifera were the least abundant among the three zooplankton groups. Brachionus formed the major component of Rotifera zooplankton at all the stations during the study period. In the Cladocera, Macrothrix was present during all the four seasons, while Pleuroxus, Oxyurella, Kurzia and, Diaphanosoma were rare. The CCA shows that maximal temporal variability in zooplankton abundance was explained by temperature and rainfall. ANOVA revealed no significant difference in mean zooplankton abundance among the seasons, but there was a statistically significant difference among the sites.																			0254-4059	1993-5005				MAY	2017	35	3					469	480		10.1007/s00343-017-5341-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-017-5341-0													WOS:000399168400001

The lake consistently exhibits a strong metalimnetic O2 maximum during summer thermal stratification. Dense beds of rooted macrophytes, primarily Nitella flexilis, grow around the circumference of the lake to a depth of 11 m. There was no correlation between the positive heterograde O2 curve and limnetic phytoplankton density or estimates of primary productivity. The strongest association existed between the metalimnetic O2 maximum and standing crop dry weights of the macrophyte community. All transects across the macrophyte beds indicated the greatest standing crop to be between depths of 6-10 m. Variation in total standing crop between transects is attributed to slope angle of the basin, substrate and direction of slope, in order of importance.																			0003-0031	1938-4238					1979	101	1					108	117		10.2307/2424906	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2424906													WOS:A1979GS58700012

In inland waterbodies, the red bloom is caused by a rapid development or accumulation of euglenophytes. Recent studies have designated euglenophytes as bioindicator of organic pollution. The ecology of euglenophytes is influenced by the changes in the intensity of sunlight, temperature, nutrient cycles, and seasons. Most of the species of euglenophytes grow prolifically with the increase of water temperature. Nitrogen and phosphorus are often thought to be the main nutrients that influence the cellular growth of toxic euglenophytes. A high concentration of nutrients is required for the euglenophytes to grow and to form bloom. Heavy bloom of euglenophytes in the summer season is the characteristic of eutrophic ponds. Inland waterbodies in many countries suffer from euglenophyte blooms, which shade submerged vegetation, deplete the dissolved oxygen and disrupt the aquatic food webs. Dense bloom of euglenophytes clog the gills of fishes, cause breathing difficulties and in extreme cases results mortality. Red blooms of the deadly toxin producing Euglena sanguinea negatively affect the water quality resulting massive mortality of fishes. Consequently, aquaculture systems and fisheries are facing a serious threat from the predicted outbreak of toxic red blooms of euglenophytes worldwide. To ensure sustainability in the fisheries and aquaculture industry, it is essential to analyze the ecology of euglenophytes. Again, interesting research on euglenophycin, a Euglena-derived natural product, has shown that it can be utilized as a potential anti-cancer drug. This paper comes up with a thorough review of the latest research in this area, revealing new insights and solutions that can help mitigate the negative impact of the freshwater harmful euglenophytes. By implementing considerable management strategies, the health of the valuable aquatic ecosystems and the future of the aquaculture and fisheries can also be secured.

Zooplankton samples collected from Batchawana Bay, Lake Superior on 15 September 1988 contained large numbers of B. cederstroemi (122.8 individuals/m2). Geographic variation in Great Lakes B. cederstroemi was observed when this sample was compared to samples from Lake Erie. There was a greater percentage of males present in the Lake Superior sample as well as a greater number of females carrying sexual resting eggs. B. cederstromei from Lake Superior weighed more than those from Lake Erie. These differences are probably the result of physiological responses to different environmental conditions, and not genetic differentiation of B. cederstroemi populations among the Great Lakes.					; Berg, David/GQQ-2457-2022	Berg, David/0000-0002-2537-0759; 													0380-1330						1990	16	1					148	152		10.1016/S0380-1330(90)71408-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(90)71408-6													WOS:A1990DE25300017

Supraglacial surface routing delays may propagate to englacial and subglacial hydrologic systems, requiring accurate assessment to correctly estimate subglacial effective pressures. We compare hourly supraglacial moulin discharge simulations from three surface meltwater routing models - the synthetic unit hydrograph (SUH), the bareice component of surface routing and lake filling (SRLF), and the rescaled width function (RWF) - for four internally drained catchments on the southwestern Greenland ice sheet surface. The routing models are forced identically using surface runoff from the Modele Atmospherique Regionale regional climate model (RCM). For each catchment, simulated moulin hydrographs are input to the SHAKTI subglacial hydrologic model to simulate diurnally varying subglacial effective-pressure variations in the vicinity of a single moulin. Overall, all three routing models produce more realistic moulin discharges than simply using RCM runoff outputs without surface routing but produce significant differences in peak moulin discharge and time to peak. In particular, the RWF yields later, smaller peak moulin discharges than the SUH or SRLF due to its representation of slow interfluve flow between supraglacial meltwater channels, and it can readily accommodate the seasonal evolution of supraglacial stream and river networks. Differences among the three routing models are reflected in a series of simple idealized subglacial hydrology simulations that yield different diurnal effective-pressure amplitudes; however, the supraglacial hydrologic system acts as short-term storage for surface meltwater, and the temporal mean effective pressure is relatively consistent across routing models.

Correlations of circulation indices with air and lake water temperature were analysed in the monthly cycle. Deviations of values of such components in different phases of the analysed atmospheric circulations types from mean average from the years 1971 to 2015 were also determined. The research showed a variable effect of the atmospheric circulations types. The strongest effect on water temperature was observed in winter, when AO and NAO circulation showed particularly evident influence. Deviations of water temperature from mean values from the analysed multi-annual period generally oscillated around 1.0 degrees C, reaching a maximum value of 1.4 degrees C. The presented research shows the complexity of processes determining changes in lake water temperature, the course of which depends on many factors with both regional (e.g., ice cover on lakes) and local range (conditions of water exchange, human pressure).					; Ptak, Mariusz/O-3217-2015; Tomczyk, Arkadiusz/ABB-7117-2021; Wrzesiński, Dariusz/I-5765-2019	Ptak, Mariusz/0000-0003-1225-1686; Tomczyk, Arkadiusz Marek/0000-0003-1576-8795; Wrzesinski, Dariusz/0000-0001-5025-1447; 														2073-4433				FEB	2018	9	2							66	10.3390/atmos9020066	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos9020066													WOS:000427507000032

In this region, Sevier contraction and a period of relative tectonic quiescence predate Miocene extension and magmatism. The herein revised Rainbow Gardens Formation, formerly the oldest member of the Horse Spring Formation, is found throughout the Lake Mead area and spans the transition from quiescence to the start of extension. New detailed stratigraphic work within the Rainbow Gardens Formation, including paleocurrent analyses, stable isotope geochemical data, new 40Ar/39Ar dates, tephrochronologic data, and ongoing structural studies, was used to build a detailed chronostratigraphic framework and reconstruct the Rainbow Gardens basin through time. Our results show that the basin formed by a combination of inherited topography and tectonic events outside the Lake Mead region prior to ca. 25 Ma. Sedimentation rates, sedimentary facies patterns, and the lack of evidence for syndepositional faulting indicate that the basin did not form during extensional faulting, although recent work suggests that this basin was modified by uplift to the south between 18 and 20 Ma. Initially, the basin recorded fluvial sedimentation within the center of an E-NE-trending inherited valley, with two facing gravel-dominated bajadas on either side. As the valley filled, rivers from the Caliente volcanic field to the north delivered an influx of volcaniclastic material into a broad area of marshes and ephemeral lakes. In the final stages of sedimentation, just prior to the onset of extension at ca. 17 Ma, the basin filled with limestone in a series of shallow lakes. Understanding the development and evolution of this basin is crucial for testing models of extension as recorded by the younger Horse Spring Formation. In addition, the detailed sedimentology and stratigraphy place constraints on models of the formation of the Grand Canyon and suggest that a paleo-Colorado River did not deposit sediment in the Lake Mead area between 25 and 17 Ma. This work highlights the importance of detailed basin analyses, which are crucial companions to structural, tectonic, and geomorphologic studies aimed at understanding the complex evolution of lithospheric and landscape changes across a large region.					; Dunbar, Nelia/HZL-8693-2023	Hickson, Thomas/0000-0002-7878-3565; Dunbar, Nelia/0000-0002-5181-937X; Schleicher, Jillian/0000-0002-2077-5589; 													0016-7606	1943-2674				JUL	2015	127	7-8					899	925		10.1130/B31144.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/B31144.1													WOS:000359010800001

Benthic metabolism and nitrogen dynamics in a sub-tropical coastal lagoon: Microphytobenthos stimulate nitrification and nitrate reduction through photosynthetic oxygen evolution	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Benthic oxygen and nutrient fluxes, and rates of nitrate reduction, were determined seasonally under light and dark conditions at four sites within a sub-tropical coastal lagoon (Coombabah Lake, Australia). Sediments at all sites were strongly heterotrophic acting as strong oxygen sinks and sources of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in all seasons during both light and dark incubations. Sediment oxygen demand (SOD) and DIN effluxes were greatest during summer, but showed only a relatively small degree of seasonal variation. In contrast, there was a strong spatial trend in SOD and DIN effluxes, which were consistently greater at the sites with fine grained compared to the coarser sediments. Microphytobenthos (MPB) directly influenced SOD and DIN effluxes, with lower SOD and DIN effluxes measured during all light incubations. Strong correlations were found between sediment chlorophylla content and light-dark shifts in oxygen and ammonium fluxes (Delta O-2 and Delta NH4+), and between Delta O-2 and Delta NH4+. Rates of total nitrate reduction were relatively low ranging from 3 to 26 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1) and exhibited only minor seasonal variations. Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) was the dominant pathway for nitrate reduction, accounting for on average, 65 and 68% of total nitrate reduction during light and dark incubations. respectively. Nitrification was the dominant source of nitrate fuelling nitrate reduction processes, accounting for approximately 90% of total nitrate supply. In contrast to typical MPB colonised sediments, rates of nitrification and, as a consequence, nitrate reduction rates were consistently stimulated in the light, indicating that MPB primarily influenced these processes through photosynthetic oxygen evolution rather than through competition for inorganic N-species.

It is classified as a threatened species by the New York Department Environmental Conservation, and agency staff planners need details of its life history for its conservation and recovery. Since there were 8 recent records for Mooneye in the river segment both upstream and downstream of a dam at Heuvelton, we chose this segment of the Oswegatchie River to characterize the river's population of Mooneye. Mooneye records also came from the nearby tributary Indian River, and spawners could travel to the rapids at Rossie upstream of Black Lake without any barriers. We caught 68 Mooneye in April-September 2021 in this study reach, using floating gillnets and boat electrofishing. Catch rates using either method varied widely among seasons. Intentions to find spawning aggregations were finally successful in late April 2023 in 2 of the previously studied locations and 1 new site. On 25 and 28 April, we caught spawners downstream of barriers, 2-3 m in height, to movement on the Oswegatchie River at Heuvelton, Coopers Falls, and at Rossie on the Indian River.																			1092-6194	1938-5307				JUN	2024	31	2					231	241		10.1656/045.031.0206	http://dx.doi.org/10.1656/045.031.0206													WOS:001269968800006

Prototype detection unit for the CHIPS experiment	XXVII INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NEUTRINO PHYSICS AND ASTROPHYSICS (NEUTRINO2016)	Journal of Physics Conference Series				27th International Conference on Neutrino Physics and Astrophysics (Neutrino)	JUL 04-09, 2016	Royal Geog Soc, London, ENGLAND	Imperial Coll London, Inst Phys	Royal Geog Soc			CHIPS (CHerenkov detectors In mine PitS) is an R&D project aiming to develop novel cost-effective neutrino detectors, focused on measuring the CP-violating neutrino mixing phase (dCP). A single detector module, containing an enclosed volume of purified water, would be submerged in an existing lake, located in a neutrino beam. A staged approach is proposed with first detectors deployed in a flooded mine pit in Northern Minnesota, 7 mrad off-axis from the existing NuMI beam. A small proof-of-principle model (CHIPS-M) has already been tested and the first stage of a fully functional 10 kt module (CHIPS-10) is planned for 2018. One of the instruments submerged on board of CHIPS-M in autumn 2015 was a prototype detection unit, constructed at Nikhef. The unit contains hardware borrowed from the KM3NeT experiment, including 16 3 inch photomultiplier tubes and readout electronics. In addition to testing the mechanical design and data acquisition, the detector was used to record a large sample of cosmic ray muon events. The collected data is valuable for characterising the cosmic muon background and validating a Monte Carlo simulation used to optimise future designs. This paper introduces the CHIPS project, describes the design of the prototype unit, and presents the results of a preliminary data analysis.

Extremely selective recognition of Pd2+ ion was demonstrated by the guest-free compound 1 (called 1 ') using a fluorescence signal. The quenching in the fluorescence signal was observed due to the weak interaction between the linker alkyne-pi bond and Pd2+. The mechanism of isophthalic alkyne-pi and Pd2+ interaction was systematically examined with the help of isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and UV-vis spectroscopy. The response time of the MOF for sensing of Pd2+ was 30 s, which is the lowest response time for MOF-based Pd2+ sensing to date, with an ultralow detection limit (102 nM) and Stern-Volmer constant (4.39 x 103 M-1), evidencing the outstanding ability to sense Pd2+ ion by this probe. The Pd2+ detection limit falls among the lowest values. Activated MOF (1 ') also showed considerable recyclability up to five steps with a constant sensing ability. In different water resources (Milli-Q water, lake water, river water, and tap water), the probe also showed excellent sensing ability. A paper-strip device was developed for the applicability of our material for the real field sensing application of Pd2+. The relevance of 1 ' is not only up to Pd2+, but it could also sense palladium in other possible oxidation states.						, PRANAM CHAKRABORTY/0009-0003-9261-8560; MUKHERJEE, SRIJAN/0000-0002-2892-9773													0020-1669	1520-510X				JAN 16	2023	62	2					802	809		10.1021/acs.inorgchem.2c03318	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.2c03318		DEC 2022						36580276					WOS:000914166600001

Concurrent samples for the enumeration of phytoplankton and green ciliates were taken, and the differential contribution of these fractions to total chlorophyll a concentration was analysed. The development of a distinctive deep chlorophyll maximum was observed during summer months. The deep chlorophyll maximum was situated near the limit of the euphotic zone and just below the upper limit of the metalimnion. The results showed that the green ciliate Ophrydium naumanni with endosymbiotic Chlorella dominated the metalimnion causing the deep chlorophyll maximum. Additional laboratory experiments revealed a strong dependence of O.naumanni on light. Therefore, the symbiotic association appears to be an effective exploitation of the water column in poor-nutrient-high-light ecosystems like large Andean lakes.					; Balseiro, Esteban/Y-2743-2019	Balseiro, Esteban/0000-0002-5052-0587; Modenutti, Beatriz/0000-0002-8683-5679													0142-7873	1464-3774				JAN	1999	21	1					167	178		10.1093/plankt/21.1.167	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/21.1.167													WOS:000078342800009

Coupled with shallow water equations, a depth-averaged 2-D flow and water quality model was developed. By means of the conservation law, a proposed differential equation for the change of sediment pollutants was linked to the 2-D equations. Under the framework of the finite volume method, the Osher approximate Riemann solver was employed to solve the equations. An analytical resolution was used to examine the model capabilities. Simulated results matched the exact solutions especially well. As an example, the simulation of CODMn in the Wuli Lake, a part of the Taihu lake, was conducted, which led to reasonable results. This study provides a new approach and a practical tool for the simulation of flow and water quality in shallow lakes.					张, 洁/GXZ-7743-2022														1001-6058	1878-0342				AUG	2007	19	4					501	508		10.1016/S1001-6058(07)60146-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-6058(07)60146-2													WOS:000208248000015

At this latitude, the light regime changes strongly during the summer months, from 24 hrs of daylight in June to 14 hrs in September. Swimming fish were monitored by a bottom mounted split-beam echosounder, and the hydroacoustic traces were analysed with software designed for fish track analysis. Fish tracks were smoothed using a locally weighted algorithm before estimating swimming speeds. The swimming speed was strongly influenced by light. Average swimming speed was highest in periods with low incident light or crepuscular light (16-18 cm s(-1)) and lowest in darkness (8-10 cm s(-1)). A positive relationship between fish size and swimming speed was observed during daylight, but not during periods of darkness.					; Gjelland, Karl/I-7023-2012; Gjelland, Karl Oystein/I-7023-2012	Bohn, Thomas/0000-0002-3851-9313; Gjelland, Karl Oystein/0000-0003-4036-4207; Amundsen, Per-Arne/0000-0002-2203-8216													0003-455X	1797-2450				FEB 26	2004	41	1					137	146																WOS:000220364300016

Practical applications for systematics and taxonomy in North American freshwater gastropod conservation	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY												The roles of systematics in the field of conservation biology are well understood and accepted for many organisms. However, the role of systematics and taxonomy has not been reviewed in the context of species protection and management of freshwater gastropods. We provide a thorough review of the relevant theoretical literature in systematics and taxonomy and illustrate with recent examples of species delineation and taxonomy in North American freshwater gastropods that these fields play key roles in the practical designation of conservation management units. We summarize some aspects of the biology of freshwater gastropods that can confound taxonomic and management efforts. Based on our review, we recommend that effective conservation plans include the systematic research necessary to recognize unique organismal lineages as primary conservation management units. This strategy must be combined with consistent and rigorous nomenclature, taxonomy, and dissemination of research findings so that all parties have access to the highest quality information.

However, the features of the atmospheric boundary layer during cold air passage are not clearly understood due to the lack of comprehensive observation data, especially regarding turbulence. In this study, four-layer gradient meteorological observation data and one-layer, 10-Hz ultrasonic anemometer-thermometer monitoring data from the northern side of Poyang Lake were employed to study the main features of the surface boundary layer during a strong cold-air passage over southern China. The results show that, with the passage of a cold air front, the wind speed exhibits low-frequency variations and that the wind systematically descends. During the strong wind period, the wind speed increases with height in the surface layer. Regular gust packets are superimposed on the basic strong wind flow. Before the passage of cold air, the wind gusts exhibit a coherent structure. The wind and turbulent momentum fluxes are small, although the gusty wind momentum flux is slightly larger than the turbulent momentum flux. However, during the invasion of cold air, both the gusty wind and turbulent momentum fluxes increase rapidly with wind speed, and the turbulent momentum flux is larger than the gusty wind momentum flux during the strong wind period. After the cold air invasion, this structure almost disappears.					l, xm/KLD-8313-2024; Cheng, Adina/B-3075-2014; cheng, xue ling/B-3075-2014	cheng, xue ling/0000-0001-6522-9162													0256-1530	1861-9533				JAN	2013	30	1					210	218		10.1007/s00376-012-1223-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00376-012-1223-8													WOS:000312636500019

To elucidate the changes in the spatial and seasonal origins of SOM in a eutrophic lake, we collected sediment at 31 sampling points in Lake Hachiro, northern Japan, in June and November of 2016 and April and June of 2017, and measured total organic carbon (TOC) and fatty acid biomarkers. We found that TOC and the origin of SOM showed both spatial and seasonal variations. TOC was relatively high in the eastern part of the lake and may reflect the hydrological conditions therein. The average TOC of sediment collected from the 31 sampling points increased from June to November 2016, concomitant with an increase in cyanobacterial fatty acids. A cyanobacterial bloom was observed in the water column from July to October of that year, and the input of cyanobacterial carbon to the sediment may explain the TOC increase during this period. We also detected an increase in TOC from November 2016 to April 2017, which coincided with increases in fatty acids of terrestrial and diatom origin. In this regard, we suspect that meltwater inflow during this period may have borne large quantities of terrestrial organic matter, and diatoms are known to predominate in Lake Hachiro during the spring. In contrast, from April to June 2017, we recorded decreases in TOC and all fatty acid biomarkers, with the exception of those derived from bacteria, indicating that decomposition processes prevailed during this period. Quantitative estimates indicated that, despite the spatial and seasonal variations, terrestrial organic carbon was the predominant carbon source in Lake Hachiro, even when the waters were eutrophic and algal blooms were present.

Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were selected as target compounds. Sample quantification and detection were performed by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Extraction parameters influencing the extraction efficiency were optimized through response surface methodology using the Box-Behnken design. The proposed method achieved good linearity within the concentration range of 0.15-250 ng L-1 PCBs, low limits of detection (0.04-0.09 ng L-1, S/N = 3:1), good repeatability of the extractions (relative standard deviation, <12%, n = 6), and satisfactory recoveries between 84.9% and 101.0% under optimal conditions. Real environmental samples collected from rivers, local lakes, rain and spring waters were analyzed using the developed method. Results demonstrated that the hexagonal boron nitride-based material has significant potential as a sorbent for organic pollutant extraction from environmental water samples. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We expect to highlight new management perspectives. Thus, we investigated both natal origin and connectivity processes for young of the year prior to their first winter. Otolith chemical composition was measured at larval and juvenile stages using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Five spawning sites were sampled and discriminated using a three-elemental model (manganese, barium, strontium). Results showed that (i) all within-lake sites contributed similarly to juvenile production and (ii) production results from both local recruitment and lake-wide connectivity processes. The study suggests fish management should include an overall evaluation of the lake-wide recruitment. Both local and widespread actions are required, depending on the level of connectivity in the lake, which plays a central role in shaping the spatial pattern of recruitment. Finally, otolith microchemistry proves to be an efficient tool for freshwater fish managers to evaluate both natal origin and connectivity in heterogeneous aquatic ecosystems.

Helium and carbon isotope systematics of cold "mazuku" CO2 vents and hydrothermal gases and fluids from Rungwe Volcanic Province, southern Tanzania	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												We report new helium and carbon isotope (He-3/He-4 and delta C-13) and relative abundance (CO2/He-3) characteristics of a suite of 20 gases and fluids (cold mazuku-like CO2 vents, bubbling mud-pots, hot and cold springs) from 11 different localities in Rungwe Volcanic Province (RVP), southern Tanzania and from 3 additional localities in northern Tanzania (Oldoinyo Lengai Volcano and Lake Natron). At RVP, fluids and gases are characterized by a large range in He-isotope compositions (He-3/He-4) from 0.97 R-A to 7.18 R-A (where R-A = air He-3/He-4), a narrow range in delta C-13 ratios from -2.8 to -65 parts per thousand (versus VPDB), and a large range in CO2/He-3 values spanning nearly four orders of magnitude (4x10(9) to 3.2x10(13)). Oldoinyo Lengai possesses upper-mantle-like He-CO2 characteristics, as reported previously (Fischer et al., 2009), whereas hot springs at Lake Natron have low He-3/He-4 (similar to 0.6 R-A), CO2/He-3 (similar to 5-15x10(8)) and intermediate delta C-13 (similar to-3.7 to -4.9 parts per thousand). At RVP, fluid phase samples have been modified by the complicating effects of hydrothermal phase-separation, producing CO2/He-3 and delta C-13 values higher than postulated starting compositions. In contrast, gas-phase samples have not been similarly affected and thus retain more mantle-like CO2/He-3 and delta C-13 values. However, the addition of crustal volatiles, particularly radiogenic helium from He-4-rich reservoir rocks, has modified He-3/He-4 values at all but the three cold CO2 gas vent (i.e., mazuku) localities (Ikama Village, Kibila Cold Vent and Kiejo Cold Vent) which retain pristine upper-mantle He-isotope (similar to 7 R-A) and He-CO2 characteristics. The extent of crustal contamination is controlled by the degree of interaction within the hydrothermal system, which increases with distance from each major volcanic center. In contrast, we propose that pristine cold CO2 mazuku gases collected at stratigraphic contacts on the flanks of RVP volcanoes may potentially tap isolated gas pockets, which formed during previous eruptive events and have remained decoupled from the local hydrothermal system. Furthermore, by identifying and utilizing unmodified gas samples, we determine mantle versus crustal provenance of the CO2, which we use to estimate mantle-derived CO2 fluxes at both Rungwe and Lake Natron. Finally, we investigate the origin of the apparent discrepancy in He isotopes between fluids/gases and mafic phenocrysts at RVP (from Hilton et al., 2011), and discuss the tectonic (i.e., rift zone dynamics) and petrogenic conditions that distinguish RVP from other plume-related subaerial rift zones.

J	Wang, YT; Fan, ZY; Wang, WC; Zhou, ZZ; Ye, XX				Wang, Yutao; Fan, Zhongya; Wang, Wencai; Zhou, Zhongze; Ye, Xiaoxin			Effects of Flood on Phytoplankton Diversity and Community Structure in Floodplain Lakes Connected to the Yangtze River	DIVERSITY-BASEL												Flood events can significantly affect the physical and biological processes of aquatic ecosystems in a short time, leading to rapid changes in phytoplankton community structure. The Huayanghe Lakes experienced extreme flooding in the summer of 2020, with the water level reaching 16.42 m. In order to understand the effects of flooding on phytoplankton diversity and community structure, eight samples were collected in the Huayanghe Lakes from 2019 to 2020. Water-level disturbance has a significant influence on lake-water quality and phytoplankton community structure. The results showed that the Secchi depth increased from 65.36 to 8.52 cm, while the concentration of total nitrogen (from 0.98 to 0.7 mg/L) and total phosphorus (from 0.04 to 0.031 g/L) decreased. In addition, flooding significantly increased the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, the Pielou index, and the Margalef richness index by an average of 43.5%, 36.7%, and 40.21%, respectively. The phytoplankton community structure in the Huayanghe Lakes changed due to the change of physicochemical environment caused by flood. While in the pre-flood period phytoplankton was composed of large diatoms (e.g., Aulacoseira granulata), cyanobacteria (e.g., Microcystis sp., Anabaena sp., and Aphanizomenon sp.) and other multicellular taxa, the flood period showed an increase in the proportion of chlorophytes and diatoms that quickly adapted to settle in new environments. Pearson correlations and redundancy analyses showed that water level fluctuation was the most significant environmental factor affecting the phytoplankton community between the regular hydrological cycle and flood periods. There are few studies on phytoplankton in the Huayanghe Lakes, and the present study provides basic data on phytoplankton diversity and community structure. In addition, it provides a theoretical basis for controlling water level change in the Yangtze River.					; Ye, Xiaoxin/HGU-2549-2022	Zhou, Zhong Ze/0000-0001-6688-8311; 														1424-2818				JUL	2022	14	7							581	10.3390/d14070581	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d14070581													WOS:000834408200001

Granulometric, chronological, geochemical and biological data from the sediment cores reveal two lowstands and two highstands of the lake level, which is today located ca. 5 m above sea level during summer. Our study confirms the presence of an ice sheet blocking the drainage of Lake Taymyr during the latest Weichselian. Although chronological control of the sediment cores does not allow us to unambiguously constrain the time frame for each of the lake stages, the proposed timing of events is in good agreement with regional terrestrial archives as well as marine signals on the Kara Sea Shelf. Overall, the data show that the evolution of Lake Taymyr involved a complex interplay of regional climatic, glacial and sea-level changes.					; Melles, Martin/J-4070-2012; Fedorov, Grigory/N-5788-2019; Wagner, Bernd/J-4682-2012; Savelieva, Larisa/H-9135-2013; Krastel, Sebastian/C-2001-2017; Kostromina, Natalia/AAM-8972-2021; Lebas, Elodie/AAR-2578-2020; Mustafin, Mark/LNQ-9745-2024; Brill, Dominik/O-2442-2015	Melles, Martin/0000-0003-0977-9463; Wagner, Bernd/0000-0002-1369-7893; Lenz (nee Baumer), Marlene Margit/0000-0002-5352-3900; Lebas, Elodie/0000-0003-1617-143X; Gromig, Raphael/0000-0001-9217-4259; Fedorov, Grigory/0000-0003-2269-4501; Krastel, Sebastian/0000-0002-5899-9748; Kostromina, Natalia/0000-0003-2681-0565; Brill, Dominik/0000-0001-8637-4641													0267-8179	1099-1417				JUL	2022	37	5			SI		851	867		10.1002/jqs.3342	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jqs.3342		JUL 2021											WOS:000674501300001

The linear range is adjustable depending on Cd2+ concentration, for example, the determination of S2- can be achieved in the range of 1.5-7.0 x 10(-6) mol L-1 by selecting 3.0 x 10(-6) mol L-1 Cd2+. The detection limit is 1.3 x 10(-8) mol L-1 under optimum conditions, and the relative standard deviation (RSD, n = 10) for 2.0 x 10(-6) mol L-1 S2- is 0.7%. Compared with other methods, this method has the following prominent advantages: with low detection limit, easy to operate and less interference. The proposed method has been successfully applied to the determination of S2- in synthetic wastewater, lake water, beverage, spring water and real wastewater samples.					; huang, deqian/K-8022-2015; Xu, Bolei/O-8493-2016; Petti, Jw/IQW-4018-2023; TANG, JIE/KIL-8226-2024	Huang, De-Qian/0000-0001-9143-9526; Xu, Bolei/0000-0001-5352-0139; 													1759-9660	1759-9679				FEB	2010	2	2					154	158		10.1039/b9ay00183b	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b9ay00183b													WOS:000275645000007

Kamisagata (N 37 degrees 49', E 138 degrees 53', alt. 4.5 m, depth 30-80 cm, area 0.025 km(2)), one of about 20 sand dune lakes in Japan. A very high concentration of NO3--N with 19.0 +/- 5.9 mg N l(-1) in spring sources decreased during passage through the reed belt along two set transect lines about 120 m long in any season, whereas progressive enrichment in N-15-NO3- in flowing water was detected. Loss rate of nitrate ranged from 38.4 to 73.1% with an average of 56.7 +/- 11.6%. Enrichment factors calculated using a Rayleigh curve method ranged from 1.03 to - 5.12 parts per thousand. The contribution of denitrification to nitrate loss ranged from 6 to 28%, with a mean of 19.5% (+/- 7.0), whereas that of plant uptake was from 72 to 94%, with a mean of 80.5% (+/- 7.0), indicating the importance of vegetation in a sand dune riparian zone. A technique using the variation of natural abundance of N-15 may provide useful information on the nitrate dynamics in artificial or natural wetlands under a non-destructive condition.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2007	584						49	58		10.1007/s10750-007-0589-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-007-0589-6													WOS:000246583500006

J	Ikeda, M; Ozaki, K; Legrand, J				Ikeda, Masayuki; Ozaki, Kazumi; Legrand, Julien			Impact of 10-Myr scale monsoon dynamics on Mesozoic climate and ecosystems	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Earth's orbital variations on timescales of 10(4)-10(5) years, known as Milankovitch cycles, have played a critical role in pacing climate change and ecosystem dynamics, through glacial and/or monsoon dynamics. However, the climatic and biotic consequences of these cycles on much longer (similar to 10(7) years) timescales remain unclear, due to a lack of long proxy records with precise age constraints. Here, we show similar to 10-Myr scale variations in early Mesozoic (250-180 Ma) records of lake-level, desert distribution, biogenic-silica burial flux, atmospheric CO2 levels (pCO(2)), and sea-surface-temperature (SST). Their phase relationships, coupled with carbon cycle modeling results, suggest that orbitally-paced summer monsoon dynamics modulates changes in terrestrial weatherability by similar to 20%, affecting changes in pCO(2) of up to 500-1,000 ppmv and 3-7 degrees C SST. We also infer that these similar to 10-Myr scale climatic variations could have been causally linked to biotic turnover, size variations in dinosaur footprints, and tetrapod dispersal, potentially through spatio-temporal variations in resource availability and arid-hot climatic barriers at low-middle latitudes.																			2045-2322					JUL 23	2020	10	1							11984	10.1038/s41598-020-68542-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-68542-w								32704030					WOS:000556694100001
J	BOOTH, DJ				BOOTH, DJ			EFFECT OF WATER TEMPERATURE ON STOMACH EVACUATION RATES, AND ESTIMATION OF DAILY FOOD-INTAKE OF BLUEGILL SUNFISH (LEPOMIS-MACROCHIRUS RAFINESQUE)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Field experiments were conducted over the summer of 1983 to determine food-evacuation rate and measure stomach fullness of bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus). A combination of these data gave estimates of daily food intake of fish. Fish were captured and held in large holding pens in Lake Opinicon, Ontario, Canada, and periodically subsampled over 24 h to monitor changes in mean weight of stomach contents. Stomach-evacuation rates obtained in this way increased significantly with water temperature over the range 10-25.degree. C. However, variation in stomach-evacuation rate was considerable, reducing the utility of water temperature as a predictor of stomach-evacuation rate. It is suggested that the simple field methods employed here to estimation stomach evacuation and food intake are more useful in the estimation of daily ration than the more commonly employed laboratory-based methods.					; Booth, David/A-5783-2010	Booth, David/0000-0002-8256-1412; 													0008-4301	1480-3283				MAR	1990	68	3					591	595		10.1139/z90-084	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z90-084													WOS:A1990CX26800024

The potential growth of the population was also estimated from the pattern and timing of nuclear and cellular division of the alga. The population started to grow when the temperature had risen from 8 to 11-degrees-C. Nuclear division in the vernal Cryptomonas population was well phased and happended solely at night. However, the type of division pattern observed, in which mitosis and cytokinesis overlapped, made it difficult to apply the mitotic index technique for measurements of growth rate in situ. These results emphasise the importance of accurate estimation of the duration of mitosis for this method of determining growth rate in situ.

Recent research works showed microplastic deposition and accumulation in the Himalayan mountains and adjoining ecosystems, rivers and streams. Fine particles of microplastic originating from different anthropogenic sources can travel long distances, even upwards (altitudinally) through atmospheric transport and can pollute remote and pristine locations situated in the Himalayas. Precipitation also plays a vital role in influencing deposition and fall-out of microplastics in the Himalayas. Microplastics can be trapped in the snow in glaciers for a long time and can be released into freshwater rivers by snow melting. Microplastic pollution in Himalayan rivers such as the Ganga, Indus, Brahmaputra, Alaknanda, and Kosi has been researched on both the upper and lower catchments. Additionally, Hima-layan region draws many domestic and international tourists throughout the year, resulting in generation of massive and unmanageable volume of plastics wastes and finally ending up in the open landscapes covering forests, river streams and valley. Fragmentation of these plastic wastes can lead to microplastic formation and accumulation in the Himalayas. This paper discusses and explains occurrence and distribution of microplastics in the Himalayan land-scapes, possible adverse effects of microplastic on local ecosystems and human population and policy intervention needed to mitigate microplastic pollution in the Himalayas. A knowledge gap was noticed regarding the fate of microplastics in the freshwater ecosystems and their control mechanisms in the Indian Himalayas. Regulatory ap-proaches for microplastics management in the Himalayas sit within the broader plastics/solid waste management and can be implemented effectively by following integrated approaches.

The research was carried out in the summer months in 15 mesotrophic lakes and showed a high ecological significance index for Rhodotorula glutinis, Epicoccum nigrum, Fusarium sporotrichioides, and Trichophyton violaceum. Mycoplankton abundance and species diversity decreased with the depth of water, which coincided with a decrease in oxygen content and organic matter concentration. A high concentration of nitrogen compounds (total nitrogen-TN and dissolved nitrogen-DN) limited the development of mycobiota in the hypolimnion. In the metalimnion, the intensive development of organisms, especially bacteria, limited mycoplankton abundance despite perfect physical and chemical conditions for its development. Finally, mycoplankton functioned the best in slightly alkaline waters.

J	Lehman, JT				Lehman, JT			Mixing patterns and plankton biomass of the St. Lawrence Great Lakes under climate change scenarios	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												This study is part of an assessment of potential effects of climate change on the St. Lawrence Great Lakes. Its purpose is to investigate potential future lake mixing patterns and primary production. Nested physical and biological models were applied to seasonal mixed layer depth, heat content, primary productivity, and to algal biomass measured a particulate chlorophyll. Two independent second generation General Circulation Models provided scenarios for future conditions of cloud cover, air temperature, humidity, and winds. The climate variables were used to force heat balance and surface mixed layer models for Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario. Physical models of heat balance and mixed layer dynamics were coupled with a model of primary biological production and growth of phytoplankton. Simulated climate conditions were for time periods centered at 1975, 2030, 2050, and 2090. Climate projections from both GCMs lead to elevated mixed layer and bottom temperatures in all five lakes by as much as 5degreesC during this century. Both GCMs point to longer duration of thermal stratification in the five lakes, stronger stability of stratification, and deeper daily mixing depths during peak thermal stratification. For Lake Erie, no striking differences in algal biomass are likely according to climate projections of either model, but for the other lakes, either the duration of nutrient limitation of algal growth is projected to increase, or light limitation caused by deeper mixing is projected to limit the development of algal biomass.																			0380-1330						2002	28	4					583	596		10.1016/S0380-1330(02)70607-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(02)70607-2													WOS:000180411100008

Various approaches have been employed to address this issue, but their performances were less evaluated via long-term field observations. Using data from three growing cycles, this study investigated the effect of five screening methods (Mth1 to Mth5 for -1 - |epsilon(1)| < beta < -1 + |epsilon(1)|, -1.05 < beta < -0.95, beta < -0.75, -1.3 < beta < -0.75 and beta < -0.7 or beta > 10 or Delta e <= 0, Delta e denotes the measured vapor pressure gradient, and epsilon(1) is a coefficient depending on sensor resolution and Delta e) on winter wheat evapotranspiration in northern China. On diurnal, daily and seasonal basis, the effect was in the order of Mth5 > Mth3 > Mth1 > Mth2 > Mth4, and the seasonal mean daily value of the gap-filled was 0.38, 0.22, 0.11, 0.01, and 0.01 mm d(-1) higher than the unfilled ones, yielding a seasonal total of 96.0, 53.5, 26.0, -0.9, and 0.4 mm, or 18.9 %, 11.4 %, 6.5 %, -0.2 %, and 0.1 % higher than the unfilled ones, respectively. These values resulted from the large difference in data rejection ranking as Mth5 > Mth3 > Mth1 > Mth4 > Mth2, seasonal mean daily 10-min rejection rate ranging from 15.4-73.2 %, 10.3-48.9 %, 5.3-44.9 %, 1.6-10.4 %, and 0.5-7.3 %, respectively (averaging 42.4 %, 30.5 %, 23.2 %, 5.7 %, and 2.6 %, respectively). The corresponding daily rejected hours ranged from 6.83-8.88, 3.60-6.11, 1.85-3.49, 0.10-0.39, and 0.07-0.33 h/day, respectively (averaging 7.53, 4.77, 2.90, 0.28, and 0.24 h/day, respectively), resulting in large data gaps for Mth5 (58.8 %), Mth3 (38.2 %), and Mth1 (17.5 %). Nighttime deletion dominated for Mth2 to Mth4, accounting for 61.1 %, 64.4 %, 68.3 %, and 63.2 % of the total deletion, whereas daytime deletion dominated for Mth1, accounting for 58.1 %. A large portion of invalid rejections of Mth1 (40.4 %-77.6 %), Mth3 (54.3 %-90.9 %) and Mth5 (61.8 %-92.7 %) was observed at the selected period, which was probably a consequence of the sensor's error cancellation effect, questioning the traditional a priori assumption that small vapor gradients within instrumental error should be discarded. Overall, large differences were observed and the simple Mth4 performed better than the more restrictive ones. These findings are expected to guide the selection of post-data processing in the application of BREB method.																			0378-3774	1873-2283				APR 30	2025	311								109379	10.1016/j.agwat.2025.109379	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2025.109379		FEB 2025											WOS:001436047600001

Assessment of the impact of a pathogen, Bonamia ostreae, on Ostrea edulis oyster stocks with different histories of exposure to the parasite in Ireland	AQUACULTURE												The protozoan parasite Bonamia ostreae has decimated Ostrea edulis stocks throughout Europe over the past four decades. A study of two stocks of O. edulis in Ireland with varying periods of exposure to B. ostreae, 5 years and 22 years, was undertaken. The objective of the study was to determine if varying lengths of exposure would translate into observations of differing susceptibilities to B. ostreae. A number of oyster beds within each area were screened. The study was carried out over 13 months to investigate seasonality and the role of environmental parameters, population density and size on disease development. Of particular interest was the fact that prevalence of infection in both stocks was very similar. The stock that had been exposed for 22 years had a similar prevalence, intensity and seasonality of infection as the stock infected for 5 years. B. ostreae was detected in both stocks throughout the year with the highest prevalence in spring, possibly related to the increase in water temperature and/or oysters directing their energy towards gametogenesis. The study indicated that oyster stocks can maintain themselves over extended periods of time in B. ostreae endemic areas. However, prevalence of B. ostreae will remain relatively stable within the stock without some intervention to improve resistance levels e.g. by breeding for resistance over a number of years. Some natural resistance to infection will build up in individual oysters but in natural populations this will continually be diluted by cross fertilisation with more susceptible oysters.

Water Quality and Plankton in the United States Nearshore Waters of Lake Huron	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Our goal in the development of a nearshore monitoring method has been to evaluate and refine an in situ mapping approach to assess the nearshore waters across the Great Lakes. The report here for Lake Huron is part of a broader effort being conducted across all five Great Lakes. We conducted an intensive survey for the United States nearshore of Lake Huron along a continuous shoreline transect (523 km) from Port Huron, Michigan, to Detour Passage. A depth contour of 20 m was towed with a conductivity-temperature depth profiler, fluorometer, transmissometer, and laser optical plankton counter. Multiple cross-contour tows (10-30 m) on the cruise dates were used to characterize the variability across a broader range of the nearshore. The cross-contour tows were comparable with the alongshore contour indicating that the 20-m contour does a good job of representing the nearshore region (10-30 m). Strong correlations were observed between water quality and spatially associated watershed land use. A repeat tow separated by several weeks investigated temporal variability in spatial patterns within a summer season. Strong correlations were observed across each variable for the temporal repeat across broad- and fine-scale spatial dimensions. The survey results for Lake Huron nearshore are briefly compared with a similar nearshore survey in Lake Superior. The biomass concentrations of lower food web components of Lake Huron were notably approximately 54-59 % of those in Lake Superior. The towed instrumentation survey supported the recent view of a change in Lake Huron to an ultra-oligotrophic state, which has been uncharacteristic in recent history.																			0364-152X	1432-1009				OCT	2012	50	4					664	678		10.1007/s00267-012-9902-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-012-9902-x								22824959					WOS:000308652800013

Acid Neutralization Capacity (ANC) was logarithmically correlated (p<0.05) to antecedent discharge in eight of the nine streams, with the largest decline in ANC occurring after low antecedent flow. In eight of the nine streams SO42- was the most important driving mechanism of ANC decline, but dilution as well as organic acidity was important in several streams. No decrease in the SO42- driven ANC decline was observed over the 20 year study period despite a similar to40% reduction in SO42- deposition. The strong correlation between ANC decline and low antecedent discharge demonstrates that episodic acidification during rain events is strongly associated with preceding drought conditions, especially in wetland-dominated catchments. The results have important implications for recovery from acidification, especially in northern ecosystems where climate scenarios forecast that warmer and drier conditions will be more common.

Lake Sediments Record Prehistoric Lead Pollution Related to Early Copper Production in North America	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The mining and use of copper by perhistoric people on Michigan's Keweenaw Peninsula is one of the oldest examples of metalworking. We analyzed the concentraon of lead, titanium, magnesium, iron, and organic matter in sediment cores recovered from three lakes located near mine pits to investigate the timing, location, and magnitude of ancient copper mining pollution. Lead concentration were normalized to lithogenic metals and organic matter to account for process than can infulence natural (or background) lead delivery. Nearly simulataneous lead enrichments occured at Lake Manganese and Copper Falls Lake similar to 8000 and 7000 years before present (yr BP), indicating the copper extraction occured concurrently in at least two locations on the peninsula. The poor temporal coherence among the lead enrichments similar to 6300 to 5000 yr BP at each lake suggests that the focus of copper mining and annealing shifted through time. In sediment younger than similar to 5000 yr BP, lead concentraions remain at background levels at all three lakes, excluding historic lead increases starting similar to 150 yr BP.

The energy for polymerisation of amino acids from pore fluids could have come from the radioactive accessories monazite, zircon and xenotime: these minerals have recently been shown to have polymerised hydrocarbons in a wide range of Phanerozoic sandstones and would have been more highly radioactive in the Early Archaean. The most favourable intervals in the sequences for the synthesis and development of proteinoid bodies were probably those where seasonally falling water tables caused concentration of the polymers, and their adsorption on clay layers. If microorganisms formed by the replication of the proteinoid bodies in the proposed environment, they would have been protected against ultraviolet radiation and shielded against extraterrestrial bombardment, thus having significant advantages over life-forms originating on the surface. The microorganisms may have emerged unsuccessfully many times into shallow seas and coastal lakes before becoming permanently established outside their original milieu. The model assumes a primitive atmosphere within the general range of strongly reducing to weakly reducing compositions suggested in the literature. It is unlikely that life could develop in similar environments at present because of the oxidised atmosphere and competition from relatively sophisticated microorganisms. The evidence for microbial remains is probably best sought in the authigenic siliceous cement of Archaean sandstones.																			0301-9268					APR	1992	56	1-2					159	166		10.1016/0301-9268(92)90089-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0301-9268(92)90089-7													WOS:A1992HN00200009
J	Fortier, D; Allard, M				Fortier, D; Allard, M			Late Holocene syngenetic ice-wedge polygons development, Bylot Island, Canadian Arctic Archipelago	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												The initial configuration of the syngenetic ice-wedge polygons that developed in the outwash plain of glacier C-79 after 6000 BP was modified by the accumulation of wind-blown and organic sediments that began after 3670 +/- 110 BP. The late Holocene sedimentation led to an increase in the thermal contraction coefficient of the soil and the formation of third- and fourth-order contraction cracks, partially explaining the current configuration of the polygonal network. The upturning of the sedimentary strata bordering the ice wedges was associated with the summer thermal expansion and resulting internal creep of the soil. The mean annual soil displacement coefficient was in the order of 2.5-2.7 x 10(-5)/degreesC at the thousand-year scale. The late Holocene sedimentary strata under the centre of the polygons were undisturbed, which will make it possible to use this sedimentary record in further studies to attempt paleoenvironmental reconstructions from cores.

J	EINSLE, U				EINSLE, U			CYCLOPS-KIKUCHII SMIRNOV, 1932 (COPEPODA, CYCLOPOIDA), A SEPARATE SPECIES FROM SOUTHERN GERMAN WATERS	CRUSTACEANA												The hitherto existing subspecies Cyclops vicinus kikuchii Smirnov, 1932 was originally described by materials from Japan; later it was found in Russia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia. Compared with Cyclops vicinus Uljanin, 1875 the subspecies is characterized mainly by the short inner furcal seta (no. 1) in proportion to furcal and body length. According to Wierzbicka (1934) both types could interbreed to produce fertile offspring. Materials collected in an old reservoir, the ''Neuweiher'' near Meersburg (Lake Constance), and further in Lake Seeg and in the ''Schwaltenweiher'' (southern Bavaria), allowed morphological and morphometrical studies (fig. 1, tab. I), completed by comparative chromatin diminution and enzyme electrophoresis. The morphological studies (tab. I) confirmed the differences in length of the inner furcal seta compared with C. vicinus. The only five specimens from Lake Seeg at least indicate the probability of a seasonal variation. The course of chromatin diminution (fig. 2) appears identical in qualitative aspects for both cyclopids. In the enzyme electrophoresis remarkable differences were found in GOT (glutamate oxaloacetate transferase), APK (arginine phosphokinase) and PGM (phosphoglucomutase) (fig. 3). Together with the morphological details and the sympatric occurrence with C. vicinus in Lake Seeg and in the ''Schwaltenweiher'', these results confirm the separate status of the species Cyclops kikuchii Smirnov, 1932. This species passes its diapause during summer in the fifth copepodid instar, while C. vicinus aestivates in the fourth instar.																			0011-216X					MAR	1994	66		2				240	246		10.1163/156854094X00729	http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/156854094X00729													WOS:A1994NF55100011

The quantitative importance of mineralization of terrestrial organic carbon in lakes in relation to terrestrial carbon fluxes is poorly understood and a serious drawback for the understanding of carbon budgets. We studied a subarctic lake in an area of discontinuous permafrost to assess the quantitative importance of lake carbon emission for the catchment carbon balance. Estimates of net ecosystem production and stable carbon-isotope composition of dissolved organic carbon in the lake water suggest substantial input and respiration of terrestrial organic carbon in the lake. The lake was a net source of CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere at ice breakup in spring and during the whole ice-free period. The carbon emission from the lake was similar in magnitude to the terrestrial net release of carbon to the atmosphere. The results indicate that lakes are important sources of catchment carbon emission, potentially increasing the positive feedback from permafrost thawing on global warming.					; Crill, Patrick/ABC-1357-2021; Hammarlund, Dan/B-9698-2008	Hammarlund, Dan/0000-0001-7147-8173; Christensen, Torben R./0000-0002-4917-148X; Forster, Johannes/0000-0003-0174-926X; Crill, Patrick/0000-0003-1110-3059													2169-8953	2169-8961				JUL 16	2010	115								G03006	10.1029/2010JG001305	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2010JG001305													WOS:000280047700007

Their presence in the Azores, a volcanic archipelago of nine islands in the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean, has already been reported. However, due to the high diversity of cyanobacteria habitats, their biodiversity is still understudied, mainly in extreme environments. To address this, a total of 156 cyanobacteria strains from Azores lakes, streams, thermal and terrestrial habitats were isolated. Identification was made based on a polyphasic approach using classical taxonomy (morphological characteristics and environmental data) and phylogeny among 81 strains assessed by maximum likelihood and Bayesian analysis of 16S rDNA partial sequences. The 156 isolates showed a high genera diversity (38) belonging to the orders Chroococcales, Nostocales, Oscillatoriales, and Synechococcales. Eleven new genera for the Azores habitats are here reported, reinforcing that cyanobacteria biodiversity in these islands is still much understudied. Phylogenetic analysis showed 14 clusters associated with these cyanobacteria orders, with evidence for six new genera and valuable information towardsMicrochaete/Coleospermumtaxonomic revision that better reflects species environmental distribution. These results emphasize the need for cyanobacteria taxonomy revisions, through polyphasic studies, mainly in Synechococcales order and in theMicrochaete/Coleospermum,Nostoc, andAnabaenagenera.

Interannual variations and future change of wintertime extratropical cyclone activity over North America in CCSM3	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												Climatology and interannual variations of wintertime extratropical cyclone frequency in CCSM3 twentieth century simulation are compared with the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis during 1950-1999. CCSM3 can simulate the storm tracks reasonably well, although the model produces slightly less cyclones at the beginning of the Pacific and Atlantic storm tracks and weaker poleward deflection over the Pacific. As in the reanalysis, frequency of cyclones stronger than 980 hPa shows significant correlation with the Pacific/North America (PNA) teleconnection pattern over the Pacific region and with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) in the Atlantic sector. Composite maps are constructed for opposite phases of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the NAO and all anomalous patterns coincide with observed. One CCSM3 twenty-first century A1B scenario realization indicates there is significant increase in the extratropical cyclone frequency on the US west coast and decrease in Alaska. Meanwhile, cyclone frequency increases from the Great Lakes region to Quebec and decreases over the US east coast, suggesting a possible northward shift of the Atlantic storm tracks under the warmer climate. The cyclone frequency anomalies are closely linked to changes in seasonal mean states of the upper-troposphere zonal wind and baroclinicity in the lower troposphere. Due to lack of 6-hourly outputs, we cannot apply the cyclone-tracking algorithm to the other eight CCSM3 realizations. Based on the linkage between the mean state change and the cyclone frequency anomalies, it is likely a common feature among the other ensemble members that cyclone activity is reduced on the East Coast and in Alaska as a result of global warming.																			0930-7575	1432-0894				JUN	2008	30	7-8					673	686		10.1007/s00382-007-0314-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-007-0314-1													WOS:000255090500001

However, only a limited number of studies have been conducted in relatively few habitat types. To evaluate large-bodied fish assemblage structure of floodplain creeks, we used experimental gill nets to sample fishes at sites spaced at even intervals within three creeks in consecutive dry seasons. A total of 60 species were collected, 41 of which were collected both years. The most frequently collected species were piscivores and algivores/detritivores. Multivariate analysis suggested non-random patterns of assemblage structure in both years. Correspondence analysis (CA) of the species abundance-by-site matrix for 2001 suggests species assemblages were most similar among sites within the same creek regardless of depth or longitudinal position. Discriminant function analysis (DFA) correctly predicted 100% of samples based on creek identity, and species ordination scores revealed creek-specific species subsets. In 2002, CA and DFA did not distinguish creeks based on species assemblages. Instead, we observed a significant positive relationship between assemblage composition and site depth and position along the creek longitudinal gradient. Assemblages were most similar among sites of comparable depth and longitudinal position, regardless of creek identity. Predators occurred almost exclusively at mouth and mid-reach sites. Flood duration prior to our 2002 sampling period was prolonged due to abnormally heavy rainfall in November and December 2001 (typically the falling-water period), and may account for the observed inter-annual variation in fish assemblage structure.					; Hoeinghaus, David/A-3190-2008	Winemiller, Kirk/0000-0003-0236-5129; Hoeinghaus, David/0000-0003-0363-8723; Arrington, Donald/0000-0002-1138-2580													0378-1909	1573-5133				AUG	2003	67	4					379	387		10.1023/A:1025818721158	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1025818721158													WOS:000185494400008

Both numerically and gravimetrically, fish stomach contents revealed that feeding started some time after sunset, peaked towards midnight, and virtually ceased after sunrise. Benthic invertebrates were consumed almost exclusively, with ephemeropterans, trichopterans, and dipterans constituting 95% of the total foods eaten, a major proportion being chironomid larvae. Size of prey eaten compared with size of invertebrates in the benthos differed signficantly during the night; this indicated that some size-selective feeding occurred. The benthic feeding habit of Galaxias brevipinnis appears to allow it to forage on relatively small prey during the night, a phenomenon that has been reported for other bottom-dwelling native fish species in New Zealand.																			0067-1940						1989	40	3					231	240																WOS:A1989AD19700001

Bacteria growing in oil refinery effluents, tannery dumpsite soils, car wash effluents, salt pans and hot springs were screened for microcystin-LR biodegradation potentials. Using a colorimetric BIOLOG MT2 assay; Arthrobacter sp. B105, Arthrobacter junii, Plantibacter sp. PDD-56b-14, Acinetobacter sp. DUT-2, Salinivibrio sp. YH4, Bacillus sp., Bacillus thuringiensis and Lysinibacillus boronitolerans could grow in the presence of microcystin-LR at 1, 10 and 100 mu g L-1. Most bacteria grew optimally at 10 mu g L-1 microcystin-LR under alkaline pH (8 and 9). The ability of these bacteria to use MC-LR as a growth substrate depicts their ability to metabolize the toxin, which is equivalent to its degradation. Through PCR screening, these bacteria were shown to lack the mlr genes implying possible use of a unique microcystin-LR degradation pathway. The study highlights the wide environmental and taxonomic distribution of microcystin-LR degraders.

The majority of Creek rivers are moderately polluted and only a few of them show significant human impact and an increase in pollutant concentrations over time. Due to droughts in recent years and anthropogenic influence, the mean annual riverine dissolved solid concentrations exhibit a general interannual increase and significant long-term variations in their intra-annual hydrochemical fluctuations. The shallow Creek lakes are eutrophic, while the deep ones are oligo-mesotrophic. The majority of the lakes are monomictic and show summer thermal stratification, while the shallow ones are characterized by anoxic hypolimnetic conditions. Catchment petrography is not a dominant factor in the composition of lake waters since biochemical processes prevail. The majority of Greek lakes are also moderately polluted and are characterized by phosphorous-limited photosynthesis.					; Skoulikidis, Nikolaos/G-9209-2011	Skoulikidis, Nikolaos/0000-0002-3527-4883; 													0943-0105					NOV	1998	36	1-2					1	17		10.1007/s002540050315	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002540050315													WOS:000077500000001

The fat content of eggs was at its highest in July and that of muscle in August during the optimal feeding season. Significant differences were not found in fat content between lakes Suvasvesi and Southern-Kallavesi in central Finland. There were no essential differences in fatty acid composition between muscle, liver and eggs of Lake Suvasvesi vendace. During the last month before spawning in October the gross energy and fat contents of eggs decreased in Lake Suvasvesi vendace. The fat and vitamin C contents of muscle as well as the liver index of females decreased during this time also. In males the corresponding decrease did not occur, indicating that spawning is a greater stress for females than for males. The egg quality and condition of Lake Inarijarvi vendace were about the same as those of Lake Suvasvesi vendace. The unfavourable conditions of Lake Inarijarvi, located in northern Finland, are reflected in the size of ovaries, which is known to be smaller (gonadosomatic index < 20%) than in Lake Suvasvesi (GSI 26-27%). Vendace, then, maintain the quality of eggs at the expense of their number.																			0018-8158					FEB 15	1991	209	3					175	182		10.1007/BF00015340	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00015340													WOS:A1991FA88800001

In normal years, water temperatures are believed to have exceeded 60 F (15.6 C) during this period. This species died when exposed for extended periods to water temperatures of 55 F(12.8 C) and below, although it survived for short periods with temperatures in the 40''s. A stocking of 58 tilapias weighing 1.6 lb/acre increased to 11,000 fish weighing 387 lb/acre when placed in a pond by themselves and left for a single growing season (May-Oct.). When varying numbers of largemouth bass were added, the tilapia population lost ground with 826 bass/acre, increased to a limited extent with 91 bass/acre, and expanded 132 times with 37 bass/acre. Predator-prey relationships were probably influenced by the relative abundance of crayfish and tadpoles in the pond. When more than 1000 tilapias/acre were present, they were able to eliminate algae and rooted submersed aquatic plants during 1962 and 1965. Vegetation density was only moderately affected during 1964 when about 164 tilapias/acre were present. Tilapias by themselves would be useful in artificial lakes and ponds where aquatic vegetation problems are common, aesthetic values are of-primary importance, and summer water temperatures are suitable.																			0022-541X	1937-2817					1967	31	3					401	+		10.2307/3798115	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3798115													WOS:A19679672900001

Lake Gosiute was a large body of water surrounded by subtropical forest, the lake being part of a lacustrine complex that occupied the Green River Basin. Lake level rises episodically drowned the adjacent forests, causing standing trees and fallen branches to become growth sites for algae and cyanobacteria, which encased submerged wood with thick calcareous stromatolitic coatings. The subsequent regression resulted in a desiccation of the wood, causing volume reduction, radial fractures, and localized decay. The subsequent burial of the wood in silty sediment led to a silicification of the cellular tissue. Later, chalcedony was deposited in larger spaces, as well as in the interstitial areas of the calcareous coatings. The final stage of mineralization was the precipitation of crystalline calcite in spaces that had previously remained unmineralized. The result of this multi-stage mineralization is fossil wood with striking beauty and a complex geologic origin.

Organic proxies based on GDGTs (e.g. TEX86, MBT/CBT and BIT) have made impressive applications in the open ocean and terrestrial environments. However, the applicability of these proxies in marginal seas has not been thoroughly evaluated, which is necessary given the complexity and dynamics of these systems, such as organic matter (OM) flux, hydrodynamic conditions, and human impact. This review aims to summarize recent studies of GDGTs and GDGT-based proxies in the Chinese marginal seas (CMS), which are characterized by diverse gradient in terrigenous supplies and ocean productivity and hold rich information on climate and sea level changes, ocean current dynamics, sedimentary evolution and biogeochemical processes.

Among the species, Ilyocypris getica was reported in Turkey for the first time; while Stenocypria fischeri was found for the second time in the country in 55 years. The most abundant species, Limnocythere inopinata, was collected in dry and wet months, while I. bradyi was the only species found in only the wet months. The 9 species clustered into 3 groups based on their ecological preference. Species composition and occurrences were closely related to the lake water level fluctuation, from 7 to 13 m within a year. These fluctuations played a significant role in changes in the physicochemical characteristics of the lake, along with ostracod species composition (P < 0.01). A strong negative correlation (P < 0.05) between precipitation and both ambient temperature and SO4 was also interpreted as the outcome of such fluctuations. The number of species corresponded with salinity changes. Most of the ostracod species appearing in Lake Sunnet were tolerant to the large water level fluctuation. These results correspond with the idea of 'pseudorichness,' when species composition is dominated by cosmopolitans over noncosmopolitans, an indication of low water quality in a lake. Changes in the lake have been accelerated by anthropogenic activities such as water diversions for chicken farms and agricultural fields during dry climatic conditions. The occurrence of these activities appears to have produced seasonal differences in the lake's water quality and species composition.

If top-down regulation were important, we expected mosquitofish predation to reduce zooplankton abundance, which would indirectly benefit phytoplankton. If bottom-up regulation were important, we expected nutrient addition to increase both primary producers and zooplankton. Western Mosquitofish predation significantly decreased the abundance of several zooplankton taxa, resulting in a trophic cascade with increased chlorophylla(i.e., primary productivity). This effect did not differ between mesocosms with 5 or 10 fish. Nutrient addition had no significant effects on zooplankton; however, chlorophyllawas positively affected by both nitrogen addition and phosphorus addition. Our results suggest weak bottom-up regulation in our experimental community, but strong top-down regulation, emphasizing the potential consequences of introducing non-native Western Mosquitofish to native aquatic ecosystems.																			0944-1344	1614-7499				FEB	2021	28	5					5845	5853		10.1007/s11356-020-10933-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-10933-7		SEP 2020						32975750					WOS:000572712700007

Its modern construction, based on the shape of a DN ice boat, makes it unique in Poland, and probably in the world as well. This novel and dynamic shape became a significant landmark associated not only with Mikolajki, but also with the whole region of Mazury, as well as with sailing itself. The system of footbridge illumination is innovative within Europe. With a blaze of lights, it not only emphasizes the bridge shape but also introduces interesting changes into the appearance of the surroundings. The bridge carrying structure is a two-span cable-stayed system suspended on a single pylon. Since on the one hand the city enjoys large numbers of tourist visitors, and on the other hand sailing had to be kept largely uninterrupted, steel as the principal material and a relevant construction technology had to be applied. The load tests performed gave positive confirmation of the bridge's safety.

Total particle number (TPN), total particle volume (TPV) and particle-size distribution were determined on 3 dates in summer. In the oligo-mesohumic lake the TPN values were .apprx. 5-fold the phytoplankton cell numbers (PCN), but in the polyhumic lakes the TPN/PCN ratio varied greatly between samples. The correlation between TPV and phytoplankton total volume (PTV) was significant in the polyhumic lakes, though not in the oligo-mesohumic one. The mean PTV was .apprx. 60% of TPV in the polyhumic lakes, and 40% in the oligo-mesohumic lake. The general agreement of electronic particle counting with microscopic determinations was rather poor.

Importance of Local and Regional Scales in Shaping Mycobacterial Abundance in Freshwater Lakes	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Biogeographical studies considering the entire bacterial community may underestimate mechanisms of bacterial assemblages at lower taxonomic levels. In this context, the study aimed to identify factors affecting the spatial and temporal dynamic of the Mycobacterium, a genus widespread in aquatic ecosystems. Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) density variations were quantified in the water column of freshwater lakes at the regional scale (annual monitoring of 49 lakes in the Paris area) and at the local scale (2-year monthly monitoring in Creteil Lake) by real-time quantitative PCR targeting the atpE gene. At the regional scale, mycobacteria densities in water samples ranged from 6.7 x 10(3) to 1.9 x 10(8) genome units per liter. Density variations were primarily explained by water pH, labile iron, and dispersal processes through the connection of the lakes to a river. In Creteil Lake, no spatial variation of mycobacterial densities was noticed over the 2-year monthly survey, except after large rainfall events. Indeed, storm sewer effluents locally and temporarily increased NTM densities in the water column. The temporal dynamic of the NTM densities in Creteil Lake was associated with suspended solid concentrations. No clear seasonal variation was noticed despite a shift in NTM densities observed over the 2012-2013 winter. Temporal NTM densities fluctuations were well predicted by the neutral community model, suggesting a random balance between loss and gain of mycobacterial taxa within Creteil Lake. This study highlights the importance of considering multiple spatial scales for understanding the spatio-temporal dynamic of bacterial populations in natural environments.					; Catherine, Arnaud/A-1305-2009; Vinçon-Leite, Brigitte/Y-1396-2019; Lucas, Françoise/AFV-1135-2022; VARRAULT, Gilles/LIC-2640-2024	Vincon Leite, Brigitte/0000-0002-0190-0209; Roguet, Adelaide/0000-0003-3688-4525; Moulin, Laurent/0000-0001-5162-7215; Bressy, Adele/0000-0001-9951-2572; Lemaire, Bruno J./0000-0002-0227-0106; VARRAULT, Gilles/0000-0001-6705-2217													0095-3628	1432-184X				MAY	2018	75	4					834	846		10.1007/s00248-017-1088-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-017-1088-6								29063147					WOS:000430393400003

As a consequence of a severe drought and the need to optimize water quality, a partial drawdown was prescribed in autumn 2005 to a eutrophic reservoir that provides water supply to a large metropolitan area (Barcelona, Spain). In order to avoid a potential massive fish kill given the reduced oxygen availability and high fish abundance, preventive purse seine fisheries were performed to reduce the fish stock. The fisheries had little effect on the fish assemblage because final population size structure and species composition did not change significantly. The species composition of the purse seine catches varied significantly during the drawdown with higher proportion of bleak (Alburnus alburnus) in pelagic water during the days of worst water quality, confirming that bleak is more tolerant than roach (Rutilus rutilus) to poor water quality and a potential good indicator of water pollution. The weight-length relationship (i.e. condition) of roach and bleak also varied significantly during the drawdown following the same tendency in both species, losing and recovering their weight (4.99% in roach and 5.96% in bleak) in only 16 days. The close relationship found between water quality and fish condition demonstrates that fish condition can be a good metric of the well being of fish, even for extreme short-term changes.

We also report the first data from AESOP (Anti Electron Sub Orbital Payload), a magnet spectrometer using a ring-dipole permanent magnet and digital optical spark. chambers. AESOP flew in a preliminary configuration from Lynn Lake, Canada during the summer of 1994. In this configuration the useful energy range is limited to a narrow band around 1.5 GeV, where we measured an abundance of positrons, relative to all electrons, of 0.32 +/- 0.18. A consistent picture of the positron abundance and its time variation may be emerging from the world data set.																			0004-637X					JUN 10	1996	464	1	1				507	515		10.1086/177340	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/177340													WOS:A1996UN84000047

Our review suggested that warming enhanced net primary production and soil respiration, decreased methane (CH4) emissions from wetlands and increased CH4 consumption of meadows, but might increase CH4 emissions from lakes. Warming-induced permafrost thawing and glaciers melting would also result in substantial emission of old carbon dioxide (CO2) and CH4. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emission was not stimulated by warming itself, but might be slightly enhanced by wetting. However, there are many uncertainties in such biogeochemical cycles under climate change. Human activities (e.g. grazing, land cover changes) further modified the biogeochemical cycles and amplified such uncertainties on the plateau. If the projected warming and wetting continues, the future biogeochemical cycles will be more complicated. So facing research in this field is an ongoing challenge of integrating field observations with process-based ecosystem models to predict the impacts of future climate change and human activities at various temporal and spatial scales. To reduce the uncertainties and to improve the precision of the predictions of the impacts of climate change and human activities on biogeochemical cycles, efforts should focus on conducting more field observation studies, integrating data within improved models, and developing new knowledge about coupling among carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus biogeochemical cycles as well as about the role of microbes in these cycles.

Increased methyl mercury release was observed when tryptic soy broth (TSB) was added to sediments at 0.06 or 0.25 g/dm3, and marked increases when TSB was added to the water flow at 35 mg/l, suggesting an effect at the sediment-water interface.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1982	39	11					1459	1466		10.1139/f82-197	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f82-197													WOS:A1982PN82500004

An evaluation of statistical methods for estimating abundances of migrating adult sea lamprey	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We evaluated statistical methods for estimating abundances of adult sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) migrating in Great Lakes tributaries. The sea lamprey is the target of a basin-wide, bi-national control program. Abundance estimates from mark-recapture data are used to evaluate program success and the efficiency of sea lamprey trapping. Recent tracking studies suggested the mark-recapture estimates of abundance could be biased. We compared four estimators of abundance using stratified (weekly) mark-recapture data for 19 years of trapping in the St. Marys River. Abundances from the pooled Petersen estimator were similar to abundances from the stratified Schaefer and stratified Petersen estimators, but substantially lower than abundances from a stratified Bayesian P-spline estimator. In simulations of virtual populations, pooled Petersen and Bayesian P-spline estimates were similar across a range of conditions where catchability differed between marked and unmarked lamprey and changed over the trapping season, with one exception. Abundances from the Bayesian P-spline estimator were strongly positively biased when catchability of marked lamprey increased over the season, while catchability of unmarked lamprey did not. Estimates from both estimators were negatively biased when lamprey displayed consistent individual differences in catchability and positively biased when a proportion of marked lamprey fell back. Discrepancies between mark-recapture and tracking studies cannot be reconciled by the choice of abundance estimator, but could be an outcome of bias due to individual differences in catchability. Sea lamprey managers could also switch from the stratified Schaefer to the pooled Petersen estimator to simplify field operations without losing accuracy and precision.

RECREATIONAL VISITATION AND SPENDING PATTERNS ON LAKE IMPOUNDMENTS IN EAST-CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI	GLOBAL CHANGE AND FORESTRY: ECONOMIC AND POLICY IMPACTS AND RESPONSES	Climate Change and its Causes Effects and Prediction											The southeastern United States is uniquely positioned to offer its residents and visitors a variety of recreational opportunities year-round. A favorable climate and an abundance of natural and impoundment water acreage provide long seasons for the region's anglers, boaters, campers, and other recreationists. Natural amenities such as water bodies and warm climates have been shown to stimulate economic growth in rural locations and provide substantial quality of life improvements to residents. While economic injections provided by surface water impoundments have been frequently studied, relatively little research has been conducted assessing how visitation patterns to such facilities vary by season. In this chapter, we discussed results of two on-site surveys carried out at lakes in east-central Mississippi. One survey was conducted at the peak of the recreation season and the other during the fall. Differences were analyzed along four dimensions: length of stay, party size, travel time, and local expenditures. Our findings indicated that significant seasonal variation existed for most visitor types across these dimensions. Since total new visitor spending in the local economy varied by length of stay, party size, and travel time, these results have important implications for the potential economic stimulus of water-based recreational facilities in the South.																					978-1-60876-262-0				2010							291	300																WOS:000281447700021

The most effective mesh size was 12.7-mm, capturing 3,035 alewives. The modal length of alewives caught in each mesh size increased as the mesh size increased from 9.5 to 25.4 mm. No alewives less than 70 mm total length or greater than 245 mm were captured. Modal lengths of selectivity curves estimated indirectly using the Holt model were 85, 114, 143, 172, and 228 mm for the 9.5-, 12.7-, 15.9-, 19.1-, and 25.4-mm mesh sizes, respectively. Adding a 22.3-mm mesh and removing the 31.8-mm mesh is suggested to sample landlocked alewives between 100 and 245 mm in Connecticut lakes.

Mass migration in hydrological processes usually causes the Earth's gravity response, wherefore the 2020 flood events provide a good opportunity to assess the capabilities of gravity measurements in capturing the water mass changes at different scales. In this study, we presents two common gravity measurements (i.e., the satellite mission GRACE-FO and the ground gPhone) used to characterize the evolution of regional floods at a basin- and local- scale, which can be attributed to East Asian rainy season (commonly called "plum rain") event, i.e., extreme climate-induced effects of the regional water balance, and floodwater absorbed by the reservoir, i.e., the man-made Three Gorges Dam (TGD) intercepting flood peaks. The terrestrial water storage (TWS) estimated by GRACE-FO shows a significant positive anomaly (e.g., similar to 370 mm in July and August) in around the TGR. The gPhone measured gravity residual of 10-20 mu gal between May and September. The results further suggest that GRACE observation does not have obvious advantages in small-scale TWS monitoring, but gPhone records is difficult to detect the source of the TWS mass change 50 km away. In particular, gPhone recorded the high-frequency gravity disturbance directly related to the high outflow (i.e., >31,000 m(3)/s) of TGD flood discharge, which is likely used as precursor or coseismic signal to further study the activity of surface landslide and underground faults induced by the vibration or noise source of the water body. This study shows that the combination of multiscale gravity solutions can potentially detect a wide range of extreme climate events triggered by atmospheric circulation patterns, like El Nino Southern Oscillation and Indian Ocean basin warming accompanied by Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and wind anomalies.

Reconstructing the Environmental Context of Human Origins in Eastern Africa Through Scientific Drilling	ANNUAL REVIEW OF EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCES												Paleoanthropologists have long speculated about the role of environmental change in shaping human evolution in Africa. In recent years, drill cores of late Neogene lacustrine sedimentary rocks have yielded valuable high-resolution records of climatic and ecosystem change. Eastern African Rift sediments (primarily lake beds) provide an extraordinary range of data in close proximity to important fossil hominin and archaeological sites, allowing critical study of hypotheses that connect environmental history and hominin evolution. We review recent drill-core studies spanning the Plio-Pleistocene boundary (an interval of hominin diversification, including the earliest members of our genus Homo and the oldest stone tools), and the Mid-Upper Pleistocene (spanning the origin of Homo sapiens in Africa and our early technological and dispersal history). Proposed drilling of Africa's oldest lakes promises to extend such records back to the late Miocene. High-resolution paleoenvironmental records are critical for understanding external drivers of human evolution. African lake basin drill cores play a critical role in enhancing hominin paleoenvironmental records given their continuity and proximity to key paleoanthropological sites. The oldest African lakes have the potential to reveal a comprehensive paleoenvironmental context for the entire late Neogene history of hominin evolution.

The allelopathic capacity of submerged macrophytes shapes the microalgal assemblages from a recently restored coastal wetland	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												We have tested the efficiency of isolated and combined submerged macrophyte cultures to inhibit, through allelopathy, the natural phytoplankton growth. Both plants and microalgae come from the same wetland, a recently restored area in Albufera de Valencia Natural Park (Spain). The need to replant the area under restoration with submerged macrophytes makes this information essential for wetland management. The selection and culture of the submerged macrophytes used in that restoration (four charophytes: Chara hispida, Chara vulgaris, Chara baltica, Nitella hyalina, and one angiosperm: Myriophyllum spicatum) provided a good opportunity to test in the laboratory the allelopathic effect of macrophyte assemblages on environmental phytoplankton communities. Three experiments were carried out using spring communities: in Experiment 1, a diverse phytoplankton assemblage (29% of biomass Chlorophyceae, 26% Cryptophyceae, 19% diatoms and 9% cyanobacteria) was cultivated with exudates from monocultures of C. hispida, N. hyalina and M. spicatum. Experiment 2 proved the allelopathic effect of a macrophyte assemblage exudate (C. hispida, C. baltica, C. vulgaris, N. hyalina and M. spicatum in a mixed culture) on two different phytoplankton communities (one diverse: 53% biomass of diatoms, 27% cyanobacteria, 18% chlorophytes and another dominated by small chlorophytes). The response variables were Chl a concentration, phytoplankton biovolume and main algal groups' biovolumes. When phytoplankton grew in water with exudates from monocultures, microalgal biomass was from 4 to 6 times lower than in the control after 5 days and Chl a concentration was up to 4 times lower. The inhibitory effect of C. hispida was greater than that of M. spicatum. Mixed macrophyte assemblages resulted in even stronger allelopathic effects than monocultured macrophytes; the biomass was reduced by 7 fold after 5 days using the mixed exudates and Chl a concentration was between 3 and 5 times lower. The experiments demonstrate that macrophytes are particularly effective in inhibiting the growth of both small diatoms and the least desirable phytoplankton component in these wetlands (filamentous cyanobacteria), but not chlorophytes (reduction by 37-69, 7-14 and 1-7 fold for diatoms, cyanobacteria and chlorophytes, respectively). The predictions are that spring macrophytes might enhance microalgae that are suitable for grazing (mostly small chlorophytes) and will decrease non-edible filamentous taxa. Thus, restoration managers should replant with the mixture of submerged native macrophytes that provide the most harmful allelopathic effects to promote benefits on aquatic communities in two synergistic ways: by directly reducing microalgal biomass and by indirectly enhancing grazing, which in turn, would promote a clear-water phase. We present replanted macrophytes as ecosystem engineers, i.e. organisms that directly or indirectly modulate the availability of resources for the wetland food webs, by causing changes in primary producer assemblages.

Phosphatase activity was detected directly at the site of enzyme action using the enzyme-labelled fluorescence (ELF) technique. Size fractionation of bulk phosphatase activity (PA), concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), chlorophyll a, and phytoplankton composition were determined in parallel. Phosphatase-positive cells were present in every phytoplankton sample; labelled cells were detected in 33 algal taxa, including many chlorophytes, dinoflagellates and some diatoms, but never among cyanobacteria. We recorded an unusual dinoflagellate bloom (Peridiniopsis sp.), of which similar to 25% of the cells were phosphatase-positive. Several populations were partly phosphatase-positive whenever present, while some other species never showed any activity. The production of extracellular phosphatases was not primarily regulated by ambient P concentrations; algae produced these enzymes even if SRP concentrations were high. Moreover, heterotrophic nanoflagellates most probably contributed to the pool of particle-bound PA in some samples.					; Kozlíková, Eliška/AAD-8558-2021; Vrba, Jaroslav/M-3780-2013; Sevcu, Alena/I-7917-2019; Znachor, Petr/F-8901-2014	Kozlikova, Eliska/0000-0002-2019-5314; Vrba, Jaroslav/0000-0003-2145-9024; Sevcu, Alena/0000-0001-8772-704X; 													0967-0262	1469-4433				AUG	2005	40	3					251	258		10.1080/09670260500192760	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09670260500192760													WOS:000232831200002

Magnitude and Drivers of Oxic Methane Production in Small Temperate Lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Methanogenesis is traditionally considered as a strictly anaerobic process. Recent evidence suggests instead that the ubiquitous methane (CH4) oversaturation found in freshwater lakes is sustained, at least partially, by methanogenesis in oxic conditions. Although this paradigm shift is rapidly gaining acceptance, the magnitude and regulation of oxic CH4 production (OMP) have remained ambiguous. Based on the summer CH4 mass balance in the surface mixed layer (SML) of five small temperate lakes (surface area, SA, of 0.008-0.44 km(2)), we show that OMP (range of 0.01 +/- 0.01 to 0.52 +/- 0.04 mu mol L-1 day(-1)) is linked to the concentrations of chlorophyll-a, total phosphorus, and dissolved organic carbon. The stable carbon isotopic mass balance of CH4 (delta C-13-CH4) indicates direct photoautotrophic release as the most likely source of oxic CH4. Furthermore, we show that the oxic CH4 contribution to the SML CH4 saturation and emission is an inverse function of the ratio of the sediment area to the SML volume in lakes as small as 0.06 km(2). Given that global lake CH4 emissions are dominated by small lakes (SA of <1 km(2)), the large contribution of oxic CH4 production (up to 76%) observed in this study suggests that OMP can contribute significantly to global CH4 emissions.

Mapping of Water Resistivity Using Pool Water	MOSCOW UNIVERSITY GEOLOGY BULLETIN												The relationship between the resistivity (conductivity) of soil and that of pore water was stated in papers by G.E. Archie and V.N. Dakhnov. This means that water resistivity should be studied at each fieldwork area. In some areas, however, the access to groundwater (boreholes, wells, and springs) as well as to the surface reservoirs (rivers, brooks, ponds, and lakes) is not possible or is restricted. Can we measure water resistivity in pools? Immediately after a rain such water has no relationship with soil resistivity. The purpose of this work was to study the pattern of ion exchange between soil and rain water over time. In (Brunet et al., 2010) the changes in resistivity of water in contact with soil over time were measured. We have verified their results.																			0145-8752	1934-8436				NOV	2019	74	6					613	615		10.3103/S0145875219060085	http://dx.doi.org/10.3103/S0145875219060085													WOS:000519248100010

It encounters drought during summer and ammonia loading during agricultural fertilization. In the laboratory, aerial exposure led to decreases in its ammonia and urea excretion. Ammonia accumulated to very high levels in the muscle and liver. Urea synthesis through the ornithine-urea cycle was not involved in ammonia detoxification in M. anguillicaudatus. However, M. anguillicaudatus was capable of partial amino acid catabolism leading to the accumulation of alanine in the first 24 h of aerial exposure. This was apparently coupled to a possible decrease in protein/amino acid catabolism. These are not detoxification mechanisms but mechanisms that avoid internal fouling by ammonia. Misgurnus anguillicaudatus was also capable of detoxifying internally produced ammonia in part to glutamine, which appears to be an important adaptation after 24 h of aerial exposure. However, unlike the case of the marble goby (Oxyeleotris marmoratus), there was no alteration to the kinetic properties of the hepatic glutamine synthetase. During dry seasons, M. anguillicaudatus moves actively on land until it encounters soft mud in which it can bury itself through several strong wriggling actions of the body. Hence, it is possible that M. anguillicaudatus uses partial amino acid catabolism to fuel its short period of activities on land and switches to the formation of glutamine to detoxify internally produced ammonia when it remains relatively inactive in the mud.

The influence of abiotic factors on gillnet catch rates of yellow perch in southern Lake Michigan, 1989-2006	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												P>The difference in yellow perch, Perca flavescens (Mitchill), catch rates were evaluated for gillnets set on the bottom at 10- and 15-m depths in southern Lake Michigan during June, July and August from 1989 to 2006. More yellow perch were captured in gillnets set at 10 m than at 15 m. Differences in water temperature were significant in explaining variation in catch rates, but differences in Secchi depth and wave height were not significant. These results suggest that yellow perch may associate with habitat based on water temperature during the summer and move in response to thermal changes. In addition, this portion of the lake lacks noticeable heterogeneous structural habitat features that normally influence yellow perch behaviour. Fisheries managers should consider sampling based on temperature in addition to depth or other habitat features when designing sampling protocols.																			0969-997X	1365-2400				JUN	2010	17	3					284	290		10.1111/j.1365-2400.2009.00728.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2400.2009.00728.x													WOS:000277420300008

The Mediterranean basin is especially sensitive to climate change and subsequent tree growth declines. In this article, we present the first study on recent tree growth trends in Turkey. Pinus nigra is a drought-sensitive species and one of the most common and economically important native conifers to Turkey. Tree-ring cores were taken from 61 Pinus nigra plots spread over the entire Lakes District (Southwest Turkey), near the species' southern range limit. The samples cover the 1839-2013 time period. We apply the Regional Curve Standardization technique and statistical modeling to the tree ring width data to investigate long-term growth trends. Both methods show remarkably similar results: a slowly increasing growth trend until the 1970s, followed by a decreasing trend. This recent negative trend is highly correlated with increased temperature and drought in summer, which suggests that it is likely caused by climate change.

New features of the model include a correction for snowfall undermeasurement, mid-winter snowmelt, snow density estimates and estimation of the effect of exposed vegetation on aerodynamic roughness height during blowing snow. Importantly, the model now includes algorithms to estimate the threshold wind speed for snow transport and to estimate the probability of blowing snow occurrence. The probability of blowing snow occurrence is used to scale the blowing snow fluxes horizontally so that estimates from a 1 x 1 km surface area control volume may be extrapolated to larger scales, varying fetches and vegetation types. As a demonstration, the model is operated using standard meteorological data from meteorological stations in the Canadian Prairies and compared to snow accumulation measurements at these stations. The model is also used to estimate snow accumulation for comparison to extensive field snow surveys from the Bad Lake experimental basin in west-central Saskatchewan. It is shown that the new version of PBSM can provide estimates of snow accumulation, melt, transport and sublimation from hourly to seasonal time periods for varying land surfaces.

The Study of the Diversity of Hydrobionts from Listvennichny Bay of Lake Baikal by DNA Metabarcoding	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF GENETICS												The taxonomic diversity of hydrobionts from Listvennichny Bay was studied by DNA metabarcoding. The sequencing of a gene fragment (313 bp) of mitochondrial DNA encoding the first subunit of cytochrome c oxidase (COI) was performed using an Illumina MiSeq after amplification from internal primers (mlCOIintF, jgHCO2198). Bioinformatic analysis of COI reads revealed 187 OTUs (operational taxonomic units), among which Arthropoda, Annelida, Mollusca, and Plathelminthes prevail, accounting for 52, 30, 10, and 4%, respectively. In general, the species diversity of the bay's fauna by the Shannon index (3.2 bits) is comparable to other areas of Lake Baikal. The most diverse composition of taxa (22 OTUs) of the species rank falls on the larvae of chironomids, which confirms the effectiveness of the method for identifying juvenile stages of invertebrates. The research results are the first step toward improving the system of hydrobiological monitoring of Lake Baikal based on the synthesis of molecular genetic diagnostics of invertebrates and classical morphological taxonomy.

The site is situated in a part of Southern Germany called "wurttembergisches Allgau". Three different situations are being observed: a) a gleyi-cumulic Anthrosol receiving liquid manure according to local practice, b) a similar soil, with no fertilizer since 1987 and c) a cumuli-mollic Gleysol under Phragmites in the wetland plot from slope to a small lake. Measurements are performed by means of four large (surface covered: 1 m(2)), permanently installed static chambers per site. Fluxes observed were 0.98 +/- 5.40 kg N2O-N ha(-1) a(-1) on the fertilized, 1.14 +/- 5.59 kg N2O-N ha(-1) a(-1) on the unfertilized cumulic Anthrosol and 0.14 +/- 3.00 kg N2O-N ha(-1) a(-1) on the wetland plot. Variability among chambers was high (cV up to 908 %) in spite of the large surface area. This may be partly due to the low frequency (two to three times per week) of measurements. On several occasions, N2O concentration in the chamber decreased. At present it is not clear, whether these are actual fluxes or results of N2O consumption within the chamber.

Characterization of an alloherpesvirus from wild lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens in Wisconsin (USA)	DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS												In the spring of 2017, 2 adult lake sturgeon (LS) Acipenser fulvescens captured from the Wolf River, Wisconsin (USA), presented with multiple cutaneous plaques that, upon microscopic examination, indicated proliferative epidermitis. Ultrastructural examination of affected keratinocytes revealed particles in the nucleus having a morphology typical of herpesviruses. A degenerate PCR assay targeting the DNA polymerase catalytic subunit (pol) gene of large double-stranded DNA viruses generated amplicons of the anticipated size from skin samples, and sequences of amplicons confirmed the presence of a novel alloherpesvirus (lake sturgeon herpesvirus, LSHV) related to acipenserid herpesvirus 1 (AciHV1). The complete genome (202660 bp) of this virus was sequenced using a MiSeq System, and phylogenetic analyses substantiated the close relationship to AciHV1. A PCR assay targeting the LSHV DNA packaging terminase subunit 1 (ter1) gene demonstrated the presence of the virus in 39/42 skin lesion samples collected from wild LS captured in 2017-2019 and 2021 in 4/4 rivers in Wisconsin.

A significant and violent rain fell down on Bujumbura city and its surroundings in the night of 9th-10th February 2014 during less than three hours where rivers crossing the city overflowed and flooded the plain bordering the Tanganyika Lake. This study aims to exploit morphologic properties of Tanganyika Lake watershed to detect and map areas that are most vulnerable to flooding during extreme precipitation events. A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was integrated in a Geographic Information System to compute morphometric factors influencing susceptibility to flooding. A weighted overlay analysis was carried out on these causal factors to distinguish areas according to their susceptibility to flooding. Main damages of February 2014 were located and superimposed to the resulting map of flood prone areas in order to validate the results.																			1314-0604						2016							241	248																WOS:000385790600025

Predicting water quality at Santa Monica Beach: Evaluation of five different models for public notification of unsafe swimming conditions	WATER RESEARCH												Bathing beaches are monitored for fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) to protect swimmers from unsafe conditions. However, FIB assays take similar to 24 h and water quality conditions can change dramatically in that time, so unsafe conditions cannot presently be identified in a timely manner. Statistical, data-driven predictive models use information on environmental conditions (i.e., rainfall, turbidity) to provide nowcasts of FIB concentrations. Their ability to predict real time FIB concentrations can make them more accurate at identifying unsafe conditions than the current method of using day or older FIB measurements. Predictive models are used in the Great Lakes, Hong Kong, and Scotland for beach management, but they are presently not used in California - the location of some of the world's most popular beaches. California beaches are unique as point source pollution has generally been mitigated, the summer bathing season receives little to no rainfall, and in situ measurements of turbidity and salinity are not readily available. These characteristics may make modeling FIB difficult, as many current FIB models rely heavily on rainfall or salinity. The current study investigates the potential for FIB models to predict water quality at a quintessential California Beach: Santa Monica Beach. This study compares the performance of five predictive models, multiple linear regression model, binary logistic regression model, partial least square regression model, artificial neural network, and classification tree, to predict concentrations of summertime fecal coliform and enterococci concentrations. Past measurements of bacterial concentration, storm drain condition, and tide level are found to be critical factors in the predictive models. The models perform better than the current beach management method. The classification tree models perform the best; for example they correctly predict 42% of beach postings due to fecal coliform exceedances during model validation, as compared to 28% by the current method. Artificial neural network is the second best model which minimizes the number of incorrect beach postings.

A large white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) population exists in a wetland in Northeast Asia during the boreal winter, mainly because of regular supplementary feeding. However, the use of supplementary food by eagles has not been assessed. In this study, we used non-invasive sampling and DNA metabarcoding to investigate the food composition of white-tailed eagles in a lake near a supplementary feeding site. Our results revealed that supplemental food was present in 94 % of the samples, with a weighted percent of occurrence (wPOO) of 64.62 %. In addition to supplementation, we identified 11 natural prey species, including fish, birds, and mammals, from freshwater, marine, and terrestrial ecosystems. After February, there was an increasing trend in the frequency of natural food items, especially of marine fish, in the diet of the eagles. Our study demonstrates the power of DNA metabarcoding in dietary studies of raptor species in the presence of supplementary feeding. Based on our results, multiple recommendations have been provided to achieve adaptive management of large nonbreeding populations of eagles in our study area.																				2351-9894				DEC	2024	56								e03297	10.1016/j.gecco.2024.e03297	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2024.e03297													WOS:001358295400001

Seagrasses play key ecological roles in coastal ecosystems as primary producers and providers of habitat and environmental structure. Therefore, mapping seagrass beds is indispensable for the effective monitoring and management of coastal vegetated habitats. In contrast to direct sampling techniques and optical remote sensing, active hydroacoustic techniques are relatively inexpensive and efficient for the detection of seagrass. We used a single beam echosounder to detect the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of the eelgrass Zostera marina L. in an important overwintering habitat for the whooper swan Cygnus cygnus (Swan-Lake lagoon), northern China. We also distinguished echograms of the macroalgae Chaetomorpha linum K. and outlined its threat to seagrass. We also propose a method for calculating the accuracy of interpolation analyses. Results showed that: (1) The distribution of seagrass in Swan Lake varies with seasons, with maximum distribution area in summer. The maximum distribution area of seagrass beds in Swan Lake was 199.09 ha-231.67 ha, accounting for 41.48%-48.26% of the area of Swan Lake; (2) C. linum is a growing threat for seagrass beds of Swan-lake, with distribution area as high as 129.28 ha in May 2018. The invasion and competition by C. linum against seagrass beds could be one of the reasons for the decline in seagrass beds in Swan-Lake; (3) Topo to Raster has the highest interpolation accuracy and is the most conservative among three interpolation methods. Topo to Raster was the most suitable interpolation method for the sonar detection of seagrass beds. The findings may facilitate the application of sonar technology in seagrass monitoring and provide data for the formulation of appropriate seagrass bed management and restoration strategies and policies.					xu, shuai/KFS-8484-2024; Wang, Peiliang/MFH-8786-2025; Zhou, Yi/F-4219-2011	Zhou, Yi/0000-0001-7300-0173													0025-326X	1879-3363				AUG	2019	145						611	623		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.06.022	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.06.022								31590831					WOS:000482493000071
J	BROWN, DR; SHRABLE, JB				BROWN, DR; SHRABLE, JB			SURVIVAL OF ARCTIC GRAYLING EGGS WATER-HARDENED IN VARIOUS CONCENTRATIONS OF IODOPHOR	PROGRESSIVE FISH-CULTURIST												Survival of eggs of Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) following water hardening in various concentrations of an iodophor, povidone-iodine, solution was investigated. The treatment is effective in reducing the external bacterial load at the surface of the egg and is thought to reduce the risk of vertical transmission of pathogens from parent to offspring. However, in some cases, the use of iodophor during water hardening of salmon and trout eggs has resulted in significant egg losses. Treatment duration and concentrations similar to those commonly used during water hardening of eggs of other salmonid species were tested with Arctic grayling eggs. Water hardening in 50, 75, and 100 mg active iodine per liter resulted in significantly greater egg losses at eye-up than occurred when eggs were hardened in lake water. Mortality was highest in treatments with the strongest iodine concentrations.																			0033-0779					OCT	1994	56	4					262	264		10.1577/1548-8640(1994)056<0262:SOAGEW>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8640(1994)056<0262:SOAGEW>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1994PM18600008

Richard; Wang, Xiaoyan			Sensitivity studies and comprehensive evaluation of RegCM4.6.1 high-resolution climate simulations over the Tibetan Plateau	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												This study provides the first comprehensive assessment of Regional Climate Model version 4.6.1 (RegCM4) for the Tibetan Plateau (TP) region. A wide range of model configurations were analyzed with different parameterizations employed to represent cumulus convection (Kuo, Grell, Emanuel, Kain, and Tiedtke), land surface processes (BATS and CLM), planetary boundary layer turbulence (Holtslag and UW PBL), and radiation (CCM3 and RRTM). In addition to the above experiments at a 30-km horizontal resolution, another experiment was conducted based upon the use of a double-nested dynamic downscaling method to construct a simulation at a 10-km resolution to study the sensitivity to the model resolution. We evaluated a 20-year simulation for precipitation, cloud cover, surface radiation budget, 2-m air temperature, and the surface atmospheric circulation against ground and satellite-based observations during the period 1989-2008. Among the factors analyzed regarding sensitivity, precipitation was unsurprisingly found to be sensitive to the cumulus parameterization scheme, and the CLM is found to reduce rainfall compared with BATS, which is satisfactory for both the Emanuel and Tiedtke schemes. Compared with the cumulus convection schemes, the cloud cover and surface radiation budget are sensitive to the land surface, PBL, and radiation schemes. Generally, the CLM is characterized by reduced mean cloud cover and enhanced surface longwave and shortwave radiation compared with BATS. Conversely, the UW PBL and RRTM radiation schemes result in increased cloud cover and less surface radiation compared with the default options in RegCM4. All experiments, except those employing the Kuo scheme, represent the mean 2-m air temperature and regional circulation patterns reasonably well. At the basin scale, the seasonal cycle and interannual variations of precipitation are found to be not well depicted by most model configurations, although the temperature field was well reproduced. Considering all the analyzed variables collectively, the Tiedtke scheme combined with the CLM land surface model is demonstrated to provide the best performance over the TP. However, the higher-resolution version of the model improves the precipitation simulation significantly, particularly in the Brahmaputra river basin, which is located in the north of the Himalayas.

Lake microbial communities are resilient after a whole-ecosystem disturbance	ISME JOURNAL												Disturbances act as powerful structuring forces on ecosystems. To ask whether environmental microbial communities have capacity to recover after a large disturbance event, we conducted a whole-ecosystem manipulation, during which we imposed an intense disturbance on freshwater microbial communities by artificially mixing a temperate lake during peak summer thermal stratification. We employed environmental sensors and water chemistry analyses to evaluate the physical and chemical responses of the lake, and bar-coded 16S ribosomal RNA gene pyrosequencing and automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) to assess the bacterial community responses. The artificial mixing increased mean lake temperature from 14 to 20 degrees C for seven weeks after mixing ended, and exposed the microorganisms to very different environmental conditions, including increased hypolimnion oxygen and increased epilimnion carbon dioxide concentrations. Though overall ecosystem conditions remained altered (with hypolimnion temperatures elevated from 6 to 20 degrees C), bacterial communities returned to their pre-manipulation state as some environmental conditions, such as oxygen concentration, recovered. Recovery to pre-disturbance community composition and diversity was observed within 7 (epilimnion) and 11 (hypolimnion) days after mixing. Our results suggest that some microbial communities have capacity to recover after a major disturbance.

Lake waters are characterised by low electrical conductivities (236-489 S/cm), neutral to alkaline pH (7.36-9.26), oxidising Eh (329-457 mV) and Ca-Mg-HCO3 facies. Stable isotopes indicate that lake waters are only slightly affected by evaporation, are fully flushed yearly and are not stratified. Carbonate equilibria dominate the lake water hydrochemistry. In summer, photosynthetic activity and temperature increase induce calcite precipitation, as testified by its high content in the sediments, up to 97%, and by its isotopic composition. The short residence time and endogenic calcite precipitation likely prevent the accumulation of contaminants and nutrients in lake waters. This study suggests a high resilience of the system to anthropogenic disturbances and demonstrates the sediment potential for the reconstruction of the environmental evolution in time and for the anthropogenic impact assessment.

J	Stanton, S				Stanton, Sharon			Western Dwarf Mistletoe and Prescribed Fire Behavior-A Case Study from Crater Lake National Park	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												This study investigates the influence of parasitic western dwarf mistletoe on prescribed fire behavior and limb flammability of ponderosa pine. Fall season prescribed fires were applied to 14 plots (7 infested and 7 uninfested) in an 81.5 ha mixed-conifer stand at Crater Lake National Park. I measured stand structure variables and surface fuel composition before and after burning and monitored fire behavior during burns. To assess the influence of mistletoe infection on limb flammability in a more controlled setting, I burned infected and uninfected limbs (n = 18 each) in a burn chamber. Results show that plots at Crater Lake infested with mistletoe burned at higher temperatures for shorter periods than uninfested plots. Plots with greater duff biomass recorded higher temperatures, while those with greater accumulations of litter burned longer. All plots experienced a significant reduction in total surface fuel loads following fire, however there was no difference in fuel reduction between uninfested and infested plots, suggesting mistletoe has little influence on fire behavior in this forest type. Infected branches lost a greater proportion of their mass during burn chamber tests, primarily in the form of needles. These results indicate that dwarf mistletoe has little influence on the behavior of low-intensity surface fires, but further research is needed to assess the role of mistletoe in other fire conditions and stand types.																			0029-344X	2161-9859				SUM	2009	83	3					189	199		10.3955/046.083.0303	http://dx.doi.org/10.3955/046.083.0303													WOS:000268078100003

Reproductive biology of the invasive species Pseudoxiphophorus bimaculatus and Poecilia sphenops in the Teuchitlan River, Mexico	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												Reproductive biology of invasive species is not often studied relative to the invasion process, although it may provide an accurate indicator of the invasion stage. We evaluated the reproductive biology of the exotic fish species Pseudoxiphophorus bimaculatus and Poecilia sphenops in the Teuchitlan River, Jalisco, Mexico by fertility, size at first maturity, sex ratio, gonad maturity stage, gonadosomatic index, condition factor, size-structure, and habitat. The reproductive variables were related to environmental characteristics using the non-metric analysis of multidimensional scaling. A total of 1374 specimens of P.bimaculatus and 571 of P.sphenops were captured by seine netting and electrofishing. Maximum fertility of P.bimaculatus was 15.99 +/- 2.27 embryonated eggs and embryos and, for P.sphenops, 31.26 +/- 4.17. Females predominated among P.bimaculatus, while in P.sphenops the sex ratio was similar to 1:1. We found mature female and male of P.bimaculatus in degraded sites and juveniles in the springs. Poecilia sphenops reproduced along the river. The establishment of both invasive species in the Teuchitlan River is evidence that they share the reproductive habitat with native fish species, and tend to spread and colonize new areas.

Has the Hudson River fish community recovered from the zebra mussel invasion along with its forage base?	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												In the first decade after zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) appeared in the Hudson River, the biomass of zooplankton and deepwater macrobenthos fell by similar to 50%, while the biomass of littoral macrobenthos rose by >10%. These changes in the forage base were associated with large, differential changes in the abundance, geographic distribution, and growth rates of openwater and littoral fish. In recent years, populations of zooplankton and deepwater macrobenthos have risen towards pre-invasion levels, while littoral macrobenthos remained unchanged. We therefore hypothesized that the abundance, distribution, and growth rates of openwater fish species would shift back towards pre-invasion levels, while littoral fish species would not change. Our analysis of large data sets for young-of-year fishes found no systematic change in the abundance or geographic distribution of either group of fish in the Hudson. We did find a marked increase in growth rates of openwater fish, but no change in growth rates of littoral fish, in support of our hypothesis. Our study shows that the ecological effects of a biological invasion may change over time.

In order to investigate the relationship between rodent communities and vegetation, the relationship between rodent population characteristics and vegetation cover between 2000 and 2020 was analyzed. The results showed that the rodent community in Dongting Lake has obvious spatial and temporal variability, and that Microtus fortis and Apodemus agrarius are currently the main rodent species in the area, with a higher population density in eastern Dongting Lake. Meanwhile, rodent fatness varied significantly between seasons, with the highest rodent fatness in winter at most survey sites. There was also significant spatial and temporal variability in vegetation cover, and the overall trend was increasing. There was a significant relationship between vegetation cover and rodent population density and fatness, and the relationship varied by rodent species. Microtus fortis population density was significantly correlated with medium to high levels of vegetation cover, but fatness was significantly correlated with low to medium levels of vegetation cover. The relationship between population density, fatness, and vegetation cover of A. agrarius is opposite to that of M. fortis. The study confirms that M. fortis is still the main pest rodent species in the Dongting Lake area, but the monitoring of A. agrarius and vegetation cover should be strengthened.

J	Chapman, JB; Thomas, JM; Garner, C				Chapman, Jenny B.; Thomas, James M.; Garner, Chris			Groundwater recharge timing based on 14C and 2H within Indian Wells Valley, California, USA	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												A large carbon-14 dataset for groundwater in Indian Wells Valley, California, is used to identify groundwater recharged during the pluvial climate of the previous glacial period, more than 12,000 years before present. Additional data collected in 2019, including measurements of 13C and 14C in the recharge areas and dissolved organic carbon isotopes, substantiated the unusually heavy-isotope-enriched 13C and relatively low 14C compositions in the Sierra Nevada canyons on the northwestern margin of the basin. The carbon isotopic characteristics in this area may be due to aeolian deposits of sodium carbonate minerals from dried lake beds along the ancient Owens River, or dissolution of metasediments within the Sierra Nevada batholith, or geothermally sourced CO2 gas, or a combination of these. Recognizing these isotope characteristics is essential for correcting apparent 14C groundwater ages. Additional complications arise from sulfate reduction and related conversion of 14C-dead sedimentary organic material to dissolved inorganic carbon with a light 13C composition. The lacustrine deposits of pluvial China Lake and organic-rich spring deposits along the Sierra Nevada range front offer reducing environments across much of the valley. A similarly large 2H dataset provides an independent marker for recharge in a previous climate, facilitated by exhaustive regional studies of 2H content of precipitation, springs, and groundwater (Smith et al., 2002). The 14C data support an association of delta 2H values less than -100%o with pluvial-climate groundwater and delta 2H values greater than -96%o with groundwater recharged under current climatic conditions. Groundwaters with delta 2H between these values cannot be assigned with certainty to either group. Evaporation is also evident for a small set of groundwater samples, rendering 2H unreliable as a climate indicator for them. Using 14C and 2H in combination, much of Indian Wells Valley is found to contain groundwater consistent with recharge during current climatic conditions, with ages generally less than 6000 years. Groundwater with pluvial characteristics occurs primarily in the far end of the flow system, in the eastern part of the valley near the evapotranspiration discharge area. The footprint of this older water is more extensive in the deeper parts of the flow system and the vertical distribution of ages indicates it moves upward from the deeper parts of the flow system to the shallow zone to discharge. Estimates of groundwater travel time from a numerical flow model of the basin are generally consistent with the isotopic interpretations.																			0883-2927	1872-9134				JUN	2022	141								105268	10.1016/j.apgeochem.2022.105268	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2022.105268		APR 2022											WOS:000799249600001

Historical and contemporary movement and survival rates of walleye (Sander vitreus) in Lake Winnipeg, Canada	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Understanding patterns of fish movement in large lake ecosystems is essential for determining appropriate management actions as differences in movement behaviour can influence life history traits such as growth and survival. Lake Winnipeg in Manitoba, Canada supports the 2nd largest walleye (Sander vitreus) commercial fishery in North America. We used mark-recapture models to determine movement and estimate survival of walleye between basins of Lake Winnipeg in historical and contemporary contexts, comparing a tag-recovery study completed historically during 1974-1977 with a contemporary (2017-2019) acoustic telemetry study. Mark-recapture models revealed comparably low but detectable annual transitions between basins from historical (0.3-1.2%) and contemporary datasets (7-8.5%). Historically, fish > 300 mm more frequently moved in a south to north direction. Contemporary estimates suggest similar length-based directionality in that fish > 350 mm were always more likely to move in a south-north direction. Contemporary annual survival derived from mark-recapture models ranged between 27 and 45% and 64.3% when derived from catch curve analysis, while independently derived annual historical survival estimates ranged between 50 and 69% and 45.5% from catch curve analysis. Using the contemporary dataset, we also observed seasonal variation in movement and survival between basins, with the greatest movement across the lake occurring during the fall. Our results demonstrate a persisting pattern of low but measurable movement, suggesting between basin movement is not unusual for Lake Winnipeg. Further, low walleye survival rates reported here for the two time periods studied, support recent management actions to reduce fishing pressure across the lake.

Spatial and seasonal variation of PAHs concentration in the Spreca river	GLASNIK HEMICARA I TEHNOLOGA BOSNE I HERCEGOVINE												The largest part of the river Spreca flows through the heavily populated region of Tuzla canton, and it is also area of mining-industrial zone. This study monitors the PAHs content, in the part of Spreca's flow which is extremely exposed to these pollutants during the year of 2015. Content of PAHs in the river were analyzed on three locations: prior Modrac lake, in the lake and on the mouth of Spreca into river Bosna. Determination of PAHs in the water was performed by HPLC techniques-fluorescence detection, after liquid-liquid extraction. Eight PAHs, recommended by EU directive, have been analyzed: naphthalene, anthracene, fluoranthene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(k) fluoranthene, benzo(a)pyrene, indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene and benzo(ghi) perylene. The highest concentration was found for naphthalene. Except naphthalene, concentration of all other PAHs was significantly higher on the mouth of Spreca than on the two previous locations. Concentration of all PAHs significantly varies during seasons and it was highest during the winter period. High level of naphthalene and fluoranthene comes from coal-mining area which is prior to Modrac lake and also from the soda drinks chemical industry further away fromthe lake.

Geochemical data and water balance calculations suggest that local rainfall makes a significant contribution to groundwater recharge and that past lake-level variations in this desert environment should reflect palaeoclimatic changes. The chronology of lake-level change, established by radiocarbon and U-series disequilibrium dating methods, indicates high lake levels and a wetter climate beginning at ca. 10 ka and lasting until the late mid-Holocene in the Badain Jaran Desert. The greatest extension of lakes in the inter-dune depressions indicates that the water availability was greatest during the mid-Holocene. Relicts of Neolithic tools and pottery of Qijia Culture (2400-1900 BC) suggest relatively intensive human activity in the Badain Jaran Desert during the early and middle Holocene, supporting our interpretation of a less harsh environment. Wetter climates during the Holocene were likely triggered by an intensified East Asian summer monsoon associated with strong insolation. (C) 2009 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc.

At the Last Glacial Maximum, expanded pluvial lakes in the south(1,2) and aridity in the northwest(3) suggest that the winter westerly storm track was displaced southwards and migrated northwards as the Laurentide Ice Sheet waned(4). However, lake highstands do not occur synchronously along zonal bands(5), in conflict with this hypothesis. Here we compile a network of precipitation proxy reconstructions from lakes, speleothems, groundwater deposits, packrat middens and glaciers from the western and southwestern US, which we compare with an ensemble of climate simulations to identify the controls of regional hydroclimatic change. The proxy records suggest a precipitation dipole during the Last Glacial Maximum, with wetter than modern conditions in the southwest and drier conditions near the ice sheet, and a northwest-southeast trending transition zone across the northern Great Basin. The models that simulate a weaker and south-shifted Aleutian low-pressure system, a strong North Pacific high-pressure system, and a high above the ice sheet best reproduce this regional variation. We therefore conclude that rather than a uniformly south-shifted storm track, a stronger jet that is squeezed and steered across the continent by high-pressure systems best explains the observed regional hydroclimate patterns of the Last Glacial Maximum.					; Maher, Kate/B-3489-2010; Ibarra, Daniel/E-6141-2013	Winnick, Matthew/0000-0003-4237-9402; Maher, Kate/0000-0002-5982-6064; Ibarra, Daniel/0000-0002-9980-4599; Oster, Jessica/0000-0002-1780-2435													1752-0894	1752-0908				MAR	2015	8	3					201	205		10.1038/NGEO2365	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/NGEO2365													WOS:000350770900017

Chinook salmon and rainbow trout catch and temperature distributions in Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We determined the distributions of Chinook salmon and rainbow trout by describing seasonal mean vertical and bathymetric catch depths from 1997 to 2005 using angler creel surveys. We developed and applied a cross-validated model of Lake Ontario temperatures to determine the water temperatures associated with these distributions. During April, Chinook salmon and rainbow trout were found nearshore at a bathymetric depth of 20 m. However, rainbow trout were caught at shallower vertical depths (4 to 6 m) than Chinook salmon (8 to 10 m). Both species moved deeper and farther offshore during May,June, and July. Vertical catch depths were similar, but rainbow trout were found further offshore (40 to 65 m bathymetric depth) than Chinook salmon (35 to 50 m bathymetric depth) during June, July and August. During September, Chinook salmon moved closer to shore (25 to 35 m bathymetric depth) and to shallower depths (9 to 12 m), consistent with river Mouth staging associated with spawning. Rainbow trout remained offshore (45 to 60 m bathymetric depth) in deeper water (11 to 16 m). The species occupied significantly different spatial habitats during April, August, and September Mean catch temperatures of both species were Similar and increased seasonally to 13 to 14 degrees C during August and September. Rainbow trout were caught at cooler temperatures than Chinook salmon during June and July. The estimated temperature distributions agree with independent field studies but are different then previously assumed in bioenergetic models. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The sediments spanning the period similar to 22.6-10.5 kcal. yr BP (6.35-1.44 m) were analysed using a combination of variables including pollen, charcoal, particle size, magnetic susceptibility and loss-on-ignition. The resulting palaeorecord provides a high-resolution reconstruction of Late Pleistocene to Early Holocene climatic and environmental changes in southwestern China. Our findings indicate that from c. 22.6 to 17.7 kcal. yr BP, vegetation assemblages were primarily aligned to sparse xerophytic grassland/tundra or cold-tolerant boreal Pinus forest, indicating that climatic conditions in southwestern China were cold and dry. However, from c. 17.7 to 17.4 kcal. yr BP, the Lake Shudu record is punctuated by marked environmental changes. These include the establishment of denser vegetation cover, a marked expansion of boreal Pinus forest and enhanced hydrological activity in the catchment over centennial timescales, perhaps suggesting that stepwise variations in the Asian Monsoon were triggering fundamental environmental changes over sub-millennial timescales. Thereafter, the pollen record captures a period of environmental instability reflected in fluctuations across all of the variables, which persists until c. 17.1 kcal. yr BR After c. 17.1 kcal. yr BP, the expansion of steppe vegetation cover and cold-cool mixed forest consisting of mesophilous vegetation such as Tsuga and Picea, thermophilous trees including Ulmus and deciduous Quercus inferred from the Lake Shudu pollen record point to the establishment of warmer, wetter and perhaps more seasonal conditions associated with a strengthening Asian Summer Monsoon during the shift from Pleistocene to Holocene climatic conditions.

The lakes will be used as manipulation (GV) and reference (KV) ecosystems in food web studies. Both lakes are mesotrophic to slightly eutrophic with mean epilimnetic total phosphorus (P) concentrations of 24 and 21 mu g L-1 in GV and KV, respectively. Mean phytoplankton biomass was 0.9 and 0.5 cm(3) m(-3) in GV and KV. During summer, the algal community of both lakes was dominated by cyanobacterial picoplankton and Ceratium spp. Filamentous cyanobacteria (mostly Planktothrix sp.) prevailed in a deep chlorophyll maximum found within the chemocline of both lakes. Bacterial biomass in the epilimnion of GV usually ranged between 1 and 3 cm(3) m(-3). Mean ciliate abundance was 13 ind. mL(-1) in GV and 14 ind. mL(-1) in KV. While Oligotricha dominated in GV, Scuticociliata were found most frequently in KV. Mean annual crustacean biomass was high in both lakes (GV 2.5 cm(3) m(-3), KV 1.2 cm(3) m(-3)); Eudiaptomus gracilis, E. graciloides and Daphnia spp. were the most prominent species. Total fish biomass of both lakes was dominated by roach (GV 52%; KV 57%) and perch (GV 24%; KV 34%) Vaucheria dichotoma and Chara spp. dominated the macrophyte community in GV; Chara spp. dominated in KV. The slightly more eutrophic character of GV was most likely a result of greater P accumulation in the sediments due to external loading, which resulted in greater hypolimnetic P concentrations throughout the summer in GV. However, on an annual basis these differences were only occasionally reflected at higher trophic levels. The differences in fish biomass, however, might have been a consequence of higher structural diversity in GV provided by submersed macrophytes rather than its more eutrophic character. We conclude that the trophic characteristics and food web structure of Grosser Vatersee and Kleiner Vatersee are similar enough to be suitable as manipulation and reference lakes in food web experiments.

Hypoxic zones as habitat for zooplankton in Lake Erie: Refuges from predation or exclusion zones?	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Bottom hypoxia has reemerged as a prominent feature of Lake Erie's central basin during late summer. Similar to coastal marine systems, the impacts of hypoxia on pelagic organisms in Lake Erie remain largely enigmatic. During summer 2005 and 2007, we used pump sampling for mesozooplankton and fish acoustics to test the hypothesis that mesozooplankton use hypoxia as a refuge from predation. We explored species-specific diel vertical migration (DVM) of mesozooplankton and spatial overlap with planktivorous fishes at several offshore stations in the central basin of Lake Erie with similar thermal structure, but varying hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations (range: 0.3 to 4.6 ring l(-1)). The tendency of a zooplankter to use the hypolimnion under normoxic conditions and its sensitivity to DO defined its DVM and overlap with fish, which were generally more sensitive to hypoxia than mesozooplankton. The diaptomids (calanoid copepods) and the predatory cladoceran Leptodora kindtii were largely unaffected by hypoxia, using the epilimnion during both day and night. Daphnia mendotae and the predatory cladoceran Bythotrephes longimanus, both of which migrated from the metalimnion and epilimnion to the hypolimnion during the day under normoxic conditions, avoided the hypolimnion at DO levels <= 2.0 mg l(-1). Dissolved oxygen levels between 1.0 and 1.2 mg l(-1) were critical avoidance thresholds for most other mesozooplankton species, with the copepod Mesocyclops edax, a migrator between the epilimnion and hypolimnion, avoiding DO <= 1.2 mg l(-1). By contrast the cool water, hypolimnetic copepod Diacyclops thomasi and Daphnia longiremis continued to use the hypolimnion during the day until DO became <= 1.0 mg l(-1). These species aggregated in the metalimnion (primarily) and epilimnion (secondarily) at night. Only Bosmina was found in abundance in the hypolimnion at DO levels equal to 0.3 ring l(-1). Hypoxia-intolerant species (e.g., D. mendotae, B. longimanus) that were compressed into the thin metalimnion during day likely faced high predation pressure from visual-feeding planktivorous fishes (e.g., rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax, emerald shiners Notropis atherinoides) as well as the predatory cladoceran, B. longimanus. By contrast, hypoxia-tolerant species (e.g., D. thomasi, D. longiremis, and B. longirostris) that remained in the hypolimnion may have found refuge in hypoxic areas with DO > 1.0 mg l(-1), although fish were occasionally observed making feeding excursions into hypoxic waters.

J	REYNOLDS, RC				REYNOLDS, RC			POLYPHENOL INHIBITION OF CALCITE PRECIPITATION IN LAKE POWELL	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Laboratory studies of calcite precipitation kinetics in waters of simulated Lake Powell [Utah, Arizona, USA] composition have verified that precipitation occurs by a spiral dislocation growth mechanism. But waters from the lake and laboratory solutions containing tannic acid and plant polyphenols at low and very low levels showed calcite growth rates proportional to the 4th power of the carbonate ion concentration. The results indicate the operation of a surface polynuclear growth process that becomes effective when polyphenol adsorption blocks spiral dislocation growth sites and causes precipitation rates to diminish with increasing polyphenol concentration and to fall drastically as pH is lowered. The effects of these factors are dominant controls on the calcium carbonate geochemistry of Lake Powell. Significant amounts of calcite precipitation occur only in the surface waters of the downstream portion of the reservoir and, even there, only during the warm (6 mo.) portion of the year.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1978	23	4					585	597		10.4319/lo.1978.23.4.0585	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1978.23.4.0585													WOS:A1978FK27200001

Emphasis was laid on collecting baseline data on soil microbial flora by a cultivation dependent - method from six different habitats of Nal Sarovar. Total heterotrophic bacterial counts (THBC) from six habitats were determined using standard procedures. Bacteria were identified using 16S rRNA sequencing and their evolutionary history was mapped using phylogenetic tree. Chemical parameters were also determined using standard procedures. THBC ranged from 4.4 x 10(6) to 14.2 x 10(6) for different habitats of Nal Sarovar wetland-a Bird Sanctuary and a Ramsar Site in Gujarat State. Acinetobacter sp., Bacillus sp. and Brevibacterium sp. were predominant bacteria identified on basis of 16S rRNA sequencing. The physicochemical results varied and ranged from 8.25 to 9.8 for pH; 0.18 % to 0.97 % for organic carbon and 0.085 ppm to 0.365 ppm for phosphorous. This research gives useful insight into microbial diversity of Nal Sarovar wetland (a Bird Sanctuary and Ramsar Site) which until now had remained unexplored.																			2278-4535					JUN	2020	15	6					43	52																WOS:000536289100007

The present study on the assemblage of fresh water phytoplankton is focused to interpret the ecological condition of the studied water body of Bankura District in West Bengal. Methodology : Phytoplankton samples were collected from water bodies of Bankura District, West Bengal during the winter season. Planktonic algal taxa were analyzed using Scanning Electron Microscopy after preliminary observations made under Bright Field Microscopy. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of the phytoplankton were done for accurate taxonomic assignment of the taxa and interpretation of ecological perspectives. Results : The qualitative analysis revealed an assemblage of phytoplankton that includes ten taxa. In the present assemblage, euglenophytes are represented by only one species, whereas, five species of desmids belonging to three genera and four species of diatoms belonging to four genera have been identified and illustrated. Quantitatively amongst the different groups of phytoplankton, desmids are dominant (57%) followed by diatoms (40%) with a minor representation of euglenophytes (3%).

Holocene oscillations of the Baltic Sea and Lake Ladoga levels and early human movements	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Multidisciplinary studies conducted in Russian Karelia substantiated the existence of a major Baltic-Ladoga waterway in the Karelian Isthmus that emerged ca. 9500 cal BCE, and remained in action for ca. 7000 years. The predominant location of prehistoric sites in the catchment area indicates that this waterway effectively controlled the movements of hunter-gatherer groups during the greater part of the Holocene. A general increase of population density and sedentary behaviour, signalled by the beginning of intensive pottery-making at ca. 5560-5250 cal BCE, occurred in an environment of increased biodiversity and the establishment of mixed boreal - broad-leaved forests observable in the pollen records. The transgression of Lake Ladoga reached its peak between 1500 and 1000 BCE, resulting in the breakthrough of the Neva River and a general fall in the water level of the Ladoga-Volkhov-Ilmen hydrological system. The availability of low-lying fertile soils stimulated the rapid expansion of agriculture, recognized by the occurrence farming-related pollen and changes in the sedimentation, resulting in the rapid spread of farming communities.

A NEW SALAMANDRID FROM THE MIOCENE RANDECK MAAR, GERMANY	JOURNAL OF VERTEBRATE PALEONTOLOGY												A new species of salamandrid is named and described from the Miocene of Randeck Maar, a long-term volcanic lake deposit in southern Germany. Based on a fully articulated specimen, Ichthyosaura randeckensis is named and described as a 3-4 cm long newt with a robust posterolateral process of the frontal, a heavily ornamented skull roof, and a premaxilla with spike-like, parallel alary processes framing a slender fontanelle posteriorly. In a phylogenetic analysis of 14 salamandrid taxa and 38 morphological characters, I. randeckensis is found to nest with I. alpestris, with which it shares apomorphic character states in the morphology of premaxilla and nasal. The present analysis employed more morphological characters than hitherto considered, highlighting the need to conduct more osteological studies of extant salamanders. Its results are largely consistent with recent molecular phylogenetic studies: Tylototriton and Pleurodeles form a clade, with Notophthalmus and Euproctus falling within unresolved trichotomies, followed by Cynops and Ommatotriton as successive crownward clades, then Triturus sensu stricto (T. marmoratus and T. cristatus), and finally Lissotriton and Ichthyosaura as terminal sister taxa.

Our approach involved relatively simple measurements of four factors affecting the calculation of internal phosphorus load: the number of sampling sites, sediment freezing, incubation temperature and oxic state in Cootes Paradise Marsh, now a very shallow (Z = 70 cm) eutrophic degraded urban lake in Ontario, Canada. Our results indicate that all of these factors need to be considered when attempting to estimate the internal phosphorus load of a shallow system. The total internal load of phosphorus in Cootes Paradise Marsh was 34% of the total loading (both internal and external), with diffusion from the sediment accounting for 23% of all phosphorus inputs. Large carp are now excluded from the lake and were estimated by difference to have contributed 23% to summer internal loading.																			1040-2381					SEP	2005	21	3					223	230		10.1080/07438140509354432	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140509354432													WOS:000232563600001

The concentration of total and dissolved phosphorus (in water and in seston) and the retention of these two forms of P were analysed at several hydrological occasions in lakes of various morphometry and trophy, and in several stream fragments. The concentration and retention is equally highly variable in lake (lentic patches) and stream fragments (lotic patches) of the system. The polluted stream fragments at all occassions as well as the lakes in summer, are mainly exporting phoshorus. The patches which act as sources occur alternatively with patches which are P-sinks. This makes the whole system more or less balanced with respect to P movement in the landscape.																			0018-8158					FEB 5	1993	251	1-3					257	268		10.1007/BF00007185	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007185													WOS:A1993KX96900030

We here report Hg concentrations and pool sizes of different plant functional groups and plant species across nine tundra sites in northern Alaska. Significant spatial differences were observed in bulk vegetation Hg concentrations at Toolik Field station (52 +/- 9 mu g kg(-1)), Eight Mile Lake Observatory (40 +/- 0.2 mu g kg(-1)), and seven sites along a transect from Toolik Field station to the Arctic coast (36 +/- 9 mu g kg(-1)). Hg concentrations in non-vascular vegetation including feather and peat moss (58 +/- 6 mu g kg(-1) and 34 +/- 2 mu g kg(-1), respectively) and brown and white lichen (41 +/- 2 mu g kg(-1) and 34 +/- 2 mu g kg(-1), respectively), were three to six times those of vascular plant tissues (8 +/- 1 mu g kg(-1) in dwarf birch leaves and 9 +/- 1 mu g kg(-1) in tussock grass). A high representation of non-vascular vegetation in above ground biomass resulted in substantial Hg mass contained in tundra above ground vegetation (29 mu g m(-2)), which fell within the range of foliar Hg mass estimated for forests in the United States (15 to 45 mu g m(-2)) in spite of much shorter growing seasons. Hg stable isotope signatures of different plant species showed that atmospheric Hg(0) was the dominant source of Hg to tundra vegetation. Mass-dependent isotope signatures (delta Hg-202) in vegetation relative to atmospheric Hg (0) showed pronounced shifts towards lower values, consistent with previously reported isotopic fractionation during foliar uptake of Hg(0). Mass-independent isotope signatures (Delta Hg-199) of lichen were more positive relative to atmospheric Hg(0), indicating either photochemical reduction of Hg(II) or contributions of inorganic Hg (II) from atmospheric deposition and/or dust Delta Hg-199 and Delta Hg-200 values in vascular plant species were similar to atmospheric Hg(0) suggesting that overall photochemical reduction and subsequent re-emission was relatively insignificant in these tundra ecosystems, in agreement with previous Hg(0) ecosystem flux measurements.

The chromium and nickel concentrations were investigated in the fall season in the sediment and common reed (Phragmites australis). The peroxidation of lipids in stalks was also investigated. The study was conducted on three points of the lake: at the entrance to the city of Pogradec, the former Fe-Ni mine and the village of Lin (control point). Heavy metals were determined with the method of atomic absorption spectrometry and malondialdehyde, using the spectrophotometric method. The results showed that there was greater accumulation of nickel than chromium in both sediments and stalks in the three explored points. The sediment and plant samples taken in the part of the former Fe-Ni mines showed a higher level of investigated metals, compared to the other two research points. At this point, the difference was significant for chromium (p <0.01) compared to the village of Lin, whereas for nickel there was a significant difference (p <0.01) for the two research points compared to the reference point (Lin). Concerning the Cr and Ni levels in stalk, a significant difference (p <0.01) was observed for both metals only in the samples taken from the former Fe-Ni mines, compared to the village of Lin. Meanwhile, the increased MDA level caused by oxidative stress was higher in the plants collected at the entrance of Pogradec, not only with the checkpoint (p <0.01) but also with the plants collected in the former Ni-Fe mine.																			2299-8993					APR	2019	20	4					114	120		10.12911/22998993/102794	http://dx.doi.org/10.12911/22998993/102794													WOS:000462924900015

We used multisource data in GIS environment; satellites, hydro-meteorological, socioeconomic and field data, to assess the role of various factors in the flooding. The event was aggravated by the geomorphic setup of the Valley. Tributaries in the south, characterized by high gradient, decreased time of runoff concentration and increased flood peakedness with short lag, almost simultaneously discharge enormous volumes of floodwaters into the Jhelum around Sangam. Owing to the flat gradient of the Jhelum from Sangam downstream (<5(o)), floods historically inundate vast areas in the stretch. The situation was exacerbated by the anthropogenic drivers, such as extensive urbanization of the floodplain, loss of wetlands, and decreased channel capacity due to the siltation from the deforested mountainous landscapes. The dilapidated flood control infrastructure and the institutional inability to manage the enormity of the event made the situation worst causing unprecedented damage to the infrastructure in the basin with the capital city Srinagar inundated up to approximate to 30ft for more than a week.

PCBs, PBDEs, and PAHs in Toronto air: Spatial and seasonal trends and implications for contaminant transport	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The distributions of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the atmosphere of Toronto, Canada and the surrounding suburban/rural area were examined. A series of temporally- and spatially-distributed air samples was collected over a 1-year period with a high-volume active air sampler at one downtown site and polyurethane foam passive air samplers at 19 sites. Passive sampler air concentrations of Sigma PAHs ranged from 0.27 to 51 ng/m(3). Concentrations of Sigma PCBs ranged from 6.0 to 1300 pg/m(3), and concentrations of Sigma PBDEs ranged from 0.47 to 110 pg/m(3). All compounds exhibited the highest concentrations in the urban core, and lowest concentrations in the surrounding rural areas, however the exact ratio depended on location since concentrations varied considerably within the city. Results from the application of a radial dilution model highlighted the influence of the central business district (CBD) of the city as a source of contaminants to the surrounding environment, however the radial dilution comparison also demonstrated that sources outside the CBD have a significant influence on regional contaminant concentrations. A strong relationship between temperature and partial pressure of the gas-phase PCBs, low molecular weight PBDEs and less-reactive PAHs suggested that their dominant emissions originated from temperature-controlled processes such as volatilization from local sources of PCBs, PAHs and PBDEs at warm temperatures, condensation and deposition of emissions at cold temperatures, and ventilation of indoor air with elevated concentrations. The relationship between temperature and atmospheric PAH concentrations varied along the urban-rural gradient, which suggested that in highly urbanized areas, such as downtown Toronto, temperature-related processes have a significant impact on air concentrations, whereas winter emissions from domestic heating have a greater influence in areas with less impervious surface coverage.

Lake Pyhajarvi was weakly mesotrophic in 1980-1996, Lake Koylionjarvi was highly eutrophic in 1991-1996, and Lake Littoistenjarvi was mesotrophic in 1993-1996 and eutrophic in 1992. In Lake Pyhajarvi, natural year-class fluctuations of vendace and smelt (range of combined biomass 5-28 kg ha(-1)) caused significant variation in planktivory. The very dense fish stocks of Lake Koylionjarvi (mainly roach, bream and smelt) were decimated from > 175 kg ha(-1) in 1991 to about 50 kg ha(-1) in 1996 by removal fishing. The roach stock of Lake Littoistenjarvi declined from about 71 kg ha(-1) to about 28 kg ha(-1) during 1993-1996. In Lake Pyhajarvi, strong stocks of planktivorous fish were accompanied with depressed crustacean zooplankton biomass, reduced role of calanoids and cladocerans, a low proportion of larger cladocerans (length > 0.5 mm), and a high chlorophyll level. In the lakes Littoistenjarvi and Koylionjarvi, zooplankton was dependent on both fish and phytoplankton: in spite of dense fish stocks, a high crustacean biomass developed in a phytoplankton peak year, but it was dominated by very small cladocerans. In Lake Pyhajarvi, late summer chlorophyll concentration was predictable from total phosphorus in water and cladoceran biomass (r(2) = 0.68), both factors explaining roughly similar fraction of total variation. In combined data from all three lakes, chlorophyll was almost solely dependent on total phosphorus, while the cladocerans were regulated both from below by productivity and from above by fish. Our data from Pyhajarvi lend support to consumer regulation of late summer phytoplankton; low chlorophyll values prevailed when planktivorous fish biomass was below 15 kg ha-(1) In large eutrophic lakes it may be difficult to reduce fish stocks to such a low level: in Lake Koylionjarvi, after six years of removal fishing, fish biomass still remained higher, and changes in plankton were accordingly small. Unexpectedly, in 1993-1996, phytoplankton biomass in Littoistenjarvi remained low in spite of low crustacean zooplankton biomass; submerged macrophytes probably regulated the water quality.					; Helminen, Harri/HZJ-8267-2023; Sarvala, Jouko/J-8962-2019	Vuorio, Kristiina/0000-0001-7974-0092; 													0018-8158	1573-5117					1997	363						81	95																WOS:000074552900007

However, the trophic transfer of MDC to consumers within macrophyte vegetation is largely unknown. We investigated the seasonality of delta C-13 in larval chironomids within Nelumbo nucifera (Gaertn.) and Trapa natans var. Japonica (Nakai) vegetation in the shallow, eutrophic Lake Izunuma in Japan. Over the past several years, N. nucifera has rapidly expanded across more than 80% of the lake surface. Prior to the expansion of N. nucifera (2007-2008), a previous study reported extremely low larval delta C-13 levels with peak sediment methane concentrations in August or September. After the expansion of N. nucifera (2014-2015), we observed extreme hypoxia as low as or lower than 1 mg l(-1) among the macrophyte coverage during June and August. During August and September, no larvae could be found among N. nucifera, and larvae in T. natans showed relatively high delta C-13 levels (> - 40aEuro degrees). In contrast, larvae were markedly C-13-depleted (down to - 60aEuro degrees) during October and November. The renewed supply of oxygen to the lake bottom may stimulate MOB activity, leading to an increase in larval assimilation of MDC. Our results suggest that macrophyte vegetation can affect the seasonality of MDC transfer to benthic consumers under hypoxic conditions in summer.

J	Duan, HT; Ma, RH; Hu, CM				Duan, Hongtao; Ma, Ronghua; Hu, Chuanmin			Evaluation of remote sensing algorithms for cyanobacterial pigment retrievals during spring bloom formation in several lakes of East China	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Using reflectance data and water sample data from 75 stations in several eutrophic lakes of East China (Lake Taihu, Lake Gehu, Lake Dongjiu) between 23 April and 3 May 2010, we evaluated several recently proposed remote sensing algorithms to estimate chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chla, 1.0-42 mu g/L) and phycocyanin pigment concentrations (PC, 0.1-7.7 mu g/L). These lakes experience phytoplankton blooms of the cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa every year due to eutrophication. It was found that after local tuning of the algorithm parameterizations, most algorithms yielded acceptable results for Chla retrievals while accurate PC retrievals were more challenging due to changing species composition (PC:Chla ratios) and low PC concentrations. For the data ranges in the study region, the best Chla algorithm yielded RMSErel (Relative Root Mean Square Error) of similar to 46% (R-2=0.92, n=75) and the best PC algorithm yielded RMSErel of similar to 83% (R-2=0.88, n=75). Based on these observations, it is recommended that local tuning of algorithm parameters should be performed for remote sensing applications, and future efforts should emphasize on application of the algorithms to satellite data.

The lake's biological communities may respond to changes in OM inputs caused by anthropogenic activities in the catchment. Testate amoebae (TA) possess an outer shell that preserves well in lake sediments and arc commonly used in paleo-environmental studies. Additionally, they fall into the size range of particles transported from peatlands to lakes, making them potential particle tracers. Here, we compared TA communities of current and pre-peat extraction sediments from lakes receiving OM only from peat extraction areas (impact lakes) with lakes receiving OM from peatlands under other uses (control lakes). We found no differences between control and impact lakes, neither between current and pre-peat extraction. In conclusion, there is either no significant increase in the amount of organic matter discharge from peatland areas, or dislodged testate amoeba are retained in areas upstream of the lakes.

Geoffrey			EXCHANGE FLOW IN A SHALLOW LAKE EMBAYMENT	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Convectively driven currents can arise in the littoral zones of lakes, as a result of either differential heating or differential cooling of the shallow water. The result of these flows is to produce a surface flow away from shore with a bottom return flow or a bottom flow away from shore with a surface return flow. Measurements taken in a shallow embayment of Clear Lake, California, USA, show the presence of both kinds of convectively driven flows under a large variety of summer conditions. The magnitude of these flows is sufficient to transport material a distance on the order of 0.5 km during such events. Through both advection and dispersion the net result of this process would be to reduce the accumulation of particles and particle-associated contaminants such as mercury in the littoral zone and to move them offshore where they are more prone to permanent burial or further transport.																			1051-0761	1939-5582				DEC	2008	18	8			SI		A89	A106		10.1890/06-1618.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/06-1618.1								19475920					WOS:000262606500007

However, owing to limited historical flood records, it is difficult to understand the processes and mechanisms of extreme floods in the LMR basin. In the present study, sediments from a high-altitude lake (Lake Baima, 4700 m above sea level) located in the upper-middle reaches of the LMR are used to reconstruct climate and hydrology variability since the last deglaciation based on a range of climate proxies and methods, including loss-on-ignition, grain size, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray fluorescence. Through the investigation of modern and historical floods in the LMR basin, we combine the climate proxies with hydrological frequency curves to reconstruct the paleoflood sequence during the Holocene. Our results suggest that the temperature and precipitation in southwestern China increased during the Holocene compared to the last deglaciation, indicating a response to changes in Northern Hemisphere summer solar insolation. In addition, Holocene sediments of Lake Baima are primarily composed of brown background layers and numerous light yellow/gray event layers. These event layers are further identified as flood events based on sedimentary facies, redness, and main exogenous elements content and their rate of change. The results show that extreme flood events in the LMR basin occurred more frequently during the early and late Holocene, with seven once-in-1000-year floods during the two intervals; while there were low-frequency flood periods during the mid-Holocene. The occurrence of Holocene floods may be related to external forcing, such as the abrupt changes in total solar irradiance (TSI) and volcanic activity, as well as the internal variability of the wider climate system including the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). When the TSI was low, the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in the Northern Hemisphere shifted northward, and the Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) moved eastward, accompanied with a negative phase of the PDO and La Nina-like phase of the ENSO. The air-sea interactions increased sea surface temperatures, leading to high precipitation and increasing flood risk in the LMR basin.

The abundance and diversity of age 0+ fish in different types of littoral habitats were examined along the longitudinal gradient of the reservoir during daytime. The impact of some physical attributes of the studied littoral habitats, e.g. slope steepness and substrate size, along with the season was the main factors affecting the distribution of age 0+ fish. The level of structural complexity was not a strong determinant, because the overall diversity and structural complexity of the available littoral habitats were relatively too low to have greater impact on the age 0+ fish distribution. The physical factors markedly influenced the spatial segregation between the two most important taxa in the reservoir-percids and cyprinids. Perch was the only representative of age 0+ percids in the littoral zone, which occupied steep-sloped habitats early in the season. In contrast, gently sloped habitats were mainly occupied by cyprinids later in the season. Species diversity was reflected in the occurrence of age 0+ cyprinids, achieving a maximum in gently sloped habitats in October. The effect of the longitudinal gradients on age 0+ fish distribution and diversity was generally far less significant, but was rather decisive during the period of a pronounced longitudinal trophic gradient during the summer season.					; Vasek, Mojmir/C-5839-2014; Cech, Martin/C-5797-2014; Peterka, Jiří/C-7218-2014; Matena, Josef/F-8254-2014; Znachor, Petr/F-8901-2014; Seda, Jaromir/F-9072-2014; Juza, Tomas/G-3159-2014; Draštík, Vladislav/G-2222-2014; Kubecka, Jan/A-8230-2011; Mrkvicka, Tomas/D-7173-2016; Muska, Milan/A-7978-2014	Peterka, Jiri/0000-0001-5935-4311; Vasek, Mojmir/0000-0001-6386-4015; Cech, Martin/0000-0003-1350-4286; Drastik, Vladislav/0000-0002-9419-6977; Kubecka, Jan/0000-0001-9203-4854; Muska, Milan/0000-0001-6659-986X													0018-8158	1573-5117				OCT	2012	696	1					185	198		10.1007/s10750-012-1207-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-012-1207-9													WOS:000307533000012

With this integrated monitoring system, it was found that the detectable maximum and average cyanobacterial bloom area were similar to that-before drinking water crisis, indicating that poor eutrophic status and cyanobacterial bloom had persisted without significant alleviation. It also revealed that cyanobacterial bloom would occur after the intense storm, which may be associated with the increase in buoyance of cyanobacterial colonies. Although the cyanobacterial blooms had persisted during the monitoring period, there had been a reduction in frequency and intensity of the cyanobacterial bloom induced black water agglomerates (a phenomenon of algal bloom death decay to release a large amount black dissolved organic matter), and there have been no further drinking water crises. This monitoring and response strategy can reduce the cyanobacterial bloom pollution risk, but cannot reduce eutrophication and cyanobacterial blooms, problems which will take decades to resolve.

Behavioral responses of rainbow smelt to in situ strobe lights	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We conducted in situ testing of strobe lights as a potential fish deterrent by examining avoidance and acclimation behaviors of rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax in Lake Oahe, South Dakota. Split-beam hydroacoustics were used to assess the effectiveness of the deterrent system by comparing proximal densities of rainbow smelt before and after the device was activated. In summer 2005, strobe lights successfully repelled rainbow smelt to a minimum horizontal distance of 21 m at both 1 h and 4 h postactivation; the model AGL-FH 920 flashhead produced a light intensity of 6,585 lumens per flash. Similarly in 2004, a model AGL-FH 901 flashhead, which produced a light intensity of 2,634 lumens per flash, repelled rainbow smelt to a horizontal distance of 15 m. A comparison of strata 10 m above and below the strobe light system showed that rainbow smelt were vertically displaced to approximately 6 m. We conclude that strobe lights elicit behavioral avoidance by rainbow smelt and may provide an effective means for reducing entrainment losses through Oahe Dam.					; Hamel, Martin/AAC-8493-2019	Hamel, Martin/0000-0001-5013-2907; 													0275-5947	1548-8675				APR	2008	28	2					394	401		10.1577/M06-254.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M06-254.1													WOS:000255310300006

The timing of these variations corresponds to known climatic shifts on the Northern Hemisphere. After a dry and cold Last Glacial Maximum the lake level of Nam Co initially rose at ca. 20k cal a BP. Moist but further cold conditions between ca. 16.2 and 14k cal a BP correspond to Heinrich Event 1. A warm and moist phase between ca. 14 and 13k cal a BP is expressed as a massive enhancement in inflow and biological productivity and might be associated with a first intensification of the Indian Ocean Summer Monsoon coinciding with the BOlling-AllerOd complex. A two-step decrease in inflow and a contemporaneous decline in biological productivity until ca. 11.8k cal a BP points to cool and dry conditions during the Younger Dryas. Lake levels peak at ca. 9.4k cal a BP, although hydrological conditions remain relatively stable during the Holocene with only low-amplitude variations observed.					; Daut, Gerhard/AAO-1514-2021; Zhu, Liping/AAC-4284-2022; Haberzettl, Torsten/AAV-9216-2021; Wang, Junbo/IVH-8446-2023	Haberzettl, Torsten/0000-0002-6975-9774; Zhu, Liping/0000-0002-4234-8748; Daut, Gerhard/0000-0001-7414-1103; 													0267-8179	1099-1417				JAN	2015	30	1					70	78		10.1002/jqs.2759	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jqs.2759													WOS:000348721100008

In this study, diurnal gaseous Hg exchanges were seasonally evaluated by means of a floating flux chamber in two freshwater environments impacted by anthropogenic sources of Hg, specifically historical mining activity (Solkan Reservoir, Slovenia) and the chlor-alkali industry (Torviscosa dockyard, Italy), and in a pristine site, Cavazzo Lake (Italy). The highest fluxes (21.88 +/- 11.55 ng m(-2) h(-1)) were observed at Solkan, coupled with high dissolved gaseous mercury (DGM) and dissolved Hg (THgD) concentrations. Conversely, low vertical mixing and saltwater intrusion at Torviscosa limited Hg mobility through the water column, with higher Hg concentrations in the deep layer near the contaminated sediments. Consequently, both DGM and THgD in surface water were generally lower at Torviscosa than at Solkan, resulting in lower fluxes (19.01 +/- 12.65 ng m(-2) h(-1)). However, at this site, evasion may also be limited by high atmospheric Hg levels related to dispersion of emissions from the nearby chlor-alkali plant. Surprisingly, comparable fluxes (15.56 +/- 12.78 ng m(-2) h(-1)) and Hg levels in water were observed at Cavazzo, suggesting a previously unidentified Hg input (atmospheric depositions or local geology). Overall, at all sites the fluxes were higher in the summer and correlated to incident UV radiation and water temperature due to enhanced photo production and diffusivity of DGM, the concentrations of which roughly followed the same seasonal trend.					; COVELLI, STEFANO/P-8796-2015; Acquavita, Alessandro/HJA-7574-2022; Floreani, Federico/ABE-5677-2021; Covelli, Stefano/P-8796-2015	Barago, Nicolo/0000-0001-8963-5034; COVELLI, STEFANO/0000-0002-0038-6658; FLOREANI, FEDERICO/0000-0002-0788-1635; ACQUAVITA, Alessandro/0000-0003-3990-3744; Klun, Katja/0000-0001-6111-1650; 														1660-4601				JUL	2022	19	13							8149	10.3390/ijerph19138149	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19138149								35805807					WOS:000824372800001

In this study, the short-term and long-term performance of closed-loop horizontal GHP systems in cold regions and the effectiveness of seasonal balancing were investigated. A period of 50 years was simulated to cover the life of a conventional system. A repeating block of heat exchangers at three depths was modeled in a series of 3D multi physics finite element simulations. Two operation modes were defined, representing the non-balanced mode and the seasonal balancing through the injection of lake water in summer. The climate conditions at the ground surface were explicitly modeled by defining a temperature boundary condition. A novel AI framework was developed to generate the projections of ground surface temperatures from air temperature and other atmospheric variables. An artificial neural network was trained using the air and ground temperature measurements at the nearby weather station. Several training approaches were compared to minimize prediction errors. The model was then used to convert the air temperatures from downscaled outputs of the CanESM2 climate model into surface temperatures. Finite element models, representing the two operation modes under three climate change scenarios and various heat exchanger spacing, were simulated and verified by comparing the resulting ground temperatures with the local measurements. The outputs were processed into extraction power, thermal output, and carbon emissions. Results suggest that in order to attain a stable heat extraction throughout a year, heat exchangers should be placed at depths that are not affected by seasonal variations of surface conditions. Simulations revealed thermal depletion and its inverse correlation with heat exchanger spacing. The seasonal balancing operation approach showed enhancement in total thermal output by 55%. The system was found to be resilient when subjected to the major climate pathways. In a rough estimate based on the average carbon footprint of electricity production in Canada, a system with 100 heat exchangers was found to save up to 800 tons and 1300 tons of equivalent CO2 emissions over its life, under the non-balanced and balanced operation modes, respectively. <comment>Superscript/Subscript Available</comment					; Fatolahzadeh Gheysari, Ali/ABD-8492-2021; Holländer, Hartmut/AAG-1743-2021; Shalaby, Ahmed/J-6331-2016	Fatolahzadeh Gheysari, Ali/0000-0003-3812-6883; Hollander, Hartmut/0000-0001-7583-1640; Shalaby, Ahmed/0000-0001-8670-5826													0375-6505	1879-3576				MAR	2021	91									10.1016/j.geothermics.2020.101979	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geothermics.2020.101979													WOS:000624125800007

This study examines the stratigraphy and geomorphological context of three tlateles in the eastern part of the former Lake Texcoco and correlates their phases of development with regional paleoclimatic trends from the seventh century b.c. to the sixteenth century. The results of this research indicate that fluvio-lacustrine (i.e., deltaic) sedimentation and freshwater springs in the lake basin were important features for the establishment of tlatel settlements in the highly dynamic and saline lacustrine environment. The formation and abandonment of the studied tlateles correlate with changes in other settlements and developments recorded in other parts of Lake Texcoco. Sites and sediments in the eastern part of Lake Texcoco provide proxy information on the lacustrine changes that accompanied the development of Tenochtitlan and other lacustrine settlements in its western part.

J	Stoyenoff, JL; Witter, JA				Stoyenoff, JL; Witter, JA			Distribution of first instar gypsy moths (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae) among saplings of four tree species common in the Great Lakes region	GREAT LAKES ENTOMOLOGIST												We examined the inter-tree distribution of first instar gypsy moth larvae under natural dispersal conditions in the field in Michigan in 1991. The study focused on saplings of northern red oak (Quercus rubra), white oak (Q. alba), red maple (Acer rubrum), and witch-hazel (Hamamelis virginiana), which are common understory components of forests in the Great Lakes region. Large-volume trees with foliage that is well-developed early in the spring should provide an excellent surface area for catching newly-hatched gypsy moth larvae, which are randomly dispersed by wind in the spring around the time of leaf flush or shortly thereafter. Comparing across tree species in our study, red maples had the largest crown volumes and well-flushed leaf material, but very few larvae were found on these trees at both sampling times in mid-May. Despite the lack of larvae on red maple, these trees were liberally covered with gypsy moth silk, indicating that many larvae landed on these plants but left rapidly when they apparently found the trees to be an unacceptable food source. Among the other three tree species, patterns of larval distribution reflected levels of host phenological development during both sampling periods, with more insects occurring on tree species that had more advanced leaf development. The highest numbers of larvae were found on northern red oak and witch-hazel. Intermediate numbers of insects were present on white oak, Trends in insect distribution also paralleled patterns seen in tree phenology across slope gradients. Defoliation ratings corresponded well to measures of first instar presence for each tree species. Northern red oak and witch-hazel trees experienced more early defoliation on average than did red maple and white oak. For those tree species that are acceptable hosts of the gypsy moth, average level of phenological development for a given tree, species, or forest stand at the time of larval dispersal can be an important predictor of plant or stand susceptibility to gypsy moth establishment and subsequent defoliation.																			0090-0222					FAL-WIN	2000	33	3-4					209	221																WOS:000175246000007
J	Dulov, LE				Dulov, LE			Transformation of organic compounds in the sediments of a eutrophic lake	MICROBIOLOGY												The decomposition of glucose, lactate, and butyrate was studied by the radioisotopic method in littoral sediments of a eutrophic lake over the period of spring water circulation. Fatty acids (C-2-C-4), CO2, and methane were revealed among the decomposition products. All the processes studied showed periodical oscillations with a frequency from two to several weeks and an amplitude of an order of magnitude or more. This periodicity was not directly related to variations in the environment, but was likely a result of the regulation of organic carbon flows in the microbial community, which was realized through changes in the rates of the production and consumption of different exometabolites. A direct correlation was revealed between acetate production from lactate and the content of acetate in the silt water. The rates of glucose, lactate, and butyrate mineralization increased throughout the entire investigation period.																			0026-2617					JAN-FEB	1996	65	1					115	121																WOS:A1996TX50600022

The impact of grazing was determined from April to November in the depth-sampling layers (0-7 and 7-20 m) in which most zooplankton organisms were concentrated. Selective grazing by consumers created spatial (vertical) and temporal variation in mortality exerted on the various phytoplankton groups. For example, the avoidance of dinoflagellates (characterized by peridinin) by most of the zooplankton organisms studied led to low grazing impacts (<280 ml liter(-1) d(-1)) on this phytoplankton group during all seasons. In contrast, preferential consumption of diatoms and chrysophytes (characterized by fucoxanthin) and chlorophytes and cyanobacteria (characterized by lutein and zeaxanthin) was recorded, depending on the zooplankton fraction in question. The grazing impact exerted on these phytoplanktonic groups was much higher than that measured on dinoflagellates, reaching values of 2,300 ml liter(-1) d(-1). Grazing mostly affected diatoms and chrysophytes in the 0-7-m layer and chlorophytes and cyanobacteria in the 7-20-m layer; the differences between these two layers were related to the heterogeneity in the vertical distribution of both phytoplankton cells and grazing organisms.																			0024-3590					DEC	1996	41	8					1767	1779		10.4319/lo.1996.41.8.1767	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1996.41.8.1767													WOS:A1996WR06100014

The enzyme could be easily extracted using a distilled water chloroform mixture suggesting that the alkaline phosphatase of Peridinium is particularly labile. The molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated as 158,000 .+-. 5000. The enzyme showed a broad pH optimum (in the range of pH 8.0-8.5), had a Km of 0.45 mM for p-nitrophenylphosphate as substrate and was stable to repeated freeze/thawing cycles. The enzyme was strongly activated by Mg2+ whereas Zn2+ (and to a lesser extent Cd2+) was an effective inhibitor of the enzyme. Cu2+ activated the enzyme at low concentrations, although at higher concentrations inhibited the enzyme. This effect of metals on the Peridinium alkaline phosphatase could be environmentally important since underwater hot springs, containing high concentrations of copper, enter the lake.																			1096-4959	1879-1107					1986	83	1					163	167		10.1016/0305-0491(86)90347-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0305-0491(86)90347-0													WOS:A1986AXZ5800025

This reservoir was warm and monomictic and was determined to vary between oligo- and meso-eutrophic status from year to year. Three sediment cores were collected from the deepest zone and frozen in situ during the short drying period, just after the emptying and before the refilling of the reservoir.

J	Birnie, JF				Birnie, JF			Devensian lateglacial palaeoecological changes in Shetland	BOREAS												Diatoms and plant macrofossils in Devensian Lateglacial lacustrine sediments in Shetland suggest that the earliest response to interstadial warming was from benthic aquatic communities that could develop under lake ice. Further warming permitted longer ice-free summers and plankton growth. The terrestrial vegetation communities responded more slowly. Pollen of land plants was then partly derived from long distance input. Macrofossils support a reconstruction of terrestrial vegetation of sparse Salix herbacea and mosses in the early interstadial, increasing to grass tundra with tall herbs and Empetrum locally present, and with patches of disturbed ground. The occurrence of Betula and Juniperus remains questionable because of a lack of macrofossils, despite the presence of their pollen. Rumex pollen peaks suggest significant local presence at the stadial/ Interstadial transitions. Overall, the palaeoenvironmental reconstruction at this isolated oceanic site depends on several proxy indicators, of which pollen is less reliable than diatoms and plant macrofossils.																			0300-9483	1502-3885				SEP	2000	29	3					205	218																WOS:000089797700005

Examination of their stomach contents revealed that fish, particularly Galaxias maculatus, formed the bulk of the food of the salmon. Other items eaten included Amphipoda, Cladocera, Ostracoda and Decapoda (Crustacea), Odonata, Coleoptera, Diptera, Trichoptera and Hemiptera (Insecta) and Gastropoda (Mollusca). At the end of their first 3 mo. in the lake the salmon had increased 85% in length and over 670% in weight. After 2 yr in the lake their length was 582 mm and their weight was 2.73 kg. Growth rate was lowest in spring when the relative amount of fish in the stomach contents was at its lowest and there was a greater diversity of food types in the diet.																				1095-8649					1981	18	3					321	330		10.1111/j.1095-8649.1981.tb03773.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1981.tb03773.x													WOS:A1981LH00700008
J	Silk, M; Falcous, M				Silk, M; Falcous, M			One day in September/A week in February: Mobilizing American (sporting) nationalisms	SOCIOLOGY OF SPORT JOURNAL												In an ongoing effort to "police the crisis" (see Denzin, 2004a and b; Denzin & Lincoln, 2003) and critically interrogate the tyrannical (govern)mentality of conservative rhetoric centered on a peculiar or juridical concept of "right" (Baudrillard, 2001; Johnson, 2002; McClaren, 2002) under the agenda of "9/11 America," this article explores the official moral pedagogies of the sporting media. Through analysis of the media representations of two major sporting events that took place in the first week of February, 2002-the delayed Super Bowl and the opening of the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics-the article focuses on the place of sport as an economy of affect through which power, privilege, politics, and position are (re)produced. The "epistemic panic" (Gordon, 1997; Ladson-Billings, 2000) played out through these two events can be read as part of the wider self-examining, self-referential, existential narrative of the American nation in the wake of the ontological, social, and historical disruption (Giroux, 2002) wrought by 9/11-a politicized and militaristic rhetoric appropriated within, and mobilized through, the affective realm of the sporting popular.

Hydrogeological impacts of road salt from Canada's busiest highway on a Lake Ontario watershed (Frenchman's Bay) and lagoon, City of Pickering	JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY												The quantity of deicing salt applied to paved surfaces in urban watersheds in cold regions has had a significant and cumulative effect on groundwater quality. Whereas road deicing salt is known in general to impact groundwater and surface waterquality, quantitative information on the impact of large transport routes is lacking. In this study, we provide a chloride mass balance for an urban stream crossed by a large transport route in south-central Ontario, Canada and quantify likely long-term impacts of salt loading on surface and groundwater resources. The chloride mass balance, supported by hydrochemical analysis, reveals that approximately 50% of the total road salt applied to Pine Creek (1700 tonnes per winter) is removed annually via overland flow with the remainder accumulating in the shallow subsurface resulting in severe degradation of groundwater quality. Moreover, results show that road salt migration is the primary reason for enhanced mineral weathering in the shallow aquifer. During the 2004-05 salting season, runoff and baseflow transport of road salts were responsible for chloride concentrations in the stream of up to 2000 mg L-1, and delivered approximately 850 tonnes of chloride (about 1400 tonnes of salt) to a shallow (<3.5 m) semi-enclosed lagoon on the shore of Lake Ontario (Frenchman's Bay; 0.85 km(2)). The total chloride delivery to the lagoon from its entire watershed is estimated at 3700 tonnes each year with up to 48% of the total load delivered by baseflow, the remainder from surface water runoff. Present day groundwater chloride concentrations are estimated to be about 80% of long-term concentrations when the system reaches steady state. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We have developed a new genome-wide SNP genotyping array to study patterns of genetic variation in sticklebacks over a wide geographic range, and to scan the genome for regions that contribute to repeated evolution of marine-freshwater or benthic-limnetic species pairs. Surveying 34 global populations with 1,159 informative markers revealed substantial genetic variation, with predominant patterns reflecting demographic history and geographic structure. After correcting for geographic structure and filtering for neutral markers, we detected large repeated shifts in allele frequency at some loci, identifying both known and novel loci likely contributing to marine-freshwater and benthiclimnetic divergence. Several novel loci fall close to genes implicated in epithelial barrier or immune functions, which have likely changed as sticklebacks adapt to contrasting environments. Specific alleles differentiating sympatric benthic-limnetic species pairs are shared in nearby solitary populations, suggesting an allopatric origin for adaptive variants and selection pressures unrelated to sympatry in the initial formation of these classic vertebrate species pairs.

Tracing stable isotope values from meteoric water to groundwater in the southwestern part of the Chad basin	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												The southwestern Chad basin is a semi-arid region with annual rainfall that is generally less than 500 mm and over 2,000 mm of evapotranspiration. Surface water in rivers is seasonal, and therefore groundwater is the perennial source of water supply for domestic and other purposes. Stable isotope has been measured for rainwater, surface water and groundwater samples in this region. The stable isotope data have been used to understand the interrelationships between the rainwater, surface water, shallow and deep groundwater of this region. This is being used in a qualitative sense to demonstrate present day recharge to the groundwater. Stable isotope in rainwater for the region has an average value of -4 parts per thousand delta O-18 and -20 parts per thousand delta H-2. Surface water samples from rivers and Lake Chad fall on the evaporation line of this average value. The Upper Zone aquifer water samples show stable isotope signal with a wide range of values indicating the complex character of the aquifer Zone with three distinguishable units. The wide range of values is attributable to waters from individual unit and/or mixture of waters of different units. The Middle and Lower aquifers Zones' waters show similar stable isotopes values, probably indicating similarity in timing and/or mechanism of recharge. These are palaeowaters probably recharged under a climate that is different from today. The Upper Zone aquifer is presently being recharged as some of its waters show stable isotope compositions similar to those of average rainfall waters of the region.

Influence of porewater sulfide on methylmercury production and partitioning in sulfate-impacted lake sediments	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												In low-sulfate and sulfate-limited freshwater sediments, sulfate loading increases the production of methylmercury (MeHg), a potent and bioaccumulative neurotoxin. Sulfate loading to anoxic sediments leads to sulfide production that can inhibit mercury methylation, but this has not been commonly observed in freshwater lakes and wetlands. In this study, sediments were collected from sulfate-impacted, neutral pH, surface water bodies located downstream from ongoing and historic mining activities to examine how chronic sulfate loading produces porewater sulfide, and influences MeHg production and transport. Sediments were collected over two years, during several seasons from lakes with a wide range of overlying water sulfate concentration. Samples were characterized for in-situ solid phase and porewater MeHg, Hg methylation potentials via incubations with enriched stable Hg isotopes, and sulfur, carbon, and iron content and speciation. Porewater sulfide reflected historic sulfur loading and was strongly related to the extractable iron content of sediment. Overall, methylation potentials were consistent with the accumulation of MeHg on the solid phase, but both methylation potentials and MeHg were significantly lower at chronically sulfate-impacted sites with a low solid-phase Fe:S ratio. At these heavily sulfate-impacted sites that also contained elevated porewater sulfide, both MeHg production and partitioning are influenced: Hg methylation potentials and sediment MeHg concentrations are lower, but occasionally porewater MeHg concentrations in sediment are elevated, particularly in the spring. The dual role of sulfide as a ligand for inorganic mercury (decreasing bioavailability) and methylmercury (increasing partitioning into porewater) means that elucidating the role of iron and sulfur loads as they define porewater sulfide is key to understanding sulfate's influence on MeHg production and partitioning in sulfate-impacted freshwater sediment.

Lahars of Ruapehu Volcano, New Zealand: risk mitigation	ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY, VOL 45, 2007	Annals of Glaciology-Series				International Symposium on Earth and Planetary Ice-Volcano Interactions	JUN 19-23, 2006	Univ Iceland, Inst Earth Sci, Reykjavik, ICELAND		Univ Iceland, Inst Earth Sci			A dam-break lahar resulting from the last eruption of Ruapehu is expected when Crater Lake reaches a critical high level, probably within the next 1-5 summers. A high level of public consultation, political decision-making and ongoing scientific input has occurred to address the risks. Decisions about managing lahar risk have taken into account the fact that lahars are common on the active Ruapehu Volcano (2797m) and in valleys draining the mountain and that most lahars are generated by eruptions, about half of which have no useful precursors. Lahars threaten New Zealand's largest ski area and nationally important infrastructure. Public safety has been the main consideration but the need for long-term risk mitigation and reducing impacts on Tongariro National Park World Heritage Area have also been important. Lahar mitigation on Ruapehu now includes six lahar warning systems, each with active response plans, and some infrastructure isolated from or hardened against lahars.																			0260-3055		978-0-946417-40-7				2007	45						155	162		10.3189/172756407782282390	http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/172756407782282390													WOS:000250427700018

Hydroacoustic assessment of mono- and polymorphic Coregonus density and biomass in subarctic lakes	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Density and biomass estimates of pelagic fish are essential to understand food web interactions and ecosystem functioning. We conducted surveys of six subarctic lakes for assessing both mono-and polymorphic whitefish Coregonus lavaretus (L.) populations. Monomorphic whitefish lakes were inhabited by a habitat and diet generalist, large sparsely rakered (LSR) morph, whereas polymorphic whitefish lakes had a littoral benthivorous LSR morph, a pelagic planktivorous densely rakered (DR) morph and in two cases a benthivorous small sparsely rakered (SSR) morph inhabiting the profundal zone. In addition, an introduced specialist zooplanktivore, vendace Coregonus albula (L.), inhabited one of the monomorphic lakes. Hydroacoustics was found to be an appropriate method for estimating coregonid densities and biomasses in large and deep polymorphic lakes occupied by the planktivorous DR morph or vendace, but only during dark nights in autumn. The suitability of hydroacoustic assessment for benthivorous LSR and SSR morphs was low, especially in polymorphic whitefish lakes due to their preference for near-bottom habitat or shallow areas not sampled with hydroacoustics. The pelagic density of DR morph varied from 330 to 1780 fish.ha(-1) and biomass from 1.4 to 13.3 kg.ha(-1) in polymorphic whitefish lakes, whereas corresponding estimates for LSR morph were 10-320 fish.ha(-1) and 0.5-8.4 kg.ha(-1) in monomorphic whitefish lakes. In general, polymorphism tended to increase the density and biomass of whitefish in the pelagic area compared with monomorphic systems.					; Tuomaala, Anna-Kaisa/AGE-2647-2022	Kahilainen, Kimmo/0000-0002-1539-014X; 													0906-6691	1600-0633				JUL	2014	23	3					424	437		10.1111/eff.12096	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12096													WOS:000337683700013
J	An, KG; Park, SS; Ahn, KH; Urchin, CG				An, KG; Park, SS; Ahn, KH; Urchin, CG			Dynamics of nitrogen, phosphorus, algal biomass, and suspended solids in an artificial lentic ecosystem and significant implications of regional hydrology on trophic status.	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												Chemical and biological parameters were analyzed to examine how regional hydrological fluctuations influence water quality of a artificial lentic ecosystem over a two-year period The intensity of seasonal monsoon rain accounted for most of annual inflow and discharge and influenced flow pathway (interflow vs. overflow), resulting in a modification of chemical and biological conditions. Sharp contrasting interannual hydrology of intense vs. weak monsoon occurred during the study. The intense monsoon disrupted thermal stratification and resulted in ionic dilution, high TP and high inorganic solids (NVSS) in the headwater reach. The variation of NVSS accounted 75% of TP variation (slope = 4.14, p < 0.01, n = 48). Regression analysis of residual chlorophyll-a (Chl) versus flushing rate indicated that short hydraulic retention time and high mineral turbidity affected algal growth in the headwater reach during summer monsoon. In contrast, severe drought during weak monsoon produced strong thermal stratification, low inorganic solids, high total dissolved solids (TDS), and low TP in the entire system. In addition, Chl concentrations were controlled by phosphorus. Based on the physical, chemical and biological parameters, riverine conditions, dominated during the intense monsoon, but lacustrine conditions were evident during the weak monsoon. The interannual dynamics suggest that monsoon seasonality is considered the main forcing factor regulating overall functions and processes of the waterbody and this characteristic has an important implication to eutrophication of the system.					; Ahn, Kunhyuck/D-4515-2011	An, Kwang-Guk/0000-0003-2018-580X; 													0254-8704					JAN	2003	24	1					29	38											12974409					WOS:000181039900005

Therefore, understanding the wind regimes is necessary in sand dune research. In this study, we combined the wind data from 2017 to 2019 at four meteorological stations (Cherigele and Wuertabulage stations in the lake basins, and Yikeri and Sumujilin stations on the top of sand dunes) in the hinterland of the Badain Jaran Desert in China, with high resolution Google Earth images to analyze the correlation between the wind energy environments and dune morphology. The results of data analysis indicated that both the wind direction and sand drift intensity exhibited notable spatial and temporal variations. The highest level of wind activity was observed in spring. Northwesterly and northeasterly winds were the dominant in the Badain Jaran Desert. At the Cherigele, Wuertabulage, and Yikeri stations, the drift potential (DP) was below 200.00 vector units (VU). The wind energy environments in most areas could be classified as low-energy environments. The resultant drift direction differed at different stations and in different seasons, but the overall direction was mainly the southeast. The resultant drift potential (RDP)/DP ratio was greater than 0.30 in most parts of the study area, suggesting that the wind regimes mainly exhibited unimodal or bimodal characteristics. Differences between the thermodynamic properties and the unique landscape settings of lakes and sand dunes could alter the local circulation and intensify the complexity of the wind regimes. The wind regimes were weaker in the lake basins than on the top of sand dunes. Transverse dunes were the most dominant types of sand dunes in the study area, and the wind regimes at most stations were consistent with sand dune types. Wind was thus the main dynamic factor affecting the formation of sand dunes in the Badain Jaran Desert BJD. The results of this study are important for understanding the relationship between the wind regimes and aeolian landforms of the dune field in the deserts.																			1674-6767	2194-7783				MAY	2022	14	5					473	489		10.1007/s40333-022-0063-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40333-022-0063-3		MAY 2022											WOS:000796789800001

In 2003, topmouth gudgeon (Pseudorasbora parva) was detected in enormous amounts in all of the investigated fishponds. P. parva got into the fishponds spontaneously by water inflow from connecting channels. The objective of this paper is to describe the condition of natural food in the presence of P. parva and its subsequent effect on carp production. The estimation of the population density of P. parva achieved at least 44 kg ha(-1) in 2003. In 2004, precautions against P. parva invasion were taken and its presence wasn't recorded during the season. The impact of P. parva on natural food structure was described in terms of zooplankton and zoobenthos amounts and main fish production parameters. A special focus has been taken on the density of Daphnia genus and chironomid larvae, the most preferred zooplanktonic and zoobenthic groups in feed of P. parva, respectively. In 2003, P. parva suppressed the zooplankton populations significantly, especially large cladocerans of the Daphnia genus. Influence of P. parva on zoobenthos structure and density was not detectable. Unfavorable natural food condition in 2003 caused extremely low carp production which fell to the mean value of 283 kg ha(-1) and food conversion ratio reached 3.5. On the contrary, in 2004 the mean carp production and food conversion ratio attained 634 kg ha(-1) and 1.6, respectively. The results described harmful competitive effect of huge populations of P. parva and its surprising economic consequences. Costs per 1 kg of growth were increased by approximately 100% in 2003 compared with results from season 2004.

Light versus food supply as factors modulating niche partitioning in two pelagic mixotrophic ciliates	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We studied the vertical distribution of two mixotrophic ciliates, Ophrydium naumanni and Stentor araucanus in two contrasting summer seasons (strong vs. mild windy years) to determine whether differences in vertical mixing affect their success by changes in light availability for their endosymbiotic algae. Field experiments were done to evaluate the effect of light climate on the photosynthetic efficiency. To test for a potential overlap in food niche we studied prokaryote abundance and examined food vacuole contents of the ciliates, using the catalyzed reported deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH). S. araucanus, a species resistant to ultraviolet radiation, was present in the epilimnion. In contrast, O. naumanni preferred the metalimnetic layers and was more abundant in years with deeper thermoclines. Variation in the diffuse extinction coefficient was significantly correlated with S. araucanus abundance, suggesting a shading effect of this dark ciliate. The expected extinction coefficient due to Stentor, measured by spectrophotometric analyses, did not differ from that observed in nature. O. naumanni was found to be photosynthetically efficient at low light intensities and susceptible to photoinhibition at epilimnetic light irradiances. Conversely, S. araucanus needed a high light supply to maintain endosymbiotic algal photosynthesis and was favored during years of relatively shallow thermocline and high epilimnetic mean irradiance. CARD-FISH analysis revealed that O. naumanni fed on Archea, Eubacteria, and picocyanobacteria. In contrast, S. araucanus did not feed on prokaryotes. Based on these results, we suggest that light climate, created by temporal or spatial variations in thermocline depth, is a key factor modulating niche partitioning for mixotrophic ciliate species.

Mortality of ducklings of the black-bellied whistling duck (Dendrocygna autumnalis) during their premier swim in a hypersaline lake in South Texas	SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST												Adult black-bellied whistling ducks (Dendrocygna autumnalis) were observed leaving islands with recently hatched young in a South Texas hypersaline lake during summer 2003. We counted 216 ducklings from 20 broods attempting to make their first swim to the mainland, presumably heading for suitable rearing habitat. Of these, 144 (67%) either died in the water or on the salt-encrusted shoreline within minutes to a few hours of first entering the water. An additional 35 carcasses from unobserved broods were found. Nine carcasses of ducklings were necropsied and they had levels of sodium in the brain above the lethal threshold concentration for sodium poisoning. From our surveillance efforts, we documented a decrease in maximum number of adult black-bellied whistling ducks observed on the islands from 489 in 2002 to 138 in 2003.																			0038-4909	1943-6262				JUN	2008	53	2					230	235		10.1894/0038-4909(2008)53[230:MODOTB]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1894/0038-4909(2008)53[230:MODOTB]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000257150700013

The hypothesis is advanced that at 16,100 B.P. a cool semi-arid environment supporting a sparse or scattered Eucalyptus-Callitris woodland with an understory of grasses, Asteraceae and Chenopodiaceae dominated the region. From this time the lake level fell and was at its lowest between 15,000 and 10,000 B.P. At about the same time Casuarina migrated into the region as Callitris, Asteraceae and Chenopodiaceae declined. There was a period from 9600 to 9200 B.P. when Acacia and Dodonaea were common around Lake Bullenmerri, but these declined and were replaced by the Eucalyptus-Casuarina woodland with a herbaceous understory which persisted through the Holocene period in western Victoria until it was cleared by European settlers.																			0307-692X						1979	4	4					419	427		10.1111/j.1442-9993.1979.tb01570.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.1979.tb01570.x													WOS:A1979JC33300007

Microbial Mats of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica: Oases of Biological Activity in a Very Cold Desert	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Cyanobacterial mats in the Antarctic Dry Valleys are photosynthetic microbial ecosystems living at the extreme of conditions on Earth with respect to temperature, light, water and nutrient availability. They are metabolically active for about 8 weeks during the austral summer when temperatures briefly rise above freezing and glacial and lake melt waters are available. There is much to learn about the biogeochemical impact of mats in these environments and the microbial communities associated with them. Our data demonstrate that these mats attain surprisingly high rates of carbon (CO2) and dinitrogen (N-2) fixation when liquid water is available, in some cases comparable to rates in warmer temperate or tropical environments. C and N-2 fixation in Dry Valley mats in turn substantially elevate dissolved organic C and inorganic N pools and thereby promote enhanced microbial secondary production. Moreover, the microbial community fingerprint of these mats is unique compared with the more ubiquitous dry soils that do not contain mats. Components of the heterotrophic microbiota may also contribute substantially to N inputs through N-2 fixation.

In this study, we selected the Daheiting Reservoir (DHTR) in North China, with a pronounced water level gradient, to investigate internal N and P loadings, estimate N and P fluxes across the sediment?water interface based on the pore water profiles, and reveal the potential effects of water discharge from an upstream reservoir and high-intensity cage aquaculture on the risks of internal N and P release. The results indicated that DHTR presented with severe internal nutrient loadings, and the N and P fluxes showed significant spatiotemporal variations. NH4+ -N and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) fluxes were higher in deep areas (averages of 26.14 and 9.9 mg m(-2) d(-1), respectively) than in shallow areas near inflows (averages of 5.0 and 1.24 mg m(-2) d(-1), respectively). Unexpectedly, the estimated NH4+ -N and SRP fluxes were the lowest in summer (averages of 3.94 and 0.33 mg m(-2) d(-1), respectively), which may have been influenced by seasonal thermal stratification and copious discharge from the hypolimnion of the upstream reservoir (Panjiakou Reservoir). Comparison of annual internal and external N and P loadings revealed that water discharge from the upstream Panjiakou Reservoir was the dominant source of N and P to the reservoir, contributing up to 83.6% of N input and 55.4% of P input. The internal P loading also contributed to water eutrophication to a great extent, accounting for 34.7% of the total P input. Our results highlight the impact of upstream reservoir discharge operation on downstream reservoir water quality and the importance of controlling the internal nutrient loading in cascade reservoirs, and further provide theoretical and practical foundations for the development of policies and strategies to conserve reservoir ecosystems.					zhang, min/IYI-9869-2023; Wu, Tao/C-8594-2019; Liu, Cheng/AAC-5395-2020	Liu, Cheng/0000-0002-3526-7026; 													0301-4797	1095-8630				OCT 15	2022	320								115884	10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.115884	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.115884		AUG 2022						35940015					WOS:000863447800005

Climatology of Severe Hail in Finland: 1930-2006	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												A climatology of severe hail (2 cm in diameter or larger) in Finland was constructed by collecting newspaper, storm-spotter, and eyewitness reports. The climatology covered the warm season (1 May-14 September) during the 77-yr period of 1930-2006. Altogether, 240 severe-hail cases were found. The maximum reported severe-hail size was mainly 4 cm in diameter or less (65% of the cases), with the number of cases decreasing as hail size increased. In a few extreme cases, 7-8-cm (baseball sized) hailstones have been reported in Finland. Most of the severe-hail cases (84%) occurred from late June through early August, with July being the peak month (almost 66% of the cases). Most severe hail fell during the afternoon and early evening hours 1400-2000 local time (LT). Larger hailstones (4 cm or larger) tended to occur a little later (1600-2000 LT) than smaller (2-3.9 cm) hailstones (1400-1800 LT). Most severe-hail cases occurred in southern and western Finland, generally decreasing to the north, with the majority of the cases near population centers. The proportion of severe hail less than 4 cm in diameter is greatest over the agricultural area in southwestern Finland where crop damage caused by severe hail is more likely to be reported. The underreporting of hail is a particular problem across much of Finland because of the vast forest and lake areas, low population density, and relatively small hail swaths. Since the 1990s, a greater interest in severe weather among the general public and media, a storm-spotter network, improved communications technology, and an official Web site for reporting hail have increased the number of reported hail cases. According to the most recent 10 yr (1997-2006), Finland experiences an annual average of 10 severe-hail cases during 5 severe-hail days.

As impounded lakes along the Eastern Route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project, Lakes Hongze and Luoma play a key role in water resource management, making the prediction of cyanobacterial blooms in these lakes particularly important. To address this, satellite remote sensing data were utilized to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of cyanobacterial blooms in these lakes. Subsequently, a precise machine learning model, integrating the Projection Pursuit Model and Random Forest (PP-RF) algorithms, was developed to predict the extent of cyanobacterial blooms, considering a range of influencing factors, including physical, chemical, climatic, and hydrologic variables. The findings indicated pronounced seasonal fluctuations in cyanobacterial blooms, with higher levels in summer than in other seasons. Key determinants for cyanobacterial blooms prediction included solar radiation, temperature and total nitrogen for Lake Hongze, while for Lake Luoma, significant predictors were identified as temperature, water temperature, and solar radiation. Compared with traditional data preprocessing methods, PP-RF model has advantages in addressing multicollinearity. This study provides a feasible method for predicting cyanobacterial blooms in impounded lakes within inter-basin water transfer projects. By inputting region-specific data, this model could be applied broadly, contributing to against the adverse effects of cyanobacterial blooms and provide scientific guidance for the protection and management of aquatic ecosystems.

These pollutants are found ubiquitously in the environment, including commercially valuable aquatic organisms. Vietnam is one of the world's largest exporters of seafood, including bivalves. At the same time, comprehensive monitoring studies of aquatic ecosystems in Vietnam are insufficient and not coordinated and are mainly aimed at detecting heavy metals. We studied concentrations of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs (DDT, HCH)) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in bivalves of four genera (Corbicula, Geloina, Ensidens, Scabies) collected from the Mekong Delta and Saigon-Dong Nai River Delta as well as purchased freshly caught at local markets in the spring of 2017 and 2018 before the rainy season. The studied watercourses and waterbodies can be arranged in the following order of increasing pollution: Lake Binh Thien - Hau River - Tien River - Ba Lai River - Saigon-Dong Nai River. The surveyed areas of mangrove ecosystems in the provinces of Kien Giang and Bac Lieu cannot be included in this order, since they are inhabited by mangrove clams Geloina sp. of the family Cyrenidae, which are bivalves with narrow specialization. Currently, the major factors responsible for the OCP pollution in South Vietnam may be agricultural activities and industrial sectors which disregard the recommendations and bans on the use of these hazardous compounds, along with the persisting unfavorable background in the form of DDE being a consequence of the wide application of DDT until 1995.

Differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry was used for the analyses. The results show that biological processes dominate the speciation. They are responsible for high concentrations of atomic mercury and also organomercury compounds. The oxidation of atomic mercury under environmental conditions in lake water is very slow, so that the equilibrium between Hg-aq(0) and Hg-aq(2+) can only be established during long periods of decreased bioactivity, as in wintertime. The sedimentation of the detritus during summer leads to a very pronounced decrease of the overall mercury concentration in the entire water body of the lakes.																			0306-7319						1997	68	3					347	368		10.1080/03067319708030500	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03067319708030500													WOS:000076138000004

Overall, hydrological change can significantly influence the riparian environment and shift the riparian vegetation. Although numerous studies have investigated the short-term responses of riparian plants to water level fluctuation in this zone, few have addressed long-term effects. In this study, four permanent plots in the WLFZ of the canyon landform area were chosen to evaluate the long-term responses of riparian plants to water level fluctuation from 2008 to 2015 and to screen candidate plants for ecological restoration. We recorded 146 species in 2008, 110 species in 2009, 68 species in 2012 and 69 species in 2015, indicating a conspicuous loss in riparian plants. Most of the remnant plants were annual and perennial herbs. Of the native species present in 2008, 82, 22 and 8 had disappeared in 2009, 2012 and 2015, respectively. Simultaneously, 45, 15 and 11 non-native species were first found, respectively. Additionally, over half of the native and the non-native species were not found after being subjected to a water level fluctuation. From 2008 to 2015, only 27 native species always presented; however, not all of them were chosen as candidates for ecological restoration because of their decreased importance values. In contrast, the importance value of Cynodon dactylon increased over time, suggesting its high tolerance to long-term winter flooding. We concluded that riparian plants' composition of the canyon landform area dramatically declined after long-term water level fluctuation and their presence was determined by the novel hydrological condition. Our results also suggested that Cynodon dactylon or its combination with other species (i.e. Digitaria chrysoblephara, Setaria glauca, Setaria viridis) is a better candidate for ecological restoration in the WLFZ.

The appraisal of surface water quality to ascertain its utility in such ecologically sensitive areas is need of the hour. The present study envisages the application of multivariate analysis, water utility class and conventional graphical representation to reveal the hidden factor responsible for deterioration of water quality and determine the hydrochemical facies and its evolution processes of water types in Nalagarh valley, India. The quality assessment is made by estimating pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), total hardness, major ions (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3-, Cl-, SO42-, NO3- and PO43-), dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen demand (BOD) and total coliform (TC) to determine its suitability for drinking and domestic purposes. The parameters like pH, TDS, TH, Ca2+, HCO3-, Cl-, SO42-, NO3- are within the desirable limit as per Bureau of Indian Standards (Indian Standard Drinking Water Specification (Second Edition) IS:10500. Indian Standard Institute, New Delhi, pp 1-18, 2012). Mg2+, Na+ and K+ ions for pre monsoon and EC during pre and post monsoon at few sites and approx 40% samples of BOD and TC for both seasons exceeds the permissible limits indicate organic contamination from human activities. Water quality classification for designated use indicates that maximum surface water samples are not suitable for drinking water source without conventional treatment. The result of piper trillinear and Chadha's diagram classified majority of surface water samples for both seasons fall in the fields of Ca2+-Mg2+-HCO3- water type indicating temporary hardness. PCA and CA reveal that the surface water chemistry is influenced by natural factors such as weathering of minerals, ion exchange processes and anthropogenic factors. Thus, the present paper illustrates the importance of multivariate techniques for reliable quality characterization of surface water quality to develop effective pollution reduction strategies and maintain a fine balance between the industrialization and ecological integrity.

Most instances of multiple-lake usage fell into 1 of 5 categories: (1) territorial defense of 2 or more lakes by a breeding pair, (2) post-reproductive wandering, (3) territorial shifts prior to breeding, (4) dispersal of displaced breeders, or (5) long-distance movements by young birds. Overall, distances moved by adult loons between lakes were shorter than expected. The frequency of such movements might indicate reconnaissance for new territories, consistent with the frequent territorial takeover observed in this species. Regular use by loons of small clusters of lakes suggests that a management strategy that preserves only small, isolated breeding lakes might be inadequate to sustain nesting pairs and also might hamper natural dispersal between lakes.																			0022-541X					OCT	1997	61	4					1253	1261		10.2307/3802124	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3802124													WOS:000071737200029

The methods are: (1) the Martinec and Rango degree-day method; and (2) Woolridge et al. method of determining the average yearly snowfall from tree morphology; (3) precipitation gage measurements from the Wyoming Water Research Center Snowy Range Observatory; (4) NADP collector data; (5) an independent estimate from snow core data from a small catchment in the GLEES. Estimated water input ranged from a low 65 cm H2O (liquid water equivalent) for the precipitation gage to a high of 85 cm H2O for the Martinec and Rango method.

J	Nesbitt, M				Nesbitt, Monica			THE RISE AND FALL OF THE NORTHERN CITIES SHIFT: SOCIAL AND LINGUISTIC REORGANIZATION OF TRAP IN TWENTIETH-CENTURY LANSING, MICHIGAN	AMERICAN SPEECH												Recent acoustic analyses examining English in the North American Great Lakes region show that the area's characteristic vowel chain shift, the Northern Cities Shift (NCS), is waning. Attitudinal analyses suggest that the NCS has lost prestige in some NCS cities, such that it is no longer regarded as "standard American English." Sociocultural and temporal accounts of capital loss and dialect decline remain unexplored, however. This article examines F-1, F-2, and diphthongal quality of TRAP produced by 36 White speakers (18 women and 18 men) in one NCS city-Lansing, Michigan-over the course of the twentieth century. Results show that TRAP realization is conditioned by gender and birth year, such that women led the change toward NCS realizations into the middle of the twentieth century and then away from them thereafter. These findings reflect the backdrop of deindustrialization during this time of linguistic reorganization in Lansing and show that as the regional industry-(auto) manufacturing-loses prestige, so does the regional variant, raised TRAP. This article expands our understanding of North American dialectology by adding the importance of deindustrialization and the Baby Roomer to Generation X generational transition to our discussion of regional dialect maintenance.																			0003-1283	1527-2133				AUG 1	2021	96	3					332	370		10.1215/00031283-8791754	http://dx.doi.org/10.1215/00031283-8791754													WOS:000694952600003

Microcystin concentrations and cell quotas in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT					8th Conference on the State of Lake Huron: Ecosystem Change, Habitat and Management	2007	Honey Harbour, CANADA	Aquat Ecosyst Hlth & Management Soc, Lake Huron Binatl Partnership				Distribution of the toxin microcystin was studied in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron during two summer (August) cruises in 2003-2004. Intracellular microcystin concentrations averaged 1.1 mu g l(-1) (range 0.01-3.5 mu g l(-1)), and extracellular concentrations averaged only 0.09 mu g l(-1) (range 0.01-0.18 mu g l(-1)). Highest microcystin concentrations were found in the nearshore regions of the bay, which were shallow and had high total phosphorus concentrations. Microcystin concentrations were strongly correlated with Microcystis aeruginosa abundance (r = 0.8). M. aeruginosa abundance was strongly correlated with total phosphorus, and growth rates were negatively correlated with C:P ratio. Particulate nutrient ratios suggested that Saginaw Bay algae were severely phosphorus deficient. Microcystin cell quotas for M. aeruginosa averaged 140 fg cell(-1), and were not correlated with any environmental factor or growth rates. In Saginaw Bay, phosphorus availability primarily influences microcystin concentrations through direct control of M. aeruginosa abundance and growth rates, and not through direct control of cellular microcystin synthesis.

There is currently limited understanding of the impacts of recreational and artisanal fishing on tigerfish Hydrocynus vittatus populations in Lake Kariba and the socioeconomic factors behind them. Hence, this study investigated socioeconomic factors that act as drivers of the recreational and artisanal fishery industry and what sort of impact this would likely have on tigerfish H. vittatus populations using qualitative approaches. Eight three percent of the artisanal fishers interviewed recorded high catches during the summer season (October-February), which also coincides with the breeding season for tigerfish when it migrates up the rivers. Recreational anglers mainly caught females during the tigerfish tournament which is likely to have a significant effect on the tigerfish population in the long term through changes in tigerfish recruitment and other life history traits. Tigerfish size at sexual maturity and catch per unit effort which are all indicators of overexploitation were found to have decreased over the past years. Results further demonstrated increased fishing activities from artisanal and recreational fishing. It can be implied that the population of tigerfish may inadvertently be affected, but direct evidence that both recreational and artisanal fishing were having impacts on tigerfish populations was limited. It is therefore recommended that effective conservation measures such as preventing fish poaching during the tigerfish breeding season are put in place to protect the population and that of other fishes (i.e. potential prey).

Laboratory biology and field population dynamics of Trichopria columbiana (Hymenoptera: Diapriidae), an acquired parasitoid of two hydrilla biological control agents	BIOCONTROL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The biology and population dynamics of Trichopria columbiana, a native semi-aquatic parasitoid of ephydrid flies of the genus Hydrellia, were investigated in Florida and Texas, USA. Hydrellia pakistanae and Hydrellia balciunasi were introduced for classical biological control of the invasive aquatic weed Hydrilla verticillata in the 1980s and acquired T. columbiana post-release. Several life history parameters of T. columbiana were investigated in the laboratory, including fecundity, egg shape and size, number and location of egg(s) deposited per host, preferred host age, description and number of instars, mode of respiration and host-selection behaviour. Field studies included seasonal abundance of T. columbiana and the introduced Hydrellia spp., parasitism levels, overwintering stage and adult winter sex ratio. T. columbiana is a synovigenic solitary endoparasitoid that developed from egg to adult in 21.9 +/- 0.2 days under laboratory conditions. Eggs of T. columbiana are hydropic, hymenopteriform in shape and possess a double membrane. Larvae have three instars; first instars have sclerotised mandibles, bifurcated abdominal appendages and are free floating in the host's haemolymph. Second and third instars are grub-like and remain attached to the host's tracheal system until pupation. Individual females produced on average 23.2 +/- 0.6 eggs and survived 15.6 +/- 1.8 days. Highest parasitism levels of early and intermediate stage pupae occurred when wasps were 8-9 days old. Field parasitism rates of the two introduced Hydrellia spp. averaged 19.1%.					; Harms, Nathan/AER-3500-2022	Harms, Nathan/0000-0002-1614-3255; 													0958-3157	1360-0478					2014	24	11					1243	1264		10.1080/09583157.2014.933311	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09583157.2014.933311													WOS:000342067300003

DM at the surfaces of 14 lakes ranged from the atmospheric equilibrium concentration (about 4 nmol L-1 for freshwater) to 385 nmol L-1. Relatively low DM of less than 50 nmol L-1 were observed in about 60% of the lakes. Many of the lakes (area fraction of 85%) were supersaturated and are thus sources of methane to the atmosphere. The exchange coefficient was calculated using wind speed data at Syowa Station. Area fraction frequency distributions with four surface DM ranges were applied to all lakes at Syowa Oasis (110 lakes, total lake area of 9 km(2)). Extrapolation to the whole Syowa Oasis gives an estimate of total emission of about 1 t CH4 yr(-1). This is the first estimation of methane flux from the surfaces of thawed lakes to the atmosphere in Antarctica. Since a methane efflux of about 2 t CH4 yr(-1) was estimated in our previous study from frozen bubbles in lake ice, a total amount of 3 t CH4 yr(-1) would be released to the atmosphere from the lakes during the ice melting season (December-January) at Syowa Oasis.

At that time nine transects were established, five in the Tanquary Fiord area and four in the Lake Hazen area. Data collected during the eleven-year monitoring period indicate that most of the ecosystems are fairly dynamic, displaying changes resulting primarily from natural processes. These processes generally have a stronger impact than human activities. The data collected in 2000 suggest that the air and soil temperatures have increased during the past three summers (1998-2000), resulting in deepening of the thaw layers on portions of most of the transects. Between 1990 and 2000 there was a significant change in the vegetation cover on three of the eight vegetated transects.																					90-5809-582-7				2003							89	94																WOS:000185049300017
J	ZAFAR, AR				ZAFAR, AR			SEASONALITY OF PHYTOPLANKTON IN SOME SOUTH-INDIAN LAKES	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The landscape of South India is dotted with innumerable man-made lakes. They differ vastly in age, physiography, water flow characteristics, chemistry and trophic state, yet maintain a phytoplankton overwhelmingly dominated (43-93%) by blue-green algae; the subdominants are diatoms and/or Chlorococcales and euglenoids. The blue-greens apparently reach them from soils which are known to harbor a rich blue-green flora and several species in common with limnoplankton. South Indian lakes resemble some tropical counterparts in sustaining dense phytoplankton populations all the year round and temperate dimictic ones in showing two annual growth peaks that usually occur in summer (February-May) and the post-monsoon period (October-November), in synchrony with rise in temperature. In the chemically more oligotrophic lakes, the peaks are constituted by Raphidiopsis mediterranea Skuja, Navicula cryptocephala Kutz., Melosira granulata (Ehr.) Ralfs, and others and in hypereutrophic lakes by Microcystis aeruginosa Kutz., Synechocystis aquatilis Sauv., Oscillatoria spp., Burkillia coronata West and West and Euglena acus Ehr. The bimodal seasonality in abundance of phytoplankton reflects in chlorophyll and biomass concentrations although these are not in strict synchrony with each other. At the maxima chlorophyll .alpha. and over-dry biomass may rise to 8.5 mg l-1 and 204 mg l-1 respectively in highly productive waters. The highest rate of carbon assimilation recorded in such phases is 10.6 g C m-3 d-1.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				AUG 5	1986	138						177	187		10.1007/BF00027239	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00027239													WOS:A1986E070900013

Based on partial sequence analysis of 16S rRNA genes, members of 35 genera were identified; however, only a few species dominated as their representatives were repeatedly isolated at different sampling sites. Determination of the phylum affiliation showed that the isolates included members of Bacteriodetes (especially the genus Flavobacterium) and Proteobacteria (mainly Pseudomonas and Stenotrophomonas). MALDI-TOF analysis and/or similarities of partial sequences of flavobacterial strains resulted in the generation of almost complete 16S rRNA gene sequences for 100 isolates, about 60 of which may represent novel phylospecies. The number as well as the intra-phylum distribution of the isolates changed with distance from the discharge site. While phylogenetically restricted at the spring, diversity increased at downstream sampling sites.

J	Nie, Z; Bu, LZ; Zheng, MP; Huang, WN				Nie, Zhen; Bu, Lingzhong; Zheng, Mianping; Huang, Weinong			Experimental study of natural brine solar ponds in Tibet	SOLAR ENERGY												A salinity gradient solar pond (SGSP) is a simple and effective way of capturing and storing solar energy. The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has very good solar energy resources and very rich salt lake brine resources. It lacks energy for its mineral processes and is therefore an ideal location for the development and operation of solar ponds. In China, solar ponds have been widely applied for aquaculture, in the production of Glauber's salt and in the production of lithium carbonate from salt lake. As part of an experimental study, a SGSP using the natural brine of Zabuye salt lake in the Tibet plateau has been constructed. The pond has an area of 2500 m(2) and is 1.9 m deep. The solar pond started operation in spring when the ambient temperature was very low and has operated steadily for 105 days, with the LCZ temperature varying between 20 and 40 degrees C. During the experimental study, the lower convective zone (LCZ) of the pond reached a maximum temperature of 39.1 degrees C. The results show that solar ponds can be operated successfully at the Qinghai-Tibet plateau and can be applied to the production of minerals. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In ol der to appreciate the consequences of marsh loss and degradation, we collected fish larvae with icthyoplankton nets during the summers of 1997 and 1998 in three coastal marsh bays in Les Cheneaux, northern Lake Huron. In addition, we obtained several metrics of human activities and local habitat features (vegetation, water temperature, and substrate slope) and evaluated the importance of these metrics in structuring local larval fish assemblages. Our study indicated that local habitat features strongly and directly affected local larval fish assemblages in Les Cheneaux, while human activities did not. However, human activities may have altered local habitats in Les Cheneaux, thus indirectly impacting local larval fish assemblages.

J	Lassen, C; Revsbech, NP; Pedersen, O				Lassen, C; Revsbech, NP; Pedersen, O			Macrophyte development and resuspension regulate the photosynthesis and production of benthic microalgae	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The effect of macrophyte growth on microbenthic photosynthetic activity was studied in two large enclosures situated in a shallow, eutrophic lake. Macrophytes were allowed to develop stands of 100% coverage in one enclosure whereas they were harvested at emergence in the other. Although less than 10% of the incident light reached the benthic microphytes below the macrophytes at mid-summer, when the macrophytes reached their maximum coverage, the seasonal productivity (April-October) of the microbenthic community was still 355 g C m(-2) corresponding to 65% of the productivity in the enclosure without macrophytes. Although the light attenuation by the macrophytes had a strong negative effect on microbenthic photosynthesis, the negative effect was partly balanced by increased water transparency caused by increased grazing on the phytoplankton, and the shelter provided by the plants also resulted in less resuspension. Analysis with microsensors for oxygen and scalar irradiance showed that the capacity for photosynthesis was evenly distributed throughout the uppermost 3 mm of the sediment and in the approximately 3-mm flocculent layer covering the sediment. Microbenthic photosynthesis seemed primarily limited by light. The microsensor analysis also demonstrated how conventional oxygen exchange experiments underestimate the true photosynthetic rates and indicated that more realistic rates might be obtained by measuring oxygen exchange if the exchange is facilitated by vigorous stirring.

Because the physical, chemical, and biological structures of high altitude lakes are highly responsive to climate change, both PCB exposure and bioaccumulation are likely to be strongly altered in the near future. Yet, in the absence of mechanistic knowledge of the processes regulating fish contamination with PCB in such ecosystems, their fate cannot be predicted. The aim of this study was to investigate the relative roles of biomagnification and bioconcentration on the individual, seasonal, and between-site variability of fish PCB contamination in 2 alpine, high altitude lakes. The intra-and within-lake variability of fish PCBs was not related to differences in fish physiology (size, age, or lipid content) and only marginally tied to fish feeding habitats (assessed from fatty acid composition and delta C-13) or trophic position (delta N-15). These results suggested that the trophic pathway and biomagnification contributed little to the observed differences in fish PCB concentrations between lakes, seasons, and individuals. Moreover, the fish PCB levels did not depend on the total PCB concentration in the water, but the fish contamination dynamics during the spring thaw pointed to a significant role of dissolved PCBs during this season in both lakes. In high altitude lakes, low temperatures might contribute to kinetically limit equilibrium with dietary PCBs, thereafter favouring bioconcentration over biomagnification pathways by which fish become contaminated with PCBs.

J	Jakkila, J; Auttila, M; Tuukkanen, T; Veijalainen, N				Jakkila, Juho; Auttila, Miina; Tuukkanen, Tapio; Veijalainen, Noora			Modelling climate change impacts on lake ice and snow demonstrates breeding habitat decline of the endangered Saimaa ringed seal	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Snowdrifts on lake ice provide vital breeding habitats for the endangered Saimaa ringed seal. In this study, a lake ice model of Watershed Simulation and Forecasting System (WSFS-Ice) was developed for improved estimation of ice and snow conditions in Lake Saimaa during the pupping season of the Saimaa ringed seal. The WSFS-Ice model is based on energy balance, enabling reliable estimation of the ice cover evolution in current and future climate. In addition, a simple snowdrift model was used to simulate formation of snowdrifts, which are essential for the seals breeding success in Lake Saimaa. The model was calibrated against ice thickness, ice type and snow depth measurements. According to our results based on climate scenarios with intermediate representative concentration pathway (RCP4.5), the breeding habitat of the Saimaa ringed seal is significantly deteriorating during the twenty-first century. The mean depth of the snowdrifts is projected to decrease approximately to half from the 1981-2010 to 2070-99 period and at the same time the ice-covered period is reduced by one and a half months. During the mildest winters the ice cover is projected to melt even before the pupping season has ended. The results highlight the importance of climate change mitigation and active conservation measures to enhance seal population growth, enabling it to survive in a changing climate.

J	Hall, ML; Robin, C; Beate, B; Mothes, P; Monzier, M				Hall, ML; Robin, C; Beate, B; Mothes, P; Monzier, M			Tungurahua Volcano, Ecuador: structure, eruptive history and hazards	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Tungurahua, one of Ecuador's most active volcanoes, is made up of three volcanic edifices. Tungurahua I was a 14-km-wide andesitic stratocone which experienced at least one sector collapse followed by the extrusion of a dacite lava series. Tungurahua II, mainly composed of acid andesite lava flows younger than 14,000 years BP, was partly destroyed by the last collapse event, 2955 +/- 90 years ago, which left a large amphitheater and produced a similar to 8-km(3) debris deposit. The avalanche collided with the high ridge immediately to the west of the cone and was diverted to the northwest and southwest for similar to 15 km. A large lahar formed during this event, which was followed in turn by dacite extrusion. Southwestward, the damming of the Chambo valley by the avalanche deposit resulted in a similar to 10-km-long lake, which was subsequently breached, generating another catastrophic debris flow. The eruptive activity of the present volcano (Tungurahua III) has rebuilt the cone to about 50% of its pre-collapse size by the emission of similar to 3 km(3) of volcanic products. Two periods of construction are recognized in Tungurahua's III history. From similar to 2300 to similar to 1400 years BP, high rates of lava extrusion and pyroclastic flows occurred. During this period, the magma composition did not evolve significantly, remaining essentially basic andesite. During the last similar to 1300 years, eruptive episodes take place roughly once per century and generally begin with lapilli fall and pyroclastic flow activity of varied composition (andesite + dacite), and end with more basic andesite lava flows or crater plugs. This pattern is observed in the three historic eruptions of 1773, 1886 and 1916-1918. Given good age control and volumetric considerations, Tungurahua III growth's rate is estimated at similar to 1.5 X 10(6) m(3)/year over the last 2300 years, Although an infrequent event, a sector collapse and associated lahars constitute a strong hazard of this volcano. Given the similar to 3000 m relief and steep slopes of the present cone, a future collapse, even of small volume, could cover an area similar to that affected by the similar to 3000-year-old avalanche. The more frequent eruptive episodes of each century, characterized by pyroclastic flows, lavas, lahars, as well as tephra falls, directly threaten 25,000 people and the Agoyan hydroelectric dam located at the foot of the volcano.

Microbiota associated with the skin-associated mucus undergo community change coincident with migration, and irrespective of this turnover, antibiotic resistance was detected in mixed bacterial cultures initiated with mucus samples. Although as expected most bacteria were unculturable, however, 5/7 isolates showed susceptibility to a panel of five common antibiotics. The fish were sampled under severe conditions and at remote locations far from human habitation. Regardless, two isolates, 'Carnobacterium maltaromaticum sm-2' and 'Arthrobacter citreus sm', showed multi-resistance to two or more antibiotics including ampicillin and streptomycin indicating multiple resistance genes. It is unknown if these fish bacteria have 'natural' resistance phenotypes or if resistance has been acquired. As result of these observations, we urge long-term monitoring of drug-resistant bacteria in the region and caution the assumption of a lack of drug-resistant organisms even in such extreme environments.																			1758-2229					JUN	2022	14	3					385	390		10.1111/1758-2229.12975	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1758-2229.12975		JUN 2021						34109745					WOS:000659300600001

In theory, if done well, urban planning can lead to responses to sea-level rise that are socially and environmentally sustainable. In practice, urban planning processes may fall short of this ideal. We use multiple methods to describe and analyse how urban planning processes have led to adaptation to sea-level rise in Lakes Entrance in Victoria, Australia. Adaptation has principally taken the form of restrictions on development on low-lying land. In this town, which is considered particularly vulnerable to sea-level rise, the urban planning process and its outcomes have been controversial and divisive. Policies at the state level were imposed rapidly on this particular local community, and were later applied across the state. Our findings support the emerging consensus that to be sustainable, urban planning needs to: facilitate local ownership of adaptation responses; build collective action within local communities and between local communities and different arms and levels of government; and be fair in its application across space and over time. Addressing these social, dimensions of adaptation takes time, but they are a sine qua non of sustainable adaptation to sea-level, rise. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In Lake Chaohu, PBDEs had an increasing trend, with a doubling time of 13.4 years at the urban site, and a decreasing trend, with a halving time of 6.1 years at the rural site. At the urban site, the negative association of OM with most congeners indicated that the graphene-like carbonaceous components might carry or release PBDEs, and the negative association of long-term rain fall and wind speed with most congeners was suggested to dilute or increase the transport speed of PBDEs in the atmosphere. At the rural site, the negative association with PM10 and positive association with OM indicated that the PBDEs-buried OM was mainly from non-local sources. Restricted to the temperature seasonality, the frequency of PBDE congeners decreased with seasonality from 64% and 43% to 50% and 43% at the urban and rural sites, respectively. The slope of the simplified Pankow adsorption model in samples with larger absolute OM content (>10 mu gCm(-3)) was steeper than that with lower absolute OM content (<5 mu gC m(-3)), indicating that OM facilitated the gas-particle partitioning equilibrium. Interestingly, the theoretic partitioning coefficients were much lower than the measured ones for less brominated BDEs, whereas the highly brominated BDEs did the opposite. The theoretic partitioning coefficient should be further modified by considering the molecular weight distribution of the OM and the corresponding activity coefficients of the target compound in a specific type of OM phase.

All Croatian carp farms are subjected to a surveillance programme for the presence of koi herpesvirus (KHV), causing a deadly disease called koi herpesvirus disease (KHVD). However, there is no surveillance for other viral pathogens of importance like carp edema virus (CEV), a causative agent of koi sleepy disease (KSD). During regular testing within the KHVD surveillance programme, we tested samples for CEV simultaneously. The screening indicated possible outbreaks of KHVD and KSD. During 2016, KHVD broke out in an isolated area and soon thereafter a KHV eradication programme was successfully performed. However, during 2018 and 2019, two additional mortality events occurred in lakes in the southern part of Croatia during the spring. Samples from both events tested positive for CEV. An epidemiological investigation confirmed the introduction of infected carps from an infected farm to one of the lakes. To prevent the spreading of CEV into open waters, it is of utmost importance to introduce CEV testing before fish movement or to perform regular testing of all carp farms in the country to determine CEV prevalence for the purpose of implementation of control measures.

J	Eckert, W; Conrad, R				Eckert, Werner; Conrad, Ralf			Sulfide and methane evolution in the hypolimnion of a subtropical lake: a three-year study	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												The differential impact of microbial sulfate reduction and methanogenesis on the mineralization of particulate organic carbon (POC) in warm monomictic Lake Kinneret (LK), Israel was studied during three consecutive lake cycles. The hypolimnetic accumulation of total sulfide and dissolved methane was examined in relation to the physical forcing of the water column and the settling flux of particulate matter. With the on-set of thermal stratification in spring, both solutes increased concomitantly with the depletion of oxygen, first in the benthic boundary layer, followed by the upper hypolimnion. Methane production was restricted to the sediments as emphasized by the persistently linear concentration gradient in the hypolimnion. Sulfate reduction occurred both in the sediments and the water column as revealed by the hvpolimnetic distribution of sulfide and recurring metalimnetic sulfide peaks. Annual differences in the accumulation pattern of both solutes appeared to be primarily linked to the settling flux of POC and the length of the stratified season. Relatively lower hypolimnetic concentrations of dissolved methane during the stratified season of 2000 coincided with increased ebullition of gaseous methane, likely as the result of a nearly a 2 in drop in the lake level. Overall, sulfate reduction accounted for more than 60% of the POC settling flux, a finding that differs from similar studies made in temperate lakes where methanogenesis was shown to be the primary mode of terminal carbon mineralization. Intensive organic carbon turnover at the sediment water interface and comparatively high sulfate concentrations in LK are the most likely reason.					; Eckert, Werner/AAP-9335-2021	Eckert, Werner/0000-0002-2361-6911; 													0168-2563	1573-515X				JAN	2007	82	1					67	76		10.1007/s10533-006-9053-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-006-9053-3													WOS:000244070900006

The species can be found in areas mainly related to water (lakes, dams and rivers), that are protected under the Natura 2000 network. Recently volunteers reported sightings of the species outside of its currently known distribution. To address those reports and investigate the possible presence of the species outside its distribution, a rapid survey approach was designed and implemented. The survey provided evidence on several sightings outside of the species' distribution, identifying new localities for the first time in 25 years and highlighting the importance of sparse springs within systems of ephemeral streams for the species population. This exciting discovery brings new opportunities and responsibilities regarding the conservation of the species. We are proposing targeted conservation actions and stress the importance of expanding the research on this critically endangered subspecies, based on current findings. The critically endangered Cyprus grass snake (Natrix natrix cypriaca) has been studied for the past 25 years. Although the need for a complete survey on the distribution of its population, outside the strict boundaries of the known mountainous localities, had been stressed, such an effort has not been conducted to date. In this study, we used a rapid survey approach to investigate possible sightings of the species upstream of the known distribution in the Troodos Mountains. We are presenting evidence from 13 sightings of the species that expand the previously known distribution in Cyprus by nearly 70%. This is the first time that new localities for the critically endangered N. n. cypriaca have been reported since the rediscovery of the species in 1992 and the extensive work that followed. Almost all new localities were discovered outside of the currently known species distribution, while individuals were found, for the first time, within the Natura 2000 site of Dasos Machaira (CY2000004) with indications of healthy populations in the area. New localities were recorded within watersheds of the Pediaios and Gialias Rivers, the first sightings outside of Serrachis watershed, indicating an even broader distribution of the species in the Troodos region. The importance of sparse springs within systems of ephemeral streams is highlighted as an exceptional niche for the population in the region. We are discussing the importance of our findings for the conservation of the species and propose targeted conservation actions that will highly improve connectivity of the populations in the region. We underline the necessity of expanding the research on this critically endangered subspecies, based on current findings, so as to fully comprehend its ecology and distribution range in the region.					; Stamatiou, Marilena/HGT-8476-2022; Meletiou, Sotiris/AFK-3980-2022; Naziri, Andrea/HTO-4908-2023	Meletiou, Sotiris/0000-0003-3766-7098; Zotos, Savvas/0000-0002-9767-396X; Naziri, Andrea/0000-0002-6090-308X; Perikleous, Konstantinos/0009-0009-8488-8329; Stamatiou, Marilena/0000-0001-7100-279X													2076-2615					APR	2021	11	4							1077	10.3390/ani11041077	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani11041077								33918973					WOS:000642671400001

Therefore, we developed a model incorporating reverse time attention with a decay mechanism (RETAIN-D) to forecast HABs with simultaneous improvements in temporal resolution, forecasting performance, and interpretability. The usefulness of RETAIN-D in forecasting HABs was illustrated by its application to two sites located in the lower sections of the Nakdong and Yeongsan rivers, South Korea, where HABs pose a critical water quality issue. Three variations of recurrent neural network models, i.e., long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and reverse time attention (RETAIN), were adopted for comparisons of performance with RETAIN-D. Input features encompassing meteorological, hydrological, environmental, and biological factors were used to forecast cyanobacteria abundance (total cyanobacteria cell counts and cell counts of dominant cyanobacteria taxa). Incorporation of a decay mechanism into the deep learning structure in RETAIN-D allowed forecasts of HABs on a high temporal resolution (daily) without manual feature engineering, increasing the usefulness of resulting forecasts for water quality and resources management. RETAIN-D yielded a high degree of accuracy (RMSE = 0.29-1.67, R-2 = 0.76-0.98, MAE = 0.18-1.14, SMAPE = 9.77-87.94% for test sets; on natural log scales) across model outputs and sites, successfully capturing high variability and irregularities in the time series. RETAIN-D showed higher accuracy than RETAIN (except for comparable accuracy in forecasting Microcystis abundance at the Nakdong River site) and outperformed LSTM and GRU across all model outputs and sites. Ambient temperature had high importance in forecasting cyanobacteria abundance across all model outputs and sites, whereas the relative importance of other input features varied by the output and site. Increases in contributions with increasing irradiance, decreasing flow rates, and increasing residence time were more pronounced in summer than other seasons. Differences in the contributions of input features among different time steps (1 to 7 days prior to forecasting) were larger in the Yeongsan River site. RETAIN-D is applicable to a wide range of forecasting models that can benefit from improved temporal resolution, performance, and interpretability.

Historically, these ecosystems have widely been regarded as anthropogenic-derived, degraded descendants of deciduous forests. Despite recent work showing that modern savannas in the subcontinent fall within established bioclimatic envelopes of extant savannas elsewhere, the debate persists, at least in part because the regions where savannas occur also have a long history of human presence and habitat modification. Here we show for the first time, using multiple proxies for vegetation, climate and disturbances from high-resolution, well-dated lake sediments from Lonar Crater in peninsular India, that neither anthropogenic impact nor fire regime shifts, but monsoon weakening during the past similar to 6.0 kyr cal. BP, drove the expansion of savanna at the expense of forests in peninsular India. Our results provide unambiguous evidence for a climate-induced origin and spread of the modern savannas of peninsular India at around the mid-Holocene. We further propose that this savannization preceded and drove the introduction of agriculture and development of sedentism in this region, rather than vice-versa as has often been assumed.

J	HARE, L; CAMPBELL, PGC				HARE, L; CAMPBELL, PGC			TEMPORAL VARIATIONS OF TRACE-METALS IN AQUATIC INSECTS	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Temporal fluctuations were measured in the concentrations of the trace metals cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) in six insect taxa collected from the same sites in a temperate zone lake over a 14-month period. The consequences of temporal changes in insect contaminant concentrations for biomonitoring studies are assessed. 2. Significant temporal fluctuations in the concentrations of the three metals were measured in almost all of the insect taxa studied. In no case was there a greater than sixfold change in the concentration of a trace metal over the course of the year. The extent of the fluctuations was generally greater for Cd, a non-essential metal, than for the essential micronutrients Cu or Zn. 3. Temporal fluctuations in Cd concentrations appeared to follow a seasonal periodicity for most taxa. Minima were measured during the winter period in the megalopteran Sialis spp. and in the dipteran taxa Chaoborus punctipennis, Glyptotendipes sp., and Procladius spp., whereas a maximum was measured in the mayfly Hexagenia limbata during the same season. In general, temporal fluctuations in Cu and Zn concentrations were less seasonal in character than were those of Cd. 4. For some of the taxon-metal combinations studied, temporal fluctuations in metal concentrations could be ignored in biomonitoring studies, whereas in other cases a temporal window of minimum variability should be chosen for the collection of organisms from different sites.

J	Lukas, S				Lukas, Sven			Processes of annual moraine formation at a temperate alpine valley glacier: insights into glacier dynamics and climatic controls	BOREAS												This paper presents the first detailed sedimentological study of annual moraines formed by an alpine valley glacier. The moraines have been forming since at least AD 1980 by a subsidiary lobe of Gornergletscher, Switzerland that advances up a reverse bedrock slope. They reach heights of 0.51.5?m, widths of up to 6?m and lengths of up to several hundreds of metres. Sediments in these moraines are composed of proglacial outwash and debris flow units; subglacial traction till is absent entirely. Based on four representative sections, three genetic process combinations have been identified: (i) inefficient bulldozing of a gently sloping ice margin transfers proglacial sediments onto the ice, causing differential ablation and dead-ice incorporation upon retreat; (ii) terrestrial ice-contact fans are formed by the dumping of englacial and supraglacial material from point sources such as englacial conduit fills; debris flows and associated fluvial sediments are stacked against a temporarily stationary margin at the start, and deformed during glacier advance in the remainder, of the accumulation season; (iii) a steep ice margin without supraglacial input leads to efficient bulldozing and deformation of pre-existing foreland sediments by wholesale folding. Ice-surface slope appears to be a key control on the type of process responsible for moraine formation in any given place and year. The second and third modes result in stable and higher moraines that have a higher preservation potential than those containing dead ice. Analysis of the spacing and climatic records at Gornergletscher reveals that winter temperature controls marginal retreat and hence moraine formation. However, any climatic signal is complicated by other factors, most notably the presence of a reverse bedrock slope, so that the extraction of a clear climatic signal is not straightforward. This study highlights the complexity of annual moraine formation in high-mountain environments and suggests avenues for further research.

J	White, JD; Hamilton, SK; Sarnelle, O				White, Jeffrey D.; Hamilton, Stephen K.; Sarnelle, Orlando			Heat-induced mass mortality of invasive zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) at sublethal water temperatures	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We observed a massive die-off of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) on the epilimnetic sediments of Gull Lake (Michigan, USA) during the relatively warm summer of 2010, even though water temperatures were below widely reported lethal temperatures of >= 30 degrees C. We followed up this observation with 4 years of in situ monitoring of caged mussels stocked across a depth-temperature gradient in Gull Lake. Mortality of caged D. polymorpha was largely explained by accumulated degree hours >25 degrees C, a temperature threshold that is considerably lower than laboratory-derived lethal temperatures for D. polymorpha. We also assessed both the acute and chronic thermal tolerance of Gull Lake D. polymorpha with laboratory experiments, which confirmed higher acute tolerance (up to 32 degrees C) under otherwise ideal conditions but high susceptibility to prolonged exposure to "sublethal" temperatures (exceeding 1700 degree hours >25 degrees C) as occurred in Gull Lake during the die-off. Our results indicate that the thermal tolerance of D. polymorpha under natural conditions may be lower than has been reported from laboratory studies. Lower temperature tolerance may have major implications for the dynamics, impacts, and management of this invasive species given future climate change scenarios.					; Hamilton, Stephen/N-2979-2014	White, Jeffrey/0000-0002-0805-5706; Hamilton, Stephen/0000-0002-4702-9017													0706-652X	1205-7533				AUG	2015	72	8					1221	1229		10.1139/cjfas-2015-0064	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2015-0064													WOS:000358608600009
J	Al-Janabi, S; Al-Barmani, Z				Al-Janabi, Samaher; Al-Barmani, Zahraa			Intelligent multi-level analytics of soft computing approach to predict water quality index (IM12CP-WQI)	SOFT COMPUTING												Water is one of the main sources of life on Earth. As a result of the progress made in the field of industry and technology, water has become one of the most important wealth that must be preserved. Studies indicate that the world is heading toward a crisis in the percentage of available water by the year 2025 as a result of the scarcity of water sources, the increase in pollution rates, and the increased use of water. On the other hand, water refining is a very expensive method. Therefore, it was necessary to go to computer methods characterized by high accuracy to know the percentage of water quality scale and the possibility of using it in different places other than drinking before resorting to the refining process. This paper presents a model for predicting a water quality scale based on twelve concentrations called ((IMCP)-C-12-WQI) that is based on the use of the concept of intelligent data mining that combines the construction of two algorithms, namely (DWM-Bat and DMARS). The DWM-Bat worked to find the number of DMARS models in addition to the weights of each of the concentrations used in this study. The DMARS algorithm has found a mathematical model that combines these concentrations to predict the percentage of water quality. The MARS algorithm was developed by replacing its kernel with four functions: [linear, RBF, sigmoid, and polynomial]. The proposed model consists of four basic stages that included: the first stage is data collection and preliminary treatment to put it within the same ranges, which are [0, 1], as well as finding the correlation between concentrations to find out the direct or inverse correlation between those concentrations and their relationship with the water quality coefficient WQI. The second stage included building an optimization algorithm called DWM-Bat to find the optimal weights for each of the twelve concentrations, as well as the optimal number of M models for DMARS. The third stage included building a mathematical model that combines these concentrations, based on DMARS and benefiting from the results of the previous stage, DWM-Bat. The last stage included evaluating the results that were reached using three types of measurements (R-2, NSE, D) on the basis of which the WQI value was determined based on four cases. The first case if the WQI value is less than 25, it can be used for the purpose of drinking, the second case if it was between (26-50) and it is used in fish lakes, the third case if it was between (51-75) and it could be used in agriculture, the fourth case if the WQI value is higher than 75 and then the water needs a refining process. Also, the results of the proposed model called ((IMCP)-C-12-WQI) were compared with the results of MARS after it was developed by using different kernel functions. By applying the proposed model, it was found using DWM-Bat that the optimal number of M related to the winter and summer data sets is 9. And the best weight for each concentration was as follows: PH = 0.247, NTU = 0.420, TDS = 0.004, Ca = 0.028, Mg = 0.042, Cl = 0.008, Na = 0.011, K = 0.175, SO4 = 0.008, NO3 = 0.042, CaCO3 (TA) = 0.011, and CaCO3 (TH) = 0.004. On the other hand, the study demonstrated a high correlation between WQI, and the following concentrations are k = 0.985, TH = 0.86, NO3 = 0.761, TDS = 0.55, Na = 0.415, PH = 0.371, TA = 0.37, Cl = 0.362, and Ca = 0.317. The results showed that the predictor (IMCP)-C-12-WQI is a good indicator compared with other techniques represented by MARS-linear, MARS-Sig, MARS-RBF, and MARS-Poly. Thus, the proposed model (IMCP)-C-12-WQI is considered one of the most promising techniques in the field of water quality measurement despite the different concentrations that cause water pollution .

The delta D values of n-alkanes were correlated with those of meteoric water in the summer months and showed increasing Pearson correlation coefficients with increasing n-alkane chain length (r, 0.80 for n-C-31). While in samples from the most humid regions (southeastern Tibetan Plateau), the apparent enrichment factors between meteoric water and lipids are close to those reported for other humid sites (epsilon approximate to -135%o for mid-chain and approximate to -125 parts per thousand for long chain n-alkanes), they become smaller (epsilon approximate to -118 parts per thousand to -41 parts per thousand; mean value: -86 parts per thousand) at sites with a negative moisture balance (northeastern and central Tibetan Plateau and Qaidam Basin). This might be caused by enrichment in deuterium of the source water used for lipid synthesis as a result of lake water evaporation and soil and leaf water evapotranspiration. In the core from Lake Koucha, decreasing delta D values of all n-alkanes between 15 and 10 cal ka BP give evidence for an intensification of the Asian summer monsoon. At ca. 9 cal ka BP, a ca. 15 parts per thousand shift towards higher delta D values of mid-chain n-alkanes suggests enhanced evaporation of the lake water, which outweighs higher precipitation amounts because of a temperature increase during the early Holocene monsoonal maximum. Only a few surface sediment samples show a significant offset between delta D values of mid-chain n-alkanes and n-C-31 (A delta Dmid-n-C31) and no systematic dependence between this offset and environmental parameters, such as mean annual precipitation, was found. In the core, available data for most samples also do not show a significant offset, only a slight increase (approximate to + 15 parts per thousand) of Delta delta Dmid-n-C31 at ca 10.0 cal ka BP and a decrease (approximate to -17 parts per thousand) at ca 6.8 cal ka BP might indicate wetter and drier conditions, respectively. However, interpretation of Delta delta Dmin-n-C31 throughout the record is difficult because of a lack of reliable data for n-C31 in key sections of the core. So, more records are necessary to further test the potential applicability of Delta delta Dmin-n-C31 as a proxy for palaeo-hydrological conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Moore, MV; Folt, CL; Stemberger, RS				Moore, MV; Folt, CL; Stemberger, RS			Consequences of elevated temperatures for zooplankton assemblages in temperate lakes	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												This paper is a review of direct and indirect effects of elevated temperatures (greater than or equal to 25 degrees C) on freshwater zooplankton in temperate latitudes. Effects of temperature on aspects of behavior, individual growth, development and reproduction, and population dynamics are compared across zooplankton taxa. Thermal responses vary markedly among co-occurring species and among clones within parthenogenetic species. There is strong evidence that elevated temperature can produce a reduction in body size within zooplankton populations. Also, some zooplankton assemblages become increasingly dominated by smaller bodied forms under warm conditions. We hypothesize that certain cold-water zooplankton species show the greatest risk of local extinction during late summer heating events because of their dependence on thermal refugia, and their lack of diapausing or dispersal stages. Indirect effects of elevated temperature mediated by changes in the algal food supply or by altered interspecific interactions are also explored. Elevated temperature can change algal community structure and algal food quality, all of which can affect the outcome of zooplankton interspecific competition. Size-selective predation rates of planktivorous fish are also likely to increase with increasing temperature or when zooplankton are driven from the hypolimnion. The onset of fish feeding is also likely to begin earlier in the season thus reducing the time that large zooplankton are present during the ice-free season. Reductions in the size structure of zooplankton assemblages are likely to alter water clarity, nutrient regeneration and fish abundances.																			0003-9136					JAN	1996	135	3					289	319																WOS:A1996TT86100001

Development of methods for ecological monitoring throughout Europe and their calibration for particular ecoregions are not finished yet and databases need to be filled by data from undersampled regions and overlooked substrates. The present study aims to explore the diversity of epiphytic diatoms in unexplored catchment areas with special attention to substrate specificity and distribution of unresolved diatom species complexes. Significant differences were found in diversity of both regions and water types (lotic/lentic). No significant differences were found in the case of substrates. CCA analysis showed significant influence of pH, water streaming (streaming/stagnant) and Lemna substrate to species composition. Surprisingly species complexes represent the majority of epiphytic assemblages with no significant differences between lotic and lentic waters or substrates except of Lemna. The high representation of complexes does not lead automatically to reduction of overall diversity of the sample.

The nature of the pre-1886 surface thermal activity indicates that boiling conditions prevailed in the upflow zone beneath the vicinity of the then-existing shallow Lake Rotomahana. On June 10, 1886, magma erupted through this part of the system, triggering violent volcanic and hydrothermal explosions that led to the formation of new fluid conduits and a large crater that filled to form the present Lake Rotomahana. Several years after the eruption, hot springs broke out along the line of 1886 craters southwest of Lake Rotomahana. The evolution of these features has been punctuated by spectacular geysers from 1900 to 1904 and a substantial hydrothermal eruption in 1917. The main effect of the 1886 volcanic eruption on the hydrothermal system was the perturbation of pressure gradients, causing abrupt near-surface cooling followed by gradual reheating.					keywood, melita/C-5139-2011	keywood, melita/0000-0001-9953-6806													0091-7613					JUL	1993	21	7					643	646		10.1130/0091-7613(1993)021<0643:ICOTRW>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0091-7613(1993)021<0643:ICOTRW>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1993LM16100017

New Insights on Ecosystem Mercury Cycling Revealed by Stable Isotopes of Mercury in Water Flowing from a Headwater Peatland Catchment	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Stable isotope compositions of mercury (Hg) were measured in the outlet stream and in soil cores at different landscape positions in a 9.7-ha boreal upland-peatland catchment. An acidic permanganate/persulfate digestion procedure was validated for water samples with high dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentrations through Hg spike addition analysis. We report a relatively large variation in mass-dependent fractionation (delta Hg-202; from -2.12 to -1.32 parts per thousand) and a smaller, but significant, variation of mass independent fractionation (Delta Hg-199; from -0.35 to -0.12 parts per thousand) during two years of sampling with streamflow varying from 0.003 to 7.8 L s(-1). Large variations in delta Hg-202 occurred only during low streamflow (<0.6 L which suggest that under high streamflow conditions a peatland lagg zone between the bog (3.0 ha) and uplands (6.7 ha) becomes the dominant source of Hg in downstream waters. Further, a binary mixing model showed that except for the spring snowmelt period, Hg in streamwater from the catchment was mainly derived from dry deposition of gaseous elemental Hg (73-95%). This study demonstrates the usefulness of Hg isotopes for tracing sources of Hg deposition, which can lead to a better understanding of the biogeochemical cycling and hydrological transport of Hg in headwater catchments.					; Sebestyen, Stephen/D-1238-2013; Tsui, Martin/F-5029-2011	Woerndle, Glenn/0000-0001-5215-1562; Sebestyen, Stephen/0000-0002-6315-0108; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				FEB 20	2018	52	4					1854	1861		10.1021/acs.est.7b04449	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.7b04449								29328674					WOS:000426143300019

The Regional Municipality of Peel is a regional municipality in Southern Ontario, Canada. It consists of three municipalities to the west and northwest of Toronto: the cities of Brampton and Mississauga, and the town of Caledon. The region is home to approximately 1.3 million people. Potable water is sourced from Lake Ontario and treated at the Lakeview and Lorne Park Water Treatment Plants. Since 2003, the Lakeview Water Treatment Plant has been undergoing significant upgrades to increase capacity and improve treatment processes. With the completion of the latest expansion in Fall 2014, it is now capable of producing 1150 million litres of water per day, making it one of the world's largest membrane treatment facilities.																					978-0-7844-8165-3				2018							116	123																WOS:000542616400013

River Inflow Dominates Methane Emissions in an Arctic Coastal System	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												We present a year-round time series of dissolved methane (CH4), along with targeted observations during ice melt of CH4 and carbon dioxide (CO2) in a river and estuary adjacent to Cambridge Bay, Nunavut, Canada. During the freshet, CH4 concentrations in the river and ice-covered estuary were up to 240,000% saturation and 19,000% saturation, respectively, but quickly dropped by >100-fold following ice melt. Observations with a robotic kayak revealed that river-derived CH4 and CO2 were transported to the estuary and rapidly ventilated to the atmosphere once ice cover retreated. We estimate that river discharge accounts for >95% of annual CH4 sea-to-air emissions from the estuary. These results demonstrate the importance of resolving seasonal dynamics in order to estimate greenhouse gas emissions from polar systems. Plain Language Summary The primary cause of recent global climate change is increasing concentrations of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Ongoing rapid Arctic climate change is affecting the annual cycle of sea ice formation and retreat; however, most published studies of greenhouse gases in Arctic waters have been conducted during ice-free, summertime conditions. In order to characterize seasonal variability in greenhouse gas distributions, we collected year-round measurements of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4) in a coastal Arctic system near Cambridge Bay, Nunavut, Canada. We found that during the ice melt season, river water contains methane concentrations up to 2,000 times higher than the wintertime methane concentrations in the coastal ocean. We utilized a novel robotic kayak to conduct high-resolution mapping of greenhouse gas distributions during ice melt. From these data, we demonstrate that the river water containing elevated levels of methane and carbon dioxide (CO2) flowed into the coastal ocean, and when ice cover melted, these greenhouse gases were rapidly emitted into the atmosphere. We estimate that in this system, more than 95% of all annual methane emissions from the estuary are driven by river inflow.					; Else, Brent/D-5267-2012; Manning, Cara/MIU-0003-2025	Tortell, Philippe/0000-0003-0212-2151; Manning, Cara/0000-0002-4984-5093; Nicholson, David/0000-0003-2653-9349; Preston, Victoria/0000-0002-5249-2866; Michel, Anna/0000-0001-9319-0592; Jones, Samantha/0000-0001-6375-0536; Ahmed, Mohamed/0000-0002-6516-0190; Duke, Patrick J./0000-0001-9189-5134													0094-8276	1944-8007				MAY 28	2020	47	10							e2020GL087669	10.1029/2020GL087669	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020GL087669													WOS:000560371700013

Adriana Assini modifies the Classical Medea, who acts here in a reflexive and premeditated manner, blending the powers of other female magicians: Circe and the Lady of the Lake (Viviana or Morgana). Yet, she preserves her distinctive feature of revengeful woman in love. Medea falls in love with Werner after having granted him with the gift of youthfulness and, when her lover is willing to abandon her, she uses a spell to entangle him in the branches of a white hawthorn. This revenge unveils the face of a primitive goddess, in between Potnia Theron and Hecate.																			2182-8814		978-989-26-1298-0; 978-989-26-1297-3				2016							343	350		10.14195/978-989-26-1298-0_25	http://dx.doi.org/10.14195/978-989-26-1298-0_25	10.14195/978-989-26-1298-0												WOS:000416669800025

We studied chironomid communities of four rivers in south-eastern Finland, differing in their water quality, during summer 2004 using the Chironomid Pupal Exuvial Technique, CPET. The aims of the study were to (i) test the adequacy of the generic-level identification in the CPET method, (ii) define the emergence patterns of chironomid taxa classified as intolerant to organic pollution, (iii) assess the tolerance levels of intolerant chironomids and (iv) identify taxa most indicative of good water quality. 2. Procrustean rotation analysis indicated very strong concordance between the ordinations using either species or genus-level data, suggesting that generic-level identification of chironomids is adequate for biomonitoring based on CPET. However, when only a few taxa occur in great numbers, it may be advisable to identify these to the species level, especially if these taxa are important indicators of the impact in question. 3. The detection of a particular species may require accurate timing of sampling, whereas a species-rich genus might be detected throughout a season. Given that the emergence of chironomid species may vary from year-to-year and between sampling sites, community differences detected at the species level may be related to between-site variation in species' emergence patterns rather than true differences in species composition. 4. Indicator species analysis (IndVal) showed that the distribution and abundance of intolerant chironomid taxa differed strongly among the studied rivers. Some of the intolerant taxa were restricted to unimpacted conditions, whereas others occurred mainly in impacted rivers. Thus, the indicator status of some genera (e.g. Eukiefferiella, Parametriocnemus, Stempellinella and Tvetenia) needs reassessment.					; Paavola, Riku/G-4813-2011; Muotka, Timo/JED-5466-2023	Paavola, Riku/0000-0002-4708-1413; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				JAN	2007	52	1					165	176		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2006.01670.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2006.01670.x													WOS:000242660200014

The microcosms were subjected to a 2 years simulation of two climate warming regimes (3 degreesC above ambient year-round and 3 degreesC above ambient during the summer-only), in combination with a nutrient addition (eutrophication) treatment and the presence or absence of fish. Throughout the experiment, total macrophyte abundance remained relatively high and was unaffected by warming. However, the proportion of each community made up by L. major and the growth rate of L. major increased under continuous warming. Warming did not significantly influence the abundance or growth rate of E. nuttallii. For P. natans, flowering occurred earlier in the season under continuous warming and floating leaf surface area increased under both warming treatments. The effects of nutrient addition and the presence of fish were almost exclusively warming-independent and, where of statistical significance, tended to increase and decrease macrophyte abundance, respectively. Only the growth rate of E. nuttalld was significantly increased by nutrient addition. Our observations suggest that, as a functional component of north temperate shallow lake and pond ecosystems, elodeid macrophyte communities may be broadly resilient to the small increases in temperature associated with climate warming, even when these temperature increases occur in combination with increased nutrient loading and the presence of fish. Nevertheless, it may be of some concern that the species apparently most favoured by warming in our microcosms, L. major, is an exotic which has the known potential to become problematic as a weed in temperate waters.

A homogeneous and stable sediment reference material has been prepared and certified on the basis of this protocol named SMT protocol, and will be available in spring of 2001. The SMT protocol, together with the reference material, are useful tools in the field of water management, especially at a time when quality assurance and data comparability are of paramount importance in laboratory analysis. The knowledge of the bioavailable forms of phosphorus is important not only for sediments but also for sludge and soils. Therefore, the SMT protocol could be extended to these materials and new CRMs could be prepared. The SMT protocol was used in a study of a reservoir, which allowed to calculate the P stock, therefore helping to predict the restoration delay of the lake. The paper describes the protocol and the CRM, and gives a brief outline of the case study.

Use of a very thin electrically heated metal (nichrome) wire to impress a mark on the scales of the fish is a fairly gentle procedure compared with the traditional method of branding. The thin metal filament can easily be shaped to form code symbols. About 200 000 one-summer-old pikeperch (Stizostedion lucioperca) juveniles (mean weight 2.5-5.5 g) were branded with this method during 1986-1995 and stocked in two lakes in southern Finland. No mortality or physiological responses caused by the branding were observed and the marks were readily identified on adult fish several years after application. This method is very economical. Branding instruments cost about FIM 600 and one person can mark up to 500-1 000 fish per hour. The method is suitable for pikeperch and other species with fairly small and firmly attached scales.																			0003-455X						1996	33	3-4					617	620																WOS:A1996WB44500038

There is usually a quick succession between these two cyanobacterial blooms in early summer; however, there is currently no solid evidence based on photosynthesis and population competition to explain this phenomenon. This study compared the photosynthetic parameters and the indirectly measured thylakoid membrane fluidity characteristics between Anabaena and Microcystis. The results showed that the growth rate, the maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII (F-v/F-m), and the maximum relative electron transport rate (rETR(max)) of Microcystis cultured at 25 degrees C were significantly lower than those from cells grown at 15 degrees C, indirectly suggesting a marked limitation of thylakoid membrane fluidity at low temperatures. Chlorophyll fluorescence dynamics also indicated inhibition of NPQ formation and membrane fluidity when Microcystis was cultured at low temperatures; however, this inhibition was not significant for Anabaena. Fourier transition infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry indicated that the thylakoid membrane of Anabaena can maintain homeostasis fluidity through the upregulation of unsaturated fatty acids when exposed to chilling stress. Increasing the temperature significantly promoted the growth rate of Microcystis, while it had little effect on Anabaena. Moreover, photoinhibition of Anabaena was more easily induced by high light, thus accelerating the bloom succession from Anabaena to Microcystis during warm seasons. An activation-energy model was used to deduce that the threshold temperature of bloom succession was 15.4 degrees C, which would increase to 16.2 degrees C and decrease to 14.9 degrees C under conditions of N-limitation and P-limitation.

Besides reducing pollutant emissions, improving nutrient assimilative capacity in wetlands is also significant for preventing eutrophication. Hydrological management can improve nutrient assimilative capacity in wetlands through physical effects on the dilution capacity of water body and ecological effects on wetland nutrient cycles. The ecological effects are significant while were rarely considered in previous research. This study focused on the ecological effects of hydrological management on two crucial nutrient removal processes, plant uptake and biological denitrification, in plant-dominated wetlands. A dual-objective optimization model for hydrological management was developed to improve wetland nitrogen and phosphorus assimilative capacities, using upstream reservoir release as water regulating measure. The model considered the interactions between ecological processes and hydrological cycles in wetlands, and their joint effects on nutrient assimilative capacity. Baiyangdian Wetland, the largest freshwater wetland in northern China, was chosen as a case study. The results found that the annual total assimilative capacity of nitrogen (phosphorus) was 4754 (493) t under the optimal scheme for upstream reservoir operation. The capacity of nutrient removal during the summer season accounted for over 80% of the annual total removal capacity. It was interesting to find that the relationship between water inflow and nutrient assimilative capacity in a plant-dominated wetland satisfied a dose-response relationship commonly describing the response of an organism to an external stressor in the medical field. It illustrates that a plant-dominated wetland shows similar characteristics to an organism. This study offers a useful tool and some fresh implications for future management of wetland eutrophication prevention. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Increased lake water temperatures were noted in 6 months of the year, with a smaller decline in water temperature with increasing depth in 2007-2008 than 1986-1987; resulting in a significantly higher (by 1.5A degrees C) mean annual value of 24.7A degrees C. Plots of water temperature gradients against depth revealed a decline in thermocline from 10- to 15-m depth in 1986-1987 to a consistent 5-m depth in 2007-2008. Lake water pH declined significantly from a mean annual value of 7.89 in 1986-1987 to 6.96 in 2007-2008; this decrease restricted to 6 months of the year. Lake water dissolved oxygen contents in 8 months of the year, increased significantly from a mean annual value of 5.45 mg l(-1) in 1986-1987 to 6.94 mg l(-1) in 2007-2008, with a substantially smaller decline in dissolved oxygen content with increasing depth evident in 2007-2008 than 1986-1987.

Using observation networks to examine the impact of Lake Okeechobee discharges on the St. Lucie Estuary, Florida	OCEAN SENSING AND MONITORING X	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Ocean Sensing and Monitoring X	APR 17-18, 2018	Orlando, FL	SPIE				The St. Lucie River Estuary (SLE) in southeast Florida has a very large watershed comprised of several natural rivers and a network of artificial canals used for water supply and flood control. One of the largest and most critical of these canals is the C-44, which connects Lake Okeechobee to the South Fork of the SLE and is one of the primary means by which excess water is drained from the lake. Major discharges from the lake at the start of the 2016 summer wet season resulted in one of the most severe harmful algal blooms in the SLE in recent history, causing millions of dollars of economic losses in the area. Despite similar discharges from Lake Okeechobee in 2017 following Hurricane Irma, no such bloom occurred. However, algae blooms are not the only hazard associated with lake discharges. Large influxes of freshwater harm organisms adapted to life in a brackish estuary. Observation networks, augmented with ad hoc sampling, can speak volumes about the status of the ecosystem and the impact of water management decisions. Examination of historical data can begin to reveal the causes of negative ecological events in the SLE and the conditions correlated to the termination of the event. Stakeholders can use this data to inform choices about potential discharges, including timing and volume, and verify expected outcomes via real-time network data, thereby mitigating ecological and economic harm to the SLE.																			0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-1774-2				2018	10631								UNSP 1063109	10.1117/12.2309797	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2309797													WOS:000454322000007

We use satellite data products from the Terra and Aqua MODerateresolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Landsat-7 and-8 satellites, along with meteorological and streamflow data, and modeled data products to study the relationship between changing snow-cover conditions and the decline of the GSL since 2000 in the context of the historical record of lake levels. The GSL basin includes much of the snow-dominated Wasatch and Uinta mountain ranges to the east of the lake. Snowmelt feeds the Bear, Jordan, and Weber rivers which are the three main rivers that flow into the lake. Snowmelttiming maps, derived from a new MODIS standard snow-cover product, MOD10A1F, show that snow melted-9.5 days earlier in the GSL basin during the study period, extending from 2000 to 2018. Air temperatures derived from 26 meteorological stations and surface temperatures measured by the Aqua MODIS land-surface temperature (LST) products, MYD21A1D and MYD21A1N, show trends of increasing temperature of similar to 0.94 degrees C (alpha = 0.05), and similar to 2.18 degrees C, respectively, with most of the LST trends in the GSL basin being statistically significant (alpha = 0.05). Increasing air temperatures in the basin have led to less precipitation falling as snow, lower snow depth (by-34.5 mm (alpha = 0.01)) and snow-water equivalent (0.02 mm (alpha = 0.01)), and earlier snowmelt. Also during the study period, Global Land surface Evaporation Amsterdam Model data show evaporation increasing by similar to 3.2 mm/yr, with trends in much of the basin being statistically significant (alpha = 0.05). Trends calculated from the various products are generally in agreement indicating higher temperatures, greater evaporation, less snowfall and snow-on-the ground, and earlier snowmelt. Earlier snowmelt contributes to increasing evaporative loss from water flowing toward the lake. Furthermore, a lower mountain snowpack and less precipitation falling as snow (versus rain) is associated with lower stream discharge even if overall precipitation stays the same. The surface-water temperature of the GSL also increased over the study period by similar to 0.69 degrees C, according to the MODIS LST data products, the surface-water elevation of the lake dropped by similar to 1.7 m between 2000 and 2018, and the areal extent of the lake decreased by similar to 901 km(2) as measured using Landsat imagery. Desiccation of the lake is associated with deleterious effects on wildlife, recreational activities, and some local industries. And, importantly, an expanding lake bed can also fuel dust storms that promote dangerous air quality along the Wasatch Front. This work elucidates the key role that satellite remote sensing can play in documenting earlier snowmelt and other changes in the GSL basin that influence the ongoing decline of the Great Salt Lake.

J	Deydier-Stephan, L; Bertru, G; Le Rouzic, B				Deydier-Stephan, L; Bertru, G; Le Rouzic, B			A chemotaxonomic method to quantify phytoplankton groups in freshwater lentic mesocosms: an approach including chlorophyll a breakdown products	COMPTES RENDUS BIOLOGIES												The use of HPLC methods to determine and quantify phytoplankton population composition, is sometimes less time-consuming than microscopic identification. However, its general application poses problems since high discrepancies between chlorophyll a calculated using chemotaxonomic methods and direct measurements were noticed. For instance, chemotaxonomic protocols generally employed can lead to a poor estimation of total and relative abundance when high amounts of chlorophyll a breakdown products are present. Therefore, we propose a new approach to calculate relative abundance of algal groups in a phytoplankton population, based on integration of these degradation products in the chemotaxonomic assessment in lentic and shallow freshwater ecosystems.

J	Smoot, JC; Findlay, RH				Smoot, JC; Findlay, RH			Spatial and seasonal variation in a reservoir sedimentary microbial community as determined by phospholipid analysis	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Sediment samples were collected monthly from Acton Lake, a eutrophic reservoir located in an agricultural region of southwestern Ohio, from three stations (River, Middle, and Dam) during the period May 1995 through January 1997. Sedimentary microbial biomass and community structures from these stations were studied using phospholipid analysis. At the River and Middle stations, the water column remained aerobic throughout the year, whereas the water overlying the Dam station sediments became anaerobic during summer stratification. Sedimentary microbial biomass at the River and Middle stations, as measured by the phospholipid phosphate (PLP) method, ranged from 225 to 450 nmol PLP g(-1) d.w. (dry weight). Sedimentary microbial biomass at the Dam station was typically greater and ranged from 500 to 1,500 nmot PLP g(-1) d.w. Principal component analysis of phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles indicated that the sedimentary microbial communities at all three stations displayed seasonal patterns of change. Among these patterns of change was a shift from aerobic microorganisms during times of cold water to anaerobic microorganisms during times of warm water. The Dam station differed from the River and Middle stations in that sediments from this station had disproportionately more polyenoic fatty acids, whereas sediments from the River and Middle stations had disproportionately more bacterial fatty acids. These data suggest that the Dam station may be a depositional zone for microeukaryotic phytoplankton produced in the overlying water column. These findings have implications for the understanding of carbon flux in reservoirs and preservation of organic matter in aquatic systems.

Dynamics of the invasive spiny water flea, Bythotrephes longimanus, in Lake Simcoe, Ontario, Canada	INLAND WATERS												The invasion of the nonindigenous zooplankter Bythotrephes longimanus in Lake Simcoe has the potential to impact overall ecosystem functioning, yet there is currently no information regarding the status and dynamics of its population. We used a combination of uni- and multivariate analyses to examine variation in Bythotrephes interannual and seasonal abundance, and life-history characteristics in Lake Simcoe from 1999 to 2007, and we explored the biotic (predators, prey) and/or abiotic (water quality, temperature) factors that may have regulated its population over this period. The mean annual abundance of Bythotrephes varied by an order of magnitude over the period of study and was significantly associated with epilimnetic temperature and prey and predator abundance. Bythotrephes typically appeared in early summer and had 2 seasonal abundance peaks, which varied in magnitude and timing within and among years. August and September Secchi depth and total phosphorus concentration predicted groups of years with similar Bythotrephes phenologies, lending further support to the role of water clarity as a significant component of this visual predator's habitat in its invaded range. Bythotrephes body size and reproductive patterns also varied seasonally, possibly reflecting the seasonal availability of cladoceran prey, predation pressure from planktivorous fish, or adaptations to avoid unfavourable conditions. Overall, a complex interaction of fish predation, food availability, temperature, and water clarity controlled the dynamics of Bythotrephes in Lake Simcoe. Changes to the Lake Simcoe ecosystem due to Bythotrephes invasion may have important consequences for the ecosystem services provided by the lake and merit further investigation.

The HONO mixing ratios ranged from 4 to 17 pptv in the FT and from 8 to 74 pptv in the BL. The HONO distribution pattern was strongly influenced by the air column stability, i.e., strong negative HONO gradients existed in stable BL in the morning hours, whereas the HONO distribution was relatively uniform in the unstable and well-mixed BL in the afternoons. The ground surface was a major source of HONO in the lower BL. The presence of substantial daytime HONO in the FT (similar to 8 pptv) and in the upper BL (25 pptv) suggests that a significant in situ source of HONO exists in the air column.

One day prior to presentation, the patient was swimming at a local lake known to be contaminated with high levels of blue-green algae that was responsible for deaths of several other dogs the same summer. The patient presented 24 hr after exposure with vomiting, inappetence, weakness, and lethargy. Blood work at the time of admission was consistent with acute hepatic failure, characteristic findings of intoxication by Microcystis spp. Diagnosis was suspected by analyzing a water sample from the location where the patient was swimming. Supportive care including fluids, fresh frozen plasma, whole blood, vitamin K, B complex vitamins, S-adenosyl methionine, and Silybum marianum were started. The patient was discharged on supportive medications, and follow-up blood work showed continued improvement. Ingestion is typically fatal for most patients.

Host Plant Phenology Affects Performance of an Invasive Weevil, Phyllobius oblongus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), in a Northern Hardwood Forest	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												We investigated how host plant phenology and plant species affected longevity, reproduction, and feeding behavior of an invasive weevil. Phyllobius oblongus L. (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is common in northern hardwood forests of the Great Lakes Region. Adults emerge in spring, feed on foliage of woody understory plants, and oviposit in the soil. Preliminary data indicate that adults often feed on sugar maple, Acer saccharum Marshall, foliage early in the season, then feed on other species such as raspberry, Rams spp. Whether this behavior reflects temporal changes in the quality of A. saccharum tissue or merely subsequent availability of later-season plants is unknown. We tested adult P. oblongus in laboratory assays using young (newly flushed) sugar maple foliage, old (2-3 wk postflush) sugar maple foliage, and raspberry foliage. Raspberry has indeterminate growth, thus always has young foliage available for herbivores. Survival, oviposition, and leaf consumption were recorded. In performance assays under no-choice conditions, mated pairs were provided one type of host foliage for the duration of their lives. In behavioral choice tests, all three host plants were provided simultaneously and leaf area consumption was compared. Adults survived longer on and consumed greater amounts of young maple and raspberry foliage than old maple foliage. P. oblongus preferred young maple foliage to old maple foliage early in the season, however, later in the growing season weevils showed less pronounced feeding preferences. These results suggest how leaf phenology, plant species composition, and feeding plasticity in host utilization may interact to affect P. oblongus population dynamics.

Eco-hydrological impacts of Eucalyptus in the semi humid Ethiopian Highlands: the Lake Tana Plain	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY AND HYDROMECHANICS												Eucalyptus is the tree of choice for wood production by farmers in Ethiopia. Although there are many claims about its harmful effect on ecology and water availability, little actual research exists. The main objective of this study was, therefore, to study the extent of harm of Eucalyptus on the ecosystem. This study was conducted at the Koga Watershed near Lake Tana in Ethiopia. Twenty-five farmers were interviewed and a field experiment with three replications was carried out to quantify the effect of Eucalyptus on various soil physical and chemical properties and maize crop measurements and to compare bulk density, soil moisture contents, maize crop counts and shading effects in fields bordered by Eucalyptus and Croton macrostachyus. Our results show that Eucalyptus decreased both soil nutrients and maize yields within 20 m of the trees. Although moisture content was not affected during the monsoon, it decreased faster within 30 m of the Eucalyptus trees than elsewhere. Soils become water repellent, too. Local farmers' perception agreed with our experimental findings and indicated that Eucalyptus trees are exhausting the once productive land. They also reported that Eucalyptus dries up springs. Despite this, the growers insist on planting Eucalyptus because of its cash income.

Water and sediment samples were taken from a total of 6 sampling stations. Both physicochemical features (pH, dissolved oxygen, water temperature, conductivity, salinity, TDS (total dissolved solids), chlorophyll-a, Secchi Disk, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate, sulfate, fluoride, chloride, B, Na, Mg, Al, K, Ca, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Cd, Sb, Ba, Tl, Pb) and biological components were investigated. A total of 47 zooplanktonic taxa (22923 ind/m3); 97 phytoplanktonic taxa (1679 ind/ml); 24 benthic macroinvertebrate taxa (3088 ind/m2) were recognized. The salinity, conductivity, and TDS results showed that the lagoon complex has brackishwater features. According to the surface water resources control regulation the parameters pH, water temperature, and dissolved oxygen were found to have acceptable limits; ion concentrations were found at acceptable limits at all sampling stations and all sampled seasons except Boron in the winter season (minimum 1726.5 ppb, maximum 6031.9 ppb), and the values of nutrients exceeded at times during the year. These observations emphasize the limnological richness of the lagoon complex and its worth for monitoring environmental changes.

Poor body condition and diet diversity in a harvested population of fishers	WILDLIFE BIOLOGY												Though fishers Pekania pennanti were extirpated from most of their historical range in the United States, they have successfully repatriated many areas, and are now legally harvested in the Great Lakes region. Recent harvests and winter track surveys, however, suggest fisher populations may again be decreasing in northern Wisconsin. We investigated potential factors contributing to this purported decrease by quantifying fisher diet in northern Wisconsin via stable isotope analysis (delta C-13 and delta N-15) and examining body condition of individual fishers using measurements of fat depots. Diet reconstruction revealed small mammals and porcupines constitute the largest portions of fishers' diets in Wisconsin. Body condition analyses showed that contemporary fishers carry significantly less body fat compared to Wisconsin fishers two decades ago and to two other regional populations. Our findings contrast with past regional studies that report snowshoe hares and white-tailed deer carrion as the largest components of fisher diet. We suggest the diet and body condition of fishers in Wisconsin could be due to low availability of preferred prey other than porcupines on the landscape, which may be contributing to the recent putative population decrease.																			0909-6396	1903-220X					2018									wlb.00334	10.2981/wlb.00334	http://dx.doi.org/10.2981/wlb.00334													WOS:000425448600001

During the snowmelt, the rapid release of acid anions can cause an episodic pH depression in surface water. The potential for the snowmelt to acidify the surface water of the Sierra Nevada was investigated at the Eastern Brook Lane watershed. The acidification potential of snowpack is determined by the anion release rate, which is difficult to measure directly. Limited measurements of snowpack were combined with a mathematical model to calculate the solute flux in snowmelt runoff. In the springs of 1984-1986, the snowpack accumulated an average of 40 cm of water. It stored 80 equivalents per hectare of acidic anions. The melting rate of the snowpack was 0.5 cm of water equivalent per day and the anion release rate was 1.4 equivalents per hectare per day. This anion release rate was one-tenth that of the Woods Lake watershed in the Adirondacks, New York.																			0733-9372					JUL-AUG	1991	117	4					472	486		10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9372(1991)117:4(472)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9372(1991)117:4(472)													WOS:A1991FY66400007

The release rate of OC (dissolved and particulate) from epipelic algae was similar to 45.4 ng C m(-2) h(-1) Bacterioplankton uptake of dissolved OC was P-limited, and pelagic primary production (PP) was colimited by N and P. Pelagic BP (3.2 +/- 6 mu g C L-1 h(-1)) exceeded pelagic PP (0.012 +/- 0.008 mu g C L-1 h(-1)). Pelagic BP was higher in lake water in contact with sediments and the epipelic algae growing on their surface than in water separated from the sediments. Epipelic algae release OC to lake water and potentially stimulate pelagic BP. However, exploitation of benthic OC probably is suboptimal because of nutrient limitation (primarily by inorganic P) of BP.

It occurs around the margins of lakes, on bogs, along the edges of stream banks, and along the seacoast, particularly in poorly drained areas behind sand dunes. In Canada, plants flower from the last week of June to the end of July and the berries mature in late fall, generally during the last two weeks of October. Named cultivars are grown commerically in the United States, particularly in New Jersey, Masssachusetts, Wisconsin, Washington and Oregon. In Canada the main commerical area is in British Columbia with lesser plantings in Nova Scotia, Quebec and Ontario. The attractive dark red berries are used in the production of sauce and jelly. Currently more than 50 per cent of the crop goes into the production of cranberry juice.																			0008-3550					JAN-MAR	1986	100	1					89	104																WOS:A1986D587600014

A conceptual framework for the identification and characterization of lacustrine spawning habitats for native lake charr Salvelinus namaycush	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Lake charr Salvelinus namaycush are endemic to the formerly glaciated regions of North America and spawn primarily in lakes, unlike most other Salmoninae. Spawning habitats for lake charr are thought to be characterized by relatively large substrate particle sizes which provide sufficient interstitial spaces for egg incubation, but little is known about the physical processes that create or maintain suitable habitats. We review the literature on lake charr spawning habitat and present a conceptual framework that examines the roles of physical variables in creating the appropriate conditions for egg incubation. A critical underlying assumption of this framework is that lake charr will select spawning habitats that provide suitable hypolentic flows for egg incubation. We suggest that the characterization of lakebed surface roughness, current patterns, substrate particle size, and groundwater flows at multiple spatial scales may yield significant insight into the physical mechanisms supporting lacustrine spawning habitats for lake charr and will be useful in creating predictive models of these habitats. This framework may also apply to other lake-spawning lithophilic fish species.					; Marsden, Ellen/JVO-2249-2024	Riley, Stephen/0000-0002-8968-8416; Middel, Trevor/0000-0002-8390-1220; Farha, Steven/0000-0001-9953-6996; Esselman, Peter/0000-0002-0085-903X													0378-1909	1573-5133				DEC	2019	102	12					1533	1557		10.1007/s10641-019-00928-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-019-00928-w		OCT 2019											WOS:000493370000001

We hypothesized that long-term averages of light-related variables would be better predictors of lake metabolism than nutrient-related variables. Model input parameters were in situ high-frequency measurements of dissolved oxygen, temperature, and irradiance. Model simulations were conducted for several (5-12) diel cycles for each lake during the summer season. Accounting for uncertainty, the results from the Bayesian model revealed that 2 lakes were autotrophic for the duration of the experiment, 1 was heterotrophic, and 5 were balanced or had an ambiguous metabolic state. Cross-comparison with a traditional bookkeeping model showed that the majority of lakes were in metabolic balance. A strong coupling between primary production and respiration was observed, with the share of autochthonous primary production respired by consumers increasing with light extinction and nutrient-related variables. Unlike gross primary production, community respiration was strongly related to light extinction, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total phosphorus. These findings suggest that a drastic decrease in light-limited primary production along the DOC gradient counter-balanced nutrient supply in the darker lakes and thus blurred the relationship between primary production and nutrients. Thus, contrary to our hypothesis, both light and nutrient-related variables seemed to be good predictors of lake respiration and its coupling to lake primary production.

The basis for the higher carrying capacity of West Lost Lake lies in its steeper basin slope which extends more of its littoral leaf fall distribution to the deeper waters where the social dominance of males forces the female adults to reside. As a result there is a greater available supply of allochthonous food provided for the female brood stock in West Lost Lake. Even though attached egg production per female breeder is the same in both lakes, more hatchlings are produced in West Lost because it has a greater density of nursery area provided by larger beds of Carex aquatilis var. substricta. Because the survival rate of crayfish throughout life does not differ in the two lakes, the higher production in West Lost is attributed to a greater carrying capacity for both young and adults.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1981	38	2					175	183		10.1139/f81-023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f81-023													WOS:A1981LL29500007
J	RIEMANN, B				RIEMANN, B			OCCURRENCE AND ECOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE OF DISSOLVED ATP IN FRESH-WATER	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Dissolved ATP, defined as ATP which passes through 0.2 .mu.m filters, was found in fresh water. During the spring diatom bloom in 2 eutrophic Danish lakes, concentrations of dissolved ATP varied between 0.1 and 3.8 .mu.g/l, consituting 14-76% of the total ATP (particulate plus dissolved ATP). The kinetics of the light emission obtained from mixing firefly enzyme with dissolved ATP demonstrated that the major proportion of the dissolved ATP was in fact ATP. Despite some variations, the seasonal changes in dissolved ATP paralleled the changes in the increasing phytoplankton population during the rise of the diatom blooms. The dissolved ATP increased after the diatom peak, indicating that release of ATP from the phytoplankton due to mortality may be a major source of dissolved ATP. Consumption of dissolved ATP was evaluated in uptake experiments using 3H-ATP. Rates of uptake of 3H-ATP by microorganisms (diameter 0.2-0.6 .mu.m) were close to the rates for 3H-D-glucose uptake. The variations in 3H-ATP uptake during the diatom blooms showed non-systematic changes and ranged between 1.0-15.8%/h (mean = 4.9%/h) of the quantity added. Turonover rates for dissolved ATP varied between 12-730 ng/l per h (mean = 175 ng/l per h). These rather high rates of turnover suggest that dissolved ATP is important in the metabolism of freshwater bacteria.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1979	9	5					481	490		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1979.tb01532.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1979.tb01532.x													WOS:A1979HM73000009

Young larvae, few days after hatching, moved towards the middle of the lake and into greater depths, but the first 3 wk they remained in water not touching the bottom. Maximum numbers of larvae occurred immediately after hatching at the turn of the summer. Differences in the numbers of larvae in particular periods of different years were considerable, over 20 times in the dystrophic lake. Intense migration of larvae from the bottom zone to the epilimnion was from June-Sep. in the eutrophic lake.																			0070-9557						1978	26	2					259	272																WOS:A1978FW20200007

Extreme windstorms in the Northeastern USA in the contemporary and future climate	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												Cold-season windstorms represent an important, and potentially changing, geophysical hazard in the Northeastern United States. Here we employ an integrated research methodology including both a storyline approach, where three intense windstorms from the current climate are subjected to pseudo-global warming (PGW) experiments, and a long-term transient simulation using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. An ensemble of WRF simulations is built for each windstorm using different planetary boundary layer and microphysical parameterizations. The fidelity assessment suggests all ensemble members capture the windstorm evolution in contemporary climate. The configuration with highest fidelity is used in the PGW experiments performed with perturbed temperature fields, constant relative humidity, and deiced Great Lakes. These perturbation simulations indicate some evidence for a reduction of sea level pressure and increases in wind speed over and downwind of the Great Lakes and over the Atlantic Ocean plus an increase in precipitation accumulation but a reduction in snow coverage. These changes are spatially inhomogeneous in terms of magnitude and sign but are consistent with changes in potential vorticity. Alberta Clippers and Colorado Lows dominate the cyclones responsible for historical windstorms and thus are sampled in the PGW simulations. However, the transient simulation suggests an increasing role for tropical cyclones that undergo transition to extratropical cyclones. This reinforces the value of combining information from both PGW perturbation experiments within a storyline context and transient simulations when seeking to quantify the future risk associated with cold-season windstorms under changing climate.

Dendroclimatology in Fennoscandia - from past accomplishments to future potential	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Fennoscandia has a strong tradition in dendrochronology, and its large tracts of boreal forest make the region well suited for the development of tree-ring chronologies that extend back several thousands of years. Two of the world's longest continuous (most tree-ring chronologies are annually resolved) tree-ring width chronologies are found in northern Fennoscandia, with records from Tornetrask and Finnish Lapland covering the last ca. 7500 yr. In addition, several chronologies between coastal Norway and the interior of Finland extend back several centuries. Tree-ring data from Fennoscandia have provided important information on regional climate variability during the mid to late Holocene and have played major roles in the reconstruction of hemispheric and global temperatures. Tree-ring data from the region have also been used to reconstruct large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns, regional precipitation and drought. Such information is imperative when trying to reach better understanding of natural climate change and variability and its forcing mechanisms, and placing recent climate change within a long-term context.

The first report was from Sweden in Lake Ekholmssjon, where Carlin found it in 1943, and later it has been found in several other locations in southern Sweden. Kellicottia bostoniensis bostoniensis was found in phytoplankton samples from Lake Tarjannevesi (in the northern part of the Kokemaenjoki river basin) in the summer of 1987. The highest density of species was 560 ind./l in the surface water (1 m). The species was found in samples from four sampling stations along the lake, which is slightly polluted by a sulphite pulp mill on the upper part of the water course. The species has only four anterior spines and its total length is < 410 .mu.m (the average in the material studied was 381 .+-. 23.7 .mu.m).																			0003-455X	1797-2450					1988	25	3					249	252																WOS:A1988R243900005

The deviations of each chemical component from the line through origin and the plot of the 2 ionic sums (line of proportional composition) give information about the differences in composition of the 2 types of water. Assuming the geologic conditions of the ground- and surface-water are similar when the plots of Ca and Mg will fall close to the ionic sum line, the alkalinity is relatively higher and the sulfate concentration is relatively lower in ground-water than in surface-water. In areas influenced by acid precipitation the ground-water is acidified less than the surface-water.

Individually coded ultrasonic transmitters were implanted into the body cavity of 15 adult male black crappie in each water body prior to spawning. Available habitat characteristics were recorded at 75 randomly selected sites within each water body, and habitat characteristics at nesting sites were recorded for each male black crappie believed to be nesting. Of the habitat characteristics analyzed, only substrate firmness did not differ (P = 0.79) between water bodies. In Richmond Lake, black crappie selected nesting sites with live cattails (Typha spp.) that were protected from prevailing south winds. In Brant Lake, black crappie selected nest sites with vegetation (usually woody debris) and silty substrate that had warmer water and were protected from wind and waves. It appeared that black crappie nested in the most protected areas available.

Ford Lake, an artificial impoundment at the lower end of the Huron River drainage basin below Ypsilanti, Michigan [USA], receives all upstream flow (2072 km2 of drainage). During dry weather an overall daytime FC disappearance rate of 0.4 (h-1) disappearance coefficient base e was measured using dye tracer for timed collection, assuming a 1st order equation of the Chick type. Sedimentation was demonstrated as important in the overall FC disappearance in the upper end of the lake. Rooftop studies showed light level to affect daytime disappearance. Two types of wet weather conditions were documented: where a substantial increase in flow occurred due to an isolated upriver storm; and as a result of 2 different storm events in the Ford Lake area itself. In both cases, Ford Lake was effective in substantially reducing the large FC contribution.																			0043-1354	1879-2448					1983	17	11					1595	1601		10.1016/0043-1354(83)90017-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(83)90017-9													WOS:A1983RM80000017

Variable Production by Different Pelagic Energy Mobilizers in Boreal Lakes	ECOSYSTEMS												We studied production by three key pelagic energy mobilizer communities, phytoplankton (PP), heterotrophic bacteria (HB), and methanotrophic bacteria (MOB), in five boreal lakes of varying size and concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Production by PP was responsible for most (> 55%) of the total pelagic energy mobilization in all five lakes. Production by HB and PP estimated for the whole water column during the ice-free period were positively correlated, but with the exception of the clearest and most eutrophic lake PP apparently could not support the total carbon demand of bacteria. However, the DOC concentration did not explain the variability of heterotrophic bacterial production (HBP) within or between the lakes. Thus, our results provide circumstantial evidence for the "priming effect" whereby labile organic matter from autochthonous production enhances decomposition of allochthonous DOC. However, HBP was only 10-23% of the total pelagic energy mobilization in the lakes, suggesting that only a minor fraction of allochthonous DOC became available for higher trophic levels. High MOB activity was detected in the water columns of the stratified lakes when the molar ratio of CH4:O-2 varied between 0.5 and 12. In the small stratified lakes (area < 0.01 km(2)), MOB production contributed 13-52% of the total pelagic energy mobilization, being greatest during the autumn mixing period. Our results indicate that in small stratified lakes (area < 0.01 km(2)) bacteria, especially MOB, are potentially quantitatively important supplementary food resources for zooplankton. However, in larger lakes primary producers are the most important (> 70%) potential food source for zooplankton.

Concentrations of DDT + DDD and dieldrin in American white pelican (P. erythrorhynchos) eggs collected at the Klamath Basin National Wildlife Refuges decreased from 1969 to 1981; DDE and polychlorobiphenyl (PCB) residues did not significantly change. Differences between PCB residues in eggs collected from Lower Klamath and Clear Lake colonies in 1969 suggest different migration routes or wintering areas between populations nesting at these 2 locations. White pelican and western grebe (A. occidentalis) PCB/DDE ratios were 0.13 and 1.58, respectively, suggesting different exposure patterns. White pelican eggshell thickness increased between 1969 and 1981, but remained significantly less than pre-1947 values. Western grebe shell thickness was not significantly different from pre-1947 values. Endrin caused some of the pelican mortalities in the Klamath Basin from 1975 to 1981.

Only certain phytoplankton taxa can synthesize eicosapentaenoic (EPA; 20:5 omega 3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6 omega 3), whereas all phytoplankton taxa can synthesize shorter-chain omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA. Here, we experimentally studied how the proportion, concentration (per DW and cell-specific), and production (mu g FA L-1 day(-1)) of omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA varied among six different phytoplankton main groups (16 freshwater strains) and between exponential and stationary growth phase. EPA and DHA concentrations, as dry weight, were similar among cryptophytes and diatoms. However, Cryptomonas erosa had two-27 times higher EPA and DHA content per cell than the other tested cryptophytes, diatoms, or golden algae. The growth was fastest with diatoms, green algae, and cyanobacteria, resulting in high production of medium chain omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA. Even though the dinoflagellate Peridinium cinctum grew slowly, the content of EPA and DHA per cell was high, resulting in a three- and 40-times higher production rate of EPA and DHA than in cryptophytes or diatoms. However, the production of EPA and DHA was 40 and three times higher in cryptophytes and diatoms than in golden algae (chrysophytes and synyrophytes), respectively. Our results show that phytoplankton taxon explains 56-84% and growth phase explains similar to 1% of variation in the cell-specific concentration and production of omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA, supporting understanding that certain phytoplankton taxa play major roles in the synthesis of essential fatty acids. Based on the average proportion of PUFA of dry weight during growth, we extrapolated the seasonal availability of PUFA during phytoplankton succession in a clear water lake. This extrapolation demonstrated notable seasonal and interannual variation, the availability of EPA and DHA being prominent in early and late summer, when dinoflagellates or diatoms increased.					; Salmi, Pauliina/AAM-4868-2020; Taipale, Sami/AAO-3492-2020	Salmi, Pauliina/0000-0003-3247-2259; Peltomaa, Elina/0000-0002-2858-8358; Taipale, Sami/0000-0001-7510-7337														2218-273X				APR	2020	10	4							559	10.3390/biom10040559	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biom10040559								32268552					WOS:000539492400065

The onset, duration, area and fate of surface melting varies spatially and temporally, and the resultant surface meltwater is stored as ponded water (lakes) or as slush (saturated firn or snow), with implications for ice-shelf hydrofracture, firn air content reduction, surface energy balance and thermal evolution. This study applies a machine-learning method to the entire Landsat 8 image catalogue to derive monthly records of slush and ponded water area across 57 ice shelves between 2013 and 2021. We find that slush and ponded water occupy roughly equal areas of Antarctica's ice shelves in January, with inter-regional variations in partitioning. This suggests that studies that neglect slush may substantially underestimate the area of ice shelves covered by surface meltwater. Furthermore, we found that adjusting the surface albedo in a regional climate model to account for the lower albedo of surface meltwater resulted in 2.8 times greater snowmelt across five representative ice shelves. This extra melt is currently unaccounted for in regional climate models, which may lead to underestimates in projections of ice-sheet melting and ice-shelf stability. Analysis of satellite imagery suggests that slush accounts for approximately half of the total meltwater area across Antarctic ice shelves.					; Arnold, Neil/AAI-2272-2021; Dell, Rebecca/MXM-0655-2025; Banwell, Alison/W-8180-2018	Arnold, Neil/0000-0001-7538-3999; Banwell, Alison/0000-0001-9545-829X; Willis, Ian/0000-0002-0750-7088; Dell, Rebecca/0000-0001-6617-3906; de Roda Husman, Sophie/0000-0001-8830-9894													1752-0894	1752-0908				JUL	2024	17	7								10.1038/s41561-024-01466-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41561-024-01466-6		JUN 2024											WOS:001257010400001

Protecting cisco (Coregonus artedi Lesueur) oxythermal habitat from climate change: building resilience in deep lakes using a landscape approach	BIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT OF COREGONID FISHES - 2011	Advances in Limnology				11th International Symposium on the Biology and Management of Coregonid Fishes	SEP 26-30, 2011	Mondsee, AUSTRIA	Austrian Acad Sci, Austrian Fed Minist Sci & Res, Prov Govt Upper Austria, Community Mondsee				Cisco (Coregonus artedi Lesueur) was projected to persist in at least 171 deep, clear lakes in a climate-warmed Minnesota, U.S.A. A process-oriented, dynamic, one-dimensional year-round lake water quality model was used to predict coldwater habitat as a function of Secchi depth (a surrogate of lake productivity) and geometry ratio = A(s) (0 25)/H-max (a measure of relative depth and strength of stratification) for a series of lake types in Minnesota. Late-summer hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations were predicted to remain sufficiently high to provide coldwater habitat within the refuge lakes even with longer durations of stratification after climate warming. Catchments of refuge lakes were prioritised based on two components: 1) threat (changes in land use) and 2) investment efficiency (total surface area of refuge lakes protected per amount invested). Priority scores were calculated for each refuge lake catchment based on the two components. Conservation strategies can be targeted in critical areas of the prioritized catchments to prevent future degradation of water quality in refuge lakes from changes in land use.

Observations from a lake less than 4 km across were made as part of the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) winter field campaign. These are interpreted with the aid of idealized three-dimensional mesoscale model simulations representing the forest-lake contrast. Typically, strong forest-lake temperature contrasts develop in the lowest 50 m of the atmosphere during the morning. The resulting pressure gradients induce low-level onshore wind components across the lake.;This snow breeze persists into the afternoon provided that large-scale winds remain light. A characteristic snow breeze signature is clearly evident in wind observations averaged over 27 days of data, in agreement with model simulations. The study Suggests that snow breezes will regularly develop over the many larger lakes and other unvegetated areas in the region.

The coastal mangrove lagoons between Grand Saline and Gonaives, the inland lakes of Etang Saumatre and Trou Caiman, and Ile de la Gonave have been, and remained, the major areas used by flamingos. The species has been extripated from areas with high human opulation densities (Ile a Vache, Les Cayes, and Cap-Haitien). No evidence of breeding activity was observed. The last nesting colony known to occur in Haiti was reported in 1928. Available data suggest that Haiti is mostly utilized by flamingos for feeding and roosting during non-breeding, winter dispersal from Great Inagua, and perhaps Cuba. Flamingo numbers in Haiti are estiamted at about 900 (.+-. 600) birds. Population trends in Haiti are likely declining due to increasing human disturbance, habitat degradation, and exploitation for food and trade.																			0738-6028						1990	13	2					115	123		10.2307/1521577	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1521577													WOS:A1990EJ43000007

Palaeoecological and palaeoenvironmental significance of some important spores and micro-algae in Quaternary deposits	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN												Spores of ferns and allied plants, and micro-algae frequently occur in abundance in Quaternary deposits, but their palaeoenvironmental significance is seldom evaluated. This paper presents morphological descriptions of spores of Selaginella sinensis (Desv.) Spring, 1843 (Selaginellaceae) and Ceratopteris cf. thalictroides (L.) Brongniart, 1821 (Parkeriaceae) and the algae Pediastrum boryanum (Turpin) Meneghini, 1840, P. simplex Meyen, 1829, P. integrum Nageli, 1849 (all Hydrodictyaceae), Spiniferites Mantell, 1850, emend. Sarjeant, 1970 (Spiniferitaceae) and Concentricystes Rossignal, 1962, emend. Jiabo, 1978 (systematic position unclear), and discusses their occurrence in mostly Quaternary sedimentary successions. All are closely associated with aquatic habitats. Extant Selaginella sinensis often colonizes fairly wet hillsides and gaps between rocks, and shady sides of ravines and slopes; it is also found within thickets of trees and shrubs (boscages) and in forests with calcareous soils. Ceratopteris thalictroides, Pediastrum and Concentricystes inhabit freshwater lakes and both natural and artificial wetlands, such as paddy fields and ditches. Spiniferites is a salt-water genus and usually associated with the marine realm. Fossil and subfossil representatives of all of these taxa can be useful proxies of biodiversity and, therefore, also important for determining environmental conditions during the Quaternary period.

J	Denneler, B; Bergeron, Y; Begin, Y; Asselin, H				Denneler, Bernhard; Bergeron, Yves; Begin, Yves; Asselin, Hugo			Growth responses of riparian Thuja occidentalis to the damming of a large boreal lake	BOTANY-BOTANIQUE												Growth responses of riparian eastern white cedar trees (Thuja occidentalis L.) to the double damming of a large lake in the southeastern Canadian boreal forest was analyzed to determine whether the shoreline tree limit is the result of physiological flood stress or mechanical disturbances. The first damming, in 1915, caused a rise in water level of ca. 1.2 m and resulted in the death of the trees that formed the ancient shoreline forest, as well as the wounding and tilting of the surviving trees (by wave action and ice push) that constitute the present forest margin. The second damming, in 1922, did not further affect the water level, but did retard the occurrence of spring high water levels, as well as reduce their magnitude. However, this did not injure or affect the mortality of riparian eastern white cedars. Radial growth was not affected by flooding stress, probably because inundation occurred prior to the start of the growing season (1915-1921) or was of too short duration to adversely affect tree metabolism (after 1921). It follows that (i) the shoreline limit of eastern white cedar is a mechanical rather than a physiological limit, and (d) disturbance-related growth responses (e.g., ice scars, partial cambium dieback, and compression wood) are better parameters than ring width for the reconstruction of long-term water level increases of natural, unregulated lakes.

J	Cochran, PA; Kinziger, AP				Cochran, PA; Kinziger, AP			Hexagenia bilineata (Ephemeroptera: Ephemeridae) persists at low levels of abundance in the lower Fox River, Wisconsin	GREAT LAKES ENTOMOLOGIST												After burrowing mayflies (Hexagenia bilineata) were first noted in the vicinity of the DePere Dam on the Fox River in 1991, adults have been observed in small numbers each summer since then. It is possible that the Fox River population has remained at low levels because of an Allee effect. In addition, it is possible that the population is still limited by poor environmental quality, presumably in the upper layer of sediment inhabited by the larvae. Two other relatively sensitive species associated with benthic habitat, the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) and the lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), have been observed in the Fox River in recent years. Collectively these species provide an indication of improved environmental conditions, but it is not yet clear that any of the three have established populations capable of successfully reproducing in the lower Fox River on a consistent basis.																			0090-0222					FAL	1997	30	3					89	92																WOS:000072187000004

However, the quantification of the storage changes is limited by sparse in-situ observations and spatial coverage of space (air)-borne altimetric sensors that have been used conventionally in storage retrieval. This hampers the attribution analysis of lake storage changes. Here, we combined long-term optical remote sensing and multi-source terrain elevation data to derive the monthly storage time series from 1990 to 2020 for 8544 lakes and reservoirs in Central Asia, where water scarcity has been bottle-necking local socioeconomic sustainability. The regional total storage has been decreasing with a rate of -4.78 +/- 0.88 km(3) yr(-1) mainly owing to the desiccation of the Aral Sea. For other lakes, 26% of them show decreasing while 22% show increasing trends. At a watershed-scale, the long-term changes in small to medium-sized (<5000 km(2)) lakes are primarily caused by the changes in surface runoff, jointly affected by precipitation and temperature changes. We also found that 29% lakes in Central Asia experienced frequent seasonal dry out in the past decades. Such seasonal dry out is mainly caused by fast evaporation losses during the summer months. For the majority (63 +/- 8%) of these lakes, their evaporation water losses are larger than the seasonal storage drawdown. Our analysis highlights the co-regulation of surface runoff and lake evaporation in the storage losses in arid and semi-arid regions.

Surface hydrochemical dynamic in an artificial lake with anthropic impact: La Purisima reservoir, Central Mexico	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												In the present study, the hydrochemical dynamic and the water quality of La Purisima reservoir, Central Mexico, have been determined. The reservoir presents total dissolved solids (TDSs) between 146 and 328 mg L-1 and water quality neutral to slightly alkaline (pH 7.0 to 8.7) during the dry season, whereas it becomes clearly alkaline (pH 8.1-9.9) in the rainy-warm season. Through its main tributaries, La Purisima reservoir has been receiving water affected by anthropic activities, such as mining, urbanization, and agriculture. La Purisima reservoir indicates water quality suitable for irrigation and aquatic lives, but unsuitable for drinking purposes. A geochemical evolution from the riverine to the lacustrine zone is evidenced by the complexation of several free ions: the higher saturation indexes; the lower toxic metal concentrations; and the lower trophic status, which ameliorate the water quality in the lacustrine zone. Trace elements co-precipitate and are adsorbed onto bottom sediments. During summer, high evaporation rates and atmospheric precipitation are found to decline the water quality. Cluster analyses reflect the geo-setting and different pollution levels: urban impact from the north coast, and agricultural activities from the east coast. The sensitivity of the lake to geochemical behavior can be used to understand the complex dissolved geochemical dynamics in a lake and the potential effects from long-term anthropic impact variability. The information about water quality of La Purisima reservoir may be useful to preserve the ecosystem and its biodiversity.					; Zanor, Gabriela/KVB-8500-2024; Lecomte, Karina/KHD-3796-2024	Segoviano Garfias, Jose J.

J	Hills, S; Dana, S; Wang, HL				Hills, Stephen; Dana, Seth; Wang, Hailei			Dynamic modeling and simulation of nuclear hybrid energy systems using freeze desalination and reverse osmosis for clean water production	ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT												Nuclear hybrid energy systems (NHES) are a viable option to combine renewable energy sources, such as wind, with a less fluctuating energy source. Given recent development and their inherent safer and modular design, small modular reactors (SMRs) can play an instrumental role in complementing renewables and supporting carbon-free power sectors in the coming decades. This study uses OpenModelica to model two types of NHES to produce clean energy and water, both powered by SMRs and wind turbines. The first system uses freeze desalination (FD), and the second system uses reverse osmosis (RO) to generate clean water. Both systems are simulated using input data for Salt Lake City, Utah on a hot summer day. The number of SMRs and wind turbines are set so as to meet the power demand for the city. The FD system was able to boost the power production by about 12% by making the steam cycle over 2% more efficient. This allows the system to meet the power demand during peak hours. Although the RO system underperformed in meeting the power demand during the peak hours, it was able to generate approximately six times the amount of clean water as generated by the FD system.

We used colorimetry and dry weight to establish relationships between surface area and biomass for six species (Ceratophyllum demersum, Potamogeton richardsonii, P. zosterfortnis, P. pusillus, Utricularia vulgaris and Myriophyllum exalbescens). Except for P. pusillus, a positive relationship existed between surface area and biomass. The relationship was species-specific; general groupings could not be made based on leaf morphology. For three of the four species found in more than one lake, relationships did not differ across lakes. Only C. demersum, which may be sensitive to fluctuating water levels, exhibited a lake-specific relationship between surface area and biomass. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, intensity tracking, interferometry and visual interpretation have been used to characterize the ice dynamics during the surge from satellite synthetic aperture radar images. The surge had a rapid initiation that saw velocities increase by 60-1500 times, and within 13 months the entire lower 53 km of the glacier was affected. Surge termination occurred very rapidly during summer, and ice velocity dropped from around 20 m d(-1) to around 2 m d(-1) in only 3 months. Uniquely, part of the upper glacier remained fast-flowing even after the main surge event had terminated. Ice dynamics together with observations of large turbid lakes at the glacier margins suggest that the surge resulted from a throttling of basal water by a switch in the hydrological system.					; Luckman, Adrian/GVS-1716-2022; Pritchard, Hamish/AAU-4696-2021	Luckman, Adrian/0000-0002-9618-5905; Murray, Tavi/0000-0001-6714-6512; 													0260-3055		0-946417-29-6				2002	34						323	329		10.3189/172756402781817491	http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/172756402781817491													WOS:000177565100048

Baseline characteristics of climate, permafrost and land cover from a new permafrost observatory in the Lena River Delta, Siberia (1998-2011)	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Samoylov Island is centrally located within the Lena River Delta at 72 degrees N, 126 degrees E and lies within the Siberian zone of continuous permafrost. The landscape on Samoylov Island consists mainly of late Holocene river terraces with polygonal tundra, ponds and lakes, and an active floodplain. The island has been the focus of numerous multidisciplinary studies since 1993, which have focused on climate, land cover, ecology, hydrology, permafrost and limnology. This paper aims to provide a framework for future studies by describing the characteristics of the island's meteorological parameters (temperature, radiation and snow cover), soil temperature, and soil moisture. The land surface characteristics have been described using high resolution aerial images in combination with data from ground-based observations. Of note is that deeper permafrost temperatures have increased between 0.3 to 1.3 degrees C over the last five years. However, no clear warming of air and active layer temperatures is detected since 1998, though winter air temperatures during recent years have not been as cold as in earlier years.

Coping with multiple stressors: physiological mechanisms and strategies in fishes of the Salton Sea	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Saline lakes are found around the world, typically within inland drainage basins that lack outflow. While fish species in these lakes are not numerous, the Salton Sea in southeastern California, USA, supports several species and a substantial recreational fishery. The Salton Sea was formed in 1905, and since its formation, the salinity has varied greatly, and is currently approaching 44 g/l. The Salton Sea presents several environmental challenges to fishes that inhabit it, especially high salinity, large variations in temperature, and high levels of calcium and sulphate. Studies investigating the osmoregulatory ability of the California Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus x O. urolepis hornorum), the dominant species in the Salton Sea, indicate that they can tolerate salinities up to 65 g/l at 25 degrees C with minimal effects on osmoregulatory status. However, a reduction in temperature to 15 degrees C or an increase to 35 degrees C (both within the range of temperature observed in the Salton Sea) greatly reduce the salinity tolerance of this species. These data indicate that the seasonal winter kills of California Mozambique tilapia are likely associated with a direct effect of temperature on salinity tolerance at the current salinity of the Salton Sea. In this review we explore these environmental stressors and their effects on fish, particularly within the context of the Salton Sea fishery, and discuss how euryhalinity may give tilapia an advantage over the other Salton Sea species with respect to surviving the dynamic environment.																			1040-2381	2151-5530					2007	23	5					518	527		10.1080/07438140709354035	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140709354035													WOS:000207177800004

Knowledge of DIC stability under these two processes in surface water systems is crucial for evaluating the role of carbonate weathering in the global carbon cycle. Here, we evaluated the net ecosystem productivity of aquatic ecosystems (NEPs), water-air CO2 exchange fluxes (FCO2), and Carbon budgets (Carbon budget = (TOCoutput + 0.5DIC(output)) - (TOCoutput + 0.5DIC(output))) in five simulated spring-pond systems controlled by carbonate weathering and different land uses. Using these parameters and the unique structure of our simulation site, the stability of the carbonate weathering-driven carbon sink (DIC) in surface water was discussed. The results showed that the NEP and FCO2 of the study site presented significant negative relationships and were mainly controlled by aquatic ecosystem metabolisms than abiotic processes. Most aquatic ecosystems in our study site were autotrophic (NEP>0) due to the strong biological carbon pump effect (BCP) induced by carbonate weathering. Moreover, the DIC input enhanced the FCO2 in the warm season. The intensive BCP enhanced both CO2 release and atmospheric CO2 invasion. Moreover, we found that the stability of DIC was positively related to DIC input, which can be influenced by BCP and human land use. After considering the net changes in Carbon budget through the groundwater-surface water systems, a high average carbon stabilization rate (CSR) of approximately 103.7% of carbonate weathering carbon sink was found in our study site. This indicated that BCP could retain most of the DIC that was driven by carbonate weathering. Therefore, due to the high stability of the carbonate weathering carbon sink under the BCP, we stress that it should be considered a significant carbon sink in the global carbon cycle.

On 18-19 January, rain-on-snow, followed by frigid temperatures, produced an ice crust that encased the stems of the suckers. Approximately 240 cm of snow fell from 21 January to 30 April, more than 100 cm above the 30-year mean. As the snowpack above the ice lens compressed that below it, the downward movement of the lens broke the stems between the lens and the soil surface. The recurrence interval for this combination of rain-on-snow, frigid temperatures, and near-record snowfall may be on the order of 30 to 100 years.																					0-939970-77-5				1999							384	386																WOS:000085856700064

Here, we reviewed the available literature to obtain a comprehensive understanding of Hg biogeochemistry over the TP. The biogeochemical Hg cycling is characterized by the following features: (1) There are existing but limited local emission sources of anthropogenic Hg in the TP. The Indian Summer Monsoon is an important transporter of atmospheric Hg pollution into the inland TP; (2) "Cold trapping effect" plays an important role in the atmospheric Hg deposition over the TP. Glacier, vegetation, and soil act as important "sinks" of atmospheric Hg pollution; (3) Enhanced anthropogenic activities around the TP, climate warming and glacier melting have the potential impacts to affect the behavior and distribution of Hg; (4) Significant bioaccumulation of MeHg (>100 ng/g) has been found in the Tibetan aquatic food chains. Considering that transboundary transport is responsible for the widespread Hg pollution in the TP, international/regional collaborations regarding Hg emission regulations are needed to reduce the migration of Hg and to mitigate adverse Hg pollution impacts on the TP.

Stratigraphic Relations of the Ipubi Formation: Siliciclastic-Evaporitic Succession of the Araripe Basin	ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS												The Ipubi Formation represents the Aptian-Albian siliciclastic-evaporitic succession of Araripe Basin, NE Brazil. This succession comprises siliciclastic rocks (bituminous shales and claystones) and evaporites (gypstun and secondary anhydrite) and represents part of the lacustrine-shallow marine post-rift phase I. This study used sequence stratigraphy concepts to define the relations between changes in the relative lake level and the formation of Ipubi deposits. Results show that the organic-rich shales of the Ipubi Formation formed during a transgressive pulse that covered large areas of the proximal domains. These deposits overlie a regional unconfonnity that marks the end of the deposition of the underlying Crato Formation. A High Stand stage that followed the transgression influenced the formation of evaporitic deposits. Climate conditions played a major role in influencing the triggering and stopping of evaporite deposition. Thus, a new relative lake level fall event caused the exposure of the Ipubi Formation deposits, and created another regional subaerial unconfonnity accompanied by widespread karstification of evaporite beds. A posterior transgression caused the deposition of siliciclastic rocks of the Romualdo Formation over the Ipubi Formation strata, and also promoted a new event of karstification of the Ipubi upper evaporite beds.					; Gomes, Igor/AAX-7409-2020; Miranda, Tiago/P-8113-2018; BARBOSA, JOSE/AAB-4437-2020; BARBOSA, JOSE ANTONIO/AAB-4437-2020	Siqueira de Miranda, Tiago/0000-0001-9099-1271; Gomes, Igor/0000-0003-2474-383X; da Costa, Sara Gomes/0000-0002-2666-5751; BARBOSA, JOSE ANTONIO/0000-0001-8754-6310													0001-3765	1678-2690				AUG	2018	90	2		1			2049	2071		10.1590/0001-3765201820170526	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/0001-3765201820170526								29947671					WOS:000442096300011
J	ROWE, DK				ROWE, DK			FACTORS AFFECTING THE FOODS AND FEEDING PATTERNS OF LAKE-DWELLING RAINBOW-TROUT (SALMO-GAIRDNERII) IN THE NORTH ISLAND OF NEW-ZEALAND	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Differences in feeding between age classes, males and females, and hatchery reared and wild rainbow trout (S. gairdneri) in Lake Rotoma are described. Analysis of results, in conjunction with other published data on trout foods and feeding, showed that there was a summer increase in epibenthic feeding which , in Lake Rotoma, was most apparent in the species of forage fish predated upon. When trout feeding on forage fish was examined in a variety of lakes, 2 trends emerged. In large, clear, oligotrophic lakes trout fed predominantly on smelt (Retropinna retropinna) which are shoaling, epipelagic fish. Trout in small turbid lakes fed mainly on the solitary, benthic bully (Gobiomorphus cotidianus). These differences in feeding on forage fish were associated with the effects of water temperature and turbidity on trout distribution and foraging behavior.																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1984	18	2					129	141		10.1080/00288330.1984.9516036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1984.9516036													WOS:A1984TM67200003

The long-term population dynamics of this species and of the two most abundant zooplankton species, Keratella cochlearis and Bosmina longirostris, were analyzed in relation to hydrochemical and climatic variates. The maximum abundance of A. priodonta was limited to the summer months with temperature being the only significant predictor of abundance. Intrinsic rate of growth and abundance of the three species were independent from each other suggesting the absence of trophic interactions. In Lake Windsborn, A. priodonta was a grazer rather than a predator. Its diet included high proportions of colonial algae and cyanobacteria which cannot be ingested by the other abundant zooplankton species, whereas zooplanktonic food were rarely found. Thus, our study supports the hypothesis that A. priodonta is an opportunistic feeder whose trophic position entirely depends on the structure of the plankton community.

J	Interlandi, SJ; Kilham, SS; Theriot, EC				Interlandi, SJ; Kilham, SS; Theriot, EC			Responses of phytoplankton to varied resource availability in large lakes of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We assessed phytoplankton dynamics in three lakes in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem to better understand the connections between changing environmental conditions and aquatic communities. This work primarily describes the connections between resource availability and phytoplankton seasonal succession in these lakes. We hypothesized that algal species efficient at utilizing a given resource (including N, P, Si, and light) would be correlated with low relative concentrations of those resources. The lakes generally exhibited moderate resource limitation, which is characteristic of lakes in subalpine and subarctic regions. Although in proximity, the lakes all exhibited different resource relationships: Lewis Lake was most P limited, Jackson Lake was most N limited, and Yellowstone Lake exhibited a moderate degree of N limitation along with periodic Si limitation. Mixing depths and light penetration were also variable among lakes. In 1996, spring diatom biomass was dominated by Stephanodiscus minutulus, Asterionella formosa, Aulacoseira subarctica, and Synedra sp. Relative abundances and dominance varied among the lakes. A. formosa and Synedra sp. abundances were positively correlated with total N:total P (TN:TP) levels in an analysis of data from all three lakes. A. subarctica was negatively correlated with TN:TP and all light: nutrient ratios. Species exhibiting late season maxima included Cyclotella bodanica, Fragilaria crotonensis, and Stephanodiscus niagarae. C. bodanica abundances corresponded to high-light/low-N situations, whereas S, niagarae maxima were found in high-TN: TP/low-light conditions. F. crotonensis abundances were most strongly positively correlated with total Si:TP and TN:TP. Environmental correlations were generally in good agreement with the measured physiological requirements of these species. Additionally, local population maxima of major species of diatoms never coincided.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				MAY	1999	44	3					668	682		10.4319/lo.1999.44.3.0668	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1999.44.3.0668													WOS:000080326300018

The identification of specimens and their morpho-ecological features was based on morphological and morphometric analyses. The data on the general distribution of the collected species allowed the evaluation of their conservation status as well. The shell morphology and morphometric analyses revealed the existence of five species belonging to the genus Pisidium [P. casertanum (Poli, 1791), P. (cf.) personatum Malm, 1855, P. subtruncatum Malm, 1855, P. amnicum (O. F. Muller, 1774) and Pisidium sp.] and one species to the genus of Musculium [M. lacustre (O. F. Muller, 1774)]. Sphaeriidae were found in all Moroccan basins, except Bouregreg and Sakia El Hamra-Oued Eddahab Basins. The results showed that Sebou Basin was the species richest with the occurrence of the five species, while Loukkos and Sous-Massa Basins had the lowest-species richness with one species only. The conservation status of sphaeriids in Morocco was evaluated for the first time and resulted in P. (cf.) personatum and P. subtruncatum being proposed as Least Concern and Vulnerable, respectively, while the status of Regionally Extinct is suggested for both species P. amnicum and M. lacustre.

Changes in pollen assemblages and influxes suggest that local vegetation has experienced three distinct stages, from alpine coniferous forest-meadow (13 500-11 500 cal. a BP), through alpine coniferous forest (11 500-3000 cal. a BP), back to alpine coniferous forest-meadow (3000 cal. a BP-present). This record reflects an ecosystem response along a transition zone where the South Asian and East Asian monsoon systems may have had different palaeoclimatic influences. A comparison of this record with other pollen records across the Tibetan Plateau shows common features with regard to large-scale Holocene climatic changes, but highlights a pattern of regional temporal and spatial variability that depends on the topography and position relative to the South Asian and East Asian monsoon fronts.

Recent changes in a remote Arctic lake are unique within the past 200,000 years	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												The Arctic is currently undergoing dramatic environmental transformations, but it remains largely unknown how these changes compare with long-term natural variability. Here we present a lake sediment sequence from the Canadian Arctic that records warm periods of the past 200,000 years, including the 20th century. This record provides a perspective on recent changes in the Arctic and predates by approximately 80,000 years the oldest stratigraphically intact ice core recovered from the Greenland Ice Sheet. The early Holocene and the warmest part of the Last Interglacial (Marine Isotope Stage or MIS 5e) were the only periods of the past 200,000 years with summer temperatures comparable to or exceeding today's at this site. Paleoecological and geochemical data indicate that the past three interglacial periods were characterized by similar trajectories in temperature, lake biology, and lakewater pH, all of which tracked orbitally-driven solar insolation. In recent decades, however, the study site has deviated from this recurring natural pattern and has entered an environmental regime that is unique within the past 200 millennia.

J	Heath, NK; Fuelberg, HE				Heath, N. K.; Fuelberg, H. E.			Using a WRF simulation to examine regions where convection impacts the Asian summer monsoon anticyclone	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												The Asian summer monsoon is a prominent feature of the global circulation that is associated with an upper-level anticyclone (ULAC) that stands out vividly in satellite observations of trace gases. The ULAC also is an important region of troposphere-to-stratosphere transport. We ran the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model at convective-permitting scales (4 km grid spacing) between 10 and 20 August 2012 to understand the role of convection in rapidly transporting boundary layer air into the ULAC. Such high-resolution modeling of the Asian ULAC previously has not been documented in the literature. Comparison of our WRF simulation with reanalysis and satellite observations showed that WRF simulated the atmosphere sufficiently well to be used to study convective transport into the ULAC. A back-trajectory analysis based on hourly WRF output showed that > 90% of convectively influenced parcels reaching the ULAC came from the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and the southern slope (SS) of the Himalayas. A distinct diurnal cycle is seen in the convective trajectories, with a majority of them crossing the boundary layer between 1600 and 2300 local solar time. This finding highlights the role of "everyday" diurnal convection in transporting boundary layer air into the ULAC. WRF output at 15 min intervals was produced for 16 August to examine the convection in greater detail. This high-temporal output revealed that the weakest convection in the study area occurred over the TP. However, because the TP is at 3000-5000m a.m.s.l., its convection does not have to be as strong to reach the ULAC as in lower altitude regions. In addition, because the TP's elevated heat source is a major cause of the ULAC, we propose that convection over the TP and the neighboring SS is ideally situated geographically to impact the ULAC. The vertical mass flux of water vapor into the ULAC also was calculated. Results show that the TP and SS regions dominate other Asian regions in transporting moisture vertically into the ULAC. Because convection reaching the ULAC is more widespread over the TP than nearby, we propose that the abundant convection partially explains the TP's dominant water vapor fluxes. In addition, greater outgoing longwave radiation reaches the upper levels of the TP due to its elevated terrain. This creates a warmer ambient upper-level environment, allowing parcels with greater saturation mixing ratios to enter the ULAC. Lakes in the Tibetan Plateau are shown to provide favorable conditions for deep convection during the night.

We compiled information on the history and ecology of this breeding colony from U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) reports and narratives filed at Medicine Lake NWR. Nesting by American White Pelicans first occurred in 1939, and the recent 10-yr average size (19932002) is about 4,000 breeding pairs. Since 1990, the mean number of young fledged pair(-1) was 0.51 +/- 0.07 (SE, N = 56). Low temperatures, hailstorms, predation, and botulism have killed > 50% of young pelicans in some years. American White Pelicans banded at Medicine Lake migrated south, mostly within the Central Flyway. They wintered predominately in Texas, Louisiana and Mexico. Protection of the Medicine Lake colony is important because the breeding colony is the largest in Montana and an important contributor to the eastern metapopulation.																			1524-4695						2005	28				1		23	26		10.1675/1524-4695(2005)28[23:HABEOT]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/1524-4695(2005)28[23:HABEOT]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000232808400005

The water temperature was considerably lower in Section 1 than in Section 2, as the number of days with a water temperature above 10degreesC (T-Dgreater than or equal to10degreesC) from spring to August 1 ranged between 2-26 and 26-52 days, respectively. Juvenile brown trout (age 0+) attained a significantly smaller body size in Section 1 than in Section 2; mean length +/-SD was 35 +/- 8 mm (ranged 27-46) and 43 +/- 7 mm (range 38-46), respectively. In Section 2, there was a highly positive correlation between the body length of 0+ brown trout and mean water temperature in June (p < 0.005), and also to some extent in Section 1 (p = 0.11). Individuals of age 1+ did not exhibit any such difference, while fish in age group 2+ were larger in Section 1 than in Section 2. By using the number of days with a water temperature between the range 5-10°C (TD≥5-10°C) as test variables, we found a highly positive correlation between the August 1 body length of 0+ brown trout and T-D≥9 °C from spring to August 1 in Section 2 (p < 0.05), as opposed to T-Dgreater than or equal to7 degreesC for trout in Section 1 (p = 0.11). Young Siberian sculpin (age 0+ and 1+) also exhibited slower growth in Section 1 than in Section 2, but this was not the case among older specimens. In the year with the lowest temperature measured ( 1987), no 0+ Siberian sculpin were caught in any of the two sections, indicating that low temperature affects their survival. Both species exhibited large spatial and temporal variation in density. Thus, data on abundance and growth sampled on one occasion at one site can not be regarded as representative for these two fish populations.																			0018-8158					JUN	2004	521	1-3					107	115		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000026353.84792.be	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000026353.84792.be													WOS:000221177900009

The region contains abundant wetlands, especially springs, rivers and natural lakes. These systems are highly sensitive to the effects of climate change, experiencing considerable lake level, water chemistry, and biological fluctuations in response to regional hydrological balances. This study focuses on the hydrogeochemical processes and mechanisms that control the chemical composition and variability of Azigza Lake, a typical tectono-karstic lake system of the region. Water monitoring was implemented from July 2013 to October 2014 with a monthly water sampling for physicochemical measurements and major ion concentration analyses of lake water and the surrounding groundwater. Both waters show a relatively low salinity due to the fresh input from the Lower Jurassic karst formation. Lake waters are slightly alkaline and of the calcium-magnesium-bicarbonate type. The geochemistry of the lake waters is mainly controlled by carbonate weathering through water-rock interaction and, to a lesser extent, by cation exchange and precipitation of carbonate minerals. The hydrochemistry of the lake showed clear responses to seasonal changes in precipitation and evaporation, with higher conductivity during the wet period. During the beginning of the wet season, groundwater evolution could be explained by a simple first flush stormwater. The rapid response of lake water to subsurface and underground waters confirms the dominance of an underground conduct flow regime. These changes and behaviors highlight the sensitivity of Azigza system to regional hydrological and climatic changes.					; Adallal, Rachid/AAP-4577-2021	Rhoujjati, Ali/0000-0002-8176-7451; 													1380-6165	1573-1421				MAR	2023	29	1					25	47		10.1007/s10498-022-09409-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10498-022-09409-6		DEC 2022											WOS:000898661300001

On the 6 major rivers entering the lake continuous flow metering was available, but chemical concentrations were only available every 8 or 15 days. To associate river chemical concentrations and loadings with flows for these observed dates and hence predict from their relation the loads at the unobserved dates, a computer program using 8 possible statistical relations was used. Those methods examined included various regressions with adjustments, higher order (polynomial) fits, logarithmic and other transforms, and different rising and falling flow relations. Results produced by the various methods with discussion of their relative merits are presented. Reasons are given for the final selection of a simple log load on log flow relation for rivers derived from terrestrial catchments.																			0043-1354	1879-2448					1977	11	8					631	636		10.1016/0043-1354(77)90098-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(77)90098-7													WOS:A1977DU34900006

A native of the Ponto-Caspian region, C. pengoi is currently expanding its range in North America. Analysis of mitochondrial gene ND5 sequences confirmed that the Lake Erie haplotype is identical to that reported previously from Lakes Ontario and Michigan and the Finger Lakes, New York. These findings support the hypothesis that C. pengoi's range expansion in the Great Lakes likely resulted from inter-lake transfer of ballast water, rather than from additional introductions from European locations. Pleasure-craft traffic operating between Lake Michigan and Muskegon Lake is likely responsible for this inland transfer of Cercopagis, a trend that likely will increase due to human activities.					macisaac, hugh/AAE-3742-2020; Therriault, Thomas/AAS-5883-2020; Kane, Douglas/H-4345-2019														0380-1330						2002	28	4					698	701		10.1016/S0380-1330(02)70615-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(02)70615-1													WOS:000180411100016

The covariation with C, N and P sedimentation also was studied. The results showed a strong temporal variation in the occurrence of different Fe species. During high discharge, such as in spring, Fe mostly occurred as crystalline Fe-silicate species, while the amorphous form dominated at other times of the year. Al generally sedimented as crystalline Al-silicate species (95%). Amorphous Fe species showed a strong relation with organic C and N, suggesting an association between organic material and amorphous Fe oxides. P was not as strongly related to amorphous Fe, probably as a result of apatite or clay bound-P species sedimentation.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				OCT	1997	99	1-4					283	295		10.1023/A:1018342029221	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1018342029221													WOS:A1997XW68200031

Ovarian histology (mainly based on the occurrence of postovulatory follicles) indicated that female ayu can be divided into four groups, which are considered to correspond with unspawned, once spawned, twice spawned, and three (or more) times spawned individuals. Comprehensive analysis of the ovarian state with field surveys revealed that most of the female ayu achieve second spawning and that third spawning is very common in this river. Mean relative batch fecundity (RBF) for the second, third, and fourth spawning indicated 69, 42, and 22%, respectively, of the value for the first spawning, showing a decline with the number of spawning batches. Mean gonadosomatic index (GSI) values of non-ovulating fish showed a similar decline during the main spawning period (October). Condition factor (without gonads) during autumn also decreased with the number of batches spawned, suggesting that multiple spawning is achieved partly by transfer of body mass nutrients to the ovary. Size dependency in reproductive parameters such as occurrence of the multiple spawning, RBF values, and GSI values of the unspawned fish, was not evident except for GSI values in early September (generally during the early phases of ovarian development), when larger fish had larger GSI.																			0919-9268	1444-2906				FEB	2007	73	1					9	18		10.1111/j.1444-2906.2007.01296.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1444-2906.2007.01296.x													WOS:000243868200002

This is important not only from the point of view of lake management but also for providing clean drinking water for human populations. In the present work, we provide quantitative information on the seasonal variations of zooplankton and selected physico-chemical variables from Valle de Bravo, a large man-made reservoir in the State of Mexico. Based on the nutrient data, this reservoir can be regarded as mesotrophic. However, we found a high density of phytoplankton. Among Cyanophyceae, Anabaena, Microcystis, Nostoc and Oscillatoria were encountered, particularly during the warmer months. Microcystis blooms were observed from June to September. Diatoms dominated the phytoplankton during the remaining months of the year. Among zooplankton, Rotifera comprised the highest number of species. The most common species occurring throughout the year were Keratella chochlearis, Polyarthra vulgaris, Trichocerca capucina, Trichocerca similis, Asplanchna priodonta and Synchaeta pectinata. The highest abundance of K. cochlearis was observed in May at site 5 (340 ind l(-1)). P. vulgaris occurred in high numbers throughout the year. Both Trichocerca capucina and T. similis were encountered in low numbers (mean annual average: 10 ind l(-1)). Among the crustacean zooplankton, Bosmina longirostris occurred in higher numbers (up to 105 ind l(-1)) regardless of the time of the year. Copepods were predominantly from the genera Mesocyclops and Megacylops; calanoids were rare. Naupliar stages were dominant during winter months (up to 670 ind l(-1)). These results have been discussed from the point of view of Microcystis control in water bodies.

A total of 443 stomachs was examined and the frequency of occurrence, volume and weight of prey items calculated. In the Ahuriri Arm of Lake Benmore the principal food (54% by weight) was zooplankton (Boeckella dilatata) whereas in the Haldon Arm of Lake Benmore it was larval and juvenile common bullies (Gobiomorphus cotidianus) (73% by volume). In Lake Waitaki in winter, salmon had eaten insects (43% by volume) with smaller amounts of snails (Potamopyrgus antipodarum, 23%) and bullies (24%). In Lake Ohau adult insects may be an important food. There were also variations in diet with season and fish size. The stomachs of 147 brown trout (Salmon Trutta) and 181 rainbow trout (S. gairdneri) caught in the same gill nets were also examined. In contrast to sockeye salmon stomachs they contained negligible amounts of zooplankton (< 1% by weight) and large amounts of aquatic insects (50-58% by weight in the Ahuriri Arm of Lake Benmore). Comparisons with juvenile sockeye salmon and kokanee in North American lakes are made. The impact of introductions of sockeye salmon into other New Zealand lakes is discussed.																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1986	20	4					537	549		10.1080/00288330.1986.9516174	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1986.9516174													WOS:A1986H418400002

Fish community and food web responses to a whole-lake removal of coarse woody habitat	FISHERIES												As lakeshores are developed, property owners often thin the riparian forest and remove older logs or fallen limbs from the adjacent littoral zone. This practice alters fish habitat and produces unknown ecosystem changes. To assess potential effects on fish communities and food web interactions, we removed more than 75% of the coarse woody habitat (CWH) from the treatment basin of Little Rock Lake, Wisconsin, while leaving the reference basin unaltered. Prior to CWH removal, the food webs in both basins were similar and dominated by aquatic prey. After CWH removal, largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) in the treatment basin consumed less fish, ate more terrestrial prey, and grew more slowly relative to the population in the reference basin. Yellow perch (Perca flavescens) in the treatment basin declined to extremely low densities as a consequence of predation and little or no recruitment. In contrast, perch in the reference basin were replenished by several successful cohorts produced in consecutive years. Maintenance of CWH appears to be crucial for sustaining desirable fishes and fisheries in lakes. Changes in CWH produce complex, long-lasting effects at the ecosystem scale.

J	Roberts, D; McMinn, A; Cremer, H; Gore, DB; Melles, M				Roberts, D; McMinn, A; Cremer, H; Gore, DB; Melles, M			The Holocene evolution and palaeosalinity history of Beall Lake, Windmill Islands (East Antarctica) using an expanded diatom-based weighted averaging model	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												A mid-Holocene climate optimum is inferred from a palaeosalinity reconstruction of a closed saline lake (Beall Lake) from the Windmill Islands, East Antarctica using an expanded diatom salinity weighted averaging (WA) regression and calibration model. The addition of 14 lakes and ponds from the Windmill Islands, East Antarctica, to an existing weighted averaging regression and calibration palaeosalinity model of 33 lakes from the Vestfold Hills, East Antarctica expands the number of taxa and lakes and the range of salinity in the existing model and improves the model's predictive ability. This improved model was used to infer Holocene changes in lake water salinity in Beall Lake, Windmill Islands. Six changes in diatom-inferred salinity in Beall Lake are put into broad chronological context based on three radiocarbon dates: as the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) retreated from the Windmill Islands during the early Holocene (similar to 9000-8130 corr. yr BP), Beall Lake formed as a melt water-fed freshwater lake, which gradually became more saline as marine influence increased from similar to 8000 coff. yr BP. Between similar to 8000 and 4800 corr. yr BP, the diatom assemblage included planktonic marine taxa such as Chaetoceros spp. and cryophilic taxa such as Fragilariopsis cylindrus, which indicate favourable summer growth conditions. A mid-Holocene warm period produced a climate that was warmer and more humid with increased precipitation and snow accumulation. This is reflected in the Beall Lake core as a reduction in the salinity of the lake diatom assemblage from similar to 4800-4600 corr. yr BP. Holocene isostatic uplift rates in the Windmill Islands vary from 5-6 m/1000 yr. By applying this uplift rate, it is calculated that the bedrock would have risen above sea level by similar to 4000 yr BP. The Beall Lake core diatom assemblage from similar to 4600-2900 corr. yr BP includes both marine cryophilic and planktonic taxa together with freshwater benthic and planktonic lacustrine taxa. This mix of species indicates the emergence of the lake from the sea around similar to 4600 corr. yr BP. From similar to 2800 corr. yr BP, retreat of the ice margin led to increasing melt water inputs and associated freshening of the lake basin until similar to 1900 corr. yr BP. The lake basin had no oceanic influence by this time, allowing a terrestrial freshwater flora to establish and thrive for the next similar to 1000 yr. At similar to 1850 corr. yr BP, a sudden and rapid salinity change is evident in Beall Lake. A late Holocene warm period between 2000 and 1000 yr BP has been observed in ice core records from Law Dome (an ice cap abutting the Windmill Islands to the east and north). It is therefore inferred that, at similar to 1850 corr. yr BP, summer temperatures within the Beall Lake catchment area were much higher than present summer temperatures. The climate optimum identified in the Beall Lake core similar to 4800 yr BP confirms mid-Holocene warming of the Windmill Islands and suggests a synchronous mid-Holocene climate optimum occurred across coastal East Antarctica. In addition, the abrupt climate change inferred at similar to 1850 yr BP suggests that higher resolution sampling of sediment cores from coastal East Antarctic limnological oases will provide more evidence of rapid climate change events over coastal East Antarctica in future.

J	Saxena, A; Sen Singh, D				Saxena, Anju; Sen Singh, Dhruv			Multiproxy records of vegetation and monsoon variability from the lacustrine sediments of eastern Ganga Plain since 1350 AD	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The lacustrine sediments of 90 cm thick profile of Nikahari Tal (lake), Deoria district in the Ganga Plain were analyzed for multiproxy study using pollen analysis, sedimentology and AMS radiocarbon date to deduce short term climate and vegetational changes since about 1350 A. D. (600 BP). The presence of arboreal and dominance of herbaceous vegetation along with aquatic elements and fresh water alga Botryococcus from the basal part suggests the prior existence of lake and open grass land vegetation in the region. However, the scantiness of tree and shrubby taxa along with higher percentage of clay in the beginning indicates relatively warm and less humid climate than today. The presence of Cerealia with other culture pollen taxa indicates prevalence of agrarian practice in the region. Substantial increase in the tree taxa of Holoptelea integrifolia, Madhuca indica, Acacia, Emblica officinalis, Syzygium cumini and Myrtaceae along with the increase in shrubs, marshy and aquatic elements suggest the expansion of forest grove within the grassland as a consequence of enhanced precipitation during similar to 1420-1620 A. D. Similar trends are observed by higher percentage of silt content owing to increased surface runoff in response to enhanced precipitation and high water budget under strong Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) during above period. A highly variable vegetation scenario existed during 1620-1900 A. D. as a consequence of fluctuating climatic conditions. The variable percentages of silt and clay indicate the increase and decrease in the surface runoff so as the water column and energy in the lake, in direct response to enhanced and weak ISM respectively. During 1620-1700 A. D., the arboreals became less diversified and a decline in the diversity of terrestrial herbs is also witnessed, which is also corroborated by exceptionally high percentages of clay elucidating stagnant low-energy ponding condition under weak ISM during the Little Ice Age (LIA). During the time interval of 1700-1800 A. D., considerable improvement in the floristics has been noticed due to climate amelioration. From 1800 A. D. onwards, the increasing frequency trends of arboreal and aquatic taxa along with relatively increased silt content suggests moderately warm and humid climate. The well-sorted sediment explains the consistency in the water level and energy of the lake. Pollen analysis coupled with sediment grain parameters indicate intense ISM from 1400 to 1600 A. D. and 1850 A. D. onwards and weak monsoon around 1600-1750 A. D. The signals of weak monsoon around 1650, 1770 and 1850 A. D. are synchronous with the Little Ice Age.

J	Robertson, EL; Liber, K				Robertson, Erin L.; Liber, Karsten			Effect of sampling method on contaminant measurement in pore-water and surface water at two uranium operations: can method affect conclusions?	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												This paper describes a comparison of two methods of sediment pore-water sampling and two methods of surface water sampling that were used in a broader investigation of cause(s) of adverse effects on benthic invertebrate communities at two Saskatchewan uranium operations (Key Lake and Rabbit Lake). Variables measured and compared included pH, ammonia, DOC, and trace metals. The two types of sediment pore-water samples that were compared are centrifuged and 0.45-mu m filtered sediment core samples vs. 0.2-mu m dialysis (peeper) samples. The two types of surface water samples that were compared are 53-mu m filtered Van Dorn horizontal beta samples vs. 0.2-mu m dialysis (peeper) samples. Results showed that 62% of the sediment core pore water values were higher than the corresponding peeper pore-water measurements, and that 63% of the Van Dorn surface water measurements were lower than corresponding peeper surface water measurements. Furthermore, only 24% and 14% of surface water and pore-water measurements, respectively, fell within +/- 10% range of one another; 73% and 50%, respectively, fell within +/- 50%. Although somewhat confounded by differences in filtering method, the observed differences are believed to primarily be related to small, vertical differences in the environment sampled. Despite observed differences in concentrations of toxicologically relevant variables generated by the different sampling methods, the weight of evidence (WOE) conclusions drawn from each set of exposure data on the possible cause(s) of in situ toxicity to Hyalella azteca from a related study were the same at each uranium operation. However, this concurrence was largely due to other dominant lines of evidence. The WOE conclusions at Key Lake were dominated by the toxicity response of H. azteca in relation to exposure chemistry, where as the WOE conclusions at Rabbit Lake were informed by exposure chemistry, the toxicological response of H. azteca, and whole-body contaminant concentrations in the test organisms. Had these multiple lines of evidence not been available, differences in exposure chemistry generated by the different sampling methods could have substantially influenced the identification of potential causes of in situ toxicity.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				AUG	2009	155	1-4					539	553		10.1007/s10661-008-0454-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-008-0454-8								18726245					WOS:000267887000041

In: Ecology and Evolution of Communities (eds Cody, M.L. & Diamond, J.M.). Harvard University Press, Cambridge, pp. 342-444] proposed that resource competition leads to checkerboard-like distributions of competing species. This proposal prompted research that revealed checkerboard patterns within a wide range of communities, but the mechanisms that generate such patterns are still poorly understood. Here we present whole-lake natural experiments and analyses of species-environment relationships in small coastal lake fish communities that were fragmented when land uplift isolated these lakes from the Baltic Sea, showing that a combination of predation and habitat suitability generated checkerboard distributions. Checkerboard patterns developed because two piscivores, northern pike and Eurasian perch, caused the extinction of several prey species in deep lakes. Conversely, low oxygen levels in shallow lakes caused extinction of the piscivores, and these areas served as a refuge for tolerant prey species. Based on these findings, we suggest that habitat suitability and biotic interactions should be viewed simultaneously in null models of assembly rules.

J	Watts, CJ				Watts, CJ			Seasonal phosphorus release from exposed, re-inundated littoral sediments of two Australian reservoirs	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Water levels in many reservoirs typically fluctuate seasonally, but the effects of re-inundation of exposed sediments on nutrient dynamics in the water column are poorly known. This study concerns the seasonal differences in the potential of sediments from two Australian reservoirs, after having undergone different degrees of in situ desiccation, to release P under aerobic conditions. Differences were determined between biotic and abiotic P release, and results were also examined in relation to sediment chemistry. The two reservoirs, Carcoar Dam and Lake Rowlands, demonstrated different patterns of P release involving an interactive complex of P release mechanisms. Sediment chemistry at the reservoir margins was important because of the higher concentrations of N, P, Fe and Mn in Lake Rowlands. Physical and chemical processes influenced P uptake and release due to desiccation and oxidation of sediments and were of greater importance in Carcoar Dam. Abiotic P release from sterilised sediments was greater than from unsterilised sediments where both biotic and abiotic processes were apparent. Biotic P uptake and release were especially marked in Lake Rowlands where large macrophyte beds provided a rich source of organic matter. Little seasonal difference in P release was detected. The increased P release from dried sediments has ramifications for internal P loading into reservoirs and for the calculation of P budgets. For managers of reservoirs where large expanses of sediment are exposed during drying, it may be better to maintain high water levels, where possible, during the summer by modifying drawdown practices.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL	2000	431	1					27	39		10.1023/A:1004098120517	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1004098120517													WOS:000089347800004

The aim of our study was to monitor long-term trends in the haemoparasite communities of spiny mice (Acomys dimidiatus) and to identify the principal factors responsible for changes over a 12 year period. Methods: To this end we sampled four semi-isolated populations of mice (n = 835) in 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2012 in four dry montane valleys (wadis) located in the Sinai Massif, Egypt. Results: Overall 76.2 % of spiny mice carried at least one of the five haemoparasite genera (Babesia, Bartonella, Haemobartonella, Hepatozoon, Trypanosoma) recorded in the study. Prevalence of haemoparasites varied significantly between the sites with the highest overall prevalence in Wadi Tlah and the lowest in W. El Arbaein, and this changed significantly with time. In the first two surveys there was little change in prevalence, but by 2008, when the first signs of a deepening drought in the region had become apparent, prevalence began to drift downwards, and by 2012 prevalence had fallen to the lowest values recorded from all four sites over the entire 12-year period. The overall mean species richness was 1.2 +/- 0.03, which peaked in 2004 and then dropped by more than 50 % by 2012. Species richness was highest among mice from Wadi Tlah and peaked in age class 2 mice (young adults). Site was the most significant factor affecting the prevalence of individual parasite species, with Trypanosoma acomys and Hepatozoon sp. occurring mainly in two wadis (W. Tlah & W. Gharaba). In four of the five genera recorded in the study we observed a significant drop in prevalence or/and abundance since 2004, the exception being Hepatozoon sp. Conclusions: During the 12-year-long period of study in the Sinai, we observed dynamic changes and possibly even cycles of prevalence and abundance of infections which differed depending on parasite species. Although the exact reasons cannot be identified at this time, we hypothesize that the effects of a 15-year-long scarcity of rainfall in the local environment and a fall in host densities over the period of study may have been responsible for a drop in transmission rates, possibly by a negative impact on vector survival.					; Behnke, Jerzy/L-6176-2015; Behnke-Borowczyk, Jolanta/ABI-7276-2020; Welc-Faleciak, Renata/JGE-3494-2023; Gilbert, Francis/K-3817-2013; Bednarska, Małgorzata/ABF-9465-2020; Mohallal, Eman/GLR-6291-2022; Kloch, Agnieszka/AAK-3244-2020	Alsarraf, Mohammed/0000-0002-6330-0719; Gilbert, Francis/0000-0002-2727-4103; Zalat, Samy/0000-0002-7929-4923; Mohallal, Eman/0000-0002-0532-224X; Bajer, Anna/0000-0001-6199-8458; Behnke-Borowczyk, Jolanta/0000-0003-2085-038X; Kloch, Agnieszka/0000-0002-0086-1578; Welc-Faleciak, Renata/0000-0003-2266-1435; 													1756-3305					APR 8	2016	9								195	10.1186/s13071-016-1471-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-016-1471-z								27059180					WOS:000374138000001

Archaeobotany, charcoal analysis, and geochemistry were applied to the samples gathered at the site. The results suggest habitation, storage, agriculture, fire-keeping, and plant gathering at the site during the Pre-Roman Iron Age. By that time, the Lepinjarvi basin was surrounded by rich local flora and served as an excellent node of communication with both overseas regions and the interior of Finland. Eight new sites were discovered around the lake, thus disproving the previously suggested hiatus of habitation around the lake. The light soils were suitable for early cultivation methods. The results point towards cultivation of ard-ploughed, fire-managed, and manured fields, where summer-annual barley, speltoid wheats, and possibly oat were grown. Other contemporary sites in Finland reveal that barley was the most important cereal during the first millennium BC. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Factors Influencing Habitat Shifts of Age-0 Yellow Perch in Southwestern Lake Michigan	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Yellow perch Perca flavescens exhibit a consistent early life history across most lakes, with hatching in spring followed by a brief pelagic phase that ends with an ontogenetic shift to benthic habitat. This shift occurs with consistent timing and at consistent sizes in most freshwater systems. In Lake Michigan, however, the pelagic phase is prolonged and age-0 yellow perch undergo the transition to benthic habitat at variable sizes, the reasons for which are unknown. We investigated whether prey resources, diet preferences, and physical environment affected the habitat shift of pelagic, age-0 yellow perch. The shift to nearshore benthic habitat between 1998 and 2005 was strongly correlated with the occurrence of onshore wind events, a surrogate for transport by onshore currents. The timing of this habitat shift was not strongly related to prey resources. Abiotic factors structured the habitat shifts of age-0 yellow perch in Lake Michigan, a pattern atypical of freshwater systems but consistent with the patterns seen in marine systems.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				SEP	2011	140	5					1317	1329		10.1080/00028487.2011.620484	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2011.620484													WOS:000296143900016
J	Murray, CD; Buttle, JM				Murray, CD; Buttle, JM			Infiltration and soil water mixing on forested and harvested slopes during spring snowmelt, Turkey Lakes Watershed, central Ontario	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Forest harvesting increases snow accumulation and water delivery to the soil surface relative to undisturbed forest; however, implications of these changes for water infiltration and storage in the soil profile are not well known. These processes were studied using a combined hydrometric and isotopic tracer approach in a harvested area and adjacent hardwood forest stand on a slope at the Turkey Lakes Watershed (TLW) in central Ontario. The slope had a mean gradient of 0.29 and a 0.5-1 m thick ablation till layer overlying compacted basal till. Pre-melt snow accumulation and daily water inputs in the harvested area and forest were measured during the 2000 and 2001 snowmelts. Soil water content in the ablation till was monitored at harvested and forest soil pits using time domain reflectometry. Isotopic signatures of input and soil water at the pits were sampled throughout melt. Total water inputs to the harvested soil surface exceeded that in the forest: 280 turn in the harvested area vs. 212 mm in the forest in 2000 and 526 mm in the harvested area vs. 409 min in the forest in 2001. Near-surface soil water content, relative saturation of the ablation till and duration of soil saturation at 0.2 m depth were also greater in the harvested area compared to the forest for both years. Despite the absence of between-pit differences in soil properties influencing infiltration into the profile, a thinner ablation till layer at the harvested area pits would have contributed to greater soil saturation at 0.2 m depth in the harvested area. Greater soil wetness in the harvested area appeared to restrict mixing between inputs and pre-melt soil water relative to conditions in the forest during the 2000 melt, leading to longer water residence times at depth in the ablation till. This was partly supported by results from the 2001 melt. We suggest that harvesting of hardwoods on slopes in TLW may promote increased subsurface flow above the basal till contact and saturation overland flow during spring snowmelt, with implications for point-scale soil water chemistry as well as the quantity and quality of slope runoff to receiving streams.

It overlies sediments C-14 dated at >39,970 BP (Beta 46 412). Based on its stratigraphic setting and palaeoecological record the unit represents a series of colluvial concave beds, at the foot of a slope, which were deposited on the margin of a river with a moderate erosional capacity, within an area dominated by conifers and in a boreal climate at the beginning of the last regional glacial cycle. The slope sequence includes 1) mud sheets derived from the colluvial cover of the slope which has been repeatedly destabilized by stream undercutting, 2) fluvial sand beds, 3) isolated seasonal-ice rafted cobbles and 4) organic beds consisting of diverse plant debris brought by floods. These deposits have no climatic significance. They were deposited over a short period of time, during re-equilibration phases of the slope, probably at the end of the Saint-Pierre Sediments episode or at the beginning of the submergence of the St. Lawrence Valley by Lake La Verendrye. The colluvial deposition continued during the lacustrine episode. The slope deposits are interstratified in the Saint-Maurice Rhythmites and indicate the minimal limit of the lake, close to the elevation of the Glens Falls ground-sill in New York State.																			0705-7199						1995	49	2					275	289		10.7202/033042ar	http://dx.doi.org/10.7202/033042ar													WOS:A1995RZ72200007

Navicula veneta, N. halophila, Nitzschia fonticola and Aulacoseira distans were particularly important on turf community. During the October month several Navicula species become progressively more important. Gomphonema lateripunctatum was particularly notable. Other diatoms were occasionally abundant, including Cymbella affinis, C. silesiaca, Navicula cryptocephala, Gomphonema olivaceum and Cyclotella ocellata. Also Navicula lanceolata and Anomoeoneis brachysira were conspicuous, owing to their large size, but were never numerically abundant. Fragilaria ulna and Nitzschia palea were found in low numbers in study area and this pointed out there has not been a remarkable abundance of algal pollution in Lake Ladik. The associations between July and August with bonds to June, January and February with bonds to April were most significant in the study period obtained by cluster analysis. Shannon diversity and evenness presented small variations during the study period. Lake Ladik presented low values of species richness particularly during summer period and highest values were recorded in April. According to canonical correspondence analysis, there was association between some Navicula and Nitzschia species with PO4-, NH3-N. Also the multivariate analysis showed, temperature as the most important factor in the distribution and abundance of diatoms on turf biomass.

Distribution patterns of the early invasion of zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas, 1771), in the south basin of Lake Winnipeg	BIOINVASIONS RECORDS												Aquatic invasive species (AIS) pose significant threats to the biodiversity of freshwater ecosystems worldwide. Consequently, it is crucial to understand the distribution and growth rates of AIS to protect susceptible lakes and rivers from potential invasions. Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) originated from the Ponto-Caspian region and were first recorded in the mid-1980s in the North American Laurentian Great Lakes. In 2013. zebra mussels were first observed in four harbours on Lake Winnipeg, Manitoba. Canada. Since then, the species appears to be spreading rapidly throughout Lake Winnipeg. Here, we present the results of the distribution of zebra mussels in the south basin of Lake Winnipeg along a 7 x 7 km grid. In fall of 2016, zebra mussels were widely distributed in the south basin of Lake Winnipeg. The highest observed density of zebra mussels on artificial substrate was 16.5 individuals per cm(2). Mean length of zebra mussels decreased with depth and latitude. This work provides valuable information for the management of MS prevention and monitoring programs for waterbodies with similar conditions in Central and Western Canada and the United States.

Mean annual water temperature increased by 2.1 degrees C, flow maxima shifted by similar to 13 days from the early April to mid-March, and the onset of thermal stratification of water column and spring algal peaks advanced by 19 and 21 days, respectively, due to climate warming. Concentrations of major ions, phosphorus (P), and chlorophyll increased from the 1960s to the 1990-2000s, then decreased due to changing agricultural practices and legislation, intensified wastewater treatment, and decreasing atmospheric pollution. Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) decreased from 1960 to the 1990s due to improved wastewater treatment, then began to increase in response to climate change and reduced acidic deposition. Concentrations of water constituents exhibited varying individual long-term and seasonal patterns due to the differing effects of following major processes on their production/removal in the catchment-river system: (1) applications of synthetic fertilizers, liming and farmland draining (NO3-, SO42-, Cl-, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, and HCO3-), (2) wastewater production and treatment (DOC, P, N forms), (3) road de-icing (Cl- and Na+), (4) atmospheric pollution (SO42-), (5) climate change (DOC), and (6) the aging of reservoirs (NH4+). The water pH increased until the early 1990s, then decreased and exhibited pronounced seasonal variations, integrating the effects of changing external acidity sources and in-lake H+ sources and sinks (i.e., microbial CO2 production/consumption and availability and transformations of inorganic N), and changes in water buffering capacity. Anthropogenic and climatic effects, reservoir aging, and changes in water eutrophication thus may significantly affect water pH also in circum-neutral systems.

Spatiotemporal Patterns and Ecophysiology of Toxigenic Microcystis Blooms in Lake Taihu, China: Implications for Water Quality Management	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Whole lake monitoring of hypertrophic Lake Taihu, China, was conducted during the summers of 2009-2010, with the intent of identifying environmental factors influencing Microcystis bloom formation and promoting the growth of toxigenic strains (mcyE possessing). Low N:P ratios (replete N & P) appeared to select for toxigenic populations of Microcystis spp., whereas nontoxic Microcystis spp. strains were dominant in more nutrient limited regions of the lake. Chlorophyll a (Adj. R-2 = 0.83, p < 0.0001) was equally predicative of microcystin variance across the lake as fluorescence based realtime quantitative PCR (qPCR) measurements of microcystin synthetase E (mcyE) gene equivalents (Adj. R-2 = 0.85, p < 0.0001). Interestingly, chlorophyll a was identified as a more robust and useful metric for predicting microcystin concentrations than qPCR measurements enumerating the total Microcystis population based on c-phycocyanin (alpha subunit; cpcA) gene equivalents (Adj. R-2 = 0.61, p < 0.0001). Overall, the lakewide composition of Microcystis spp. was highly variable over time and space, and on average the population consisted of 36 +/- 12% potentially toxic cells. On the basis of this study's findings, a framework for the design and implementation of a water safety plan for Taihu water quality managers and public health officials is proposed.

It focuses on an article from 1944, Le leggi razziali e la questione ebraica , and on a series of poems that reveal the close relationship that Bassani established between art, morality, and politics. The analysis specifically considers two texts that Eugenio Montale considered among the best European poems of the Resistance: Non piangere compagno , dedicated to a young man who fell during the Neapolitan days of September 1943, and Retrovia , portraying an unknown German soldier buried near Lake Albano. Both poems show the attitude of pietas with which Bassani approaches even the death of his enemies. A French source, Apollinaire's Calligrammes , is used for the interpretation of Retrovia.																			0039-2618					JAN-APR	2024	39	1																						WOS:001230918400015

The content of phenols in composites (thymol-23.0 and carvacrol-19.1 wt%) was determined using both C,H,N and thermal analysis (TGA); interactions of the phenols with the zeolite lattice studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) showed that the zeolite lattice was preserved in the composites. The composites exhibited antibacterial activity toward Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli DSM 498 and Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 in different water media (phosphate buffer solution, spring water and lake water). After 1 h carvacrol-containing clinoptilolite showed better antibacterial activity than composite with thymol. Both composites expressed bactericidal effect after 24 h of contact.

Quaternary climates have been relatively well studied in north-east North America and the adjacent Atlantic Ocean over the last decades, and new research methods have been developed to improve reconstructions. We present newly inferred reconstructions of sea surface temperature for the north-western Atlantic region, together with a compilation of published temperature records. The database thus comprises a total of 86 records from both marine and terrestrial sites, including lakes, peatlands, ice and tree rings, each covering at least part of the Holocene. For each record, we present details on seasons covered, chronologies and information on radiocarbon dates and analytical time steps. The 86 records contain a total of 154 reconstructions of temperature and temperature-related variables. Main proxies include pollen and dinocysts, while summer was the season for which the highest number of reconstructions were available. Many records covered most of the Holocene, but many dinocyst records did not extend to the surface, due to sediment mixing, and dendroclimate records were limited to the last millennium.

The MCs produced by cyanobacteria in a freshwater reservoir were discharged frequently into the adjacent Isahaya Bay, remained in the surface sediments, and then accumulated in various macrobenthic animals on the seafloor. The MCs were transported further outside of Isahaya Bay (Ariake Bay), and the median values of the MC contents in the sediments were in the same levels in both bays, while their temporal variations were also similar during the study period. Therefore, the fluctuations of the MC contents in the surface sediments were physically controlled by the timing of the discharge from the reservoir. The MC contents in polychaetes and oysters collected in Isahaya Bay increased markedly during winter. The median values of the carbon-based MC contents in the sediments, primary consumers, and secondary consumers in the bay were 87, 160, and 250 ngMC gC(-1), respectively. These results demonstrated bio-accumulation at lower trophic levels in benthic marine ecosystems. An understanding of the processes occurring between sediments and macrobenthic animals is important for clarifying MC dynamics in ecosystems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The mean individual carbon content in the population varied between 0.15-0.66 .mu.g C ind.-1 (n = 21) for A. priodonta and 1.0-1.6 .mu.g C ind.-1 (n = 3) for A. herricki. The carbon content and the size of A. priodonta varied considerably between the populations of both different lakes and dates. The carbon level of both Asplanchna species (sample mean 0.2-1% of wet weight) was considerably lower than is generally found for rotifers. Much of the variation of carbon level could be explained by an inverse relationship with wet weight. The high variation in the carbon content of individuals suggests that Asplanchna populations may adapt their mean body size to fit prevailing environmental conditions.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY 9	1988	162	1					79	87		10.1007/BF00014335	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00014335													WOS:A1988N181900006

However, quantifying the relative importance of these crucial environmental factors and mechanisms in reservoir regions characterized by various depths remain comparatively uninvestigated. Tianbao Reservoir is a typical monomictic warm and drinking water source reservoir in Southwest China. This study supplemented field observations with a three-dimensional numerical simulation model to quantitatively analyze mixing and turnover events. Air temperature and wind were two important meteorological factors resulting in hydrodynamics during stratification and mixing processes. Air temperature led to variations in stratification strength and wind-induced fluctuations of thermocline depth. A 10% rise in air temperature increased stratification strength by 18%, and a 3 m/s rise in wind speed induced the deepening of the thermocline by 2.09 m. Two hydrodynamics involved penetrative convection caused by temperature plummets and wind-induced mixing during winter turnover events were identified. Penetrative convection was the main driving force, and wind shear mixed the upper 21% of the mixed layer, which was contributed by convection. Response of water temperature to air temperature in shallow regions was faster (58 d), and the mixing depth caused by the wind was smaller than that in deep regions. Research on physical processes during stratification and mixing processes can provide support for further study on water quality deterioration distributions.

J	Fan, XF; Xing, P				Fan, Xianfang; Xing, Peng			The Vertical Distribution of Sediment Archaeal Community in the (Black Bloom) Disturbing Zhushan Bay of Lake Taihu	ARCHAEA-AN INTERNATIONAL MICROBIOLOGICAL JOURNAL												Using the Illumina sequencing technology, we investigated the vertical distribution of archaeal community in the sediment of Zhushan Bay of Lake Taihu, where the black bloom frequently occurred in summer. Overall, the Miscellaneous Crenarchaeotal Group (MCG), Deep Sea Hydrothermal Vent Group 6 (DHVEG-6), and Methanobacterium dominated the archaeal community. However, we observed significant difference in composition of archaeal community among different depths of the sediment. DHVEG-6 dominated in the surface layer (0-3 cm) sediment. Methanobacterium was the dominating archaeal taxa in the L2 (3-6 cm) and L3 (6-10) sediment. MCG was most abundant in the L4 (10-15 cm) and L5 (15-20 cm) sediment. Besides, DHVEG-6 was significantly affected by the concentration of total phosphorus (TP). And loss on ignition (LOI) was an important environmental factor for Methanobacterium. As the typical archaeal taxa in the surface layer sediment, DHVEG-6 and Methanobacterium might be more adapted to abundant substrate supply from cyanobacterial blooms and take active part in the biomass transformation. We propose that DHVEG-6 and Methanobacterium could be the key archaeal taxa correlated with the "black bloom" formation in Zhushan Bay.					xing, peng/HDM-6843-2022	Xing, Peng/0000-0002-4917-5181													1472-3646	1472-3654					2016	2016								8232135	10.1155/2016/8232135	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/8232135								26884723					WOS:000369335500001

In this study, based on a multitude of proxies, such as magnetic susceptibility, geochemical elements and their ratios, and grain size spanning MIS 7 of Xiashu Loess, the paleoclimatic changes that are synchronous with the five episodes during MIS 7 are reconstructed in the Chaohu Lake Basin, East China. It is proposed that the paleoclimate change in the Chaohu Lake Basin during MIS 7, on orbital time scale, might be controlled by low-latitude insolation; on millennium scales, might be directly driven by the global ice volume variations.

However, many important plankton members do not leave any microscopic features in sedimentary records. Here we used ancient DNA preserved in Qinghai Lake sediments to reconstruct the temporal succession of plankton communities in the past 18,500 years. Our results showed that seven classes and sixteen genera of phytoplankton in the lake underwent major temporal changes, in correlation with known climatic events. Trebouxiophyceae and Eustigmatophyceae were predominant during the cold periods, whereas Chlorophyceae, Phaeophyceae, Xanthophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, and Cyanophyceae were abundant during the warm periods. The inferred changes in temperature, nutrients, precipitation, and salinity, as driven by the Westerlies and summer Monsoon strength, likely contributed to these observed temporal changes. Based on these correlations, we propose the phytoplankton index as a proxy to reconstruct the stadial versus interstadial climate change history in Qinghai Lake. This taxon-specific index is free of terrestrial contamination, sensitive to short-term climatic oscillations, and continuous in recording all climatic events in the lake. The validity of this index and its applicability to other lakes is demonstrated by its good correlations with multiple climate records of Qinghai Lake and another lake on the Tibetan Plateau, Kusai Lake.

A multi-component dynamic model for nutrients in the bottom sediment-water system was incorporated into the model, a one-dimensional water temperature-water quality-ecological model. Good agreement between the model calculations and observed nutrients, chlorophyll-a, and dissolved oxygen concentrations in the water and nutrient concentrations in the bottom sediment was noted. The agreement between the model calculations and the measured nutrient flux from bottom sediment during the summer stagnation period was good. The effectiveness of sediment dredging, artificial circulation, and reduction of external phosphorus loading as eutrophication control programs on chlorophyll-a, PO4-P, and dissolved oxygen concentration in the water was assessed using a calibrated model.					hosomi, masaaki/G-1122-2013														0273-1223						1991	24	6					339	348		10.2166/wst.1991.0174	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.1991.0174													WOS:A1991FQ84300042

Under current climate models can be anticipated increase risk of extreme weather in Central Europe. Series of instrumental meteorological observations in Northwestern Bohemia is not long enough. It was therefore, necessary to use for processing old records of the weather. It was essentially the chronicles, the city archives and records. Northwestern Bohemia had to face very frequent alternation of dry and wet periods, a period of very hot and cold in the last 500 years. Catastrophic floods and droughts in recent years pointed out that the research does not pay to underestimate the extremes. At the local microclimate had a significant effect drying of lakes and drainage work in the 18th and 19th century. For example, Komorany surface of the lake has decreased from 56 km(2) in the beginning of the 17th century to 1.95 km(2) in the mid-19th century. Based on historical documentation was reconstructed variations of wet and dry periods, cold and warm winters, vegetation frosts in the last 500 years. Reconstruction of air temperature during the growing season was made applications palaeoclimatological standard methods. The coldest period was 1659 - 1705, while the warmest from 1946-2009.

With an average content of chlorophyll (Chl a) from 13.1 +/- 1.4 to 52.5 +/- 2.7 g/L in the Ivankovo Reservoir and from 7.6 +/- 1.6 to 27.5 +/- 2.5 g/L in the Uglich Reservoir, an increase in Chl a is observed after the anomalously hot 2010. Interannual changes in Chla in dependence on the water temperature, as well as the Wolf numbers and North Atlantic Oscillation index (NAO) that indirectly affect phytoplankton productivity, are analyzed. Chl a content in the Ivankovo Reservoir, which retains the eutrophic status, does not go beyond the long-term fluctuations, while an increase in the absolute and relative amounts of Chla in the Uglich Reservoir indicate an increased role of blue-green algae and transition of the reservoir to the eutrophic category.

Spatial Variability of Nitrate Concentrations Under Diverse Conditions in Tributaries to a Lake Watershed1	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) concentrations in stream water often respond uniquely to changes in inter-annual conditions (e.g., biological N uptake and precipitation) in individual catchments. In this paper, we assess (1) how the spatial distribution of NO3-N concentrations varies across a dense network of nonnested catchments and (2) how relationships between multiple landscape factors [within whole catchments and hydrologically sensitive areas (HSAs) of the catchments] and stream NO3-N are expressed under a variety of annual conditions. Stream NO3-N data were collected during two synoptic sampling events across > 55 tributaries and two synoptic sampling periods with > 11 tributaries during summer low flow periods. Sample tributaries drain mixed land cover watersheds ranging in size from 0.150 to 312 km(2) and outlet directly to Cayuga Lake, New York. Changes in NO3-N concentration ratios between each sampling event suggest a high degree of spatial heterogeneity in catchment response across the Cayuga Lake Watershed, ranging from 0.230 to 61.4. Variations in NO3-N concentrations within each of the large synoptic sampling events were also high, ranging from 0.040 to 8.7 mg NO3-N/l (March) and 0.090 to 15.5 mg NO3-N/l (October). Although Pearson correlation coefficients suggest that this variability is related to multiple landscape factors during all four sampling events, partial correlations suggest percentage of row crops in the catchments as the only similar factor in March and October and catchment area as the only factor during summer low flows. Further, the strength of the relationships is typically lower in the HSAs of catchment. Advancing current understanding of such variations and relationships to landscape factors across multiple catchments - and under a variety of biogeochemical and hydrological conditions - is important, as (1) nitrate continues to be employed as an indicator of regional aquatic ecosystem health and services and (2) a unified framework approach for understanding individual catchment processes is a rapidly evolving focus for catchment-based science and management.

Objective synoptic-pattern classification showed that boundary days, especially convective boundary days, were more frequent under a mid-troposphere high-pressure ridge or pre-trough pattern. Such patterns featured a warmer near-surface environment, stronger southerly winds, larger convective available potential energy (CAPE), and low-level moisture convergence. Relative to unfavorable patterns, boundaries under favorable patterns showed more apparent arid-area dependence, more dominant orientation along the line of vegetation contrast, more moved northward, formed and matured earlier, and triggered convection more dispersedly. Under each pattern, compared with nonboundary days, boundary days possessed higher near-surface temperatures and stronger ambient flows against the vegetation-contrast-induced circulations near the surface; plus, compared with nonconvective boundary days, convective boundary days possessed stronger updrafts, larger CAPE, and higher moisture and K index.

The deepest levels of the core (spruce pollen zone 13,000-10,200 yr B.P.) resemble modern diatom assemblages from deep oligotrophic lakes of northeastern Minnesota. Diatom assemblages of the pine pollen zone (about 10,200-9500 yr B.P.) have few modern analogs. In the oak zone (9500 yr B.P. to present) after a brief pulse of diatom species indicative of eutrophication, the assemblages are dominated by species characteristic of shallow lakes, suggesting a drop in the lake water level during the prairie period (5500-7500 yr B.P.). Macrofossil data of W.A. Watts and T.C. Winter show that this shift to shallow-water diatoms occurred when aquatic macrophytes appeared at the site in abundance.

Developmental and reproductive costs of osmoregulation to an aquatic insect that is a key food resource to shorebirds at salt lakes threatened by rising salinity and desiccation	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Saline lakes worldwide are undergoing drying, and as lake levels fall and areas contract, salinities increase. There is a critical need for data on salinity impacts to guide conservation for recovery of the aquatic productivity that supports migratory and breeding birds that depend on these habitats. Brine flies are key sources of food to these birds and are adapted for life in saline waters owing to their capacity for osmotic regulation. The sublethal effects on growth, development and reproduction were determined in experiments and field observations with the alkali fly Cirrula hians from alkaline lakes of differing salinity. The cost of osmoregulation to fitness from rising salinity was exhibited in slower growth rates of larvae, smaller size at maturity of pupae, reduced adult emergence success, and lower fecundity. The results identify a salinity management range of 25 to 100 g L-1 that would optimize life history traits and productivity of this insect as a food source for birds.

J	Trommer, G; Poxleitner, M; Stibor, H				Trommer, Gabriele; Poxleitner, Monika; Stibor, Herwig			Responses of lake phytoplankton communities to changing inorganic nitrogen supply forms	AQUATIC SCIENCES												A shift has been predicted in future nitrogen emission scenarios from nitrous oxide to higher proportions of ammonium compounds. To investigate the interaction between increasing nitrogen load and varying nitrate:ammonium ratios (NO3-:NH4+), we performed a mesocosm experiment in an oligotrophic lake in southern Germany. We fertilized mesocosms with both roughly natural and four times the natural nitrogen wet deposition amounts in molar NO3-:NH4+ ratios of 4:1 and 1:4. We observed greater phytoplankton biomass in treatments with a relatively higher ammonium supply, but not in those with nitrate and total nitrogen load. Ammonium significantly increased the total chlorophyll a concentrations, and especially the growth of small nanophytoplankton species. The effects observed indicate that NH4+ was taken up preferentially and that spring phytoplankton in oligotrophic lakes appear to be able to respond to variations in nitrogen forms (available NO3-:NH4+ ratios) by adjusting their community composition. Such communal changes at the base of the food web may affect higher trophic levels. Therefore, the effects of varying available forms of nitrogen should also be considered in primarily phosphorus-limited aquatic systems.																			1015-1621	1420-9055				JAN 17	2020	82	2							22	10.1007/s00027-020-0696-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-020-0696-2													WOS:000520179200001

Several lines of evidence suggest that atmospheric N-2 may be a significant source of nitrogen to the lake. Particulate organic nitrogen (PON) at approximate to 10-15 m depth in July and October had a delta N-15 of 0.5-1.5 parts per thousand. These values closely reflect the N-15 composition of atmospheric N-2, suggesting biological nitrogen fixation. Historical data show a developing late-summer N:P minimum at approximate to 15 m; low abundance of inorganic nitrogen relative to phosphorus favours species able to acquire atmospheric nitrogen. Microscopic examination of October water samples revealed abundant heterocystous cyanobacteria, including Nodularia sp. Potentially nitrogen-fixing Anabaena spp. have been found in Lake Michigan before but, to our knowledge, this is the first report of Nodularia. Finally, we have amplified both cyanobacterial and non-cyanobacterial nifH sequences (encoding the nitrogenase iron protein) from lakewater samples, evidence for the presence of bacteria capable of nitrogen fixation. The surface waters of Lake Michigan are considered to be phosphate limited in the stratified season and, under these conditions, energetically expensive nitrogen fixation is expected to be uncompetitive with assimilation of combined nitrogen. Our results suggest that, from both microbiological and biogeochemical perspectives, this may be an oversimplification.

J	Framenau, VW				Framenau, Volker W.			Knoelle, a new monotypic wolf spider genus from Australia (Araneae: Lycosidae)	ZOOTAXA												A new monotypic wolf spider genus, Knoelle, is described to accommodate the Australian member of the Lycosinae Knoelle clara ( L. Koch, 1877) comb. nov. as type species. Knoelle gen. nov. differs from all other wolf spiders in the peculiar structure of the male pedipalp. The tip of the cymbium carries a unique, large patch of macrosetae and the tegular apophysis has a unique lamellar structure between two hook-shaped processes. The median septum of the female epigyne widens distinctly anteriorly. Knoelle clara comb. nov. is common in the northern parts of Australia ( New South Wales, Northern Territory, Queensland, Western Australia) north of ca. 30 degrees S latitude. The species appears to prefer sandy, open to partly shaded habitats near freshwater, such as creeks, springs and lakes, but can also be found in sand dunes near beaches. Adults show a peak of activity in October ( males) and November ( females) and records of mature spiders are rare between May and August.					; Framenau, Volker/H-5234-2019	Framenau, Volker/0000-0002-7724-3831; 													1175-5326	1175-5334				AUG 7	2006		1281					55	67																WOS:000239666500004
J	Howard, JK; Cuffey, KM				Howard, JK; Cuffey, KM			The functional role of native freshwater mussels in the fluvial benthic environment	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Freshwater mussels are the dominant consumer biomass in many fluvial systems. As filter feeding grazers, mussels can remove large amounts of particulate matter from the water column and transfer these resources to the substrate as biodeposits (agglutinated mussel faeces and pseudofaeces). Mussel biodeposits are a nutrient rich and easily assimilated food source and therefore may have significant relevance to benthic community structure. This study examines the functional role of Margaritifera falcata in the South Fork Eel River, California. 2. We addressed two main questions: (i) Do mussels increase benthic resources in this system? (ii) If so, does this alter macroinvertebrate community structure? 3. Measurements and enclosure experiments in the South Fork Eel River show that mussels can play a significant role in local food webs by increasing available fine particulate matter (both organic and inorganic) on the substrate. We document increased benthic macroinvertebrate biomass for predators and collectors (Leptophlebidae) in the presence of mussels, but only in late summer.																			0046-5070					MAR	2006	51	3					460	474		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2005.01507.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2005.01507.x													WOS:000235331600006
J	Grützmacher, G; Böttcher, G; Chorus, I; Bartel, H				Grützmacher, G; Böttcher, G; Chorus, I; Bartel, H			Removal of microcystins by slow sand filtration	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY												To assess the elimination potential of slow sand filters for cyanobacterial hepatotoxins (microcystins), two full-scale experiments were conducted using the German Federal Environment Agency's experimental field in Berlin, Germany. One experiment was carried out with dissolved microcystins extracted from a cyanobacterial bloom on one of Berlin's lakes, dosed as short-term, single-pulse application. The other experiment simulated natural conditions more closely, with a longer-term exposure of the filter to living cyanobacterial cells (collected from the same lake) so that most toxins were initially contained inside the cells. The microcystins were detected by ELISA and HPLC/photodiode array detector and subsequently identified by MALDI-TOF MS. The experiment with dissolved microcystins yielded very high elimination rates (>95%) inside the filter bed attributed to biodegradation, whereas retardation by adsorption was low. The obtained half-lives for the microcystins detected by ELISA were about 1 h. The second experiment, which was with mostly cell-bound microcystins, showed similar results during the first days after application of cyanobacteria (elimination >85%). As the population declined in late autumn, the proportion of extracellular to cell-bound microcystins increased. At the same time the elimination rates declined to values <60%. This decline is most likely attributable to retarded biodegradation at temperatures of <4degreesC. Altogether the results of the experiments show that under moderate temperatures, with an intact schmutzdecke (biofilm) with previous contact with microcystins, slow sand filtration is an effective treatment for eliminating microcystins from drinking water.

J	Avissar, R; Pan, H				Avissar, R; Pan, H			Simulations of the summer hydrometeorological processes of Lake Kinneret	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												Lake Kinneret is a 168-km(2) lake located in northern Israel. It provides about 50% of the drinking water consumed in this arid country. To manage correctly this vital water resource, it is essential to understand the various hydrometeorological processes that affect its water budget and, in particular, its evaporation. The complexity of the terrain in this region (varying from approximate to 2800 m to approximate to-410 m within a short distance), combined with different types of soil and ground covers surrounding the lake, results in complicated microscale and mesoscale atmospheric motions, including sea, lake, and land breezes, as well as anabatic and katabatic winds. The Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS), a state-of-the-art nonhydrostatic model with two-way interactive multigrid nesting and four-dimensional data assimilation capabilities, was used, together with observations collected near the western and eastern shores of the lake, to study these processes. It was configured with two nested grids centered in the middle of the lake: 1) a coarse grid with 4 km x 4 km grid elements representing a 264 km X 240 km domain including Mount Hermon, the Dead Sea, the Golan Heights, and the Mediterranean coast; and 2) a fine grid with 1 km X 1 km grid elements covering a 42 km x 50 km domain. Two three-day periods in the summers of 1992 and 1993, during which hydrometeorological observations were available, were simulated. To account for synoptic conditions, the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research mandatory-level reanalyses produced every 6 h for these periods were assimilated by the model. The strength and timing of the various atmospheric motions that develop in that region and their interactions significantly affect the hydrometeorological processes of the lake, which are subject to important diurnal and spatial variations of wind intensity and direction, temperature, humidity, and fluxes. Since these processes have a strong feedback on the lake hydrodynamics and thermal structure, it is concluded that the development of a coupled lake-atmosphere model is needed to provide good estimates of lake evaporation when lake water surface temperatures are not available. Here, it is demonstrated that RAMS performs properly, given the particular complexity of the Lake Kinneret system and the uncertainty inherent in observations above turbulent water.																			1525-755X	1525-7541				FEB	2000	1	1					95	109		10.1175/1525-7541(2000)001<0095:SOTSHP>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1525-7541(2000)001<0095:SOTSHP>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000089483000008
J	Jacobs, TV				Jacobs, TV			Systematics and conservation status of estuarine macrophytes of South Africa	PHYTON-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY												Including river mouths, coastal lakes and lagoons, South Africa has 296 estuaries. Macroflora inhabiting South African estuaries fall under the following categories: floating, emergent and salt marsh macrophytes and macroalgae. Some of the factors that affect the health of estuarine ecosystems are: excessive water abstraction from catchments; uninformed agricultural practices that lead to soil erosion and silt deposition; residential, industrial and transport developments in the vicinity of estuaries; various forms of pollution, including dumping of domestic and industrial waste. With the help of a Numerical Index Value (9), it has been estimated that only 26% of South African estuaries are in healthy condition. Using biotic diversity as an index, estuaries with high conservation status need to be identified so that the Consortium for Estuarine Research and Management can put pressure on relevant authorities to pay particular attention to conservation needs.																			0031-9457						1998	63	1-2					267	273																WOS:000078394300036

Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri and Potamothrix hammoniensis were practically the only species in group 1, and the same species accounted for 2/3 of the total numbers in group 2, although Peloscolex ferox and some other species also occurred. At the cleanest stations the dominating species were P. ferox, Psammoryctides barbatus, Stylodrilus heringianus and Tubifex tubifex. A factor analysis showed that L. hoffmeisteri and P. hammoniensis were associated with increased nutrients and water color in the lower part of the epilimnion. In the metalimnion the relationship of S. heringianus and P. ferox to water color and total N differed from that of L. hoffmeisteri and P. hammoniensis. Winter O2 content was important for S. heringianus.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1980	10	3					197	206		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1980.tb01194.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1980.tb01194.x													WOS:A1980JX00100001

Acute toxicity of sonificated cyanobacterial suspensions was tested by i.p. injection in mice. In 9 of 10 locations M. aeruginosa hepatotoxin(s) were present. These cyanobacterial endotoxin(s), i.e. fast-death factor (FDF) or microcystin caused death in mice within 3 h. In most samples associated bacterial toxin(s), i.e., slow-death factor (SDF) causing death within 4-48 h were possibily involved in SDF intoxication symptoms and mortality. Suspensions of O. agardhii were also lethal. Symptoms and mortality were probably due to at least 2 toxic factors. One resembling FDF, the other possibly resulting from associating bacteria. Administration of G. echinulata suspensions did not kill mice but produced symptoms of illness. The symptoms were not consistent with those observed with Microcystis FDF or SDF.																			0166-445X	1879-1514					1983	4	1					63	72		10.1016/0166-445X(83)90061-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0166-445X(83)90061-9													WOS:A1983RB00200005
J	Fuentes, OV				Velasco Fuentes, Oscar			THE EARLIEST DOCUMENTED TORNADO IN THE AMERICAS Tlatelolco, August 1521	BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												This paper discusses a meteorological phenomenon that occurred in the Basin of Mexico in August 1521. The only known description appears in Book XII of the Florentine Codex, which is an account of the Spanish conquest of Mexico written in Nahuatl in the mid-sixteenth century. According to it, just before the fall of Mexico-Tenochtitlan a heavy storm accompanied by a whirlwind struck the basin. The whirlwind hovered for a while above Tlatelolco, Tenochtitlan's twin city, before moving to the lake where it disappeared. Analyzing the account in the context of Nahua culture and contrasting it with contemporary European descriptions of tornadoes and waterspouts shows that the described phenomenon was a tornado. This conclusion receives further support from eighteenth-and nineteenth-century pictorial and written evidence showing that tornadoes do occur in the territory now occupied by Mexico City. Since the tornado of Tlatelolco predates the Cambridge, Massachusetts, tornado of 1680, it represents the earliest documented tornado in the Americas.																			0003-0007					NOV	2010	91	11					1515	1524		10.1175/2010BAMS2874.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/2010BAMS2874.1													WOS:000285409200004
J	Kagalou, I; Papastergiadou, E; Leonardos, I				Kagalou, I.; Papastergiadou, E.; Leonardos, I.			Long term changes in the eutrophication process in a shallow Mediterranean lake ecosystem of W. Greece: Response after the reduction of external load	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Lake Pamvotis is a shallow Mediterranean lake located in Western Greece near the city of Ioannina. The lake has been recognized as an internationally important conservation Site under European Community legislation due to its rich biodiversity. However, during the last three decades the trophic status of the lake has changed as a result of anthropogenic activity (among others irrigation and domestic sewage discharge), resulting in serious problems. Here we present data about the long-term development in eutrophication of Lake Pamvotis. Water samples were collected and analyzed (water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, nutrients, chlorophyll-a) during three monitoring periods: 1985-1989, 1998-1999, 2004-2005. The high nutrient concentrations in the lake water during the three monitoring periods, as well as its eutrophic to hypertrophic status reflect the degree of impact anthropogenic activity has had on the lake. Commencement of a restoration plan in 1995-1996, involving sewage diversion, led to a reduction in external nutrient load and consequently to lower in-lake nutrients and Chlorophyll-a concentrations. Orthophosphate concentration decreased by about 87%, nitrates fell below 1.20mg/l, whilst the total reduction of inorganic N compounds showed a weaker downward trend, fluctuating between 0.39 and 1.24 mg N/l with an average value of 0.76 mg N/l. However, after a short-term recovery the eutrophic status of the lake remains eight years later (2004-2005), suggesting the importance of the internal loading process and the absence of the top-down effect of fish. This study provides evidence for the need of greater restoration efforts utilized in Mediterranean shallow lakes. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The novel surface marine modification of the time domain electromagnetic method was used to map the spatial distribution of brines in the sediments below the lake. Results indicate that electrical resistivities of 1.0 and 0.5 ohm-m are detected at depths of similar to 10 m below the lake bottom in most of the lake area, which are equivalent to similar to 11,000 and 22,000 mgCl/L, respectively. Relatively fresh groundwater was detected beneath most of the shoreline. Faulting controls the Vertical interfaces between saline and fresh groundwaters.

J	Grayson, DK				Grayson, Donald K.			Holocene bison in the Great Basin, western USA	HOLOCENE												Bison (Bison bison) were widespread in the eastern and northern parts of the Great Basin (the area of internal drainage in the arid western USA) during the late Holocene, particularly after 1600 C-14 yr BP. However, of the four areas within the Great Basin for which there is anecdotal evidence of the historic presence of these animals, only one - south-central Oregon - has provided compelling empirical data in support of that evidence. Bison populations flourished in the area immediately surrounding the basin of Pleistocene Lake Bonneville between c. 1600 and 600 C-14 yr BP, a fluorescence that seems to have been tied to deeper northwards incursions of monsoonal storms. Once those incursions weakened, bison populations declined substantially in size. The appearance of bison in south-central Oregon after 500 C-14 yr BP may be a function of the increased winter moisture and cooler temperatures that marked this region during the 'Little Ice Age'.																			0959-6836	1477-0911				SEP	2006	16	6					913	925		10.1191/0959683606hol982fa	http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683606hol982fa													WOS:000242053300012

We address this question through an analysis of the land use surrounding 46 inter-connected lakes located within seven different drainage basins in northern Germany, and the microbiomes of these lakes during early summer. Lake microbiome structure was not correlated with the specific drainage basin or by basin size, and bacterial distribution did not seem to be limited by distance. Instead, land use within the drainage basin could predict, to some extent, NO2 + NO3 concentrations in the water, which (together with temperature, chlorophyll a and total phosphorus) correlated to some extent with the water microbiome structure. Land use directly surrounding the water bodies, however, had little observable effects on water quality or the microbiome. Several microbial lineages, including Cyanobacteria and Verrucomicrobia, were differentially partitioned between the lakes. Significantly more data, including time-series measurements of land use and water chemical properties, are needed to fully understand the interaction between the environment and the organization of microbial communities.

CUADERNOS DE INVESTIGACION GEOGRAFICA												Soils in the Ross Sea Region of Antarctica generally comprise a surface desert pavement and a seasonally thawed active layer over permafrost. Most soils are formed on regolith such as glacial till or colluvium. Mean annual air temperatures range from -18 degrees C to -24 degrees C with low precipitation. The active layer ranges in depth from minimal in higher altitude, colder sites, to near 1 m deep at warmer coastal sites in the northern part of the region. Underlying permafrost may be ice-cemented, or dry with no ice cement. In some areas ice-cored moraine occurs where there is a large body of ice within the subsoil permafrost. Two examples of active gully/fan - forming events, one at Cape Evans and one at Lake Vanda are described. At the Cape Evans event water from a small lake thawed and came into contact with the ice in the underlying patterned ground ice-wedge causing the ice-wedge to melt and extensive gully erosion to occur. A fan-building event near Lake Vanda in the Wright Valley resulted in erosive and depositional features covering a horizontal distance of about 3 km and an altitudinal range of about 1400 m. Such occasional events, can be attributed to warmer than average summers, and were first described in the Ross Sea Region in the 1970s. The Cape Evans and Lake Vanda events are examples of active, rapid, landscape processes and show that landscapes are not as static as is often assumed.																			0211-6820	1697-9540					2016	42	2					415	434		10.18172/cig.2923	http://dx.doi.org/10.18172/cig.2923													WOS:000384226300007

A biomanipulation experiment was carried out in a small (10 ha), but relatively deep (17 m) and highly eutrophic lake in northern Poland. The lake had been stocked in 1996, 1997 and 1998 with a variety of piscivorous fish (pike, catfish, trout and pikeperch), in order to reduce numbers of cyprinid planktivores. 2. Piscivore stocking was associated with a threefold decrease in the offshore fish density (night echosounding). Despite this reduction, the large planktonic cladoceran, Daphnia hyalina, remained scarce, whereas the density of small-sized zooplankton increased greatly. 3. The lack of demographic response in D. hyalina was probably due to the anoxia in the hypolimnetic refuge of this vertically migrating species. The anoxic hypolimnion, below 3-4 m depth, was inhabited day and night by numerous Chaoborus flavicans larvae. 4. Changes in zooplankton were associated with shifts in the taxonomic composition (from single-cell green algae to filamentous cyanobacteria), size structure (from nano- to net phytoplankton) and seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton, but not in the average biomass of planktonic algae. A clear-water phase, which was absent in the prestocking years, developed in spring, with Secchi depth reaching 2.5 m, a value which had never been recorded in the 20 years preceding the biomanipulation. In general, the lake's status was switched from hypertrophic to eutrophic. 5. Deteriorating food conditions, resulting from qualitative changes in the phytoplankton community, combined with predation pressure by the remaining fish and Chaoborus larvae were associated with the ultimate elimination of D. hyalina from the lake.

Studying the Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) predicting model helps to control algal blooms. Predicting the behavior of algae is difficult because of the complex physical, chemical, and biological processes involved. Artificial neural network (ANN) models have been determined to be useful and efficient, especially for such problems for which the characteristics of the processes are difficult to describe using numerical models. An indoor simulated environment is designed for algal cultivation to analyze the temporal change in the algae biomass of Taihu Lake during summer. A Chl-a prediction model based on a nonlinear autoregressive neural network with exogenous inputs (NARX) that can detect and consider within the time dependency is proposed. The NARX model is compared to a static neural network and a dynamic neural network: feedforward neural network (FNN) and Elman recurrent neural network (ERNN). The performance of the proposed NARX model was examined with experimental data collected over 3months in 2010. The results showed that the NARX model outperformed the other ANN models and significantly enhance the accuracy of Chl-a prediction.																			0883-9514	1087-6545				NOV 26	2015	29	10					962	978		10.1080/08839514.2015.1097142	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08839514.2015.1097142													WOS:000365582600002

Regional climate scenarios show increases in annual precipitation and heavy rain events in most parts of Sweden. Accordingly, the risks for flooding will increase. Also the risks of erosion and landslides are expected to increase as well as changed behaviour and increased mobility of soil contaminants. The summer season in general is expected to become drier and there consequently larger fluctuations of groundwater levels is expected further enhancing the risks of erosion, land slides and mobility of soil contaminants. One of the areas expected to be among the most affected in Sweden is the Lake Vanern and the Gota alv (river) system. The Swedish geotechnical institute has, together with other agencies and universities in Sweden, contributed in the national climate and vulnerability inquiry [1]. Here the results from three of those reports are presented, i.e. impact of flooding on soil pollutants [2], increased tapping from lake Vanern and related geotechnical conditions in the Gota alv valley [3] and overview assessment of land slide changes in a changing climate [4]. Based on the results from the national climate and vulnerability inquiry research projects have been initiated. One project focuses on the vulnerability and adaptive capacity among municipalities along the Gota alv system. The project includes socioeconomic, environmental and geotechnical aspects. The aim is to present some preliminary results from this project.																					978-960-474-001-7				2008							52	57																WOS:000260451300004

Now, there is a danger of the lake drying out, which will affect the region and its inhabitants. This study aimed to present a model which can relate the water level of the lake to effective factors. Methods: Parameters that influence water level, such as precipitation, evaporation, water behind dams, and the previous year's water level, were considered in the modeling procedure. The proposed model, based on evolutionary polynomial regression, can be used to evaluate salt marshes produced in the region in recent years. Results: Results show that the high surface-area-to-depth ratio of Urmia Lake is most influential on its drying; however, omitting this characteristic as an inherent one, the main cause is the construction of dams on rivers in the Urmia Lake basin. Conclusion: The proposed model predicts that by 2015, the water level of Urmia Lake will fall below 1269 m, and by 2030, the lake will dry out completely.					; ahmadi, javad/IWU-7098-2023; Benis, Khaled/AAM-1241-2021	Zoroufchi benis, Khaled/0000-0003-3532-6839; 													2423-3765	2423-4311				WIN	2016	3	1					23	28																WOS:000456034500004

However, their ability to improve water quality to safe levels for direct human exposure while largely surrounded by agricultural lands and hosting large wildlife populations remains unknown. Our aim was to examine the ecosystem service capabilities of an avian-dense coastal wetland surrounded by agricultural lands along the southwestern shore of Lake Erie in Ohio by assessing the quality of water as it flows through the wetland (Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge (ONWR)) and into Lake Erie beach waters. Our study used total phosphorus and fecal indicator (Escherichia coli) concentrations as water quality metrics across the wetland and at an adjacent Lake Erie swimming beach during the 2012 summer swim season. E. coli and total P levels were consistently highest at the site, where water enters the ONWR (mean E. coli = 507 CFU/100 mL; mean total P = 535 mu g/L), and steadily decreased as water flowed through the wetland and into the adjacent beach (mean E. coli = 10 CFU/100 mL; mean total P = 41 mu g/L). E. coli and total P showed statistically significant (alpha = 0.01) correlations with phycocyanin, chlorophyll-a, turbidity, specific conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and pH; total P was also significantly correlated with total N. The results suggest that this wetland may be contributing to improving water quality, which is beneficial for human health as well as to downstream ecosystem health (e.g., limiting eutrophication promoting conditions, etc.).					; Andridge, Rebecca/C-8457-2012	Mitsch, William/0000-0001-8348-3172; Andridge, Rebecca/0000-0001-9991-9647													1612-9202	1612-9210				MAR	2015	12	1					77	87		10.1007/s10393-014-1007-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10393-014-1007-y								25582638					WOS:000353910000008

The Eyes Have It: Regulatory and Structural Changes Both Underlie Cichlid Visual Pigment Diversity	PLOS BIOLOGY												A major goal of evolutionary biology is to unravel the molecular genetic mechanisms that underlie functional diversification and adaptation. We investigated how changes in gene regulation and coding sequence contribute to sensory diversification in two replicate radiations of cichlid fishes. In the clear waters of Lake Malawi, differential opsin expression generates diverse visual systems, with sensitivities extending from the ultraviolet to the red regions of the spectrum. These sensitivities fall into three distinct clusters and are correlated with foraging habits. In the turbid waters of Lake Victoria, visual sensitivity is constrained to longer wavelengths, and opsin expression is correlated with ambient light. In addition to regulatory changes, we found that the opsins coding for the shortest-and longest-wavelength visual pigments have elevated numbers of potentially functional substitutions. Thus, we present a model of sensory evolution in which both molecular genetic mechanisms work in concert. Changes in gene expression generate large shifts in visual pigment sensitivity across the collective opsin spectral range, but changes in coding sequence appear to fine-tune visual pigment sensitivity at the short-and long-wavelength ends of this range, where differential opsin expression can no longer extend visual pigment sensitivity.					; Cheney, Karen/A-6827-2013; Seehausen, Ole/C-8272-2011	Carleton, Karen/0000-0001-6306-5643; Marshall, Justin/0000-0001-9006-6713; 													1544-9173	1545-7885				DEC	2009	7	12							e1000266	10.1371/journal.pbio.1000266	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000266								20027211					WOS:000273060500012
J	TOTH, LG				TOTH, LG			SHORT-TERM INVESTIGATIONS ON THE BACTERIOPLANKTON OF LAKE BALATON AT TIHANY	ACTA BOTANICA ACADEMIAE SCIENTIARUM HUNGARICAE												The short-term changes of bacterioplankton were studied by daily sampling in the summers of 1976 and 1977 on Lake Balaton [Hungary]. About 99% of the bacterioplankton was made up of floating colonies in which the bacteria cells remained together in the course of division. About 80% of the colonies had synchronous division and the population went through regular cycles of lag .fwdarw. log .fwdarw. stationary .fwdarw. death phases. The inhibited growth of colonies was presumed from these facts. The storms of previous days stirred up the nutrients from the bottom stimulating the synchronous division. The succession of different morphological groups could be detected. Because of short-term sampling turnover time could be estimated. The decreasing bacterial turnover times and the increasing organic C content in the water column demonstrated the accelerated eutrophication of Lake Balaton.																			0001-5350						1980	26	3-4					425	435																WOS:A1980LT71300013
J	Eyayu, A; Getahun, A				Eyayu, Alamrew; Getahun, Abebe			Distribution and community structure of fish in relation with water physico-chemical parameters of floodplain rivers in the Alitash National Park, Ethiopia	JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY												Riverine ecosystems are highly exposed to different forms of human activities and fish distribution in such habitats can be affected by different features of water. Tributaries of the Abbay and Tekeze Basins are supporting all life requesting activities in Ethiopia. Fisheries of these habitats are also the mainstay of livelihoods. However, brutal human activities are affecting these ecosystems and the fish therein. This study was thus undertaken to examine fish distribution and community structure in relation to water parameters in Ayima, Gelegu and Shinfa Rivers. 2719 fish specimens identified into 43 species were sampled using gillnets, cast nets and electro-fishing on a seasonal campaign. Based on frequency of occurrence (%FO), 5 species fell in the category of 'euconstant occurrence' or their FO was >= 75%, while many species were laid in the 'constant occurrence'. Among others, site depth, total phosphorus, dissolved oxygen and river channel diameter were key environmental factors determining fish community structure. Similarity percentage produced an overall average Bray-Curtis dissimilarity of 60.8% between the fish communities of the three rivers. The final model accounted for 77.2% of the total variance in fish composition, and all canonical axes were significant (Monte Carlo test 499, p = 0.002). Generally, this study was conducted in areas where no ecological studies are undertaken and the results obtained from this study could be important for sustainable utilization of Ethiopian fisheries.					; Getahun, Abebe/NTR-3079-2025	Eyayu, Alamrew/0000-0003-1029-5191; 													0266-4674	1469-7831				JUL	2022	38	4					171	182	PII S0266467422000025	10.1017/S0266467422000025	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0266467422000025		MAR 2022											WOS:000773275800001

After initial vegetation mapping and yearly censuses of ducks in 1985-1990, we collected observational data in 1991-1994 from 28 lakes with natural populations of mallard Anas platyrhynchos and teal A. crecca. Mallard and teal co-occur over vast areas in the Holarctic and they are the only breeding dabbling ducks on many oligotrophic lakes. Both species are migratory in our study regions, teal arriving later in spring than mallards. Log-linear model analysis of observational presence/absence data revealed a positive, not a negative, association between the species. This association was independent of habitat diversity as well as of lake size. Mallard-teal interaction was also studied in a cross-over introduction experiment in 32 other lakes in two years. Wing-clipped mallards were introduced to breeding lakes before the arrival of teal to induce resource limitation and interspecific competition, hypothesized to reduce lake use by teal. The density of mallard pairs on experimental lakes was 2.9-8.0 times higher than on controls, but there was no negative response by teal to the treatment. This is the first combined observational-experimental demonstration of lack of interspecific competition in waterfowl. Our results indicate that heterospecific attraction may affect species co-existence in dabbling ducks.

Mercury complexation by low-molecular-weight (LMW) thiols can affect its bioavailability and thus the production of methylmercury. Freshwater biofilms were sampled in the summer using artificial Teflon substrates submerged for over a year to allow natural community colonization in the littoral zone of a Boreal Shield lake. Inside biofilms, concentrations of different extracellular thiol species (thioglycolic acid, L-cysteine-L-glycine, cysteine, and glutathione) were up to 3 orders of magnitude greater than in the surrounding water column, potentially more readily controlling mercury speciation than in the water column. All biofilm thiols except thioglycolic acid were highly correlated to chlorophyll a, likely indicating an algal origin. Extracellular total mercury represented 3 +/- 1% of all biofilm mercury and was preferentially found in the capsular fraction. Levels of LMW thiols of presumed algal origins were highly correlated with total mercury in the mobile colloidal fraction of biofilms. We propose that periphytic phototrophic microorganisms such as algae likely affect the bioavailability of mercury through the exudation of LMW thiols, and thus they may play a key role in the production of methylmercury in biofilms.

M.; Bonilla, Sylvia; Costa, Luciana; Lurling, Miquel; Reynolds, Colin S.; Scheffer, Marten			A morphological classification capturing functional variation in phytoplankton	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												P> A logical way of distinguishing functional groups of phytoplankton is to cluster species according to their functional traits, such as growth rate and nutrient assimilation constants. However, data for such an approach are lacking for the vast majority of the species. In this study, we show that a classification based on simple morphological traits may capture much of the variability in functional properties among the phytoplankton. We used information on more than 700 freshwater species, from more than 200 lakes situated in climate zones ranging from subpolar to tropical. Morphological characteristics correlated well with functional properties, such as growth rate and sinking rate, and also with the population size and biomass attained in the field. This suggests that morphology is a good predictor of the functional characteristics of species. Cluster analysis was used to define seven species groups based on morphology. Although some of the clusters are taxonomically homogeneous, others include species of several separate divisions. Functional traits (not used for the classification) differed significantly among the clusters, suggesting that the clusters may indeed represent meaningful functional groups. Advantages of our morphological approach to classification include its objectivity, its independence from taxonomic affiliations, and the relative ease of its application to the majority of species for which physiological traits are unknown and are not readily determined.

However, recent studies have indicated that the availability of light energy is also important. On the other hand, the amount of phototroph was reported to decrease in summer in Antarctic lakes, furthermore, the light environment underwater was shown containing high amount of ultraviolet energy in small Antarctic lakes. Here, we hypothesized that primary productivity is limited by not only nutrients and simple light quantity but also light quality in nutrient-poor lakes. Then, we investigate factors influencing primary production by benthic phototrophic communities in shallow nutrient-poor lakes. We examine the relationships between primary production in 17 Antarctic freshwater lakes and nutrient concentrations in lake and benthic water, temperature and light energy. Primary production is decreased by ultraviolet energy reaching the lake bed, showing that production is determined by light quality. We also correlate ultraviolet energy in lake water with the catchment area of each lake. Our results show that the underwater light environment has an important influence on primary production as a key limitation factor and is sensitive to materials in runoff from the surrounding environment for pristine lakes.

(water soldier) on the accumulation and concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus, seston concentrations and provision a habitat for planktonic crustaceans was studied in a Polish oxbow lake during 2002-2004. The Stratiotes stand and the open water differed in the concentrations of mineral nitrogen and chlorophyll a. Stratiotes accumulated significantly more nitrogen in spring. The lower TN:TP ratio, concentrations of mineral nitrogen and chlorophyll a in stands of the water soldier may suggest nitrogen limitation in the littoral of the oxbow lake. The decrease of phytoplankton biomass in the Stratiotes stands may also result from shading and/or allelopathy. The plants did not reduce seston concentrations in the littoral but did affect the abundance and diversity of planktonic and bentho-planktonic crustaceans and probably provided a daytime refuge for Ceriodaphnia and older stages of Cyclopoida but not for Daphnia.

Semi-Automated Classification of Lake Ice Cover Using Dual Polarization RADARSAT-2 Imagery	REMOTE SENSING												Lake ice is a significant component of the cryosphere due to its large spatial coverage in high-latitude regions during the winter months. The Laurentian Great Lakes are the world's largest supply of freshwater and their ice cover has a major impact on regional weather and climate, ship navigation, and public safety. Ice experts at the Canadian Ice Service (CIS) have been manually producing operational Great Lakes image analysis charts based on visual interpretation of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. In that regard, we have investigated the performance of the semi-automated segmentation algorithm "glocal" Iterative Region Growing with Semantics (IRGS) for lake ice classification using dual polarized RADARSAT-2 imagery acquired over Lake Erie. Analysis of various case studies indicated that the "glocal" IRGS algorithm could provide a reliable ice-water classification using dual polarized images with a high overall accuracy of 90.4%. However, lake ice types that are based on stage of development were not effectively identified due to the ambiguous relation between backscatter and ice types. The slight improvement of using dual-pol as opposed to single-pol images for ice-water discrimination was also demonstrated.					; Duguay, Claude/G-5682-2011; Clausi, David/J-4613-2013	Wang, Junqian/0000-0001-9632-2132; Howell, Stephen/0000-0002-4848-9867; Duguay, Claude/0000-0002-1044-5850; Clausi, David/0000-0002-6383-0875; Pinard, Veronique/0000-0003-3686-2764													2072-4292					NOV	2018	10	11							1727	10.3390/rs10111727	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs10111727													WOS:000451733800058

How a constructed wetland within a natural park enhances plankton communities after more than 10 years of operation: Changes over space and time	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Constructed wetlands are increasingly used as a solution to treat polluted water in natural environments. Located in the Albufera de Vale`ncia Natural Park, a constructed wetland was built in 2009 as a pilot project to act as an intermediary between low-quality waters and the largest protected coastal lagoon in the Iberian Peninsula. With a unique dataset spanning more than a decade (2009-2023), this study assessed changes in plankton communities both spatially (comparing six sampling sites) and temporally (comparing four periods of years). The results show how the constructed wetland, after nearly 15 years of operation, has not only maintained but also improved its capacity to enhance the biological quality of the water which is released into the protected lagoon, thus fulfilling one of the main aims of its construction. During the last period (2020-2023) of the time series, the constructed wetland outlets had significantly higher zooplankton biomass, particularly filter-feeding cladocerans, compared to the inlets. This clear improvement in the plankton community was due to management interventions (e.g., drying sectors of the constructed wetland during the summers since 2019) and the rise in temperature. These circumstances promoted earlier hatching of cladoceran diapause eggs from the sediments compared to previous years, maintaining their presence throughout all seasons. Consequently, the outlets of the constructed wetland had significantly lower phytoplankton abundance and sestonic chlorophyll-a concentrations than in the past, nearly oligotrophic states, and a reduced biovolume of potentially toxic cyanobacteria in the released waters.

Wyatt; Foster, David R.; Doughty, Elaine D.; Macdonald, Dana			A record of Holocene environmental and ecological changes from Wildwood Lake, Long Island, New York	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												Analyses of pollen, charcoal and organic content in a lake sediment core from Wildwood Lake, Long Island, New York, provide insights into the ecological and environmental history of this region. The early Holocene interval of the record (ca. 9800-8800 cal. a BP) indicates the presence of Pinus rigida Quercus ilicifolia woodlands with high fire activity. A layer of sandy sediment dating to 9200 cal. a BP may reflect a brief period of reduced water depth, consistent with widespread evidence for cold, dry conditions at that time. Two other sandy layers, bracketed by (14)C dates, represent a sedimentary hiatus from ca. 8800 to 4500 cal. a BP. This discontinuity may reflect the removal of some sediment during brief periods of reduced water depth at 5300 and 4600 cal. a BP. In the upper portion of the record (<4500 cal. a BP), subtle changes at ca. 3000 cal. a BP indicate declining prevalence of Quercus-Fagus-Carya forests and increasing abundance of Pious rigida, perhaps due to reduced summer precipitation. Elevated percentages of herbaceous taxa in the uppermost sediments represent European agricultural activities. However, unlike charcoal records from southern New England, fire activity does not increase dramatically with European settlement. These findings indicate that present-day Pious rigida Quercus ilicifolia woodlands on eastern Long Island are not a legacy of recent, anthropogenic disturbances.

Over a period of several months the pond inflow and outflow were monitored to observe flow rate, suspended solids and total phosphorus concentration. In all runoff events, the inflows were characterized by rapid increases in the concentration of both suspended solids and phosphorus. It appears that significant amounts of phosphorus and sediment accumulate in the pond during the small, more frequent rainfall events. In most small to medium size winter flood events, 60% of phosphorous and 80% of suspended sediments were deposited in the pond. The implication for use of ponds for stormwater treatment would appear to be that ponds can be effective in arresting the downstream movement of sediment, but may not significantly reduce the downstream movement of phosphorus.

All but one of the tephras originates from Iceland; the exception has been attributed to Jan Mayen. We find strong spatial patterning in tephra occurrence at the landscape scale; most, but not all of the tephra occurrences are significantly spatially clustered, which likely reflects atmospheric and weather patterns at the time of the eruptions. Contrary to expectations based on atmospheric modelling studies, tephras appear to be at least as abundant in Ireland and northern Scotland as in Scandinavia. Rhyolitic and other felsic tephras occur in lakes and peatlands throughout the study region, but andesitic and basaltic tephras are largely restricted to lake sites in the Faroe Islands and Ireland. Explanations of some of these patterns will require further research on the effects of different methodologies for locating and characterizing cryptotephras. These new maps will help to guide future investigations in tephrochronology and volcanic hazard analysis. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Evidence for exchange comes from mass balancing total inputs and outputs of POPs in lakes, and experiments to determine air-water fugacity gradients. Several of these investigations in the Great Lakes demonstrate a net volatilization of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The annual cycle of hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) in the Great Lakes, predicted from average monthly air concentrations, shows invasion for most of the year, with short periods of evasion during summer. Volatilization of HCHs takes place in some estuarine regions. Gas-phase fluxes of organochlorine pesticides to oceans and large lakes are of equal or greater magnitude than those due to precipitation and dry particle deposition.

Fecundity of Lake Sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens, Rafinesque) in Lake Winnebago, Wisconsin, USA	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY					5th International Symposium on Sturgeons	MAY 09-SEP 13, 2005	Ramsar, IRAN	Iranian Fisheries Res Org, Int Sturgeon Res Inst, World Sturgeon Conservat Soc, IUCN/SSC Sturgeon Specialist Grp, CITES, Minist Jihad Agr Iran, Iranian Fisheries Org, Shilat Trading Co, Imperial Caviar				Sturgeon species are known for their relatively high fecundity, with some reported to carry as many as 7.7- million eggs. However, the fecundity of lake sturgeon ( Acipenser fulvescesn Rafinesque) has not been thoroughly studied, with limited information available primarily in gray literature and agency reports. Our objectives were to quantify ( 1) the fecundity and gonadosomatic index ( GSI) of female lake sturgeon in a winter F4 stage of development; 2) the average size and weight of F4 lake sturgeon eggs; and 3) relationships between lake sturgeon fecundity and fish weight, length, and age. Total length, weight, age, gonad weight, fecundity, egg diameter, and egg weight were sampled from 14 female lake sturgeon in an F4 stage of egg development in February 2005 from the Lake Winnebago System in Wisconsin. Mean fecundity was 383,529 eggs and the mean GSI was 22.9. Egg diameter averaged 2.74 mm and egg weight averaged 17.34 mg. Weight was the best predictor of fecundity ( r(2) = 0.66). Fecundity data for lake sturgeon larger than 35 kg are needed to allow better estimation of fecundity for larger fish.

Long-term limnological changes in the Ecuadorian paramo: Comparing the ecological responses to climate warming of shallow waterbodies versus deep lakes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Paramos are high-altitude ecosystems of grasslands and shrubs that sustain high levels of biodiversity and contain numerous lakes, ponds and wetlands that are a crucial source of water for millions. In the Andes, limnological data are rare from paramos and particularly so from shallow waterbodies that are prominent features of the landscape. 2. Here, we analyse fossil diatom assemblages using dated sediment cores from three shallow lakes in the paramo of southern Ecuador and document their response to recent climate changes. The two shallowest sites were <0.5 m deep and contained nearly identical diatom assemblages, dominated by Achnanthidium minutissimum and other benthic taxa. The deepest study site, at 4 m depth, differed notably from its shallower counterparts in that the dominant taxa were tychoplanktonic Aulacoseira species. All three study sites showed only minor assemblage shifts over the past similar to 200 years. This contrasts sharply with paleolimnological data from nearby deep lakes (Z(max) > 17 m) that recorded abrupt changes in diatom phytoplankton coincident with the onset of higher temperatures, reduced wind speeds and the onset of thermal stratification in recent decades. 3. In temperate and high-latitude regions, an overriding factor influencing freshwater ecosystems is the duration and extent of ice cover, which itself is closely linked to climate variables. In contrast, there is no winter ice cover and the growing season is continuous year round in our equatorial Andean sites. Instead, rising temperatures are affecting deep lakes primarily by altering the physical structure of the water column resulting in greater periods of thermal stratification, which in turn drives changes in biota and other lake processes. However, this mechanism of change only affects deep lakes because shallow waterbodies are easily mixed by wind. 4. Our data demonstrate the differential response of large, deep lakes in the paramo compared to the relative complacency of changes in shallow waterbodies, which is in marked contrast to similar sites affected by seasonal ice cover.					; Smol, John/A-8838-2015	Michelutti, Neal/0000-0002-5857-4811; Smol, John/0000-0002-2499-6696; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				OCT	2018	63	10					1316	1325		10.1111/fwb.13159	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13159													WOS:000448881700011

Hydrological balances of lakes and lagoons are complex dynamic systems, and to elucidate them, isotopic tracers of water have been used as effective tools along with observations of precipitation, evaporation, inflows, and outflows. Here, to understand hydrological processes during freezing periods in the brackish Saroma-ko Lagoon, Hokkaido, northern Japan, we examined horizontal and vertical distributions of salinity and isotope compositions of lagoon water and ice in 2005 and 2006. Horizontal and vertical gradients of salinity and isotope compositions were observed from the river mouth to the sea channel, and factors determining these distributions were considered. The mixing of freshwater and seawater and a freezing effect were presumed to be factors in relationships between salinity and isotopes and in relationships between surface waters and ice just above the water. A simple box model for water balance was constructed based on these putative factors to reproduce the distributions of salinity and isotope compositions of surface waters and ice. An evaluation of the model revealed that this hydrological system is controlled primarily by horizontal advection of the epilimnion, freshwater influx, and the ice growth rate.

Six sites were urban, 2 suburban and 2 rural (small town). For all storms, 4 urban stations had the highest pH of the 10 locations, with the 6 Montreal Island sites having the highest chemical concentrations. Employing principal component analysis, 2 chemical species associations were apparent: an alkaline/fly ash factor and an acid snow factor. The former indicated the possible effects of local emissions. The storms produced individual chemicl concentrations patterns enabling 5 storms to be separated into distinct events. Three stores were designed as type storms in which pH, sulfates and nitrates varied according to individual storm characteristics and air trajectories. If the air trajectory passed over SOx and NOx sources to the west and southwest (Ontario-Great Lakes region) pH values were lower and sulfate and nitrate concentrations in the snowfall higher.

J	Pernthaler, J				Pernthaler, Jakob			Competition and niche separation of pelagic bacteria in freshwater habitats	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Freshwater bacterioplankton assemblages are composed of sympatric populations that can be delineated, for example, by ribosomal RNA gene relatedness and that differ in key ecophysiological properties. They may be free-living or attached, specialized for particular concentrations or subsets of substrates, or invest a variable amount of their resources in defence traits against protistan predators and viruses. Some may be motile and tactic whereas others are not, with far-reaching implications for their respective life styles and niche partitioning. The co-occurrence of competitors with overlapping growth requirements has profound consequences for the stability of community functions; it can to some extent be explained by habitat factors such as the microscale complexity and spatiotemporal variability of the lacustrine environments. On the other hand, the composition and diversity of freshwater microbial assemblages also reflects non-equilibrium states, dispersal and the stochasticity of community assembly processes. This review synoptically discusses the competition and niche separation of heterotrophic bacterial populations (defined at various levels of phylogenetic resolution) in the pelagic zone of inland surface waters from a variety of angles, focusing on habitat heterogeneity and the resulting biogeographic distribution patterns, the ecophysiological adaptations to the substrate field and the interactions of prokaryotes with predators and viruses.					; Pernthaler, Jakob/A-2257-2008	Pernthaler, Jakob/0000-0001-7558-909X; 													1462-2912	1462-2920				JUN	2017	19	6			SI		2133	2150		10.1111/1462-2920.13742	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.13742								28370850					WOS:000404007700007

Table Grape Cultivar Performance in Oregon's Willamette Valley	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN POMOLOGICAL SOCIETY												Many cultivars of table grapes (Vitis sp.) are grown in Oregon's Willamette Valley, but with the availability of several new cultivars, it is important to compare their performance to well-established standards in this region. Commonly grown cultivars ("established": Canadice, Interlaken, Jupiter, Lakemont, Neptune, Reliance, and Remaily Seedless) along with new cultivars from the University of Arkansas breeding program ("new"; 'Passion', 'Faith', 'Gratitude', 'Hope', 'Joy', and 'Sweet Magic') were planted in Corvallis and Aurora, OR in 2001 ("established") and 2006 ("new") and data collected from 2014 to 2016. Despite differences in growing degree day accumulation and precipitation during the bloom and harvest period, cultivar had a stronger impact than year on traits such as cluster fullness and plant vigor. 'Neptune', 'Canadice', and 'Hope' had the best cluster fill while 'Jupiter' and ` Sweet Magic' had looser clusters. Yield for most cultivars was highest in 2016 and lowest in 2014, and some cultivars performed better at one location than another. 'Faith' and 'Neptune' had consistently high yield at both locations while 'Canadice' had outstanding yield at one location only. 'Interlaken', 'Lakemont', 'Remaily Seedless', and 'Passion' tended to have the lowest yields. Average berry weight ranged from 1.8 to 5.1 g. Large berries contributed to higher yield, except for 'Jupiter' where very poor fruit set resulted in large but very few berries, and in 'Canadice' where berry weight was low, but excellent fruit set coupled with many berries per cluster led to high yield. Total soluble solids (TSS) were often higher in early season than in late-season cultivars, which were sometimes picked before full ripeness to avoid the onset of autumn rain and disease development. Disease pressure ranged from very low in 'Canadice' and 'Neptune' to very high in 'Sweet Magic', 'Reliance', and 'Remaily Seedless', negatively impacting quality at harvest and during storage. Wide ranges in flavor and texture were observed and rated. "Established" cultivars frequently rated higher for flavor intensity than "new" cultivars that were bred to have a mild flavor, considered palatable to a broader range of consumers. Overall, three of the new cultivars (Passion, Faith, and Joy) show promise for production in this region, along with the best performing established cultivars Canadice, Neptune, and Interlaken.																			1527-3741					OCT	2017	71	4					240	249																WOS:000423301300008

The main aim of this study was to determine the concentration of nickel and thallium in Cynoglossus arel fish in Musa estuary. Sixty-seven fish samples were collected from Musa estuary during five intervals of 15 days in summer 2013. After biometric measurements, the concentrations of nickel and thallium were measured by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The mean concentration of nickel and thallium in muscle tissue of fish samples was 2.458 +/- 0.910 and 0.781 +/- 1.754 mg kg(-1)/ww, respectively. The GLM analysis showed a significant negative relationship between nickel concentration and length. In addition, there was a significant positive relationship between thallium concentration and fish length. Nickel concentration exceeded the allowable standards of WHO and FDA in Cynoglossus arel. Therefore, regarding with high consumption of seafood in this region, it is recommended that these fishes should be consumed under a nutritionist counseling.					; Ramezani, Zahra/O-6591-2018; angali, kambiz/S-7360-2017; Ravanbakhsh, Maryam/GZG-9516-2022; zarejavid, ahmad/I-2101-2018; Ahmadi, Mehdi/L-8912-2017	ahmadi angali, kambiz/0000-0002-6816-4517; Jaafarzadeh, Nematallah/0000-0003-1172-4277; ahmadi angali, kambiz/0000-0002-1530-2349; Ramezani, Zahra/0000-0001-7404-2105; Ravanbakhsh, Maryam/0000-0001-9434-7213; zarejavid, ahmad/0000-0002-9993-4713; Ahmadi, Mehdi/0000-0002-9227-7562; Zare Javid, Ahmad/0000-0001-7119-7582													0944-1344	1614-7499				JAN	2017	24	3					2936	2945		10.1007/s11356-016-8055-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-8055-5								27844319					WOS:000396138800069

Studies were carried out in summer 2008 at 10 measurement points localized on Narew River (Bondary, Ploski, Doktorce, Rzedziany, Uhowo, Bokiny Zlotoria, Siekierki and Tykocin). The metal concentrations were determined by means of AAS technique. Calculated bio-accumulation coefficients for roots of examined plants were following: Carex elata Co > Cu > Zn > Cd > Ni > Pb = Cr while for Acorus calamus Co > Cu > Zn > Cd > Ni > Cr > Pb. It can be supposed that household activity, including influences of a local transport and surface runoffs, were the main sources of examined metals deposited in bottom sediments and aquatic plants of upper Narew River. Studied plant material and bottom sediments were only slightly contaminated with cadmium.																			1898-6188	2084-4530					2014	21	1					87	98		10.2428/ecea.2014.21(1)9	http://dx.doi.org/10.2428/ecea.2014.21(1)9													WOS:000420368700009

Physical and hydrochemical variables were measured and ostracod samples were collected in different seasons (April, June, August, and October). Most of the considered sites were characterised by high concentrations of nitrogenous compounds due to washing out from cultivated areas, intermittent river flooding and internal recycling. Observed differences in macrophyte communities were consistent with trophic status of waters, with pleustonic forms dominating most degraded areas. Both morphology of valves (by scanning electron microscopy) and anatomy of soft parts were analysed for ostracod species identification. Nineteen ostracod species in five families were found. Two species, Candona weltneri and Pseudocandona compressa, are new records for Italy. Cypria ophthalmica was collected from all sampling sites; other relatively common species were Cypridopsis vidua, Cyclocypris ovum, and Candona weltneri. No clear seasonality was observed in community structure; highest species diversity occurred in June in most of the studied wetlands. The maximum number of species per site was seven, and a maximum of six species was found in a single sample. Ostracod occurrence in relation to environmental factors was examined using Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Total alkalinity and pH were the most important variables structuring the species assemblages. The ostracod fauna found in this area was compared to the known distribution of recent non-marine ostracods in Italy, and the validity of published checklists is discussed.

However, it is unclear how site-specific factors, such as location, morphometry and hydrology, will mod-ulate these impacts on regional spatial scales. Here, we report water level time series collected by citizen scientists for 15 diverse inland lakes in the upper Laurentian Great Lakes region from 2010 to 2020, and we compare these time series with those for the two largest Great Lakes, Lake Superior and Lake Michigan-Huron. Combined with historical data (1942-2010), the findings indicate that lakes spanning seven orders of magnitude in size (10-2 to 105 km2) all rebounded from record low to record high water levels during the recent decade. They suggest coherent water level oscillations among regional lakes (large and small) implying a common, near-decadal, climatic driver that may be changing.(c) 2022 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

These lakes are in a state of instability, and it is believed that climate warming could result in either lake drainage or thaw lake enlargement. However, accurate prediction of such changes is difficult due to a poor understanding of the complex interactions of climate, permafrost and hydrology. As a first step in considering the role of climate in lake drainage, this paper will consider climate conditions affecting the rapid drainage of a lake in NW Canada in 1989, a warm summer with a deeper than normal active layer. In addition, lake drainage followed an extreme precipitation event. It is postulated that lake drainage may be more frequent with a warmer, wetter climate with increased extreme events.																					90-5809-582-7				2003							729	734																WOS:000185049300128
J	Möckel, S				Moeckel, Stefan			Small Water Bodies and the Incomplete Implementation of the Water Framework Directive in Germany	JOURNAL FOR EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENTAL & PLANNING LAW												Under the Water Framework Directive (WFD), the European Union obliged all member states to protect all their surface water and restore it to a good condition by 2015. For administrative reasons, they must subdivide their surface water into water bodies and define water body types. The Directive proposes minimum sizes for water bodies. Like some other member states, Germany has interpreted this to mean that small rivers, often called headwaters, and small ponds and lakes need not be identified and delineated as a water body and therefore do not fall under the protection system of the WFD. This paper analyses whether the German interpretation and implementation can be considered correct, given that small surface water elements are not unimportant. In Germany, they account for two-thirds of the overall length of rivers. Like the little twigs of a tree, small rivers have a decisive impact on the whole river basin.																			1613-7272	1876-0104					2013	10	3					262	275		10.1163/18760104-01003005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/18760104-01003005													WOS:000212545600004
J	Penny, D				Penny, Dan			The Mekong at climatic crossroads: Lessons from the geological past	AMBIO												The wetlands of the lower Mekong River Basin are ecologically and socioeconomically significant, but they are threatened by predicted climatic change. The likely response of wetland ecosystems to altered flooding regimes and surface-water chemistry is unknown in detail and difficult to model. One way of exploring the impact of climate change on wetland ecosystems is to utilize proxy environmental data that reveal patterns of change over geological time. In recent years, the coverage and resolution of proxy climatic data have improved markedly in the region. Recent evidence of the South China Sea transgression into southern and central Cambodia and paleobotanical evidence from the Tonle Sap ("Great Lake") and elsewhere allow us to explore how periods of higher-than-present sea level and increased monsoon rainfall in the past have impacted the wetland ecology of the lower Mekong River Basin.

J	VOSHELL, JR; SIMMONS, GM				VOSHELL, JR; SIMMONS, GM			COLONIZATION AND SUCCESSION OF BENTHIC MACROINVERTEBRATES IN A NEW RESERVOIR	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The colonization and succession of benthic macroinvertebrates were examined in shallow areas (< 7 m) of Lake Anna, a new mainstream impoundment in the southeastern USA. Benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled for the first 3 yr after filling by means of artificial substrates placed on the bottom and retrieved with SCUBA. Lake Anna was well colonized by benthic macroinvertebrates during the summer season immediately after impoundment. The total density of organisms increased in each of the first 3 yr. Major changes in the fauna occurred between the 1st and 2nd yr, but the changes between the 2nd and 3rd yr were more subtle. The fauna could be divided into 2 distinct groups based on the time when the organisms were most consistently abundant. The 1st colonizers appeared to be dependent on the components of the former terrestrial ecosystem for food and habitat. As autochthonous factors began to regulate succession, diversity increased and the dominant species shifted to an assemblage of 2nd colonizers. These factors included: decomposition of terrestrial vegetation and detritus leaving bare substrate; sedimentation; improved food quality of the organic matter in the sediment because of ingestion and egestion by the organisms themselves; increased plankton populations; and the appearance of macrophytes. As the 2nd colonizers became firmly established in the 3rd yr, distinct patterns of spatial distribution began to appear among species with similar niches.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1984	112	1					27	39		10.1007/BF00007663	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007663													WOS:A1984SS09100003

Therefore, their presence in the environment is considered to be serious and their determination is important. This paper reports the development and validation of a new method based on solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and high-performance liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) for the simultaneous determination of five parabens (methylparaben (MP), ethylparaben (EP), propylparaben (PP), butylparaben (BP) and benzylparaben (BzP)) in surface water. The polymer sorbent was obtained by the electropolymerization of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene on a stainless steel spring support. The parameters affecting the extraction efficiency of parabens were optimized. Under optimal conditions, the extraction recoveries ranged from 88 to 98% except for BzP (70%). Good linear responses were obtained with correlation coefficients (r(2)) exceeding 0.999. The detection limits were from 0.004 to 0.28 mu g L-1. The method was successfully applied for the determination of parabens in lake water.					; Werner, Justyna/M-2273-2014; Zgoła-Grześkowiak, Agnieszka/G-1400-2011; Rębiś, Tomasz/B-1182-2016	Grzeskowiak, Tomasz/0000-0003-3332-5648; Rebis, Tomasz/0000-0003-4930-7241; Werner, Justyna/0000-0002-6020-2179; Frankowski, Robert/0000-0002-9609-8473; Zgola-Grzeskowiak, Agnieszka/0000-0002-9722-4769													0003-2719	1532-236X				OCT 13	2021	54	15					2452	2472		10.1080/00032719.2020.1870232	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00032719.2020.1870232		DEC 2020											WOS:000608877700001

Aphanizomenon strains isolated from the eutrophic shallow Vela Lake (Centralwestern Portugal) during bloom formation in summer months from 2001 to 2007 were characterized combining phenotypic and molecular approaches. The molecular affiliation of the strains was established through sequencing of the 16S rDNA, as well as nifH and hetR genes fragments, and inter-specific genetic variability was checked through repetitive sequences fingerprinting. The morphological characters were characteristic of the descriptions of Aph. issatschenkoi (Cuspidothrix issatschenkoi), Aphanizomenon gracile and Aph. aphanizomenoides. Molecular phylogenetic results corroborated the morphological identification and fingerprinting showed a persistent occurrence of Aph. gracile and Aph. aphanizomenoides strains over the years but also indicated that Aph. aphanizomenoides strains are not clonal within a same bloom. Partial nifH and hetR gene sequences of the cyanobacterial strains showed a high phylogenetic differentiation capacity, even at the strain level.					de Figueiredo, Daniela/C-6192-2008; Correia, Antonio/B-1593-2008; Alves, Artur/C-3645-2008	de Figueiredo, Daniela/0000-0003-3760-4142; Alves, Artur/0000-0003-0117-2958; Pereira, Mario J./0000-0003-1826-391X; Correia, Antonio/0000-0002-5115-1429													0142-7873					FEB	2010	32	2					239	252		10.1093/plankt/fbp111	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbp111													WOS:000273230300010

These systematic surveys are performed at depths of 9 to 110 m at each of seven index sites around Lake Michigan. Zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) popu lations have expanded to all survey locations and at a level to sufficiently contribute to the bottom trawl catches. The quagga (Dreissena bugensis), recently reported in Lake Michigan, was likely in the catches though not recognized. Dreissena spp. biomass ranged from about 0.6 to 15 kg/ha at the various sites in 1999. Dreissenid mussels were found at depths of 9 to 82 m, with their peak biomass at 27 to 46 m. The colonization of these exotic mussels has ecological implications as well as potential ramifications on the ability to sample fish consistently and effectively with bottom trawls in Lake Michigan.																			0380-1330						2001	27	2					252	257		10.1016/S0380-1330(01)70638-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(01)70638-7													WOS:000169535900013

J	Takano, K; Igarashi, S; Hino, S				Takano, K; Igarashi, S; Hino, S			Seasonal changes in silicon content of diatoms estimated from the ratio of particulate silicon to diatom volume under silicon sufficiency in diatom-rich Lake Barato	LIMNOLOGY												To clarify the changes in Si content of diatoms, the particulate silicon (PSi) concentration and total diatom volume (TDV) were determined in Lake Barato, Japan, from April to July 1998-2000. The soluble reactive silicon (SRSi) concentration decreased markedly with the rapid increase in TDV in May and June in all three years, although the value did not fall below that at which diatom growth might be limited. The proliferation of small discoid diatoms contributed to the decrease in SRSi concentration each year. The Si content of diatoms may not be constant as indicated by the changes in PSi:TDV ratio. The low PSi:TDV ratio and the fact that PSi concentration was lower than diatom PSi concentration (calculated from the volume of diatom species) accompanying the decrease in TDV suggests the possibility of a disturbance in the silicification in May and June 1999. These parameter changes accompanying the increase in TDV suggest that the silicification did not catch up with the cell division in early April 1998, early May 1999, and mid-June 2000. In addition, the PSi:TDV ratio increased rapidly and showed large fluctuations in July 1998 and 1999. This may have been caused by a change in dominant species from small discoid diatoms to Aulacoseira granulata because of the differences in Si content per unit cell volume.																			1439-8621	1439-863X				AUG	2004	5	2					115	120		10.1007/s10201-004-0117-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-004-0117-6													WOS:000223274100007

Northern Hemisphere temperature patterns in the last 12 centuries	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												We analyse the spatio-temporal patterns of temperature variability over Northern Hemisphere land areas, on centennial time-scales, for the last 12 centuries using an unprecedentedly large network of temperature-sensitive proxy records. Geographically widespread positive temperature anomalies are observed from the 9th to 11th centuries, similar in extent and magnitude to the 20th century mean. A dominance of widespread negative anomalies is observed from the 16th to 18th centuries. Though we find the amplitude and spatial extent of the 20th century warming is within the range of natural variability over the last 12 centuries, we also find that the rate of warming from the 19th to the 20th century is unprecedented in the context of the last 1200 yr. The positive Northern Hemisphere temperature change from the 19th to the 20th century is clearly the largest between any two consecutive centuries in the past 12 centuries. These results remain robust even after removing a significant number of proxies in various tests of robustness showing that the choice of proxies has no particular influence on the overall conclusions of this study.					; Ljungqvist, Fredrik/JCE-6614-2023	Charpentier Ljungqvist, Fredrik/0000-0003-0220-3947; 													1814-9324	1814-9332					2012	8	1					227	249		10.5194/cp-8-227-2012	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-8-227-2012													WOS:000300878100015

Study focus: Groundwater flow systems in permafrost regions are characterized by a unique circulation. Understanding the groundwater circulation mechanism is essential for studying the hydrological effect of permafrost degradation in alpine regions. In this study, potential water sources and origin of solutes in the groundwater of a typical alpine region were studied using hydrochemistry, O-18, H-2 and H-3 analyses. This research is essential for studying the hydrological effects of permafrost degradation. New hydrological insights for the region: Upon moving from the mountainous region to the plains, the renewal rate decreases from 10.5% to 0.6% and the mean transit time increases from 5-30 to 20-32 years. Groundwater is mainly recharged by ground ice meltwater and infiltration of glacier meltwater, snow meltwater and precipitation in mountainous areas, and by deep groundwater near faults. Discharge to surface water, evaporation, and overflow into springs are the main drainage modes. Water/ice-rock/soil interactions, such as dissolution of aluminosilicate minerals, are the main factors affecting the hydrochemical evolution. This study provides a data-driven approach for understanding groundwater recharge and evolution in similar systems.

Effect of Water Surface Salinity on Evaporation: The Case of a Diluted Buoyant Plume Over the Dead Sea	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Evaporation from water bodies strongly depends on surface water salinity. Spatial variation of surface salinity of saline water bodies commonly occurs across diluted buoyant plumes fed by freshwater inflows. Although mainly studied at the pan evaporation scale, the effect of surface water salinity on evaporation has not yet been investigated by means of direct measurement at the scale of natural water bodies. The Dead Sea, a large hypersaline lake, is fed by onshore freshwater springs that form local diluted buoyant plumes, offering a unique opportunity to explore this effect. Surface heat fluxes, micrometeorological variables, and water temperature and salinity profiles were measured simultaneously and directly over the salty lake and over a region of diluted buoyant plume. Relatively close meteorological conditions prevailed in the two regions; however, surface water salinity was significantly different. Evaporation rate from the diluted plume was occasionally 3 times larger than that of the main salty lake. In the open lake, where salinity was uniform with depth, increased wind speed resulted in increased evaporation rate, as expected. However, in the buoyant plume where diluted brine floats over the hypersaline brine, wind speed above a threshold value (similar to 4 m s(-1)) caused a sharp decrease in evaporation probably due to mixing of the stratified plume and a consequent increase in the surface water salinity.

J	Dumont, HJ				Dumont, HJ			The Caspian Lake: History, biota, structure, and function	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The elongate, endorheic Caspian Lake has a north-south orientation and its main freshwater inflow, the Volga River, enters at the shallow north end. Two deep basins occupy its central and southern regions. These facts lead to horizontal differences in temperature, salinity, and ecology. Nutrient levels and primary production are low. Historically, lake level has fluctuated by similar to 6 m, but on the geological timescale, fluctuations of >200 m have occurred. The lake formed in the late Miocene, first went through a long shrinking phase, expanded to three times its present size in the late Pliocene, and repeatedly rose and fell throughout the Pleistocene, with corresponding freshenings and salinizations. The lake surface has remained below sea level since the last pleniglacial. This dynamic history led to the assemblage of a set of euryhaline biota of Tethyan and freshwater origin, besides Baltic elements, that invaded with glacial meltwater. Endemism is as high as in Lake Baikal, but typical marine groups are absent. Because the lake is oxygenated to the bottom, its biota show a vertical zonation, but without a true abyssal community, suggesting catastrophic episodes of deep anoxia.																			0024-3590					JAN	1998	43	1					44	52		10.4319/lo.1998.43.1.0044	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1998.43.1.0044													WOS:000073694200006

Historical data present only one set of observed events with no information as to whether future events will be greater or smaller. Using statistics extracted from the historical data set, we can generate alternate sequences of data with the same properties as those observed. By generating very many sequences we can derive information on the frequency of occurrence of events of varying magnitude, thus providing the information needed for planning. Time series techniques were used to analyze mean monthly levels of Lake Erie at Cleveland, Ohio, and to generate 1,000 time series to estimate confidence limits. Results indicate that the maximum and minimum historical lake levels all fall within the generated upper and lower 95% confidence limits but that maximum and minimum generated data are often significantly beyond the range of the historical data.																			0380-1330						1992	18	3					481	488		10.1016/S0380-1330(92)71313-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(92)71313-6													WOS:A1992JW93600012

RADARSAT-1 ScanSAR synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery provides new opportunities for synoptic, moderate-high resolution observation of the Great Lakes ice environment. This paper presents ScanSAR imagery and low-altitude oblique air photos to a) illustrate SAR expressions of typical Lake Superior ice features and b) indicate the utility of such oblique air photos as ground truth for SAR validation. SAR imagery reveals a diversity of ice types and conditions, and captures rapidly evolving conditions in the Lake. Contemporaneous oblique air photos reveal essential information about ice conditions, but due to inherent geometric distortions tend to be difficult to correlate with relatively more planimetric SAR imagery.																					0-7803-4403-0				1998							583	585		10.1109/IGARSS.1998.699518	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.1998.699518													WOS:000075217100190

II. Formation and decomposition of thiosulfate and polythionate in Cinder Pool	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Cinder Pool is an acid-sulfate;chloride boiling spring in Norris Geyser Basin, Yellowstone National Park. The pool is unique in that its surface is partially covered with mm-size, black, hollow sulfur spherules, while a layer of molten sulfur resides at the bottom of the pool (18 m depth). The sulfur speciation in the pool was determined on four different days over a period of two years. Samples were taken to evaluate changes with depth and to evaluate the importance of the sulfur spherules on sulfur redox chemistry. All analyses were conducted on site using a combination of ion chromatography and colorimetric techniques. Dissolved sulfide (H2S), thiosulfate (S2O32-), polythionates (SxO62-), and sulfate were detected. The polythionate concentration was highly variable in time and space. The highest concentrations were found in surficial samples taken from among the sulfur spherules. With depth, the polythionate concentrations dropped off. The maximum observed polythionate concentration was 8 mu M. Thiosulfate was rather uniformly distributed throughout the pool and concentrations ranged from 35 to 45 mu M. Total dissolved sulfide concentrations varied with time, concentrations ranged from 16 to 48 mu M Sulfate was relatively constant, with concentrations ranging from 1150 to 1300 mu M. The sulfur speciation of Cinder Pool is unique in that the thiosulfate and polythionate concentrations are significantly higher than for any other acid-sulfate spring yet sampled in Yellowstone National Park. Complementary laboratory experiments show that thiosulfate is the intermediate sulfoxyanion formed from sulfur hydrolysis under conditions similar to those found in Cinder Pool and that poiythionates are formed via the oxidation of thiosulfate by dissolved oxygen. This last reaction is catalyzed by pyrite that occurs as a minor constituent in the sulfur spherules floating on the pool's surface. Polythionate decomposition proceeds via two pathways: (1) a reaction with H2S, yielding thiosulfate and elemental sulfur; and (2) by disproportionation to sulfate and thiosulfate. This study demonstrates that the presence of a subaqueous molten sulfur pool and sulfur spherules in Cinder Pool is of importance in controlling the pathways of aqueous sulfur redox reactions. Some of the insights gained at Cinder Pool may be relevant to acid crater lakes where sulfur spherules are observed and variations in polythionate concentrations are used to monitor and predict volcanic activity.

Impacts of Near-Term Climate Change and Population Growth on Within-Year Reservoir Systems	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT												Climate change and increased urban demand can significantly stress water supply systems, emphasizing the importance of reallocating reservoir storage for the designed uses. Most studies on climate change assessment have analyzed arid region reservoirs due to high interannual variability in streamflows. This study focuses on a within-year reservoir system, Lake Jordan in North Carolina, from a temperate region that has been experiencing rapid growth since the 1990s. Given the interest in utilizing climate change projections for planning purposes, the current operational policies are evaluated, and revised rules for operating the within-year system over 30year period (2012-2041) are suggested. Downscaled general circulation model (GCM) projections are used to implement the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model for the Upper Cape Fear River basin to estimate changes in mean monthly streamflows during 2012-2041 at Lake Jordan. Projected monthly streamflows from four GCMs indicate wet winter conditions and increased interannual variability. The authors forced the reservoir model with multiple streamflow realizations that preserve the projected changes in monthly streamflow using a stochastic scheme. The within-year reservoir system performance was evaluated under stationary climate, climate change under existing and projected water demands, and by investigating interventions to ensure the design reliability under increased demands. These results indicate that the changes in the reliability due to increased urban demands are small because initial reservoir storage ensure the demand for multiple seasons. However, increases in the urban demand and streamflow variability tend to decrease the reservoir resiliency, forcing the within-year reservoir to behave like an over-year system. This could result in increased period of proactive measures such as restrictions and necessitates periodical reevaluation of drought management plans for better managing existing systems.

W.; Marshall, Bruce; Tsuchida, Shinji; Miyazaki, Jun-Ichi; Fujiwara, Yoshihiro			Adaptive radiation of chemosymbiotic deep-sea mussels	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Adaptive radiations present fascinating opportunities for studying the evolutionary process. Most cases come from isolated lakes or islands, where unoccupied ecological space is filled through novel adaptations. Here, we describe an unusual example of an adaptive radiation: symbiotic mussels that colonized island-like chemosynthetic environments such as hydrothermal vents, cold seeps and sunken organic substrates on the vast deep-sea floor. Our time-calibrated molecular phylogeny suggests that the group originated and acquired sulfur-oxidizing symbionts in the Late Cretaceous, possibly while inhabiting organic substrates and long before its major radiation in the Middle Eocene to Early Oligocene. The first appearance of intracellular and methanotrophic symbionts was detected only after this major radiation. Thus, contrary to expectations, the major radiation may have not been triggered by the evolution of novel types of symbioses. We hypothesize that environmental factors, such as increased habitat availability and/or increased dispersal capabilities, sparked the radiation. Intracellular and methanotrophic symbionts were acquired in several independent lineages and marked the onset of a second wave of diversification at vents and seeps. Changes in habitat type resulted in adaptive trends in shell lengths (related to the availability of space and energy, and physiological trade-offs) and in the successive colonization of greater water depths.

J	Zhu, RB; Liu, YS; Ma, J; Xu, H; Sun, LG				Zhu, Renbin; Liu, Yashu; Ma, Jing; Xu, Hua; Sun, Liguang			Nitrous oxide flux to the atmosphere from two coastal tundra wetlands in eastern Antarctica	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Only few estimates of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are available from Antarctic tundra ecosystems. During the summer of 2005/2006, for the first time field measurements of N2O emissions were conducted by a static chamber technique in two coastal marshes (Wolong Marsh and Tuanjie Marsh) of eastern Antarctica. In Wolong Marsh, the N2O fluxes ranged from -20.6 to 85.6 mu g N2O-N m(-2)h(-1), -5.3 to 50.8 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) and 6.4 to 27.1 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) at the wet, mesic and dry sites, respectively. In Tuanjie Marsh, the fluxes ranged from -5.9 to 12.6 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1), -3.6 to 12.1 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) and 12.8 to 59.8 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) at the ponds, shallow fens and dry tundra sites, respectively. The seasonal pattern of N2O fluxes followed the warming of the sediment/soil, indicating that the variation of ground temperatures had an important effect. on N2O emissions. The freezing-thawing cycle seemed to increase the N2O emissions from the wetlands, and water table was the major parameter for spatial variations of controlling N2O fluxes. There was a consistent diurnal pattern in the N2O emission rates from two wetlands and a good correlation with ground temperatures. The sparse data in this study hint at the potential importance of coastal tundra wetlands in the total local atmospheric NO load in eastern Antarctica. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Factors influencing the spatial ecology of Lake Sturgeon and Walleye within an impounded reach of the Winnipeg River	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Impoundments of free-flowing rivers for hydropower generation often confine fish to relatively small reaches that can restrict movement, limit habitat availability, and alter life history strategies. Here, acoustic telemetry was used to describe the seasonal habitat use, locomotory activity, and depth use for Lake Sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) and Walleye (Sander vitreus) within an impounded reach on the Winnipeg River, Manitoba, Canada. Lake Sturgeon foraged and overwintered in the riverine-lacustrine transitionary habitat as well as immediately below the tailrace of the upstream run-of-river facility. Walleye demonstrated high site fidelity to the upstream habitat situated near the tailrace of a hydropower facility. Contrary to Lake Sturgeon, that used multiple habitat types, Walleye used the tailrace for spawning, foraging, and overwintering, given their high residency rates throughout all months at this location. Activity for both species increased with water temperature and when residing in habitat types located farther upstream, but were minimally active during the winter season throughout the impounded reach. On average, Lake Sturgeon utilized 73% of the available depth while Walleye utilized 62% of the available depth across habitat types and months. Overall, the habitat located within the tailrace and below run-of-river facilities should be a conservation priority for both Lake Sturgeon and Walleye populations. There was persistent presence of Lake Sturgeon and Walleye throughout the spawning, foraging, and overwintering periods in the SSGS tailrace and within the first rkm downstream of the tailrace. The habitat proximal to run-of-river facilities generally encompasses small areas of the total potential habitat within impoundments, yet is important to both species studied here. The results provide information on the seasonal habitat use and biological responses to environmental cues for Lake Sturgeon and Walleye that will enhance management and ecological understanding for populations that are confined to impounded reaches.

Samples of the water and the substrate were also analyzed. Phytosociological characteristic was presented, and ranges of physical and chemical properties of habitats were found. It was also found that phytocoenoses of the investigated association have an indicative value in relation to definite properties of the water and the substrate, and could be indicators of the habitat conditions. Comparison of habitat requirements of phytocoenoses investigated in the Wielkopolska region (the Wielkopolski National Park, Western Poland) to those investigated in north-eastern region of Poland (Klosowski, 1992) pointed out the indicative value to be partly the same and partly different in different regions.

Here we evaluated the ecological and hydrological changes in a glacier-influenced lake (Hala Hu, China) since the last glacial. Rapid fluctuations of aquatic biomarker concentrations, ratios, and hydrogen isotope values, from 15 to 14,000 and 8 to 5000 years before present, provided evidence for aquatic regime shifts and changes in lake hydrology. In contrast, most negative hydrogen isotope values of terrestrial biomarkers were observed between 9 and 7,000 years before present. This shows that shifts of vapour sources and increased precipitation amounts were not relevant drivers behind ecosystem changes in the studied lake. Instead, receding glaciers and increased meltwater discharge, driven by higher temperatures, caused the pronounced ecological responses. The shifts within phytoplankton communities in the Late Glacial and mid Holocene illustrate the vulnerability of comparable ecosystems to climatic and hydrological changes. This is relevant to assess future ecological responses to global warming. The Lake Hala ecosystem on the Tibetan Plateau is more sensitive to local changes in temperature and glacial melt than it is to large-scale monsoonal variability, according to aquatic biomarker analysis in lacustrine sediment cores.					; Barbante, Carlo/B-3195-2011; Aichner, Bernhard/AAH-1768-2020; van der Meer, Marcel/L-3450-2013; Sachse, Dirk/D-3410-2012	Wunnemann, Bernd/0000-0002-7172-735X; Barbante, Carlo/0000-0003-4177-2288; Aichner, Bernhard/0000-0002-2471-7466; van der Meer, Marcel/0000-0001-6454-1752; Sachse, Dirk/0000-0003-4207-0309														2662-4435				JAN 10	2022	3	1							3	10.1038/s43247-021-00325-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s43247-021-00325-1													WOS:000740975800005

The sensitivity of phytoplankton to the hydrological environment can effectively indicate the health of the aquatic ecosystem and the change in water quality. Understanding the changes of phytoplankton communities in lakes contaminated by agriculture may contribute to determining the directions of protection of these water bodies and provide reference cases for wider research. It is found that there are 146 species, 63 genera, and 8 phyla of phytoplankton, including 57 species of Bacillariophyta, 46 species of Chlorophyta, 17 species of Cyanobacteria and Euglenophyta. The total abundance was changed successively with Bacillariophyta (75% in June), Cyanobacteria (50% in July-August), and Chlorophyta (75% in September-October). The total biomass decreased continuously over time. The biomass of Chlorophyta is highest in October (67.4%), and diatoms contribute the most biomass in other months (76.5%). The Redundancy analysis indicated that the main environmental factors affecting phytoplankton's dynamic change are total salt, water temperature, total phosphorus, and 5-day biochemical oxygen demand. The phytoplankton can be divided into 21 functional groups. The MP group has the highest frequency, mainly distributed in the frequently stirred and turbid shallow water. Representative functional groups indicate the high degree of eutrophication and nutrient-rich conditions and the good associated environment for phytoplankton and slow water flow rate. With the seasonal change of agricultural irrigation and drainage, the water quality of Xinmiao Lake began to deteriorate from medium pollution in July and reached serious pollution in October finally. Furthermore, this research discovered that the risk of cyanobacteria bloom is high in summer, primarily when thermal stratification occurs. This study provides necessary information for understanding and predicting the changes of the phytoplankton community caused by the increase of nutrients, human disturbance, and temperature conditions in eutrophic lakes in agricultural areas.																				2296-665X				MAR 31	2022	10								833409	10.3389/fenvs.2022.833409	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.833409													WOS:000788353600001

In the present study, we evaluated the responses of epiphytic chironomids to changes in environmental conditions over a long time scale. We intended to decipher whether changes in the trophic status of a lake (hypertrophic-eutrophic) would affect the taxonomic structure of epiphytic chironomids by influencing their food availability (structure of periphytic algae) and whether the responses of chironomids are taxa specific. In a shallow hypertrophic lake ecosystem, epiphytic chironomids associated with the emergent macrophyte Phragmites australis were studied from 2001 to 2018. In the autumn of 2006, emergent macrophyte removal led to an improved water transparency and reduced phytoplankton biomass. Epiphytic chironomids responded clearly to the shift from hypertrophic to eutrophic conditions. Under hypertrophic conditions larvae of detritivorous Cricotopus sp. (gr. sylvestris) and filter-feeder larvae of Glyptotendipes sp. prevailed. After macrophyte removal, we observed high relative abundances of Endochironomus albipennis and Paratanytarsus austriacus, which are classified as grazers, utilise periphytic algae (mainly diatoms) as a food source. The results indicated that the density of P. australis, relative abundances of cyanobacteria and diatoms in periphyton communities, Secchi disc depth, and periphytic and planktonic Chl-a are significant determinants of the diversity of epiphytic chironomids. The results can provide a reliable reference to the neolimnological and paleominological studies on chironomid responses to multiple environmental stressors in shallow lakes. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The results of the soil carbon cycle in Maocun, Guilin, showed that the soil carbon cycle in the karst area, the weathering and dissolution of carbonate rocks under the soil, resulted in a lower soil respiration of 25% in the karst area than in a non-karst area (sandstone and shale), and the carbon isotope results indicated that 13.46% of the heavy carbon of the limestone is involved in the soil carbon cycle. The comparative monitoring results in paired watersheds, suggesting that the HCO3- concentration in a karst spring is 10 times that of a rivulet in a non-karst area, while the concentration of inorganic carbon flux is 23.8 times. With both chemical stoichiometry and carbon stable isotopes, the proportion of carbon in karst springs derived from carbonate rocks was found to be 58.52% and 37.65% respectively. The comparison on carbon exchange and isotopes at the water-gas interface between the granite and carbonate rock basins in the Li River showed that the CO2 emission of the karst water is 10.92 times that of the allogenic water from the non-karst area, while the carbon isotope of HCO3- in karst water is lighter by 8.62%. However, this does not mean that the karst water body has a larger carbon source effect. On the contrary, it means the karst water body has a greater karst carbon sink effect. When the karst subterranean stream in Zhaidi, Guilin, is exposed at the surface, carbon-rich karst water stimulated the growth of aquatic plants. The values of carbon stable isotopes in the same species of submerged plants gradually becomes heavier and heavier, and the 512 m flow process has a maximum range of 15.46%. The calculation results showed that 12.52% of inorganic carbon is converted into organic carbon. According to the data that has been published, the global karst carbon sink flux was estimated to be 0.53-0.58 PgC/a, equivalent to 31.18%-34.41% of the global forest carbon sink flux. In the meanwhile, the karst carbon sink flux in China was calculated to be 0.051 PgC/a, accounting for 68% of its forest carbon sink flux. (C) 2018 China Geology Editorial Office.

The << BAIKAL-5D >> was installed during the 2020 winter expedition at a depth of 1250 m. To carry out the optical measurements, we use a device with a shaded point-like isotropic light source having a spectral resolution of about 3 nm. A wide angle light receiver is moved by a stepper motor so that the distance between the receiver and the light source can vary from 0.9 m to 7.4 m. The absorption and scattering lengths were measured every week in 6 spectral points. The short-time variation of absorption length was estimated.																									2022									1034															WOS:001081844902108

How unusual is this trend of ice loss within the frame of natural variability, and to what extent can it be explained by underlying climate dynamics? Here, we present new high-resolution reconstructions of long-term changes in the extents of three glaciers on the island of South Georgia (54 degrees S, 36 degrees W), combining detailed analyses of glacial-derived sediments deposited in distal glacier-fed lakes and cosmogenic exposure dating of moraines. We document that the glaciers of South Georgia have gradually retracted since the Antarctic cold reversal (ACR, 14.5-12.8 ka), culminating in the disappearance of at least one of the reconstructed glaciers. The glacier retreat pattern observed in South Georgia suggests a persistent link to summer insolation at 55 degrees S, which intensified during the period from the ACR to approximately 2 ka. It also reveals multi-decadal to centennial climate shifts superimposed on this long-term trend that have resulted in at least nine glacier readvances during the last 10.5 ka. Accompanying meridional changes in the Southern Hemisphere westerlies and their interconnection with local topography may explain these glacier readvances.					; Timmermann, Axel/F-4977-2011; Schäfer, Jörg/U-2573-2019; Bakke, Jostein/AAI-1145-2020	Paasche, Oyvind/0000-0003-0329-9063; Timmermann, Axel/0000-0003-0657-2969; 													2045-2322					APR 16	2021	11	1							8361	10.1038/s41598-021-87317-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-87317-5								33863941					WOS:000641795600004

Why does Cladophora fail to reach nuisance proportions in Lake Simcoe?	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												In recent years, a resurgence of filamentous benthic algae (e.g., Cladophora) in the Laurentian Great Lakes has been perceived as a consequence of dreissenid mussel invasion and subsequent alterations to ecosystem nutrient and energy cycling. Here, we employ high-frequency hydro acoustic surveys at two sites in lake Simcoe to assess the presence and extent of excessive benthic algal (Cladophora) growth that we hypothesized would be growing on hard substrate in the post dreissenid mussel period. Despite comparable dreissenid abundance, water clarity and phosphorus concentrations to sites in the lower Great Lakes known to suffer extensive Cladophora fouling during the summer months, the nuisance growths of Cladophora that have become a seasonal phenomenon in the lower Great Lakes were not found at survey sites in Lake Simcoe. While the proximal cause for the lack of excessive Cladophora growth in Lake Simcoe remains elusive, in this paper, we highlight some distinct differences in environmental conditions and ecological interactions that might make near shore areas of Lake Simcoe unique from near shore areas of the lower Great Lakes. Overall, the results of this study and other recent studies in Lake Simcoe are not inconsistent with the near shore shunt hypothesis that predicts dreissenid mussels enrich the benthic environment, but the manifestation in Lake Simcoe is very different than that observed in the lower Great Lakes.

Given the large spatial and temporal variability of the surface temperatures of the North American Great Lakes, such estimations can introduce errors when used as lower boundary conditions for dynamical downscaling. Lake surface temperatures (LSTs) influence moisture and heat fluxes, thus impacting precipitation within the immediate region and potentially in regions downwind of the lakes. For this study, the Advanced Research version of the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF-ARW) was used to simulate precipitation over the six New England states during a 5-yr historical period. The model simulation was repeated with perturbed LSTs, ranging from 10 degrees C below to 10 degrees C above baseline values obtained from reanalysis data, to determine whether the inclusion of erroneous LST values has an impact on simulated precipitation and synoptic-scale features. Results show that simulated precipitation in New England is statistically correlated with LST perturbations, but this region falls on a wet-dry line of a larger bimodal distribution. Wetter conditions occur to the north and drier conditions occur to the south with increasing LSTs, particularly during the warm season. The precipitation differences coincide with large-scale anomalous temperature, pressure, and moisture patterns. Care must therefore be taken to ensure reasonably accurate Great Lakes surface temperatures when simulating precipitation, especially in southeastern Canada, Maine, and the mid-Atlantic region.					; Huang, Huanping/GLR-5969-2022	Bruyere, Cindy/0000-0001-6913-6705; Huang, Huanping/0000-0002-6153-6357; Hanrahan, Janel/0000-0002-3509-0224; 													1558-8424	1558-8432				JUL	2021	60	7					935	949		10.1175/JAMC-D-20-0169.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-20-0169.1													WOS:000683000100005

Environmental factors influencing invasibility and ecological consequences of persistent invasions of the spiny waterflea	INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF THEORETICAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY, VOL 30, PT 8, PROCEEDINGS: NOW: INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF LIMNOLOGY	International Association of Theoretical and Applied Limnology Proceedings				30th Congress of the International-Association-of-Theoretical-and-Applied-Limnology	AUG 12-18, 2007	Montreal, CANADA	Int Assoc Theoret & Appl Limnol				The spiny waterflea, Bythotrephes longimanus (Crustacea: Onychopoda: Cercopagidae), is a predatory zooplankter native to Eurasia that has invaded more than 80 lakes in North America over the last 3 decades. Its inconsistent invasion pattern - high success in some lakes and absence in other proximal lakes (MACISAAC et al. 2000, BRANSTRATOR et al. 2006) - undoubtedly results from variation in regional dispersal and local habitat (SHURIN 2000). However, teasing apart the relative importance of these processes is difficult because dispersal vectors remain poorly defined (BRANSTRATOR et al. 2006), habitat requirements are not fully understood (MACISAAC et al. 2000, BRANSTRATOR et al. 2006), and the invasion record is incomplete. In a series of reservoirs in St. Louis County, Minnesota (USA), local habitat, not regional dispersal, has likely limited establishment. Island Lake Reservoir, Fish Lake Flowage, and Boulder Lake were invaded in the 1990s (FORMAN & WHITESIDE 2000), when presumably planktonic animals and/or diapausing eggs were transported from previously invaded Lake Superior. B. longimanus persisted in Island Lake Reservoir (hereafter Island Lake), but failed to establish in Fish Lake Flowage (hereafter Fish Lake) and Boulder Lake (FORMAN & WHITESIDE 2000, BRANSTRATOR et al. 2006). Insufficient abiotic and/or biotic habitat in Fish Lake and Boulder Lake may have prevented establishment of B. longimanus; the exotic is sensitive to extremes in temperature, salinity, pH, and dissolved oxygen (GRIGOROVICH et al. 1998, BROWN 2008) and also requires abundant crustacean zooplankton prey resources (YURISTA & SCHULZ 1995). Intense fish planktivory has also been proposed to explain establishment failure across the range of B. longimanus (MACISAAC et al. 2000, BRANSTRATOR et al. 2006). I examined whether the abiotic habitat and prey resources in Island Lake during summer were more suitable for B. longimanus than those of Fish Lake or Boulder Lake. Because no pre-invasion data were available, post-invasion conditions were monitored during the summer for 3 years, and results were interpreted as (1) factors contributing to invasion success and (2) ecological consequences of a persistent invasion in Island Lake.																			0368-0770		978-3-510-54079-2				2009	30		8				1301	1306																WOS:000274244900033

Microhabitat association of Hemimysis anomala on fish spawning reefs in Grand Traverse Bay, Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												In 2006 the bloody-red mysid (Hemimysis anomala), a new invasive species to the Great Lakes, was discovered in the Muskegon channel which flows into Lake Michigan. As predicted at the time of introduction, it quickly expanded its range in Lake Michigan and has recently been documented in Grand Traverse Bay near Elk Rapids, Michigan. Its effects on Great Lakes ecosystems, however, remain unclear owing to a lack of information on its abundance. Using a gear intended to sample lake trout and lake whitefish eggs from cobble substrate during spawning, we found variable densities of Hemimysis at three near shore reefs at Elk Rapids, Lake Michigan over a two year period. The highest densities of Hemimysis were found at the reef with the highest quality fish (i.e., lake trout and lake whitefish) spawning habitat based on the proportion of rounded cobble and rubble substrates, and the amount of interstitial space. Abundance of Hemimysis on all reefs was highly seasonally dependent, ranging from 0 to 31.4 per m(2). The highest numbers were seen during the fall when water temperatures were between 6 and 12 degrees C. Based on the association of Hemimysis with cobble substrates and the abundance of this type of habitat in northeastern Lake Michigan, we predict substantial expansion of Hemimysis in this area of the lake. Additional evaluation of Hemimysis on fish spawning habitat is needed to determine potential interactions with other Great Lakes biota, particularly larval fish with which they may compete.

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that most AOB groups were Nitrosospira and Nitrosomonas, in which Nitrosospira was dominant. The AOA amoA were affiliated with two branches of classical sequences which belonging to Thaumarchaeota: water/sediments branch and soil/sediments branch. The abundance of AOA amoA in the rhizospheres of aquatic plants were higher than in the non-rhizosphere (p < 0.05), indicating that aquatic plants may promote the growth of AOA. However, the anammox 16S rRNA showed the opposite trend relative to AOA amoA (p < 0.05). Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that the differences in abundance of AOB, AOA, anammox bacteria, and denitrifying bacteria are very likely related to the different contents of ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) and thus to the rhizosphere states of aquatic plants.					; Zhao, Jianwei/IST-8553-2023; Yin, Xingjia/NFT-3649-2025; Hua, Yumei/KHY-2013-2024	Yin, Xingjia/0009-0008-6389-4909; 													0233-111X	1521-4028				NOV	2018	58	11					998	1006		10.1002/jobm.201800220	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jobm.201800220								30117537					WOS:000449869800010

The technique described is adapted to small temperate glaciers with complex flow patterns. We also describe a motion anomaly, apparent in the InSAR phase signal, that persisted on Black Rapids Glacier for at least 78 days during winter 1991/92 and recurred in 1996. This anomaly is interpreted using a basal hydrology hypothesis in which a hydraulic head is maintained at the glacier bed at close to the overburden pressure. This permits a cumulative influx of 1.6 x 10(6) m(3) of water under the glacier, a sort of shallow subglacial lake, that migrates downstream at an average rate of 30 in d(-1) over 78 days. The motion anomaly is speculated to be an unsuccessful bid for surge initiation.																			0260-3055		0-946417-31-8				2003	36						29	36		10.3189/172756403781816095	http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/172756403781816095													WOS:000184905100005

W.; Jamu, Daniel			Seasonal dynamics of physico-chemical characteristics and biological responses of Lake Chilwa, Southern Africa	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake Chilwa is shared by Malawi and Mozambique, it supports an important fishery and its watershed is undergoing rapid population growth and increasing utilization for agricultural production. It is a shallow, closed basin lake with extensive surrounding wetlands; and it has suffered several desiccation events in the last century. To better understand the current condition of the lake, we monitored a suite of physical, chemical and biological parameters at approximately monthly intervals over an annual cycle in 2004-2005. The limnology of the lake was extremely sensitive to seasonal changes in the lake's seasonal hydrological cycle. The physico-chemical parameters, temperature, electrical conductivity, and total suspended solids exhibited clear seasonal patterns driven by the highly seasonal rainfall and resultant lake levels. In response, phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance, as well as biologically dependent oxygen concentrations and pH, exhibited several maxima levels over the year. The peaks of phytoplankton and zooplankton were out of phase suggesting a lag in the zooplankton grazing in response to pulses in primary productivity. Chlorophyll concentrations can exceed 1 mg/L in surface waters indicative of hypereutrophic conditions, but they fell dramatically during zooplankton peaks. This hydrologically driven, shallow and mesohaline lake is a productive and critical resource to the region. Its management poses challenges arising from the dependence of its limnology and fishery on the lakes hydrology, catchment land use and climate variability.

J	Yu, B; Lin, H				Yu, Bin; Lin, Hai			Coherent changes of wintertime surface air temperatures over North Asia and North America	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The surface temperature variance and its potential change with global warming are most prominent in winter over Northern Hemisphere mid-high latitudes. Consistent wintertime surface temperature variability has been observed over large areas in Eurasia and North America on a broad range of time scales. However, it remains a challenge to quantify where and how the coherent change of temperature anomalies occur over the two continents. Here we demonstrate the coherent change of wintertime surface temperature anomalies over North Asia and the central-eastern parts of North America for the period from 1951 to 2015. This is supported by the results from the empirical orthogonal function analysis of surface temperature and temperature trend anomalies over the Northern Hemisphere extratropical lands and the timeseries analysis of the regional averaged temperature anomalies over North Asia and the Great Plains and Great Lakes. The Asian-Bering-North American (ABNA) teleconnection provides a pathway to connect the regional temperature anomalies over the two continents. The ABNA is also responsible for the decadal variation of the temperature relationship between North Asia and North America.					; Yu, Bin/JAC-8514-2023	Yu, Bin/0000-0002-3706-8194; Lin, Hai/0000-0003-4353-0426													2045-2322					MAR 29	2018	8								5384	10.1038/s41598-018-23750-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-23750-3								29599434					WOS:000428618900027

Demographic analysis of trade-offs with deliberate fragmentation of streams: Control of invasive species versus protection of native species	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Tools restricting the movements of invasive species (e.g. barriers) and reducing habitat fragmentation for native species (e.g. corridors, fishways) provide examples where actions taken to address one environmental concern can hinder efforts to address another environmental concern. We used perturbation analysis of stage-structured projection matrices to evaluate the efficacy of seasonally operated barriers and fishways for controlling non-native sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) in the Laurentian Great Lakes while minimizing effects on non-target fishes. For non-jumping fishes migrating in spring, seasonally operated barriers without a fishway will not balance the management objectives satisfactorily. Migration phenologies of the seven common non-target fishes considered in our analyses overlapped considerably with the migration phenology of sea lamprey, with peaks in migration typically being 7-43 days (median 12) from the peak in the sea lamprey migration. Consequently, across species, years, and tributaries, 44-100% of the migratory runs of non-target fishes would be blocked under the 75-day operation period required to block 99% of the sea lamprey spawning run, on average. Reductions in the production of nontarget fishes due to blocking were also projected to be similar in magnitude to reductions projected in the production of sea lamprey, unless density-dependent compensation was strong or overlap in migration phenologies between a non-target species and sea lamprey was low. Even under density-dependent compensation, providing a fishway is advisable and passage of non-target fishes may have to be highly effective to avoid population declines in non-jumping species that migrate between a Great Lake and its tributaries.

J	Ellis, AW; Johnson, JJ				Ellis, AW; Johnson, JJ			Hydroclimatic analysis of snowfall trends associated with the North American Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												Research over the past several decades has indicated that snowfall has increased dramatically over portions of the past century across those areas of the Great Lakes region of North America that are subject to lake-effect snowfall. Within this study, time series of annual midwinter snowfall within lake-effect areas show evidence of a clear increase in both snowfall and snowfall frequency through a 40-yr period beginning in the early 1930s and ending in the early 1970s. The goal of the work presented here is to determine to what extent the apparent increases in lake-effect snowfall actually modified the winter hydroclimate of the areas. Simple hydroclimatic analysis of midwinter precipitation to the lee of Lakes Erie and Ontario for the period of significant snowfall increases suggests that the changes were a product of 1) a shift toward more precipitation events that were snowfall rather than rainfall, 2) an associated decrease in midwinter rainfall, 3) an increase in the intensity of individual snowfall events, and 4) an increase in the snowfall/snow water equivalence ratio. The balance was a small increase in total precipitation confined to areas in close proximity to the lakes across northeastern Ohio and western New York, while areas outside the regions generally experienced an overall decrease in midwinter precipitation. While the cause(s) of the snowfall trends remains elusive, the results of the work presented here suggest that no great long-term regional change occurred in the true wintertime seasonal hydroclimate of the lake-effect areas. Rather, much of the touted snowfall increase simply came at the expense of rainfall events to produce only small changes in total precipitation over the time period of significant snowfall increase.																			1525-755X					JUN	2004	5	3					471	486		10.1175/1525-7541(2004)005<0471:HAOSTA>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1525-7541(2004)005<0471:HAOSTA>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000222090600008

Using the SeaWiFS data for the time period 1998-2004, the seasonal dynamics of spatial distributions of phytoplankton chlorophyll and dissolved organic matter in Lake Ladoga have been documented and analyzed. It is shown that the hydro-optical characteristics of the lake's water have undergone appreciable modifications as compared to the mid-1980s. Contrary to expectations that these changes would bring about some amelioration of the lake's ecological state, ship-based and spaceborne observations indicate that the attained decrease in phosphorous input has not resulted in "healing" of the lake's ecology. It is proposed that during the lake's mesotrophic period, a specific mechanism of phosphorus release from dissolved organic matter has gradually developed. As a result, the lake's phosphorous concentrations have continued to be higher than expected. In addition changes in local atmospheric forcing are manifested not only in remotely sensed color data but also in the inter-annual behavior of the spring thermal bar derived from the AVHRR multi-year observations.

J	Hastenrath, S; Polzin, D; Francou, B				Hastenrath, S; Polzin, D; Francou, B			Circulation variability reflected in ice core and lake records of the southern tropical Andes	CLIMATIC CHANGE												The circulation mechanisms of climate anomalies in the southern tropical Andes are of particular interest for the January-February core of the precipitation season. With this focus, we evaluate in context upper-air and surface analyses, water level measurements of Lake Titicaca, and records of net balance and delta(18)O from ice cores. Precipitation is more abundant with enhanced and southward expanded easterlies through a deep layer of the troposphere over the southern tropical Andes. Concomitant with this is a southward displaced circulation system over the equatorial Atlantic, entailing reduced interhemispheric gradient of sea surface temperature (SST; cold/warm anomalies in the North/South), more southerly position of the surface wind confluence and Intertropical Convergence Zone, and thus more abundant rainfall in Northeast Brazil. Such ensemble of circulation departures in boreal winter is common to the high phase of the Southern Oscillation. delta(18)O in the ice cores from Peru's Quelccaya Icecap, as well as the cores from Sajama and Ilimani in Bolivia is more negative with more abundant precipitation, both in the same annual cycle and on interannual timescales. The large-scale circulation departures associated with the more negative delta(18)O are in the sense as for anomalously abundant precipitation activity over the southern tropical Andes. The variability of delta(18)O seasonally and interannually appears to be controlled mainly by the fate of the water vapor along its trajectory and over the Andes, rather than by the SST of the South Atlantic source region.

The average surface water alkalinity for lakes in the Alagnak drainage (109-mu-eq L-1) is much less than that for the Naknek drainage (425-mu-eq L-1), and below that for lakes from South Central Alaska, indicating a potential sensitivity of the lakes in the Alagnak river system to acid depostion. The upper Alagnak drainage contains Iron Springs Lake, a naturally acidic lake (pH 3.65) with a surface area of 70 ha. The acidity of this lake may be due to oxidation of surficial iron sulfide deposits, which would also explain the relatively high sulfate concentrations (120-1516-mu-eq L-1) in the Alagnak drainage.																			0004-0851					FEB	1992	24	1					64	68		10.2307/1551321	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1551321													WOS:A1992HF86200007

Herring gulls (Larus argentatus) and common terns (Sterna hirundo) were the only species found to breed in abundance within the surveyed area. All of the herring gull colonies and the majority of the common tern colonies were located on Reindeer Lake, rather than on the smaller lakes and river channels along the Churchill and Reindeer rivers. The mean size of nesting colonies was relatively small compared to those of more southerly latitudes. Favored nesting sites were small rocky islands which were very susceptible to flooding. Common terns may be better adapted to utilizing the more ephemeral nesting habitat along the river systems than herring gulls.																			0008-3550						1979	93	2					132	138																WOS:A1979GV21500004

We present a palynological reconstruction of regional vegetation and fire history in Grass Valley, central Nevada, from similar to 14 to similar to 7.5k cal a BP showing thatPinus-dominated woodlands were replaced by dry-adapted steppe and desert vegetation accompanied by an increase in regional fire activity at the beginning of the Holocene, in response to summer warming and a drying climate. Following a severe drought period peaking similar to 10.2-9.3k cal a BP,Pinuswoodlands partially recovered contemporaneously with the 8.2k cal a BP climate anomaly. Local wetlands provided important resource patches for human foraging societies, and periodic declines of wetlands in response to changing local hydrological conditions may have necessitated adjustments in subsistence and settlement practices and technology.

The reflection pattern and correlation to the isotope stages indicate that the topset and progradational foreset sediments of the deltas formed during periods of stable lake levels and warm climatic conditions. During warm stages, the lake level was high, and during cold stages it was low. The drop in the lake level due to cooling from MIS 5 through MIS 4 is estimated to be 33-38 m; from MIS 3 through MIS 2, it fell an additional 11-15 m. Because the lake level is chiefly controlled by evaporation and river input, we infer that more water was supplied to Lake Baikal during warm stages. (C) 2004 University of Washington.

Human activities and long-range pollutants are increasing on the Antarctic continent. Research on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) has been carried out internationally by several countries having their permanent research stations to explain the impact of an ever increasing range of POPs in Antarctic ecosystem. POPs have been detected in Antarctica despite its geographical isolation and almost complete absence of human settlements. The presence of POPs in different abiotic (atmosphere, water bodies, sediments, soil, sea ice) and biotic components (mosses, lichens, krill, penguins, skua, etc.) in Antarctica has been studied and documented around for decades and has either been banned or strictly regulated but is still found in the environment. This review focuses on recent research pertaining to sources and occurrence of POPs in Antarctic lake water, soil, sediment, lichen, mosses and other Antarctic marine community. This review also proposes to summarize the current state of research on POPs in Antarctica environment and draw the earliest conclusions on possible significance of POPs in Antarctica based on presently available information from related Antarctic environment.

In non-glacier-fed lakes, the loss-on-ignition variations are interpreted to reflect mainly lake productivity and hence variability in surface summer air temperature. Sediments deposited in proglacial lakes, however, reflect mainly the glacier activity in the lake catchment.

Shoot blights of red pine in the Lake States are caused primarily by the pathogens Sirococcus conigenus and Sphaeropsis sapinea. Outbreaks of S. conigenus historically have been associated with wet spring weather and multiple canopy levels. Outbreaks of S. sapinea cankers often occur on trees under moisture stress or with wounds. Shoot blights are common where there is a pine overstory, which provides a source of fungal spores. Both pathogens are capable of killing trees. Permanent plots were established in MI and WI during a recent shoot blight epidemic. Both pathogens were often present on the same site, and sometimes on the same branch. Disease severity was greatest where both pathogens were present. Stand characteristics and site factors affect the risk of disease damage.																					0-939970-77-5				1999							389	390																WOS:000085856700066
J	JOHNSON, L				JOHNSON, L			THE RELICT FAUNA OF GREINER LAKE, VICTORIA ISLAND, NWT, CANADA	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												A survey of Greiner Lake in Victoria Island revealed the presence there of 4 species usually considered to be "relicts" of marine or glacial events. The species are: Mysis relicta. Limnocalanus macrurus. Gammaracanthus loricatus aestuariorum and Mesidothea entomon. M. entomon is a new record for fresh waters isolated from contact with the sea in North America and G. loricatus aestuariorum is a new record for this region. Greiner Lake (15 m above sea level) is in an area that has risen from the sea within the last 1300 years. It has a maximum depth of 11 m and a maximum summer temperature of approximately 8[degree]C. An analysis of the lake water is given and also a brief account of other species present. Possible methods for the arrival of the relicts in Victoria Island are discussed.																									1962	19	6					1105	1120		10.1139/f62-073	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f62-073													WOS:A1962WV54000011

Euphorbiaceae: Acalyphoideae fossils from early Miocene New Zealand: Mallotus-Macaranga leaves, fruits, and inflorescence with in situ Nyssapollenites endobalteus pollen	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												An early Miocene (ca. 23 Ma) flora from the Foulden Maar diatomite deposit. Otago, southern New Zealand contains numerous organically-preserved fossil leaf compressions, flowers and fruits. A fossilised male partial lax inflorescence carrying in situ pollen of the type Nyssapollenites endobalteus (McIntyre) Kemp & Harris is assigned to Euphorbiaceae. subfamily Acalyphoideae, tribe Acalypheae. Leaves from the same site are referred to the Mallotus-Macaranga clade (Euphorbiaceae: Acalyphoideae) on the basis of leaf architecture and epidermal features and described as Malloranga fouldenensis gen. et sp. nov. In addition, euphorbiaceous trilobed capsular fruits are assigned to the form genus Euphorbiotheca as E. mallotoides sp. nov. and an immature infructescence is also described. The inflorescence, pollen, leaves and fruits blew or fell into a small enclosed maar lake and must have been derived from trees or shrubs growing around the lake margin. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

An important source of atmospheric methane is the methane generated in organic-rich sediments underlying surface water bodies, including lakes, wetlands, and the ocean. The fraction of the methane that reaches the atmosphere depends critically on the mode and spatiotemporal characteristics of free-gas venting from the underlying sediments. Here we propose that methane transport in lake sediments is controlled by dynamic conduits, which dilate and release gas as the falling hydrostatic pressure reduces the effective stress below the tensile strength of the sediments. We test our model against a four-month record of hydrostatic load and methane flux in Upper Mystic Lake, Mass., USA, and show that it captures the complex episodicity of methane ebullition. Our quantitative conceptualization opens the door to integrated modeling of methane transport to constrain global methane release from lakes and other shallow-water, organic-rich sediment systems, and to assess its climate feedbacks.

Average surface temperatures in the Eurasian watermilfoil beds were significantly elevated in two of the five years, while bottom temperatures were significantly depressed each year. Dissolved oxygen concentrations in surface layers of the bed were elevated by at least 1 mg L-1 during roughly 30-40% of site-date visits, while DOs in the bottom layers were depressed on the average more than 50% of monitoring visits. Both depressed DOs and low DOs (< 3.0 mg L (-1)) in bottom layers were positively correlated with average annual air temperatures but were not directly related to variations in milfoil biomass. Dissolved oxygen and temperature appeared to be most severely impacted at shallow, densely vegetated sites close to shore.																			0270-5060					DEC	2000	15	4					497	503		10.1080/02705060.2000.9663772	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2000.9663772													WOS:000165431900009
J	Lindgren, PMF; Sullivan, TP				Lindgren, Pontus M. F.; Sullivan, Thomas P.			Influence of repeated fertilization on forage production for native mammalian herbivores in young lodgepole pine forests	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Stand thinning and fertilization are silvicultural practices designed to enhance wood and biomass production. Applications of nitrogen-based fertilizers make nutrients potentially available to all trees, plants, and wildlife in a given forest ecosystem, and therefore may affect productivity of forage plants for native mammalian herbivores. Species associated with areas of forest fertilization in temperate and boreal zones of North America include mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), elk (Cervus elaphus), moose (Alces aloes), and woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus), snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), and several species of voles. Impacts of fertilization on forest plant species may have important consequences for the nutrition, cover, and consequent survival of these herbivores, particularly in winter. This study tested the hypothesis (H-1) that large-scale repeated fertilization, up to 20 years after the onset of treatments, would enhance the biomass production of forage plants, particularly grass, forb, shrub and tree species for native mammalian herbivores. A secondary hypothesis (H-2) predicted that mosses and terrestrial lichens would decline as part of the ground vegetation in fertilized stands. Study areas were located in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) stands near Summerland, Kelowna, and Williams Lake in south-central British Columbia, Canada. Each study area had eight replicate stands: four unfertilized, and four fertilized five times at 2-year intervals. Mean biomass of total grasses responded dramatically starting in the first year after fertilization. Total forbs and herbs also followed this pattern, although not to a significant degree until after the second and third applications of fertilizer. All of the dominant grasses and forbs serve as summer forage for mule deer, moose, elk, and woodland caribou. Fireweed (Epilobium angustifoliwn), a preferred forage for mule deer, increased in fertilized stands. Grasses and dominant herbs in fertilized stands provide excellent forage and cover habitat for snowshoe hares and Microtus voles. Mean biomass of total shrubs was not affected by fertilization. However, saskatoon berry (Amelanchier alnifolio), prickly rose (Rosa acicularis), and red raspberry (Rubus idaeus) increased significantly in biomass in fertilized stands. Willow (Salix spp.) also increased in biomass, but was variable across treatment stands. Snowshoe hares respond favourably to enhanced shrub growth for food and cover in fertilized stands. All of these shrubs are readily eaten by deer, moose, and elk, and their structural attributes provide security and thermal cover. Mean biomass of understory Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) responded positively to fertilization, but sub alpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) and the three deciduous tree species did not. Dwarf shrubs such as kinnikinnick (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi), twinflower (Linnaea borealis), and dwarf blueberry (Vacciniwn caespitosum) declined in fertilized stands. Thus, H-1 was partially supported for some species. Increasing cover of grasses and nitrophilous herbs, and canopy cover from rapidly growing crop trees, in fertilized stands may have contributed to the decline of some dwarf shrubs. Mean crown volume index of total mosses and terrestrial lichens declined significantly in fertilized stands, thereby supporting H-2. Mean biomass of total grasses (increase), R. acicularis (increase), and V. caespitosum (decline) were significantly affected after one application of fertilizer. Repeated applications of fertilizer may enhance biomass of some additional forage forbs and shrubs, but reduce biomass of some dwarf shrubs, mosses, and lichens.																			0378-1127	1872-7042				MAY 15	2018	417						265	280		10.1016/j.foreco.2018.03.002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2018.03.002													WOS:000430778900023

Direct measurements of air-sea CO2 exchange over a coral reef	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Quantification of CO2 exchange with the atmosphere over coral reefs has relied on microscale measurements of pCO(2) gradients across the air-sea interfacial boundary; shipboard measurements of air-sea CO2 exchange over adjacent ocean inferred to represent over reef processes or ecosystem productivity modeling. Here we present by way of case study the first direct measurements of air-sea CO2 exchange over a coral reef made using the eddy covariance method. Research was conducted during the summer monsoon over a lagoonal platform reef in the southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Results show the reef flat to be a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere of similar magnitude as coastal lakes, while adjacent shallow and deep lagoons were net sinks as was the surrounding ocean. This heterogeneity in CO2 exchange with the atmosphere confirms need for spatially representative direct measurements of CO2 over coral reefs to accurately quantify their role in atmospheric carbon budgets.

Open Access Quantitative reconstruction of precipitation changes on the NE Tibetan Plateau since the Last Glacial Maximum - extending the concept of pollen source area to pollen-based climate reconstructions from large lakes	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Pollen records from large lakes have been used for quantitative palaeoclimate reconstruction, but the influences that lake size (as a result of species-specific variations in pollen dispersal patterns that smaller pollen grains are more easily transported to lake centre) and taphonomy have on these climatic signals have not previously been systematically investigated. We introduce the concept of pollen source area to pollen-based climate calibration using the north-eastern Tibetan Plateau as our study area. We present a pollen data set collected from large lakes in the arid to semi-arid region of central Asia. The influences that lake size and the inferred pollen source areas have on pollen compositions have been investigated through comparisons with pollen assemblages in neighbouring lakes of various sizes. Modern pollen samples collected from different parts of Lake Donggi Cona (in the north-eastern part of the Tibetan Plateau) reveal variations in pollen assemblages within this large lake, which are interpreted in terms of the species-specific dispersal and depositional patterns for different types of pollen, and in terms of fluvial input components. We have estimated the pollen source area for each lake individually and used this information to infer modern climate data with which to then develop a modern calibration data set, using both the multivariate regression tree (MRT) and weighted-averaging partial least squares (WA-PLS) approaches. Fossil pollen data from Lake Donggi Cona have been used to reconstruct the climate history of the north-eastern part of the Tibetan Plateau since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The meanannual precipitation was quantitatively reconstructed using WA-PLS: extremely dry conditions are found to have dominated the LGM, with annual precipitation of around 100 mm, which is only 32% of present-day precipitation. A gradually increasing trend in moisture conditions during the Late Glacial is terminated by an abrupt reversion to a dry phase that lasts for about 1000 yr and coincides with "Heinrich event 1" in the North Atlantic region. Subsequent periods corresponding to the Bolling/Allerod interstadial, with annual precipitation (P-ann) of about 350 mm, and the Younger Dryas event (about 270 mm P-ann) are followed by moist conditions in the early Holocene, with annual precipitation of up to 400 mm. A drier trend after 9 cal. ka BP is followed by a second wet phase in the middle Holocene, lasting until 4.5 cal. ka BP. Relatively steady conditions with only slight fluctuations then dominate the late Holocene, resulting in the present climatic conditions. The climate changes since the LGM have been primarily driven by deglaciation and fluctuations in the intensity of the Asian summer monsoon that resulted from changes in the Northern Hemisphere summer solar insolation, as well as from changes in the North Atlantic climate through variations in the circulation patterns and intensity of the westerlies.					; Shumilovskikh, Lyudmila/P-2493-2015; Birks, John/C-3103-2008; Boehner, Juergen/I-9844-2014; Mischke, Steffen/L-9300-2015; Birks, H.

During two winter seasons (2020 and 2021), an optical fibre was deployed over one of the frozen Roberts Mountain lakes (at 2400 m a.s.l) near Grenoble (France) and we measured both the continuous ambient seismic noise as well as signals generated by active sources (hammer), with a DAS interrogator. Following a Bayesian scheme, we inverted the dispersion curves of longitudinal and flexural guided waves retrieved from the analysis of active shot gathers and obtained Young's modulus E = 3.4 +/- 0.1 GPa and ice thickness h = 47 +/- 1 cm from the second-year data. The ice thickness was consistent with field measurements. Field observations of porous and/or fracture ice may explain the relatively low effective Young's modulus (relative to pure ice), which may also be affected by a snow layer not included in the model. The drastic improvements in the inversion results between the two years are related to better coupling conditions (drone deployment before early freezing), more appropriate acquisition parameters (2 m gauge length), and the upper snow layers (less thick and less heterogeneous in the second year). Moreover, we were able to use the non-dispersive low-frequency noise associated with gravity waves to estimate the lake depth H = 5 m which is compatible with independent observations. The use of DAS to record guided seismic waves could then appear as a relevant tool for monitoring environments like floating ice shelves and sea ice.

Bequest of the Norseman-The Potential for Agricultural Intensification and Expansion in Southern Greenland under Climate Change	LAND												The increase of summer temperatures and a prolonged growing season increase the potential for agricultural land use for subarctic agriculture. Nevertheless, land use at borderline ecotones is influenced by more factors than temperature and the length of the growing season, for example soil quality, as the increasing lengths of dry periods during vegetation season can diminish land use potential. Hence, this study focuses on the quality of the soil resource as possible limiting factor for land use intensification in southern Greenland. Physical and chemical soil properties of cultivated grasslands, reference sites and semi-natural birch and grassland sites were examined to develop a soil quality index and to identify the suitability of soils for a sustainable intensification and expansion of the agriculture. The study revealed that soils in the study area are generally characterized by a low effective cation exchange capacity (CECeff) (3.7 +/- 5.0 meq 100 g(-1)), low pH CaCl2 (4.6 +/- 0.4) and low clay and silt content (3.0 +/- 1.0% and 38.2 +/- 4.7%, respectively). Due to the high amount of coarse fraction (59.1 +/- 5.8%) and the low amount of soil nutrients, an increasing threat of dry spells for soils and yield could be identified. Further, future land use intensification and expansion bears a high risk for concomitant effects, namely further soil acidification, nutrient leaching and soil degradation processes. However, results of the soil quality index also indicate that sites which were already used by the Norseman (980s-1450) show the best suitability for agricultural use. Thus, these areas offer a possibility to expand agricultural land use in southern Greenland.

Mercury may occur at elevated concentrations adjacent to industrial sources, such as coal-fired power plants, or in remote environments and newly filled water bodies. Mercury tissue concentrations were determined for a sample of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) from Crystal Reservoir, Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge, Nye County, Nevada. This investigation was triggered by (1) the presence of several conditions in soil and water that facilitate mercury bioaccumulation, (2) previous investigations that detected mercury in source springs, and (3) the presence of game fish and endangered pupfish within the reservoir. Mercury concentrations were significantly correlated with both fish mass and condition, but were lower than national human health and safety standards. It is possible that high pH and salinity inhibited methylation and subsequent bioaccumulation; however, additional studies are needed to determine causation of the low concentration in fish tissue compared with ambient conditions.																			0090-4341					APR	2011	60	3					496	500		10.1007/s00244-010-9565-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-010-9565-7								20602096					WOS:000291979500013
J	Uchman, A; Kazakauskas, V; Gaigalas, A				Uchman, Alfred; Kazakauskas, Vaidotas; Gaigalas, Algirdas			Trace fossils from Late Pleistocene varved lacustrine sediments in eastern Lithuania	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Trace fossils Cochlichnus anguineus, Glaciichnium liebegastensis, Gordia carickensis (new combination, youngest occurrence), Gordia isp., Warvichnium ulbrichi, cf. Warvichnium isp. have been found in varved sediments of a small proglacial lake (17-16 kyr BP) in East Lithuania. They occur mostly in summer and transitional laminae along bunches of discrete microlaminae. Vertical reworking is absent. Horizontal distribution of trace fossils along microlaminae studied in one varved package points to a patchy distribution of trace fossils, resulting from a patchy distribution of food. Locally C. anguineus dominates and commonly this is the only trace fossil. Its co-occurrence with G. liebegastensis is distinctly rarer than with other ichnotaxa, probably due to a competition between their tracemakers. The trace fossil assemblage can be ascribed to the Mermia ichnofacies, in which the Glaciichnium ichnocoenosis (arthropod trackways dominate) and Cochlichnus ichnocoenosis (grazing traces dominate) can be distinguished as the end members. Replacement of the Glaciichnium ichnocoenosis by the Cochlichnus ichnocoenosis can be interpreted as shallowing of hypolimnion and degrading ecological conditions. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Environmental conditions responsible for the morphogenesis and evolution of the site (from a shallow periglacial lake to an alkaline fen) were reconstructed. A detailed geological survey in combination with the analysis of Cladocera assemblages revealed the presence of numerous palaeodepressions under the plain covered today by the alkaline fen, which were initially small shallow lakes with a well-developed phytolittoral zone. Geochemical data and the analysis of stable O and C isotopes indicated that these lakes were supplied by ascending waters. Karstic phenomena under periglacial conditions, including subsidence at the bottom of biogenic accumulation basins, played an important role in the transformation of this site.

J	Li, XH; Hu, Q				Li, Xianghu; Hu, Qi			Spatiotemporal Changes in Extreme Precipitation and Its Dependence on Topography over the Poyang Lake Basin, China	ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY												Spatiotemporal changes in extreme precipitation at local scales in the context of climate warming are overwhelmingly important for prevention and mitigation of water-related disasters and also provide critical information for effective water resources management. In this study, the variability and trends of extreme precipitation in both time and space in the Poyang Lake basin over the period of 1960-2012 are analyzed. Also, changes in precipitation extremes with topography are investigated, and possible causes are briefly discussed. The results show that extreme precipitation over the Poyang Lake basin is intensified during the last 50years, especially the increasing trends are more significant before the end of the 1990s. Moreover, high contribution rates of extreme precipitation to the total rainfall (40-60%) indicated that extreme precipitation plays an important role to the total water resources in this area. The precipitation extremes also exhibited a significant spatial dependence in the basin. The northeastern and eastern areas are exposed to high risk of flood disaster with the higher frequency of extreme precipitation events. In addition, the distribution of precipitation extremes had a clear dependence on elevation, and the topography is an important factor affecting the variability of extreme precipitation over the Poyang Lake basin.

Use of an unmanned aerial vehicle (drone) to survey Nile crocodile populations: A case study at Lake Nyamithi, Ndumo game reserve, South Africa	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Observer bias and inexperience are challenging aspects of crocodile survey methods for determining population numbers and structure. Aerial surveys with either a helicopter or a fixed winged aircraft are generally preferred methods to ground surveys; however, the high cost of the former is a limiting factor. Recently unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones have been proposed for surveys because of their potential of improving over traditional techniques of wildlife monitoring and as they have relatively lower costs. We investigated of the suitability of a UAV to determine numbers and structure of the Nile crocodile, Crocodylus niloticus, population during winter at Lake Nyamithi, Ndumo Game Reserve in South Africa. We used the UAV for eight flights covering 132 ha. We also conducted a diurnal ground survey of crocodiles for comparison. Using the UAV, 287 crocodiles were identified and body length measured accurately for size class allocation whereas only 211 crocodiles were counted in the diurnal ground survey. Consequently, the UAV aerial survey recorded 26% more crocodiles. The potential of using UAVs to estimate crocodile population size and measure the total length (TL) of individuals accurately and precisely at a relatively low cost should improve management actions, enable monitoring of the crocodile populations annually and importantly avoid observer bias. Implications of this may facilitate improved crocodilian survey techniques.

Pikas initially spread south along cordilleran dispersal corridors during a pre-Wisconsin glacial stage, and were fragmented into isolated montane refugia during a subsequent interglacial. Range re-expansion during the Wisconsin allowed secondary contact of genetic units, while montane glaciers, pluvial lakes, and glacial lakes limited secondary contact in some areas. Low genetic variation in all examined populations of O. princeps is due to: the metapopulation structure of pikas, dictated by the fragmented nature of a narrowly defined habitat and maintained by low vagility and high philopatry; accelerated loss in small or isolated habitat patches; accelerated loss in summer-drought regions; and, in the Cascade Range genetic unit, derivation of current populations from a genetically depau-perate source population.																			0022-2372					MAY	1995	76	2					302	321		10.2307/1382343	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1382343													WOS:A1995QZ50200003

Fish were sampled toward the end of their annual breeding season, at a time when the host population consisted of 2 cohorts, i.e., young-of-the-year (0+) and mature adults (I Prevalence of infection was 94%, Willi a mean intensity of 8.9 +/- 9.6; neither measure varied significantly Willi host length or between cohorts (P > 0.05). At necropsy. parasites were characterized as juveniles that included postoncomiracidia (immature, Willi a ventrally directed haptor) as well as developing protandrous males (body with a near-complete haptor and Willi little or no pigmented vitellaria), or as adults (Willi testis, ovarium, darkened vitellaria, and occasionally bearing a tanned egg). The proportion Of juvenile to adult parasites differed significantly between cohorts (P < 0.05), with 0+ fish infected Willi a mixture of juveniles and adults. whereas 1+ fish had almost exclusively adult parasites. Since adult (1+) brook stickleback typically die after spawning, the increased frequency Of juvenile parasites exploiting juvenile hosts may represent an evolutionary adaptation, maximizing the chances of parasites infecting hosts that will enter winter. It is Suspected that 0+ fish can be infected in the nest within 2 wk of hatching and persist by effectively infecting new host recruits when they are sympatric with their parents.																			0022-3395					AUG	2008	94	4					973	975		10.1645/GE-1495.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1645/GE-1495.1								18576820					WOS:000258938400037

B.; Gilli, Adrian; Stamm, Christian; Alewell, Christine			Plants or bacteria? 130 years of mixed imprints in Lake Baldegg sediments (Switzerland), as revealed by compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) and biomarker analysis	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Soil erosion and associated sediment transfer are among the major causes of aquatic ecosystem and surface water quality impairment. Through land use and agricultural practices, human activities modify the soil erosive risk and the catchment connectivity, becoming a key factor of sediment dynamics. Hence, restoration and management plans of water bodies can only be efficient if the sediment sources and the proportion attributable to different land uses are identified. According to this aim, we applied two approaches, namely compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) of long-chain fatty acids (FAs) and triterpenoid biomarker analysis, to a eutrophic lake, Lake Baldegg, and its agriculturally used catchment (Switzerland). Soils reflecting the five main land uses of the catchment (arable lands, temporary and permanent grasslands, mixed forests, orchards) were subjected to CSIA. The compound-specific stable isotope delta C-13 signatures clearly discriminate between potential grasslands (permanent and temporary) and forest sources. Signatures of agricultural land and orchards fall in between. The soil signal was compared to the isotopic signature of a lake sediment sequence covering ca. 130 years (before 1885 to 2009). The recent lake samples (1940 to 2009, with the exception of 1964 to 1972) fall into the soil isotopic signature polygon and indicate an important contribution of the forests, which might be explained by (1) the location of the forests on steep slopes, resulting in a higher connectivity of the forests to the lake, and/or (2) potential direct inputs of trees and shrubs growing along the rivers feeding the lake and around the lake. However, the lake sediment samples older than 1940 lie outside the source soils' polygon, as a result of FA contribution from a not yet identified source, most likely produced by an in situ aquatic source, either algae, bacteria or other microorganisms or an ex-site historic source from wetland soils and plants (e.g. Sphagnum species). Despite the overprint of the yet unknown source on the historic isotopic signal of the lake sediments, land use and catchment history are clearly reflected in the CSIA results, with isotopic shifts being synchronous with changes in the catchment, land use and eutrophication history. The investigated highly specific biomarkers were not detected in the lake sediment, even though they were present in the soils. However, two trimethyltetrahydrochrysenes (TTHCs), natural diagenetic products of pentacyclic triterpenoids, were found in the lake sediments. Their origin is attributed to the in situ microbial degradation of some of the triterpenoids. While the need to apportion sediment sources is especially crucial in eutrophic systems, our study stresses the importance of exercising caution with CSIA and triterpenoid biomarkers in such environments, where the active metabolism of bacteria might mask the original terrestrial isotopic signals.

J	Pálffy, K; Vörös, L				Palffy, Karoly; Voros, Lajos			Phytoplankton functional composition shows higher seasonal variability in a large shallow lake after a eutrophic past	ECOSPHERE												Eutrophication is a well-known problem of global proportions with some easily recognizable and potentially harmful effects on aquatic habitats, but our knowledge on the underlying associated changes in ecosystem functioning is rather limited. Relevant studies suggest that seasonal variability in the functional composition of phytoplankton shows an increase as eutrophication progresses. The aim of the present study was to test this hypothesis through the assessment of long-term changes in the functional diversity and composition of phytoplankton in a large shallow lake situated in Central Europe with a history of dramatic changes in trophic state. Contrary to our expectations, results have shown that the maximum range of compositional variability had a significant negative correlation with the summer biomass maxima. On the other hand, average seasonal variability measured as annual beta diversity exhibited an increasing trend throughout the years from the period of early eutrophication to the recent period of reoligotrophication, seemingly following a decline in functional richness and a long-term rise in annual mean water temperature. The enhanced variability in phytoplankton succession implies that all the ecosystem processes connected to the phytoplankton follow more complex seasonal dynamics. Besides changing community structure, trophic state also seems to be an important factor in setting the limits to compositional changes during the annual cycle, whereas long-term warming is likely to enhance instability in the phytoplankton. The trajectories of these two factors and the changes in seasonal succession indicate a lake in transition, urging more in-depth research efforts to understand the impact of climate change on this specific ecosystem, and raise the question of whether the observed changes can also occur in other similar aquatic systems.					; Palffy, Karoly/KWU-8678-2024	Palffy, Karoly/0000-0003-2015-7972; 													2150-8925					MAY	2019	10	5							e02684	10.1002/ecs2.2684	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.2684													WOS:000474063600007

Collapse of a fish population after exposure to a synthetic estrogen	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Municipal wastewaters are a complex mixture containing estrogens and estrogen mimics that are known to affect the reproductive health of wild fishes. Male fishes downstream of some wastewater out falls produce vitellogenin (VTG) (a protein normally synthesized by females during oocyte maturation) and early-stage eggs in their testes, and this feminization has been attributed to the presence of estrogenic substances such as natural estrogens [estrone or 17 beta-estradiol (E2)], the synthetic estrogen used in birth-control pills [17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2)], or weaker estrogen mimics such as nonylphenol in the water. Despite widespread evidence that male fishes are being feminized, it is not known whether these low-level, chronic exposures adversely impact the sustainability of wild populations. We conducted a 7-year, wholelake experiment at the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) in northwestern Ontario, Canada, and showed that chronic exposure of fathead minnow (Pimephalespromelas) to low concentrations (5-6 ng-L-1) of the potent 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol led to feminization of males through the production of vitellogenin mRNA and protein, impacts on gonadal development as evidenced by intersex in males and altered oogenesis in females, and, ultimately, a near extinction of this species from the lake. Our observations demonstrate that the concentrations of estrogens and their mimics observed in freshwaters can impact the sustainability of wild fish populations.

Chemical soil surveys at the Bremer Site (Dakota county, Minnesota, USA): Measuring phosphorous content of sediment by portable XRF and ICP-OES	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE												The Bremer Site lies along the shores of Spring Lake in southeastern Minnesota, and excavations in the 1950s uncovered evidence of Woodland and Mississippian occupation phases. In 2011, a new program of systematic survey and excavation began to better understand cultural patterning and diachronic changes at the Bremer Site. The investigations came to include microarcheaological methods, including sediment micromorphology and soil chemistry. No element has received more archaeological attention than P, which can reflect human and animal waste, organic refuse, burials, and ash. There has been interest in integrating soil chemistry into the workflow of fieldwork and in the potential of portable analytical instruments to yield data within the timeframe of an excavation season. The last few years have seen the rise and proliferation of portable XRF (pXRF) instruments in archaeological studies. The newest generation of pXRF instruments is able to quantify P at low concentrations, and our focus here is developing effective methods to do so in archaeological soils and sediments. Using sediments from the Bremer Site, we evaluate two preparation techniques in order to find which one best balances analytical quality and preparation time. To analyze as many specimens as possible during an excavation season, it is desirable to identify adequate preparation methods as well as the smallest number of analyses needed to attain reasonable confidence levels. Regarding repeatability, we show that, to attain P values with a standard error better than 10% or 20% of the mean, one or two analyses per specimen are sufficient in a majority of cases. Regarding reproducibility, we compare the pXRF data to two independent ICP-OES datasets. Ultimately, these tests aid in establishing methods that enable archaeologically significant pXRF analyses of soil P concentrations, even when working far from an analytical laboratory.

The pyrosequencing approach unveiled a much more extensive small-eukaryotic diversity (991 OTUs) than has been described previously. The vast majority of the diversity described was represented by rare OTUs (0.01% of reads) belonging primarily to Cryptomycota, Dikarya and photosynthetic organisms, which were never detected as abundant in any of the samples. The small eukaryote community was characterized by a continual and important reassembly. These rearrangements involved the 20 core taxa' (1% of reads), and, were essentially due to a handful of OTUs that were detected in intermediate abundance (0.01-1% of reads) and sporadically in dominant taxa. Putative bacterivorous (Ciliophora and Cercozoa) as well as parasitic and saprotrophic taxa (Perkinsozoa and Cryptomycota) were involved in these changes of diversity. A putative infection of microalgae by a lacustrine perkinsozoan was also reported for the first time in this study. Open questions regarding both the patterns that govern the rapid small eukaryote reassemblies and the possible biogeography of these organisms arise from this study.

J	Nettleton, S; Green, J				Nettleton, Sarah; Green, Judith			Thinking about changing mobility practices: how a social practice approach can help	SOCIOLOGY OF HEALTH & ILLNESS												Policy efforts directed at encouraging physical activity have had minimal success to date. Drawing on Bourdieu's theory of practice, we suggest that a social practice framing might provide useful ways of thinking about why and how some practices do and could change. This article takes three case studies of transformations in mobility practices to explore conditions of possibility for change, using a secondary analysis of qualitative data from studies on cycling in London and fell running in the English Lake District. Three modes of transformation: unthinkable, thwarted and resisted, are rooted in differential interrelationships of field, habitus and doxa in these contrasting cases. We suggest that the notion of tacit, practical knowledge is more useful to understanding why change is thinkable or unthinkable than participants' reasoned accounts of their practice; that where new social fields are available that are congruent with habitus, change is possible and that where field and habitus are tightly aligned, the conditions of possibility for change are reduced. Efforts directed at changing practice might usefully focus not on behaviour or environments but on identifying the social fields in which mobility practices are likely to be malleable. The sociology of public health needs to focus less on health behaviour and more on social practice.

Direct and interactive effects of climate, meteorology, river hydrology, and lake characteristics on water quality in productive lakes of the Canadian Prairies	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Aquatic ecosystems are subject to multiple interacting stressors that obscure regulatory mechanisms and reduce the effectiveness of management strategies. Here we estimate the unique and interactive effects of continental climate systems, regional meteorology, river hydrology, and internal lake characteristics on patterns of landscape-scale water quality in six productive lakes within a 52 000 km(2) catchment. We quantify variation in mean summer and monthly algal abundance, surface bloom intensity, water clarity, and density of potentially toxic cyanobacteria during 16 years on the Canadian Prairies. Internal lake characteristics best predicted overall water quality change, while climate systems, regional weather, and river hydrology characterized indirect pathways that influenced physicochemical environments. Scenario analysis of future environmental change predicted that atmospheric warming (3-5 degrees C) will have the strongest effect on water quality in these productive lakes, but unexpectedly predicted that even severe industrial water extraction (1% of inflow) will have negligible effects on transparency or algal abundance. Instead, nutrient management represents the only practical means to sustain water quality, although atmospheric and lake warming may override re-oligotrophication of eutrophied sites in future decades.					; Leavitt, Peter/A-1048-2013	Sharma, Sapna/0000-0003-4571-2768; Leavitt, Peter/0000-0001-9805-9307													0706-652X	1205-7533				JAN	2018	75	1					47	59		10.1139/cjfas-2016-0520	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2016-0520													WOS:000419137900005
J	Tenagashaw, DY; Tamirat, DM				Tenagashaw, Diress Yigezu; Tamirat, Dawit Munye			Spatial and Temporal Variations of the Physicochemical Parameters of the Water Quality of Lake Basaka, Oromia Region, Ethiopia	WATER CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING												The water quality of Lake Basaka is currently influenced by natural and anthropogenic activities. The objective of this study was to examine the spatial and temporal variations in physicochemical water quality parameters in Lake Basaka. The water sample was collected in the dry and wet seasons for the verification of some selected parameters. Laboratory analysis was performed at the Abbay Basin Development Authority Water and Wastewater Laboratory. Statistical analysis of physicochemical parameters was used in the dry and rainy seasons during the year 2021. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to measure the significant spatio-temporal variation of the physicochemical parameters of water quality. The ANOVA results indicated that the physicochemical indicators of water quality have a significant variation with time and space. Spatial maps were also generated using the GIS (interpolation) tool to understand the spatial distribution of each water quality indicator in Lake Basaka. The result shows a high spatial variation of PH, EC, Na, F, and bicarbonate in the Abadir and Addis Ababa roadside. The temporal variation of the quality of Lake Basaka shows a decreasing trend due to the dilution of freshwater (runoff or hot springs) towards Lake Basaka. The water quality index (WQI) was used to assess the general state of the water quality of the lake for irrigation purposes. Lake Basaka's water quality index is 103.97, indicating poor water quality in the lake. In general, this document revealed that the water status of Lake Basaka is currently not suitable for any purpose due to poor quality, as a result, the expansion of the lake becomes a great challenge for the city of Metahara and the sugar plantation of Metahara from time to time.

RSL rose across low-lying coastal areas in the early Holocene, inundating isolation basins in the Sleat peninsula, and then fell back in the early-middle Holocene before a fluctuating rise occurred later in the middle and late Holocene. A short-lived marine inundation at one site may have been caused by an episode of rapid RSL rise after the discharge of Lakes Agassiz-Ojibway in North America and/or the Holocene Storegga Slide tsunami, generated by submarine landsliding off South-West Norway. The empirical evidence for RSL change on Skye is compared with a recent shoreline-based glacio-isostatic adjustment model, which includes Skye, showing altitudes for the Holocene Storegga Slide tsunami, Main Postglacial, Blairdrummond and Wigtown shorelines in the area. The empirical evidence is shown to be in accord with the altitudes predicted by the model.																			1470-2541	1751-665X				JAN 2	2016	132	1					42	65		10.1080/14702541.2015.1051102	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14702541.2015.1051102													WOS:000365666100003

Sediment P inactivation with Al salts has been shown to provide long-term (5-14 years) control of sediment P release; long-term effectiveness of Fe and Ca salts has not been reported. Al toxicity problems are possible unless pH is maintained in the 6-8 range. Vertical transport of hypolimnetic P is unlikely in small, deep, dimictic lakes (Z square-root A0 > 8BAR), and effectiveness of P inactivation in lowering their mid-summer epilimnetic P has not been demonstrated. To date, P inactivation has been found to be most effective in improving trophic state in shallow, softwater, polymictic lakes where control of sediment P release affects the entire water column. Abatement of external loading, where necessary, is essential for a successful P inactivation treatment.

Trends in water clarity of the lower Great Lakes from remotely sensed aquatic color	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Satellite observations of aquatic colour enable environmental monitoring of the Great Lakes at spatial and temporal scales not obtainable through ground-based monitoring. By merging data from the Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS) and the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), monthly binned images of water-leaving radiance over the Great Lakes have been produced for the periods 1979-1985 and 1998-2006. This time-series can be interpreted in terms of changes in water clarity, showing seasonal and inter-annual variability of bright-water episodes such as phytoplankton blooms, re-suspension of bottom sediments, and whiting events. Variations in Secchi disk depth over Lakes Erie and Ontario are predicted using empirical relationships from coincident measurements of water transparency and remotely-sensed water-leaving radiance. Satellite observations document the extent to which the water clarity of the lower Great Lakes has changed over the last three decades in response to significant events including the invasion of zebra mussels. Results confirm dramatic reductions in Lake Ontario turbidity in the years following mussel colonization, with a doubling of estimated Secchi depths. Evidence confirms a reduction in the frequency/intensity of whiting events in agreement with suggestions of the role of calcium uptake by mussels on lake water clarity. Increased spring-time water clarity in the eastern basin of Lake Erie also corroborates previous observations in the region. Despite historical reports Of localised increases in transparency in the western basin immediately following the mussel invasion, image analysis shows a significant increase in turbidity between the two study periods, in agreement with more recent reports of longer term trends in water clarity. Through its capacity to provide regular and readily interpretable synoptic view of regions undergoing significant environmental change, this work illustrates the value of remotely sensing water colour to water clarity monitoring in the lower Great Lakes.																			0380-1330					DEC	2007	33	4					828	841		10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[828:TIWCOT]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[828:TIWCOT]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000252473500009

YouTube as a crowd-generated water level archive	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												In view of the substantial costs associated with classic monitoring networks, participatory data collection methods can be deemed a promising option to obtain complementary data. An emerging trend in this field is social media mining, i.e., harvesting of pre-existing, crowd-generated data from social media. Although this approach is participatory in a broader sense, the users are mostly not aware of their participation in research. Inspired by this novel development, we demonstrate in this study that it is possible to derive a water level time series from the analysis of multiple YouTube videos. As an example, we studied the recent water level rise in Dahl Hith, a Saudi Arabian cave. To do so, we screened 16 YouTube videos of the cave for suitable reference points (e.g., cave graffiti). Then, we visually estimated the distances between these points and the water level and traced their changes over time. To bridge YouTube hiatuses, we considered own photos taken during two site visits. For the time period 20132014, we estimate a rise of 9.5 m. The fact that this rise occurred at a somewhat constant rate of roughly 0.4 m per month points towards a new and permanent water source, possibly two nearby lakes formed from treated sewage effluent. An anomaly in the rising rate is noted for autumn 2013 (1.3 m per month). As this increased pace coincides with a cluster of rain events, we deem rapid groundwater recharge along preferential flow paths a likely cause. Despite the sacrifice in precision, we believe that YouTube harvesting may represent a viable option to gather historical water levels in data-scarce settings and that it could be adapted to other environments (e.g., flood extents). In certain areas, it might provide an additional tool for the monitoring toolbox, thereby possibly delivering hydrological data for water resources management. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Stentor pyriformis represents a green, short, and fat Stentor, but it is a little-known species. We investigated 124 ponds and wetlands in Japan and confirmed the presence of S. pyriformis at 23 locations. All these ponds were noticeably oligotrophic. With the improvement of oligotrophic culture conditions, we succeeded in long-term cultivation of three strains of S. pyriformis. The cytoplasm of S. piriformis contains a large number of 1-3 mu m refractive granules that turn brown by Lugol's staining. The granules also show a typical Maltese-cross pattern by polarization microscopy, strongly suggesting that the granules are made of amylopectin-rich starch. By analyzing the algal rDNA, it was found that all S. pyriformis symbionts investigated in this study were Chlorella variabilis. This species is known as the symbiont of Paramecium bursaria and is physiologically specialized for endosymbiosis. Genetic discrepancies between C. variabilis of S. pyriformis and P. bursaria may indicate that algal sharing was an old incident. Having symbiotic algae and storing carbohydrate granules in the cytoplasm is considered a powerful strategy for this ciliate to withstand oligotrophic and cold winter environments in highland bogs.

Several oscillatorialean genera (Lyngbya, Phormidium, Plectonema, and Leptolyngbya) have problematic phylo-genetic position and taxonomic state because of their heterogeneity and polyphyletic nature. To accurately resolve the phylogenetic relationship of some filamentous species (Nodosilinea bijugata, Phormidium molle, Phormidium papyraceum), we have performed phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene and the phycocyanin operon (PC-IGS) by using maximum-likelihood (ML) tree inference methods. These analyses were combined with morphological re-evaluation. Our phylogenetic analyses support the taxonomic separation of genus Nodosilinea from the polyphyletic genus Leptolyngbya. Investigated Nodosilinea strains always formed a coherent genetic cluster supported with a high bootstrap value. The molecular phylogeny confirmed also the monophyly of the Wilmottia group. In addition, data reveal that although P. papyraceum is morphologically similar to Wilmottia murrayi, this species is genetically distinct. Strains from the newly formed genus Phormidesmis and some Phormidium priestleyi strains were clustered in a separate clade different from the typical Phormidium species, but without strong bootstrap support.

Monthly and daily power spectra of the magnetic fields suggest a dynamic and seasonally varying source, with atypical geomagnetic activity in year 2000. Bounded influence NIT and GDS responses were obtained for periods ranging between 80 and 25,000s over selected monthly time segments. The responses at periods over 4000 s vary, suggesting source field effects. A frequency domain principal component (PC) method was applied to the array to investigate the spatial form of the source field variations. The PC analysis was tested with synthetic data from a regional 3D model with a uniform external source to study the sensitivity of the eigenvectors to conductivity structure, demonstrating a negligible influence with increasing penetration depth. We conclude that magnetic fields at periods near one half day are subject to a ID polarized source of relatively homogeneous morphology over the survey area during any month recorded, except for the summer month of July 2000 that had particularly high geomagnetic activity. In general, the source space approaches two polarizations at periods below one half day, with the dominant NS component seen quasi-homogeneous over the survey area at periods over 1000 s.

Nutrients and warming interact to force mountain lakes into unprecedented ecological states	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												While deposition of reactive nitrogen (N) in the twentieth century has been strongly linked to changes in diatom assemblages in high-elevation lakes, pronounced and contemporaneous changes in other algal groups suggest additional drivers. We explored the origin and magnitude of changes in two mountain lakes from the end of the Little Ice Age atca1850, toca2010, using lake sediments. We found dramatic changes in algal community abundance and composition. While diatoms remain the most abundant photosynthetic organisms, concentrations of diatom pigments decreased while pigments representing chlorophytes increased 200-300% sinceca1950 and total algal biomass more than doubled. Some algal changes beganca1900 but shifts in most sedimentary proxies acceleratedca1950 commensurate with many human-caused changes to the Earth System. In addition to N deposition, aeolian dust deposition may have contributed phosphorus. Strong increases in summer air and surface water temperatures since 1983 have direct and indirect consequences for high-elevation ecosystems. Such warming could have directly enhanced nutrient use and primary production. Indirect consequences of warming include enhanced leaching of nutrients from geologic and cryosphere sources, particularly as glaciers ablate. While we infer causal mechanisms, changes in primary producer communities appear to be without historical precedent and are commensurate with the post-1950 acceleration of global change.

J	Barboni, D				Barboni, Doris			Vegetation of Northern Tanzania during the Plio-Pleistocene: A synthesis of the paleobotanical evidences from Laetoli, Olduvai, and Peninj hominin sites	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												More than 40 years of scientific investigations of the hominin bearing Plio-Pleistocene sediments of northern Tanzania have provided a number of paleobotanical data, which, taken as a whole, provide today a way to investigate vegetation changes between 4 and 1 Ma, at a time when our early ancestors emerged. Here, I have integrated the data from all vegetation proxies obtained for the paleontological sites of Laetoli, Olduvai, and Peninj (i.e. macroscopic plant remains, pollen and phytolith assemblages, carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios measured on carbonates, and organic biomarkers). This important, yet discontinuous botanical record suggests some similarities between past and present-day vegetation at the regional scale: Afromontane forests with Olea, Podocarpus, Juniperus, Hagenia abyssinica in the highlands, and wooded grasslands with grasses and drought-adapted Acacia, Commiphora, Capparidaceae, and Chenopodiaceae and/or Amaranthaceae in the lowlands were present in the southern Serengeti Crater Highlands region since 4 Ma. Grasses of the C-4 photosynthetic type made their first appearance in the record at similar to 3.7 Ma, i.e. during the mid-Pliocene, similar to 700 ky before major pCO(2) and temperature decline. C-4 grasses became dominant in the vegetation soon after (similar to 3.66 Ma), probably in response to reduced precipitation. At similar to 2.6 Ma, phytolith and isotope indicate grassland with abundant C-4 xerophytic grasses that document strong aridity during the Intensification of Northern Hemisphere Glaciation period (similar to 2.7-2.5 Ma). After 2 Ma, the detailed and diverse record at Olduvai indicates complex vegetation patterns linked to oscillating precipitation, varying lake levels, and the presence of geological faults. Hence, despite low (basin-averaged) reconstructed paleo-precipitation amounts of similar to 250-700 mm/y, C-4-grasslands, closed woodlands, wetlands, and palm-groves co-occurred on short spatial scales near saline Lake Olduvai. Freshwater wetlands and palm-rich woodlands occurred in highly localized areas on the lake margins, where aquifer barriers and/or outcrops caused by geologic faults allowed groundwater discharge. Botanical evidence of paleo-springs at Laetoli, Olduvai, and Peninj includes the marked presence of Typha (cattail) and Hyphaene (palm tree) in association with Acacia pollen grains, and (at Olduvai) abundant forest indicator phytoliths and organic and isotopic biomarkers. At Olduvai, freshwater wetlands were most developed when lake level and fluvial competence where low, i.e. during dry periods. When wet dry climate variability was extreme in East Africa (similar to 1.9-1.7 Ma), freshwater springs may therefore have offered a sustainable habitat (i.e. refuge) for several species, including hominins, and favored hominin and artifact concentration at these specific places, particularly during environmentally stressful times.

J	Nash, DJ				Nash, DJ			On the dry valleys of the Kalahari: Documentary evidence of environmental change in central southern Africa	GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL												Dry 'fossil' valleys (mekgacha) are an important landscape feature in the semi-arid to arid Kalahari Desert of central southern Africa. The majority of valleys do not contain flow, except in their headwater regions, but may contain pools of water on a seasonal basis. As a result, they are frequently mentioned in historical accounts of the region recorded by European travellers, and from these reports it is possible to assemble a picture of hydrological change. This paper describes the evidence for such change, for the period c.1750 until c.1910. Discussion mainly concerns the most frequently observed valleys, the Molopo and Kuruman, although Middle Kalahari systems are also considered. The picture which emerges is one of little change in Middle Kalahari systems. A decline in flow in the Kuruman since c.1750 is tentatively identified, pre-dating the period of permanent human settlement in this region. The river appears to have established its present regime after 1800. A previously unrecognized flood event in the Kuruman in 1820 is also identified. These hydrological changes are placed within the context of historical climate evidence from the southern Cape of South Africa and show dose correlation. This suggests that documentary evidence may be used to extend the climate record established for the southern African summer rainfall zone into the Kalahari.

A case study of resistivity and self-potential signatures of hydrothermal instabilities, Inferno Crater Lake, Waimangu, New Zealand	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Inferno Crater Lake, Waimangu, one of the largest hot springs in New Zealand, displays vigorous cyclic behavior in lake level and temperature. It provides a natural small-scale laboratory for investigating the geo-electrical signature of fluid flows. We measured self-potential and electrical resistivity to see whether the huge variations of fluid volume, approximately 60,000 m 3 during a mean cycle period of 40 days, could be detected. Electrical resistivity measurements revealed spectacular changes over time, with the medium becoming more conductive as the lake receded. This result is consistent with analog models, where the vapor phase is replaced by liquid at recession. The self-potential survey did not detect temporal changes related to fluid movements. This can be explained by the pH of the pore water (similar to 2.3), which is close to the point of zero charge of silica. Citation: Legaz, A., J. Vandemeulebrouck, A. Revil, A. Kemna, A. W. Hurst, R.

J	Brettum, P				Brettum, P			Changes in the volume and composition of phytoplankton after experimental acidification of a humic lake	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL					5th Nordic Symposium on Humic Substances in Soil and Water / HUMEX/HUMOR Project Seminar	JUN 06-08, 1995	UNIV LUND, LUND, SWEDEN		UNIV LUND			In connection with the HUMEX project carried out in Lake Skjervatjern, near Forde, in the western part of Norway, the effects of the experimental acidification on the phytoplankton volume and composition were investigated. The lake was divided into two basins by a thick plastic curtain. One of the basins, Basin A, and its entire catchment was acidified by a mixture of ammonium nitrate and sulphuric acid, while Basin B acted as a reference. The results of the phytoplankton analyses from both basins in the investigation period are presented. In Basin B, the control basin, the succession of the main groups of phytoplankton throughout the growth season remained almost identical until 1993. The results from the acidified Basin A in 1991 and 1992 show marked changes in the phytoplankton composition and percentage of the main algae groups. The percentage of the green algae decreased, especially the species Oocystis submarina v. variabilis, while the dinoflagellates, mainly the species Peridinium umbonatum (P, inconspicuum), and the cryptomonads increased. In 1993, however, and even more in 1994, there was a marked change in the composition in the control Basin B compared to previous years, with less green algae and more chrysomonads. The total volume was higher in Basin A in 1994 than in Basin B, especially in the autumn, while it was more or less the same in both basins in 1993. In the acidified Basin A, the dominance of the dinoflagellates was more pronounced in 1993 and 1994 than in previous years. The reason for the change in composition of phytoplankton registered in the control Basin B in 1993 and 1994 is hard to explain. As the changes in the composition of Basin A came immediately after the treatment of the Basin started, it is obvious that the addition of nitrogen, and especially the nitrate, through the treatment, was important in regulating the composition in this acid and humic lake. An increase in phosphorus seems to contribute more to the level of the total biomass of phytoplankton than to the observed changes in the composition.																			0160-4120						1996	22	5					619	628		10.1016/0160-4120(96)00037-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0160-4120(96)00037-2													WOS:A1996VG55900020

Burbot Population Dynamics in Northern Lake Michigan, 2001-2023, and Predation on Newly Stocked Lake Trout by Burbot	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												Although the worldwide status of burbot (Lota lota) across its Holarctic distribution has recently been assessed, adverse effects of dreissenid mussels on burbot abundance in waters invaded by mussels have not been investigated. We analyzed data from an annual spring gillnet survey to characterize burbot population dynamics in northern Lake Michigan during 2001-2023. Adult burbot abundance in northern Lake Michigan trended neither significantly upward nor downward during 2001-2023. Thus, expansion of the quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) population into deeper waters of Lake Michigan during 2003-2008 had no detectable negative effects on burbot abundance. Burbot continued to feed on lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) stocked in the Northern Refuge of Lake Michigan through 2023, which supported a hypothesis that the burbot population potentially impeded lake trout restoration in the refuge.

J	Winter, JG; Duthie, HC				Winter, JG; Duthie, HC			Epilithic diatoms as indicators of stream total N and total P concentration	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY												Patterns of diatom species distribution in relation to total N (TN), total P (TP), and other environmental variables from riffle sites on 2 streams in southern Ontario, Canada, were determined using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Relationships with TN and TP were sufficiently strong to develop weighted-averaging (WA) regression-calibration models for inferring stream water concentrations of these nutrients. The models were accurate within +/-2.4 mu g/L for TP (apparent r(2) = 0.52) and +/-2 mg/L for TN (apparent r(2) = 0.53). An evaluation of the goodness of fit of these models with and without bootstrapping indicated that they performed better (bootstrapped r(2) = 0.44 for TP and bootstrapped r(2) = 0.42 for TN) than published TN and TP inference models for which similar assessments were made. Based on Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development eutrophication ratings, the TP model predicted 76% of the mesotrophic and 57% of the eutrophic samples correctly. The model correctly predicted only 20% and 33%, respectively of oligotrophic and hypereutrophic samples. WA inference models were improved when seasonal variation was removed by using mean summer water quality and diatom data (apparent r(2) = 0.76 and bootstrapped r(2) = 0.61 for TP; apparent r(2) = 0.82 and bootstrapped r(2) = 0.70 for TN). Overall, rye conclude that epilithic diatoms can be related to TN and TF using these methods, and that WA inference models have utility for indicating eutrophication in southern Ontario lowland streams.																			0887-3593					MAR	2000	19	1					32	49		10.2307/1468280	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1468280													WOS:000087205700003

In this study the ecosystem process model, BIOME-BGC, was adapted to represent these unique conditions in Arctic ecosystems by including a new water storage and evaporation routine that accounts for nonvascular vegetation and the effects of permafrost, adding ground heat flux as an input, and representing ground shading by dead vegetation. The new Arctic version and the original BIOME-BGC models are compared to observed ET from two eddy flux towers in Barrow, Alaska over four summer seasons (1999-2002). The two towers are located less than 1 km apart, yet represent contrasting moisture conditions. One is located in a drained thaw lake, marsh area, while the other is located in a drier, upland area characterized by mesic tundra. Results indicate that the original BIOME-BGC model substantially underestimated ET, while the Arctic version slightly overestimated ET at both sites. The new Arctic model version worked particularly well at the wet tower because the model was able to capture energy limitations better than water limitations. Errors in the simulation of snowmelt date led to errors in the ET estimates at both sites. Finally, the substantial differences in soil moisture led to substantially different ET rates between the sites that were difficult to simulate and indicates that soil moisture heterogeneity is a strong controller on ET in these ecosystems.					; Oechel, Walter/F-9361-2010; Engstrom, Ryan/AEW-0212-2022	Engstrom, Ryan/0000-0002-3063-0551; Oechel, Walter/0000-0002-3504-026X; 													2169-8953	2169-8961				JUN 21	2006	111	G2							G02021	10.1029/2005JG000102	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2005JG000102													WOS:000240991800001

Grazing on bottom sediments by age-I and age-II gizzard shad usually began in early morning, increased in intensity until 1400-1600 h, and then declined. After dusk, the fish became inactive, and feeding activity ceased. Exceptions to this pattern were noted in May and June 1974, when food intake decreased markedly during the spawning period. Organic and caloric contents of detrital food material in the gizzards ranged from 3.1-61.5% (mean = 18%) of dry weight and 845-5520 cal/g ash-free dry weight (1973, mean = 3187; 1974, mean = 3132). The low quality (expressed as calories) of the organic detritus ingested during most of the summer could explain in part why the growth rates of gizzard shad in this system are depressed in relation to those observed in other impoundments at similar latitudes.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1981	110	3					391	395		10.1577/1548-8659(1981)110<391:AOTFEO>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1981)110<391:AOTFEO>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1981LU90100009

Microbiome analysis reveals Microcystis blooms endogenously seeded from benthos within wastewater maturation ponds	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Toxigenic Microcystis blooms periodically disrupt the stabilization ponds of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Dense proliferations of Microcystis cells within the surface waters (SWs) impede the water treatment process by reducing the treatment efficacy of the latent WWTP microbiome. Further, water quality is reduced when conventional treatment leads to Microcystis cell lysis and the release of intracellular microcystins into the water column. Recurrent seasonal Microcystis blooms cause significant financial burdens for the water industry and predicting their source is vital for bloom management strategies. We investigated the source of recurrent toxigenic Microcystis blooms at Australia's largest lagoon-based municipal WWTP in both sediment core (SC) and SW samples between 2018 and 2020. Bacterial community composition of the SC and SW samples according to 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing showed that Microcystis sp. was dominant within SW samples throughout the period and reached peak relative abundances (32%) during the summer. The same Microcystis Amplicon sequence variants were present within the SC and SW samples indicating a potential migratory population that transitions between the sediment water and SWs during bloom formation events. To investigate the potential of the sediment to act as a repository of viable Microcystis cells for recurrent bloom formation, a novel in-vitro bloom model was established featuring sediments and sterilized SW collected from the WWTP. Microcystin-producing Microcystis blooms were established through passive resuspension after 12 weeks of incubation. These results demonstrate the capacity of Microcystis to transition between the sediments and SWs in WWTPs, acting as a perennial inoculum for recurrent blooms.					; Neilan, Brett/I-5767-2012; Timms, Verlaine/E-8326-2011; Neilan, Brett/AGW-6984-2022; Crosbie, Nicholas/T-5247-2019	Romanis, Caitlin/0000-0001-5036-6922; Crosbie, Nicholas/0000-0002-0319-4248; Neilan, Brett/0000-0001-6113-772X; Nebauer, Daniel/0009-0004-5017-0400; 													0099-2240	1098-5336				JAN 24	2024	90	1								10.1128/aem.01585-23	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/aem.01585-23		DEC 2023						38117057					WOS:001128116600001

Along the longitudinal axis from the Ter River downstream to the dam, we characterized a microbial succession of food web dominance of bacteria-HNF-ciliates. The Ter River transports a large load of organic material into the reservoir, with a bacterial density of similar to9.10(6) large cells per ml. While at the first lacustrine station of the Reservoir HNF were the dominant bacterial consumers, at the others, an oligotrich ciliate, Halteria grandinella, was the main protozoan bacterivore. Most of the bacterial production in the reservoir epilimnion was consumed by grazing. The spatial succession of the resevoir microbial food webs was followed downstream by maximum densities of their potential predators among zoo-plankters - rotifers, and early developmental stages of copepods.

This species initiated inshore movement at sunset, occupied the nearshore area throughout the night, and moved offshore by sunrise. Mimic shiners were collected in less than 1 m of water throughout inshore areas with sparsely developed macroscopic vegetation. Greatest relative abundance was observed at sites possessing the greatest expanse of sparsely or nonvegetated substrate. Relative abundance at inshore sites may be related to habitat characteristics of the sites or to the proximity of feeding habitat. These diel movements differed markedly from those exhibited by the mimic shiner in other lakes. The inshore movement in Lake Itasca may function to reduce crepuscular and nocturnal predation pressure. Freshwater fishes may possess behavioral plasticity sufficient to alter movement and distribution patterns according to prevailing conditions and predation pressure may be important in altering prey behavioral patterns.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1983	40	7					888	894		10.1139/f83-115	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f83-115													WOS:A1983QX62800005

FPV represents a relatively new technology in Europe and is currently showing a rapid growth in deployment. However, effects on thermal characteristics of lakes are largely unknown, yet these are crucial for licensing and approval of such plants. Here, we quantify FPV impacts on lake water temperature, energy budget and thermal stratification of a lake through measurements of near-surface lateral wind flow, irradiance, air and water temperatures at one of the largest commercial German facilities, situated on a 70 m deep dredging lake in the Upper Rhine Valley, South-West Germany. Underneath the FPV facility, a 73% reduction in irradiance on the lake surface and an average 23% reduction in near-surface wind speed at module height are detected. A three month data set is then used to set up the General Lake Model and simulate scenarios of different FPV occupancies and changing climatic conditions. We observe that a lake coverage with FPV result in a more unstable and shorter thermal stratification during summer, which could mitigate the effects of climate change. The reduction of water temperatures follows a non-linear relationship with increased FPV occupancy. A sensitivity analysis showed that an increased wind reduction by FPV can have a considerable impact on the thermal properties of the lake. However, measurements only suggest small deviations with regard to the thermal properties of the investigated lake. These findings can be used in approval procedures and allow for a more accurate assessment of environmental impacts of future installations.

OECOLOGIA												Cyanobacterial blooms induce significant costs that are expected to increase in the near future. Cyanobacterial resistance to zooplankton grazing is one factor thought to promote bloom events. Yet, numerous studies on zooplankton ability to graze upon cyanobacteria have been producing contradictory results and such a puzzle might arise from the lack of direct observations in situ. Our objective was to track, using fatty acid (FA) and fatty acid stable isotope analyses (FA-SIA), the fate of cyanobacterial organic matter in the food web of a lake subjected to summer blooms of Planktothrix rubescens. A metalimnetic bloom of P. rubescens occurred in Lake Bourget (France) during the study period (May-November 2009). The bloom was especially rich in alpha-linolenic acid, 18:3(n-3), but none of the considered zooplankton taxa exhibited spiking content in this particular FA. FA-SIA revealed, however, that over a quarter of 18:3(n-3) in small zooplankton (< 500 mu m) was provided by P. rubescens while large cladocerans (> 500 mu m) did not benefit from it. P. rubescens 18:3(n-3) could be tracked up to perch (Perca fluviatilis) young of the year (YOY) to which it contributed to similar to 15 % of total 18:3(n-3). Although transferred with a much lower efficiency than micro-algal organic matter, the P. rubescens bloom supported a significant share of the pelagic secondary production and did not constitute, sensu stricto, a 'trophic dead end'. The cyanobacterial bloom also provided perch YOY with components of high nutritional values at a season when these are critical for their recruitment. This cyanobacterial bloom might thus be regarded as a significant dietary bonus for juvenile fish.

Cladophora exists in different morphologies, including attached submerged Cladophora (AC), grown floating Cladophora (GFC), and death floating Cladophora (DFC). Previous satellite remote sensing has mainly focused on identifying floating algae. In this study, Qinghai Lake served as a case study, and a classification decision tree model (CDTM) was proposed. The model employed the chlorophyll spectral index (CSI) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to differentiate AC, Floating Cladophora (FC), and water. Additionally, the floating Cladophora index (FCI) was introduced to further distinguish GFC and DFC within FC. The method was applicable to Sentinel-2 images from 2016-2023. Visual interpretation methods were used for Landsat series images from the summer months (July to September) to obtain the AC and FC. The results demonstrate that over the past 30 years, the areas inhabited by AC and FC have increased gradually. The three morphologies of Cladophora also exhibited seasonal variations, with growth observed annually in May-June, reaching peaks in August-September, and gradually declining in October. In addition, by combining factors such as water surface area and climatic factors, we analyzed the driving forces influencing the changes in Cladophora. In this research, AC and FC showed significant correlations with the water surface area, with correlation coefficients (r) of approximately 0.9 and 0.7, respectively. These new findings provide valuable insights regarding the spatiotemporal changes and underlying causes for different morphologies of Cladophora in global saline lakes.					; zhou, yuting/JWP-5025-2024; Yue, Yao/KIC-2405-2024; xu, wenting/GVR-8851-2022; jiarui, shi/JAC-4211-2023	Yao, Yue/0000-0001-5671-6399; li, jun sheng/0000-0002-8590-9736; 														2072-4292				FEB	2024	16	3							602	10.3390/rs16030602	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs16030602													WOS:001160335100001

Small changes in precipitation in the Amazon Basin have immediate consequences for the survival of the Andean cloud forest, because its dominant source of moisture today is the Atlantic Ocean. A 40 k.y. lacustrine record from the Eastern Cordillera in Bolivia in an endemic species-rich and ecologically threatened region shows a dry Last Glacial Maximum, indicating a drastic decrease of the Amazonian moisture source. To explain this aridity, we infer steep temperature gradients between the pole and equator in both hemispheres that would have reduced considerably the size and displacement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and the austral summer precipitation. This major change in water supply induced a dramatic reduction in species diversity and suggests that the Andean cloud forest did not provide refugia for tropical lowland taxa during full glacial times.

Species composition was very variable, the commonest species being roach (Rutilus rutilus), bream (Abramis brama), tench (Tinca tinca), perch (Perca fluviatilis) and pike (Esox lucius). Two main kinds of fish community were identifiable from the survey, those consisting of a mixture of cyprinids, usually roach and bream, and those in which cyprinids were rare or absent and the fish community was composed of perch and pike. The majority of the lakes fell into the 1st category. Comparison of growth curves derived by back-calculation showed that, in all species, variation occurred from lake to lake and from year to year. The majority of gravel-pit lake fishes had medium growth rates when compared with works on different waters. Seasonal growth of roach infected with plerocercoids of Ligula intestinalis was observed at monthly intervals. Annulus formation on the scales of these fish occurred at the onset of growth in May. The heavy Ligula burden in 89% of these fish did not cause the formation of any additional or false rings.

Nanofiltration (NF) systems can prevent DBP formation by removing color and NOM before chlorination. Research studies were conducted on Fall Lake water in Minnesota and dechlorinated potable water spiked with NOM in Ohio by using nanofiltration (Fyne process). Several types of tubular membranes with various molecular weight cutoffs were studied. The effectiveness of the Fyne process in producing safe drinking water was gauged by measuring the removal efficiency of total organic carbon, color, 2-3 micron particles, Bacillus subtilis as a surrogate for bacteria removal and MS2 bacteriophage as a surrogate for virus removal. Results of tests conducted under controlled laboratory conditions and field conditions indicated that Fyne process NF membranes could be used by small system drinking water treatment systems for DBP precursor and pathogen removal.

Geochemistry of vapor-dominated hydrothermal vent deposits in Yellowstone Lake, Wyoming	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Yellowstone Lake hydrothermal vent systems have been studied using ROV assets to better understand the chemical and mineralogical evolution of the sublacustrine sediments through which the hot spring fluids discharge to the lake floor. Here we focus on the deposits/alteration and coexisting vent fluid chemistry associated with the Deep Hole on the lake floor, east of Stevenson Island. Remote in its location, at 120 m below the lake surface, this region in the northeast portion of Yellowstone Lake is associated with numerous hydrothermal vents and hot springs, providing evidence of high-temperature fluid-mineral interaction and phase separation phenomena. Vapor-dominated hydrothermal fluids issuing from Deep Hole vents attain temperatures in excess of 150 degrees C and are enriched in magmatically derived H2S and CO2. Upon mixing with lake water in the root zone of the hydrothermally active vents, the dissolved gases render the mixed fluid, both acidic and reducing, effectively transforming diatomaceous sediment, with detritally sourced Al and Fe components, to an alteration assemblage dominated by kaolinite, pyrite, and lesser boehmite. These alteration processes have been modeled by computer based simulations, coupling fluid flow and mineral dissolution kinetics, to provide insight on the temporal evolution of the vent system. Results predict rapid dissolution of amorphous silica. The magnitude and rate of silica loss, facilitated by the continuous influx of acidic source fluids, yields an increasingly silica poor alteration mineral sequence with time, characterized by quartz, followed by kaolinite and ultimately boehmite. These data are consistent with the observed decrease in SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of the vent deposits with increasing abundance of trace immobile elements, suggesting significant mass loss with reaction progress. Pyrite is predicted to form from sulfidation of magnetite, with noteworthy decrease in magnetic intensity, as measured for hydrothermally altered sediment in the near-field vent environment. Moreover, hydrogen isotope compositional data for kaolinite, together with delta D vent fluid data, suggest temperatures in keeping with the high temperatures measured for the vent deposits and discharging fluid, while supporting the potential use of kaolinite as a geothermometer. The predicted and observed transformation of silica-rich protolith to kaolinite, boehmite, and pyrite underscores the large scale dissolution and removal of silica, with possible implications for the temporal evolution of vent deposits on the lake floor in the Stevenson Island Deep-Hole region.

Phytoplankton structure and dynamics in a volcanic lake in Deception Island (South Shetland Islands, Antarctica)	POLAR BIOLOGY												This work constitutes the first floristic and ecological analysis of the phytoplankton community of a volcanic freshwater lake in Deception Island (62 degrees 57'S, 60 degrees 38'W, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica). The main limnological features and phytoplankton size fractions were analyzed. Samples were taken during the austral summer of 2002 at two opposite sites. According to ANOVA results performed with abiotic variables, no significant differences between sites were found. The phytoplankton community showed low algal species richness, with an important contribution of the tychoplanktonic taxa. In terms of species number, Bacillariophyceae was the dominant class. Autotrophic picoplankton registered the highest densities from the second sampling date onwards. Nanophytoplankton was represented by unidentified chrysophycean organisms, which showed different distribution patterns between sites. The net phytoplankton abundance remained low during the sampling period and was strongly correlated with chlorophyll a concentration. Both nutrient concentrations and chlorophyll a values indicated oligotrophic conditions.

J	Power, G				Power, G			Charrs, glaciations and seasonal ice	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES					4th International Charr Symposium	JUN 25-JUL 01, 2000	TROIS RIVIERES, CANADA					Although the paleontological evidence is sketchy, the genus Salvelinus appears to have arisen some 5-10 million years (My) ago. During most of the last 0.6 My, and for a long period before that, the charrs existed in periglacial environments just beyond the fringes of great ice sheets. The charrs of eastern North America evolved and live in close and intimate association with ice in all its various natural forms. The aquatic environments in which they evolved were cold, unproductive, sediment laden, and often catastrophically unstable. Even during times like the current interglacial, seasonal ice conditions influence their environment. Ice can limit movement and confine fish during winter to groundwater fed refuge areas in rivers or to deep waters. In rivers, spawning grounds may be delimited by suitable groundwater upwellings needed to protect eggs and embryos from ice. In lakes, ice thickness and, often, groundwater upwellings help define suitable spawning areas which often occur in ice molded glacial deposits. Not surprisingly, many of the traits displayed by eastern North American charrs can be recognized as beneficial in cold regions. Particularly valuable is their opportunistic, exploratory, and migratory behaviour which helps define their life history. These traits were presumably selected during life in periglacial areas and would have been useful for dispersal whenever ice sheets retracted. It is unlikely these traits will promote survival under present circumstances when human activity is rapidly modifying their environment. However, should modern technology enable the necessary information to be obtained and, with guidance, society responds appropriately, it is possible the charrs will persist into the future.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				JUN	2002	64	1-3					17	35		10.1023/A:1016066519418	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1016066519418													WOS:000177002400002
J	Güçlü, SS				Guclu, Salim Serkan			The First Data on the Biology of Anatolichthys meridionalis (Actinopterygii, Aphaniidae): an Endemic and Endangered Fish of Turkey (Dalaman River Basin)	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												Species belonging to the Aphaniidae, extant as well as fossil, are widel distributed along the late-period Tethys Sea coast lines. Among the mentioned genera, Anatolichthys is the genus that includes the 13 species. Anatolia has been a center in the diversity of Anatolichthys. The study is one of the first studies on the growth of the species. On this occasion, in study, it was aimed to examine the growth parameters of the Anatolichthys meridionalis Aksiray, 1948 population, which is an endemic and endangered species in Anatolia. The population structure of endemic species Anatolichthys meridionalis in Gokpinar Spring (Dalaman River basin-Turkey) (37.34 degrees N, 29.44 degrees E) was studied, using 108 fish in October 2019 and September 2020. The growth and reproductive characteristics of A. meridionalis were examined in the study. Males made up 42.59%, females 57.41% of the population. The length-weight relationship and Von Bertalanffy growth equation were W = 0.0112L(3.4638), R-2 = 0.9793, L-t = 22.97 (1 - e(-0.0304 (t+2.834))), respectively. Average growth performance and condition factor are calculated as 1.21 and 1.84, respectively. The gonadosomatic index was found in a maximum value (12.742%) in July and a minimum value (0.545%) in January. Reproduction time was found to be in between of July and September. The mean fecundity and mean egg diameter were found as 147.94 +/- 28.03 number/individual/year and 1.35 +/- 0.04 mm, respectively. The first maturation was found to be at age I. First maturity length (L-m) was estimated at 23.95 mm for females and 22.04 mm for males. Although the study shows that the species has no problem in finding food and is a population with a wide age range, the presence of invasive species in the habitat, the habitat is directly affected by pollution from agricultural activities, water is drawn by pumps for agricultural activities, and it is narrowly distributed and endangered species, A. meridionalis and its habitat Gokpinar Spring should be protected.

Here, we seek to reveal the latest MP pollution status in the largest freshwater lake of China, Poyang Lake, by comprehensively assessing the abundance, distribution, size, shape, polymer composition, and micro-morphology of MPs in water and sediment, covering a large geographic area of the Lake and its five main river tributaries. High levels of MPs were detected in water (up to 1064 +/- 90 MP/m(3)) and sediment (up to 1936 +/- 121 MP/kg), with the highest concentrations in the Gan River and the lowest in the national Nature Reserves. While a positive correlation was identified between MP abundance in water and sediment, the size distribution of MPs in between water and sediment was distinct. The dominant MP form in sediment and water was fragment and fiber, respectively. Infrared spectroscopy analysis confirmed the dominant polymer types including polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene, polystyrene, and polyvinyl alcohol. Moreover, both mu-FTIR and SEM results suggested significant features of weathering and fragmentation of MPs. This study provides comprehensive data to understand the environmental behavior and pollution magnitude of MPs in China's largest freshwater lake and highlights the significant contribution of smaller-size fractions (0.03-0.1 mm) to improve future MP studies in freshwater systems.

HYDROBIOLOGIA												The Iberian Peninsula harbours 24 taxa of native large branchiopods (LBs). Most of them inhabit Mediterranean temporary ponds, which are priority habitats under the EU Habitats Directive. In this work, Iberian LBs were evaluated using IUCN Red List criteria based on geographic range (extent of occurrence, area of occupancy, number of locations, habitat fragmentation and expected decline). Our results show that 46% of the Iberian LBs are threatened: four taxa should be considered as Critically Endangered (Linderiella baetica, Triops emeritensis, Cyzicus tetracerus and Leptestheria mayeti), three taxa fall under the category Endangered (Artemia salina, Tanymastigites lusitanica and Triops vicentinus) and four species (Artemia sp. parthenogenetic strains, Branchinecta orientalis, Lepidurus apus and Triops gadensis) are Vulnerable. Two species (Phallocryptus spinosus, and Maghrebestheria maroccana) are considered Near Threatened. Our results highlight the worrying risk of extinction of Iberian LBs at the regional level, mainly related to the disappearance and degradation of their habitats and the relatively low degree of habitat protection. For Iberian endemic species, this evaluation is also valid at the global level and gives strong support for their inclusion in the IUCN Red List.

Data were collected to examine the water chemistry of Front Range high-elevation lakes and their sensitivity to atmospheric deposition, particularly nitrogen saturation. Water chemistry data from synoptic surveys of high-elevation lakes in wilderness areas of other National Forests in Colorado are also included in this report. Because of the extent, uniqueness, and potential value of the data collected, the entire water chemistry data base including over 265 samples from more than 130 lakes and streams is presented. Preliminary data examination indicates that many lakes have detectible nitrate concentrations, nitrate concentrations are higher early in the season and decrease as the season progresses, and inlets often have higher nitrate concentrations than outlets. Detailed data analysis and interpretation, its relationship to landscape characteristics, and the implications for ecosystem response and management will be presented by the authors in subsequent manuscripts in preparation.																			0502-5001					SEP	1996		RM-325					1	+																WOS:A1996WN38500001

Samples of meltwater collected at the base of the snowpeak in 1987 were acidic and exhibited distinct 'pulses' of nitrate and sulfate. Solutions collected with lysimeters in forest soils adjacent to the stream revealed high levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total Al. Peaks in concentration of DOC, Al, and nutrient species in the stream samples indicate a flush of soil solution into the surface water at the beginning of the melt. Infiltration of meltwater into soils and spatial heterogeneity in the timing of melting across the basin prevented stream and lake waters from becoming acidic.

J	Yang, YM; Deng, ZH; Lu, XM; Gao, XL				Yang, Yumei; Deng, Zhenghua; Lu, Xianming; Gao, Xiaoling			Study on the environmental efficiency of agricultural water resources about typical cropping patterns around the Dongting Lake area	JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE												This paper aims to evaluate the environmental efficiency of agricultural water resources utilization in different cropping patterns in the Dongting Lake area. To achieve that, the following materials are used: (1) study area: 16 counties (cities and districts) of Yueyang, Changde, and Yiyang around the Dongting Lake area; (2) data: relevant indicators of economic and environmental benefits of agricultural water resources utilization from 2011 to 2020; and (3) model: the Luenberger productivity model based on the directional distance function. With all the materials above, this paper calculates the environmental efficiency of typical cropping patterns in the Dongting Lake ecological zone and explores the spatial and temporal evolution patterns of typical cropping patterns in the lake area. The results show that (1) the environmental efficiency (LEI) of four typical cropping patterns in 16 counties (cities and districts) around Dongting Lake shows an overall increasing trend from 2011 to 2020, especially the environmental efficiency of four cropping patterns has increased significantly since 2014. (2) Among the four typical cropping patterns, the environmental efficiency of one-season rice + lobster is higher, and the environmental efficiency value of two-season rice + winter leisure is lower but most significantly improved. (3) The environmental efficiency of agricultural water resources in the hilly areas around the lake is higher than that in the Dongting Plain. Finally, some countermeasures and suggestions were put forward, such as implementing the reduction and efficiency of pesticide and chemical fertilizer in the planting industry in the lake area, optimizing the rice + planting mode, strengthening the construction of water conservation projects in the four river basins, and promoting high-standard farmland water-saving irrigation.

Assessment of Levels, Speciation, and Toxicity of Trace Metal Contaminants in Selected Shallow Groundwater Sources, Surface Runoff, Wastewater, and Surface Water from Designated Streams in Lake Victoria Basin, Uganda	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH												The levels, speciation of elements, and toxicity of selected trace metals as well as other parameters in selected surface water, shallow groundwater sources, landfill leachate, and associated surface runoff in the Lake Victoria basin, Uganda, were studied. The WHO guidelines, Ugandan standards, Canadian guidelines and Swedish EPA were used for assessment. The shallow groundwater was acidic with pH values below 6.5. The pH, dissolved organic carbon, flouride, and sulphate levels for all springs were below the guideline values although 52.8% was contaminated with nitrates while 39% was contaminated with chloride ions. Some surface water samples had levels of major elements, such as iron, chromium, aluminium, and manganese, above the guideline values. Speciation studies showed that 74% of the metal ions was bound to dissolved organic matter in surface water, whereas in landfill leachates, the dominant ionic species was metal hydroxides or fulvic acid bound. Risk analysis based on the Swedish EPA showed varied risks of negative effects in 30%-76% of the sample sites ranging from high to increased risk in surface water, whereas the results from modelling sorption data using the Bio-met tool showed potential risk to toxicity effects of Cu2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, and Pb2+ in 15.3%-30.8% surface water samples and 8.3%-62.5% groundwater samples.

In Lo Mendez and Lo Galindo are frequent blooms of different groups of algae (cyanobacteria, green algae, diatoms and dinoflagellates), which generated wealth increases at different times of the year, even in winter they were presented. In Las Tres Pascualas blooms were rare. The occurrence and frequency of blooms of species representatives of the M, C, Y and Lo functional groups, and VII, VI, IV and V morphological groups, reflect the eutrophic lakes, being indicative of the degree of contamination of these systems that influence their present and future use.

The genetic composition of each of these stocks was confirmed electrophoretically. Overwinter survival of northern largemouth bass in central Illinois was significantly greater than that of Florida largemouth bass; the two reciprocal F1 hybrids had intermediate survival. The absolute survival rate of all stocks decreased as the severity of the winter increased; however, the effects were most dramatic for the Florida subspecies. The northern largemouth bass also exhibited greater second- and third-year growth than the Florida largemouth bass; again, the reciprocal F1 hybrids were intermediate. Results of this study indicate the potential negative effects that may arise when Florida largemouth bass or hybrids between it and the northern subspecies are introduced into waters of the USA and Canada that are within or contiguous to the native range of the northern subspecies.																			0002-8487					JAN	1991	120	1					58	64		10.1577/1548-8659(1991)120<0058:SAGONF>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1991)120<0058:SAGONF>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1991FK68300006

During the summer of 1973 and 1974 Sphaerium and Hexagenia made up 8190 of the benthic macroinvertebrate abundance and 92% of the benthic biomass; both taxa had greatly reduced abundance and biomass within stands of emergent Sagittaria along the lake margin. During July 1974 the Sagittaria net productivity was about 19 g/m2 per day. Between 1896 and 1973 about 76 cm of sediment had accumulated in Big Lake, and the recent sedimentation rate (1964-1974) was about 1.7 cm/yr.

It must ensure the stability of water quality during transportation. However, uncontrollable microbial growth can develop in the water delivery system during the long delivery process, posing a risk to health and safety. Therefore, we applied 16 s and 18 s gene sequence analysis in order to study microbial communities in box culvert waters sampled in 2021, as well as a molecular ecological network-based approach to decipher microbial interactions and stability. Our findings revealed that, in contrast to natural freshwater ecosystems, micro-eukaryotes in LUBWT have complex interactions such as predation, parasitism, and symbiosis due to their semi-enclosed box culvert environment. Total nitrogen may be the primary factor affecting bacterial community interactions in addition to temperature. Moreover, employing stability indicators such as robustness and vulnerability, we also found that microbial stability varied significantly from season to season, with summer having the higher stability of microbial communities. Not only that but also the stability of the micronuclei also varied greatly during water transport, which might also be related to the complex interactions among the micro-eukaryotes. To summarize, our study reveals the microbial interactions and stability in LUBWT, providing essential ecological knowledge to ensure the safety of LUBWT's water quality.

Lake Whitefish offers a powerful system to investigate processes of adaptive divergence where the dwarf, limnetic species evolved repeatedly from the normal, benthic species. We compared the transient intestinal microbiota between both species from the wild and in controlled conditions, including their reciprocal hybrids. We sequenced the 16s rRNA gene V3-V4 regions to (a) test for parallelism in the transient intestinal microbiota among sympatric pairs, (b) test for transient intestinal microbiota differences among dwarf, normal, and hybrids reared under identical conditions, and (c) compare intestinal microbiota between wild and captive whitefish. A significant host effect on microbiota taxonomic composition was observed when all lakes were analyzed together and in three of the five species pairs. In captive whitefish, host effect was also significant. Microbiota of both reciprocal hybrids fell outside of that observed in the parental forms. Six genera formed a bacterial core which was present in captive and wild whitefish, suggesting a horizontal microbiota transmission. Altogether, our results complex interactions among the host, the microbiota, and the environment, and we propose that these interactions define three distinct evolutionary paths of the intestinal microbiota.

The record indicates a relatively stable and warm MAAT until 2200 cal yr BP; subsequently, the MAAT decreased by similar to 4.4 degrees C at similar to 2100 cal yr BP and maintained a cooling trend until the present day, with centennial-scale oscillations centered at similar to 800 cal yr BP, similar to 600 cal yr BP, and similar to 190-170 cal yr BP. MAAT decreased abruptly at similar to 500-300 cal yr BP and reached its minimum for the past 4700 years. We assessed the representativeness of our record by comparing it with 15 published paleotemperature records from the TP spanning the past similar to 5000 years. The results show divergent temperature variations, including a gradual cooling trend, a warming trend, and no clear trend. We suggest that these discrepancies could be caused by factors such as the seasonality of the temperature proxies, the length of the freezing season of the lakes, the choice of proxy-temperature calibrations, and chronological errors. Our results highlight the need for more high-quality paleotemperature reconstructions with unambiguous climatic significance, clear seasonality, site-specific calibration, and robust dating, to better understand the processes, trends, and mechanisms of Holocene temperature changes on the TP.

DO ENVIRONMENTAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN LAKES IN NORTHWESTERN ARGENTINEAN PATAGONIA AFFECT THE INFECTION OF PHILURETER TRIGONIOPSIS (MONOGENEA) IN GALAXIAS MACULATUS (OSMERIFORMES)?	JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY												Philureter trigoniopsis is the only parasite found in the ureters and urinary bladder of Galaxias maculatus in Patagonian Andean lakes. The dynamics of this endoparasitic monogenean were studied in Lake Gutierrez, a body of water with scarce shoreline vegetation, where the host has an annual cycle of migration to the deep pelagic zone of the lake. To compare variations of the infection related to differences between lakes, G. maculatus specimens were sampled monthly with baited traps from September 1998 to November 1999 in Lake Moreno, which is an oligotrophic body of water with emergent shoreline vegetation and where the fish do not migrate to the deep pelagic areas of the lake. In addition, data for summer infections of P. trigoniopsis from 10 Andean Patagonian lakes that differ in aquatic vegetation, depth, and area were compared. In Lake Moreno prevalence of P. trigoniopsis showed a seasonal pattern, with 1-yr-old fish exhibiting the highest values of prevalence and mean intensity. Negative correlations between water temperature and prevalence and between age of fish and abundance were found. Our results suggest that age of fish may be the main factor structuring the distribution of P. trigoniosis in populations of G. maculatus. At the regional level the relationship between the infection and the characteristics of the lakes was also observed, with prevalence and mean intensity of P. trigoniopsis in G. maculatus higher in large deep lakes without macrophytes.

This paper proposed an ocean wave powered lifejacket using 2DOF floating boards to provide both buoyance and electricity for drowning people. Hence, they can use this continuous electric power to keep key body warm and send distress signal. This lifejacket is featured with two 2DOF floating boards and the mechanical motion rectifier (MMR) can convert the 2-DOF motions to the unidirectional rotation of generator. The design principle is illustrated and the dynamic modelling for the 2-DOF motions has been analyzed. Bench test and lake test have been conducted to validate the design concept.					; Mi, Jia/IRY-9186-2023	Mi, Jia/0000-0001-5100-6064; 													0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-1687-5				2018	10595								UNSP 105951Z	10.1117/12.2296524	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2296524													WOS:000454436800053
J	Noon, PE; Leng, MJ; Jones, VJ				Noon, PE; Leng, MJ; Jones, VJ			Oxygen-isotope (δ18O) evidence of Holocene hydrological changes at Signy Island, maritime Antarctica	HOLOCENE												A record of Holocene hydrological changes has been produced from variations in oxygen-isotope composition (delta(18)O) preserved in freshwater lake sediments from maritime Antarctica. Small amounts (<5%) of authigenic carbonate have been extracted from a non-marl sediment core from Sombre Lake, Signy Island (60 degrees 43'S, 45 degrees 38'W). Oxygen-isotope and particle-size analysis provide a sensitive record of hydrological events in the lake arising from local and regional climate phenomena. The climate affects delta O-18 through snowpack volume and glacier activity in the catchment, lakewater temperatures, the input versus evaporation balance and the duration of seasonal lake ice cover. The most depleted (negative) delta O-18 values are associated with influxes of meltwater at times of glacier advance or retreat. Enriched (positive) delta O-18 values occur during more arid, warmer conditions with longer periods of open water in summer. This isotope record can be used to determine century-scale to decadal variability in air circulation and moisture origin. Strong similarities with other Holocene proxy records from the Weddell Sea and Antarctic Peninsula Region are apparent, including the mid-Holocene climate optimum followed by the Neoglacial and, most recently, late twentieth-century climatic warming. The oxygen-isotope record from Sombre Lake illustrates the importance of remote islands in contributing to our understanding of teleconnections in atmospheric and oceanographic circulation, sea-ice extent, air temperatures and precipitation in the Southern Ocean.

Alewives consumed the young of 4 game [Morone chrysops, Micropterus sp., M. salmoides and Lepomis sp.] and 2 forage species [Perca flavescens and Notemigonus crysoleucas] (maximum 26 mm total length (TL)). Alewife piscivority may be at least partially nocturnal and was more prominent in littoral than in limnetic areas. Predator and prey lengths were positively correlated, although morphological limits on larval fish ingestion by alewives were not severe. Peak occurrence (40-70%, June 1978) of larval fish in alewife stomachs coincided with a precipitous decline in zooplankton density. Zooplankton abundance was higher in early summer 1979, when alewife piscivority was less common. Alewife piscivority may have contributed to the collapse of Great Lakes resident fish populations following alewife establishment. Alewife piscivority should be considered in risk-benefit evaluations prior to introducing alewife as a pelagic forage species.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1980	37	8					1314	1317		10.1139/f80-167	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f80-167													WOS:A1980KD15600013

These statistically designed estimates are considerably higher than index counts obtained during periodic aerial surveys conducted between 1968 and 1992. Mean length of spawners for the three-year study ranged from 797 to 817 mm for males and 921 to 928 mm for females. Ages of inconnu spawners ranged from 8 to 23 years with the largest proportion of males ages 11 and 12 and female ages 13 and 14. A mixed stock fishery on the wintering and feeding grounds in Hotham Inlet and Selawik Lake is supported by inconnu populations from the Kobuk River as well as the less abundant Selawik River stock.																			0071-1128		3-510-47059-1				2002	57						639	645																WOS:000180355400054

J	GAEDKE, U; SCHIMMELE, M				GAEDKE, U; SCHIMMELE, M			INTERNAL SEICHES IN LAKE CONSTANCE - INFLUENCE ON PLANKTON ABUNDANCE AT A FIXED SAMPLING SITE	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												During thermal stratification, pronounced internal seiches occur in Lake Constance with periods of 4-6 days. The amplitudes reach 12 m at the sampling site in Uberlinger See (northwestern part of Lake Constance). Seiches change the thickness of the warm and generally biologically rich epilimnion and, thus, also the areal abundance of planktonic organisms at a fixed sampling site. The potential impact of seiche-driven changes of epilimnetic thickness on observed plankton abundance was calculated using continuously recorded temperature profiles and weekly vertical profiles of plankton biomass. Observed plankton biomass was recalculated by taking into account the effect of changing layer thickness in order to give a more realistic picture of biomass changes caused by waxing and waning of populations. Our calculations imply that changes of strata thickness do not mask the general seasonal trend in population dynamics (e.g. spring bloom and clear water phase); estimates of average yearly standing stock are not significantly affected if sampling is done at least weekly. However, changes of strata thickness can alter areal plankton abundance at the sampling site by a factor of 2 within 2 days. During pronounced seiches, areal abundance of phytoplankton, which generally exhibit a stronger vertical gradient than most other plankton, may be changed by a factor of 3-4 within hours. Hence, at our sampling site, the impact of changes in strata thickness cannot be ignored for detailed analysis of population dynamics of autotrophs involving comparisons between single observations.																			0142-7873					JUL	1991	13	4					743	754		10.1093/plankt/13.4.743	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/13.4.743													WOS:A1991FV24100005

However, its formation mechanism remains unclear at a basin scale due to the difficulty of precise identification of these processes. To address this issue, we investigated the spatial-temporal variations in water chemistry and isotopic compositions (e.g., delta C-13(DIG) delta N-15(NO3), delta O-18(NO3), delta S-34(SO4), and delta O-18(SO4)) in cascade reservoirs (artificial dam lakes) of the Jialing River, SW China in 201 6. The results showed that the denitrification and BSR processes coexisted in the studied reservoirs, which was supported by the positive correlation between delta N-15(NO3) and delta O-18(NO3) and between delta S-34(SO4) and delta O-18(SO4), and by the decreasing concentrations of NO3- and SO42- Moreover, covariation of Delta(CDIC)-C-13, 4 Delta N-15(NO3), and Delta S-34(SO4) indicated the dominance of heterotrophic denitrificalion (HD) in the reservoir waters along with the occurrence of bacterial sulfide oxidation (BSO). In addition to SO42- and NO3-, the coexistence of HD and BSR processes were also controlled by the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in winter and dissolved oxygen (DO) contents in other seasons. Overall, (he cumulative effect of cascade reservoirs caused delta N-15(NO3) and delta S-34(SO4) to display an upward (rend from upstream to downstream in the Jialing River, while delta C-13(DIC) showed an opposite downward trend, which implying that cascade reservoirs may be in favor of the coexistence of the HD and BSR processes. This study therefore concludes that the multi-isotope approach could be a useful technique to ascertain the coexistence mechanism of HD and BSR processes in reservoir water systems.

Water catchment area to fill the "Radoniqi" Lake is 120 Km2 and it lies at an altitude of 600-2500 m, which is a clear indicator that the catchment area is far from settlements and sources of pollution. The main water supplier is river Lumbardh of Deqani with an average flow 5m(3)/s. This study was conducted over a period of one year from February 2015-February 2016. Water samples were taken twice a month in three locations: River Lumbardh, Derivative channel and in the Lake. Samples were analysed for microbiological parameters: total coliform bacteria, fecal coliform bacteria, aerobic mesophilic bacteria and streptococcus faecalis as indicator of water pollution and physicochemical parameters such as: temperature, turbidity, ph, dissolved oxygen, chloride, ammonium, nitrites, nitrates etc. Enumeration of bacteria is made by membrane filtration method and by counting colonies on plates with RBA, M-Endo Agar less, PCA and BEA agar. According to preliminary results as it was expected, there is a high load of coliform bacteria in the river Lumbardh comparing with two other locations (Derivative channel and Lake "Radoniqi) due to increased rainfall and summer season.

FIELD OBSERVATIONS OF WINDBLOWN SAND AND DUST IN THE TAKIMAKAN DESERT, NW CHINA, AND INSIGHTS INTO MODERN DUST SOURCES	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Despite the importance of desert dust at global and regional scales, its exact provenance is often unclear. The Taklimakan Desert in northwest China is a common source of high-frequency regional dust storms and is also a large source of global dust production. On the basis of field observations and the determination of the fraction of aeolian dust in surface samples, we characterized the relative intensity of windblown sand/dust processes in the Taklimakan and the volume of dust emitted (PM10) during these processes. Major dust sources were degraded lands on the eastern desert margin, the Gobi and alluvial, fluvial and aeolian sediments occurring on the desert margin. These areas have high PM10 emission capacity due to high-surface PM10 concentrations and intensive windblown sand/dust activity. Despite having intensive windblown sand activity, the central desert had lower PM10 dust emission capacity (<1<bold>6</bold>kgday(-1)m(-2) in spring, <0<bold>08</bold>kgday(-1)m(-2) in other seasons) due to lower surface PM10 fraction. The dry Taitema Lake bed was a source of potentially high dust emissions (at least 4<bold>4</bold>-17kgday(-1)m(-2) for the monitoring period) due to the intensity windblown sand/dust activities, despite low PM10 concentrations. The dry river beds on the southeastern desert margin had lower dust emission potential due to low PM10 concentrations and windblown sand/dust activity. Most dust emission sources lie in the paths of prevailing winds, leading to aeolian dust transported to and deposited in the desert hinterland or Hotan, Yutian and Minfeng areas, where wind stream convergence leads to high-frequency dust storms.

J	Carlsson, L; Persson, J; Håkanson, L				Carlsson, L; Persson, J; Håkanson, L			A management model to predict seasonal variability in oxygen concentration and oxygen consumption in thermally stratified coastal waters	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												There are many indications of increasing eutrophication problems in the Baltic Sea. In the coastal zone, problems manifested as low near bottom oxygen concentrations and oxygen depletion are no longer unusual. The aim of this paper is to present a practically useful model to predict seasonal variability in oxygen concentration and oxygen consumption. In the model, empirical variations in deep water oxygen concentrations (late summer values) among 20 Baltic coastal areas were explained by variations in organic load and deep water turnover time. Regressions between modelled values and empirical data yielded r(2)-values from 0.84 to 0.90. The mean oxygen consumption rate (March-October) for the 20 areas was calculated to 23 l O-2/m(2)*month. The predicted rate is in the same order of magnitude as literature data from the Oresund area and a calculated default rate for the Baltic Sea. The model can be used to predict the lowest oxygen concentration during the year and to identify coastal areas where low concentrations are likely to appear. Furthermore, the sensitivity of a coastal area to an increased organic load can be assessed. Such information is useful when planning for example new locations for sewage treatment plants and/or fish farms, which increase the load of biodegradable substances. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Factors controlling the activity of the microbial community of the alkaline Lake Beloe (Transbaikal Region)	MICROBIOLOGY												In this work, the main environmental factors determining the functioning of the microbial community of the alkaline low-mineralized Lake Beloe during the annual cycle were studied. High numbers of phototrophic and heterotrophic microorganisms (up to 10(7) cells/mL) and high rates of bacterial processes of organic matter (OM) production and destruction were observed. The highest rate of dark CO2 assimilation (up to 0.43 mg C dm(-3) day(-1)), as well as the peak intensities of the terminal processes of sulfate reduction and methanogenesis (up to 1.81 mg S dm(-3) day(-1) and 0.96 mu L CH4 dm(-3) day(-1), respectively), detected at the end of summer, were comparable to the rates of these processes detected in the bottom sediments of most soda lakes of the Transbaikal Region. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) allowed us to estimate the effect of environmental factors on the functioning of the microbial community of the alkaline Lake Beloe. Four main components, explaining 98% of variations, were detected. The first one (PC1) explained 63.5% of the seasonal variations and represented the temperature factor consisting of the temperatures of air, water, and bottom sediments. Water temperature and pH were the main contributors to the second component (PC2) and determine 26.2% of the seasonal variations. The PC3 (silt temperature and the concentration of organic matter) and PC4 (salt concentration) components were less important and explained only 6.5 and 2.2% of the variations, respectively.

J	Zhang, YQ; You, QL; Ye, L; Chen, CC				Zhang, Yuqing; You, Qinglong; Ye, Lei; Chen, Changchun			Spatio-temporal characteristics and possible mechanisms of rainy season precipitation in Poyang Lake Basin, China	CLIMATE RESEARCH												Anomalous precipitation during the rainy season (April-June) exerts a considerable impact on hydro-climatic processes in the Poyang Lake Basin (PLB), China. In this study, the spatial and temporal patterns of rainy season precipitation from 1960 to 2014 were investigated using principal component analysis. Possible associations of rainy season precipitation with Nino-3.4 sea surface temperature (SST), maximum consecutive 5 d precipitation amount (RX5day), and diurnal temperature range (DTR) were explored through linear regression analysis. The possible water vapor flux mechanisms for the rainy seasons in dry/wet years were also investigated. The primary spatial pattern indicated a common variation trend in rainy season precipitation, and the variability in maximum value of this, occurring around 28 degrees N, decreased to the north and to the south. The corresponding time series of the primary spatial pattern implied that northern parts were more vulnerable to drought and flood than other parts of the basin. The secondary spatial pattern indicated a north-south dipole, and the corresponding time series showed strong interannual variability. The results also showed that Nino-3.4 SST in winter may positively impact the subsequent year's rainy season precipitation. Strongly positive correlation existed between RX5day and rainy season precipitation, but the correlation between DTR and rainy season precipitation was negative. Further, the water vapor transport from western boundaries into the PLB was substantial, whereas across the eastern boundary there was mainly an output of water vapor. Large input/output values were concentrated at about 850 hPa. Composite analysis indicated that a sizeable quantity of water vapor converged over the basin in wet years, forming effective precipitation with negative values of divergence over the PLB. For dry years, positive anomalies in water vapor flux divergence implied that little water vapor had converged over the basin.

Land use patterns, ecoregion and phytoplankton relationships in productive Ohio reservoirs	INLAND WATERS												We describe characteristics of phytoplankton communities of Ohio reservoirs with emphasis on the interrelationships among cyanobacterial populations, land use within 3 ecoregions, and associated environmental variables. We collected 59 phytoplankton samples from 25 mostly productive reservoirs located within 3 distinct ecoregions corresponding to intense agricultural land use (Eastern Corn Belt Plains), intermediate forestation and intermediate agricultural land use (Erie Drift Plain), and heavily forested land (Western Allegheny Plateau) between May and October 2008-2010 and May and June 2011. Cyanobacteria populations peaked in late summer months and were dominated by nitrogen-fixing taxa only in Western Allegheny Plateau and Erie Drift Plain sites, which commonly included Anabaena, Anabaenopsis, Aphanizomenon, and Cylindrospermopsis. Canonical correlation analysis suggests that the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of phytoplankton populations in Ohio reservoirs are strongly influenced by underlying land use practices. Coarse resolution at the ecoregion scale can be valuable in describing potential cyanobacteria composition where detailed nutrient budgets are not available for particular reservoirs and lakes.																			2044-2041	2044-205X					2012	2	2					101	108		10.5268/IW-2.2.481	http://dx.doi.org/10.5268/IW-2.2.481													WOS:000307721600004

We present seven years of field data on the salinity stratification of meromictic lakes Wallendorfer See and Rassnitzer See forming in the pits of the former lignite mine Merseburg-Ost in the Central German Mining District. Mainly from groundwater inflows, salinity stratified meromictic residual lakes had formed before freshwater was introduced intentionally over a period of two years to fill the pits more rapidly close to the final water level. From the observations, changes in the salinity stratification were interpreted in terms of deposited potential energy. Freshwater introduction (capping) was quantified in terms of potential energy. Thus the evolution of the salinity profiles was explained and their residual shapes became understandable as a consequence of the flooding procedure.

J	Sener, S; Sener, E; Bulut, C				Sener, Sehnaz; Sener, Erhan; Bulut, Cafer			Appraisal of heavy metal contents, spatial-temporal variation, toxic metal pollution, and health risk in water and sediment of Uluabat Lake (Ramsar Site, Turkey)	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Uluabat Lake holds a significant status as one of our country's essential Ramsar areas. Nevertheless, the lake faces considerable pressure from environmental pollutants. This study employed GIS-based index methods to examine the heavy metal pollution and water quality in Uluabat Lake. To achieve this, sediment and water samples were collected from 19 different locations during various seasons. The concentrations of As, Ni, Cr, Zn, Cu, Cd, Pb, Hg, Al, Fe, and Mn in these samples were analyzed. The average contents of the investigated heavy metals in the lake waters were found to be in the following order: Al > Fe > Mn > As > Zn > Ni > Pb > Cu > Cr > Hg > Cd. The As content in the lake waters exceeded the limit value of 10 mu g/L, as defined by TS-266 (2005) and WHO (2017) guidelines. Consequently, the lake waters were deemed unsuitable for drinking. The health risk assessments revealed that consuming the lake waters could lead to both carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic health problems. However, all other metal concentrations were measured below the specified limit values. Based on index calculations, the heavy metal pollution index value indicated that the lake water samples were suitable for drinking water use. Additionally, all samples fell into the "low pollution" category according to the heavy metal evaluation index, and degree of contamination values. However, geoaccumulation index values indicated that As was moderately contaminated. Moreover, enrichment factors of As, Cr, Ni, Pb, and Cd exhibited significant enrichment in lake sediments, with pollution load index values of all sediment samples indicating the impact of anthropogenic pollutants and a decline in sediment quality. Considering all the obtained results together, it can be concluded that environmental pollutants, especially heavy metal pollution, primarily enter the lake water through stream transports, leading to pollution in Uluabat Lake.

This work presents an integrated investigation on Se distribution and speciation conducted in 20 high altitude pristine lakes from the central-western Pyrenees. Five seasonal sampling campaigns were carried out after snowmelt (June/July) and in early fall (October) for the period 2017-2019. Concentrations of total dissolved Se (TDSe) ranged from 7 to 78 ng L-1, with selenate being ubiquitously observed in most cases (median of 61% of TDSe). Selenite was only occasionally detected up to 4 ng L-1, therefore a fraction of TDSe was presumably in the forms of elemental Se(0) and/or selenides. Depth profiles obtained in different lakes showed the occurrence of such Se(-ii, 0) pools in bottom hypoxic to anoxic waters. The production of volatile Se compounds presented a low median total concentration (TVSe) of 33 pg L-1 (range 3-120 pg L-1), mainly in the form of dimethylselenide in subsurface samples (median of 82% of TVSe). The Se concentration in lake waters was significantly correlated with the sulphate concentration (rho = 0.93, p < 0.0001), demonstrating that it is influenced by erosion and dissolution of Se and S-enriched parent bedrocks. In addition, for Se depleted alpine lake-bedrock systems, long-range transport and wet atmospheric depositions represent a major source of Se for lake waters.					; Kortazar, Leire/ABG-8902-2020; Fernandez, Luis/KHX-5442-2024; Fernandez Cuadrado, Luis Angel/C-3973-2017	Kortazar, Leire/0000-0002-2922-429X; Fernandez Cuadrado, Luis Angel/0000-0002-6740-5358; Amouroux, David/0000-0002-0056-8590													2050-7887	2050-7895				SEP 21	2022	24	9					1430	1442		10.1039/d1em00430a	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1em00430a		JAN 2022						35080575					WOS:000746913000001
J	Weiss, CC; Sousounis, PJ				Weiss, CC; Sousounis, PJ			A climatology of collective lake disturbances	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												This study examines the frequency and intensity with which collective lake disturbances (COLDs) develop. These disturbances develop when cold air overspreads the Great Lakes region in winter. The heat and moisture that is transferred from the Great Lakes aggregate into the lower atmosphere, and that spreads across a large region, allows eventually for the development of a meso-cr-scale pressure perturbation and circulation. Cases from the period 1980-90 were identified based on the existence of a surface trough or closed low over the Great Lakes region in the presence of cold air. Output from the Limited-Area Fine Mesh (LFM) model was used rather than performing numerous with-lake and no-lake numerical simulations to determine whether the feature was indeed the result of aggregate heating by the lakes. The LFM did not include the lakes in its simulations, so the 24-h forecast served as an optimal no-lakes simulation. Subtracting the initialization sea level pressure (SLP) field valid at the same time allowed for an assessment of the COLD events in terms of the SLP perturbation. An average of 33 events per year with an average SLP perturbation of 3-4 hPa was found for the 10-yr period. The synoptic-scale conditions for weak events with SLP perturbations less than 3 hPa differed significantly from those for strong events with SLP perturbations greater than 9 hPa. The weak scenario was characterized by a weak trough over the Great Lakes with high static stability and weak cold advection below 500 hPa and weak vorticity advection at 500 hPa. The strong scenario was characterized by a nearly closed low over the Great Lakes with low static stability and strong cold advection below 500 hPa and strong positive vorticity advection at: 500 hPa. The current study is the first attempt to measure the frequency and intensity with which the Great Lakes collectively generate meso-ru-scale disturbances in winter. The LFM-based technique provides a result that cannot likely be obtained without a herculean effort from a numerical modeling standpoint. Future numerical studies using the identified scenarios, however, will be extremely useful to better understand the sensitivities of COLD events to the large-scale conditions.					; Weiss, Christopher/AFV-6033-2022	Weiss, Christopher/0000-0003-0931-8966; 													0027-0644					APR	1999	127	4					565	574		10.1175/1520-0493(1999)127<0565:ACOCLD>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0493(1999)127<0565:ACOCLD>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000079571400009
J	Fukui, M; Suh, J; Yonezawa, Y; Urushigawa, Y				Fukui, M; Suh, J; Yonezawa, Y; Urushigawa, Y			Major substrates for microbial sulfate reduction in the sediments of Ise Bay, Japan	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												To clarify the anaerobic microbial interactions in the process of carbon mineralization in marine eutrophic environments, the microbial sulfate reduction and methane production rates were examined in coastal marine sediments of Ise Bay, Japan, in autumn 1990. Sulfate reduction rates (51-210 nmol ml(-1) day(-1) at 24 degrees C) were much higher than the methane production ones (< 1.78 nmol ml(-1) day(-1)) in the surface sediments (top 2 cm) at the six stations surveyed (water depth: 10.7-23.3 m). Substrates for sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) were estimated after the addition of a specific inhibitor for SRB (20 mmol l(-1) molybdate) into the sediment slurry, from the substrate accumulation races. In the presence of the inhibitor, sulfate reduction was completely stopped and volatile fatty acids (mainly acetate) were accumulated, although hydrogen was not. Methane production occurred markedly accompanied by consumption of the accumulated acetate from the third day after the addition of molybdate. The maximum rate of methane production was 1.2-1.9 mu mol ml(-1) day(-1), which was similar to those in highly polluted freshwater sediments such as the Tama River, Tokyo, Japan. These results show that acetate is a common major substrate for sulfate reduction and methane production, and SRB competitively inhibit potential acetoclastic methanogenesis in coastal sediments. Methanogens may potentially inhabit the sediments at low levels of population density and activity.

These can cause outburst floods that spread destruction far through the mountains and into the lowlands. More than 90 outbursts from impoundments behind such dams have been identified. Of the largest and most destructive, 17 were on the upper Indus River and 10 on the Yarkand. Unlike "dangerous lakes" recently reported elsewhere in the Himalaya, these events are associated with advancing glaciers, in some cases glacial surges. The lakes are short-lived, rarely surviving more than one summer. Their outburst styles and flood waves exhibit distinctive features. This paper summarizes the behavior and current status of advances of more than a dozen glaciers with histories of large impoundments. Recent developments are assessed in relation to historical records and the Karakoram glacier environment. Destructive outburst floods have already occurred on the Yarkand and may be imminent on the Indus. Problems of predicting dangerous outbursts are outlined, uncertainties raised by limited and mainly older investigations. Implications of global climate change appear different for these hazards in this region than reports of dangerous glacial lakes elsewhere in the Himalaya.																			0272-3646	1930-0557				NOV-DEC	2010	31	6					528	551		10.2747/0272-3646.31.6.528	http://dx.doi.org/10.2747/0272-3646.31.6.528													WOS:000285920400005

Sacred toponyms of Tuva: lexical and semantic groups	NOVYE ISSLEDOVANIYA TUVY-NEW RESEARCH OF TUVA												The article analyzes the names of sacred toponyms in Tuva, which are places or natural objects revered by the Tuvan people as having special power. Some of these names directly contain terms related to holiness, while others do not, but they do contain other terms that indirectly indicate a sense of sacredness. The research was based on the geographical names of certain sacred toponyms, as well as information gathered from residents of the area through scientific expeditions in the Republic of Tuva. The author also drew on personal memories from the older generation of their family, who were native to the village of Don-Teresin in the Barun-Khemchik district. When analyzing the names, several lexical and semantic groups were considered: names of sacred springs, rivers, lakes, names of sacred passes and hills, names of religious camps, and names of forest areas. Examples were given for each group, along with explanations from residents and descriptions of the characteristics of these places.

Designing Trust: Design Style, Political Ideology, and Trust in "Fake" News Websites	DIGITAL JOURNALISM												Assessments of the trustworthiness of news outlets necessarily implicate visual design. The design of the newspaper has been a hallmark of its credibility; a newspaper looks trustworthy. But the relationship between design and trust is more complicated in a digital era. Agents of mis- and dis-information produce lake" news outlets that look trustworthy, appropriating the design qualities of credible news outlets. This article brings together literature on trust in journalism, political esthetics, and pragmatist semiotics to analyze how fake news outlets seek to achieve trust. We conduct a visual analysis of both mainstream and "fake" news websites, identifying how "fake" news websites employ specific design elements in patterned ways that simultaneously (1) establish themselves as legitimate claimants to the label of "news outlet" and (2) differentiate themselves as outlets that can be depended upon to provide a certain class of political information that falls outside the mainstream. We argue that the news website is best understood as a design genre, within which there can be variations in design style. Fake news outlets must conform to the genre expectations of news websites. Beyond this, fake news websites must also employ design elements in ways that convey political ideology through style.

Mussel abundance ranged from 76 500/m(2) at 1.5 m depth to 344 300/m(2) at 4.5 m depth at the shoal (1990). Despite the almost total coverage of spawning beds walleye continued to spawn at the shed, with no apparent effect of the mussels on egg deposition, egg viability, and interstitial dissolved oxygen. Although preinvasion data for walleye egg deposition are not comparable to data from this study, deposition appears adequate based on good indices of recruitment of young-of-the-year walleye derived from resource agency trawling during 1990 and 1991. Thus there appears to have been no adverse impacts of zebra mussel on walleye reproduction in western Lake Erie during 1990 and 1991.																			0706-652X					MAR	1995	52	3					578	586		10.1139/f95-058	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f95-058													WOS:A1995RR80700014

It was revealed that the dominant aerosol ions are SO42-, NO3-, Cl-, Ca2+, Na+. In fire periods, an increase in the proportion of nitrate ions, chloride ions, calcium ions, sulfate ions, bromide ions in suspended particles on average up to 10 times or more compared to background conditions, as well as the proportion of metal ions (calcium, potassium, sodium). The found high correlation between potassium ions and chloride ions (r = 0.8-0.9) indicates the predominant proportion of potassium chloride in the composition of atmospheric aerosols at Baikal. In case of smoke emission from the centers of intense wildfires, the proportion of secondary components in the long-range transport of smoke aerosol as a result of its aging was higher than in a regional wildfire (51.6% versus 40.5%).

No explanation was found before the outbreak ended, several months before the antiprotease era. Factors associated with microsporidiosis diagnosis were HN infection, male homosexuality, low CD4 cell counts, and diarrhea, The major factor associated with a diagnosis of microsporidiosis during the outbreak was living in an area corresponding to one of the three water distribution subsystems of the town.

Multiscale Characteristics of Surface Winds in an Area of Complex Terrain in Northwest Utah	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												Climatological features of the surface wind on diurnal and seasonal time scales over a 17-yr period in an area of complex terrain at Dugway Proving Ground in northwestern Utah are analyzed, and potential synoptic-scale, mesoscale, and microscale forcings on the surface wind are identified. Analysis of the wind climatology at 26 automated weather stations revealed a bimodal wind direction distribution at times when thermally driven circulations were expected to produce a single primary direction. The two modes of this distribution are referred to as the "northerly" and "southerly" regimes. The northerly regime is most frequent in May, and the southerly regime is most frequent in August. January, May, and August constitute a "tripole seasonality" of the wind evolution. Although both regimes occur in all months, the monthly changes in regime frequency are related to changes in synoptic and mesoscale phenomena including the climatological position of the primary synoptic baroclinic zone in the western United States, interaction of the large-scale flow with the Sierra Nevada, and thermal low pressure systems that form in the Intermountain West in summer. Numerous applications require accurate forecasts of surface winds in complex terrain, yet mesoscale models perform relatively poorly in these areas, contributing to poor operational forecast skill. Knowledge of the climatologically persistent wind flows and their potential forcings will enable relevant model deficiencies to be addressed.																			1558-8424	1558-8432				JUL	2016	55	7					1549	1563		10.1175/JAMC-D-15-0313.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-15-0313.1													WOS:000380757600002

Groundwater-Surface water interactions research: Past trends and future directions	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Interactions between groundwater and surface water sustain groundwater-dependent ecosystems and regulate river temperature and biogeochemical cycles, amongst many other processes. These interactions occur in freshwater environments including rivers, springs, lakes, and wetlands, and in coastal environments via tidal pumping, submarine groundwater discharge, and seawater intrusion. Here, we explore groundwater-surface water interactions research using bibliometric analyses of titles, abstracts, and keywords from 20,275 journal papers published between 1970 and 2023 extracted from Scopus. Analyses show that research into groundwater-surface water interactions is highly multi-disciplinary, with growing contributions from the social and biological sciences. The number of groundwater-surface water interactions papers is rapidly increasing with over 1200 papers published per year since 2020. Drawing on our data-driven approach and expert knowledge, we synthesise current research trends and identify critical future research directions. Despite the thousands of papers on groundwater-surface water interactions, important processes are still difficult to quantify or predict at meaningful spatial scales to inform water-resources management. We see benefits in future groundwater-surface water interactions research focusing on: (1) using new technologies including internet-of-things-based sensors, uncrewed vehicles, and remote-sensing approaches for data collection to inform groundwater-surface water interactions at large scales, (2) seeking approaches to upscale site-specific findings to better inform management, and (3) continuing the movement towards multi-disciplinary investigations to better inform the understanding of groundwater-surface water interactions and processes that will enable better management outcomes.					; Tait, Douglas/O-5630-2017; Irvine, Dylan/HDM-4104-2022; Sebastian, Yakub/C-2502-2014	Singha, Kamini/0000-0002-0605-3774; Irvine, Dylan/0000-0002-3543-6221; Sebastian, Yakub/0000-0003-0499-6565													0022-1694	1879-2707				NOV	2024	644								132061	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.132061	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.132061		SEP 2024											WOS:001324838400001

This invasion provided an opportunity to examine both the responses of a population following establishment in a new area and the immediate response of the native community. We compared seasonal dynamics and several morphological and life history traits of C. pengoi both among and within the 4 years following its invasion into Lake Michigan. Samples collected from five nearshore sites in southwestern Lake Michigan from 1999-2002 indicated that the average density doubled from 75 individuals/m(3) in 1999 to 150 individuals/m(3) in 2002. We found no evidence for rapid changes in body size or average clutch size as the population established. We did, however observe a shift in seasonal phenology, with the population occurring in the water column earlier each year. By 2002, Cercopagis pengoi appeared in the water column by July and persisted until early fall. We also compared the average monthly densities of several potential prey items in August in the years before (1998-1999) and after (2000-2003) establishment. Although we found a significant reduction in the average number of rotifers, the general trend was a decline in all zooplankton species. Given the number of previously established exotic species in this system, it may prove difficult to quantify the impact of this most recent addition on what is left of the native community.																			0380-1330						2005	31	3					245	252		10.1016/S0380-1330(05)70256-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(05)70256-2													WOS:000232425200001

Climate warming and projected loss of thermal habitat volume in lake populations of brook trout	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We applied an ensemble of climate warming models to an iconic protected landscape (Algonquin Park, Ontario) and the seasonal temperature profile model for lakes to assess changes in brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) thermal habitat volume (THV) among lakes of different sizes in 30-year periods under two climate warming scenarios (RCP 4.5 and 8.5). Bayesian beta regression models show that lake size (surface area) and morphometry (dynamic lake ratio) are important factors in THV loss. THV loss increases as a function of the dynamic lake ratio (transition from bowl-shaped to dish-shaped lakes). The magnitude of this effect depends on the lake size category and the RCP scenario. Small (<100 ha) and medium (100-500 ha) dish-shaped lakes are projected to have greater THV loss in 2071-2100 (60%-100% of brook trout THV under RCP 8.5; 40%-70% under RCP 4.5) than large lakes (>500 ha) of similar shape.

J	Arrhenius, F; Hansson, S				Arrhenius, F; Hansson, S			Growth and seasonal changes in energy content of young Baltic Sea herring (Clupea harengus L)	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Growth rates, hatch-date distributions and seasonal changes in energy content of larval and juvenile herring (Clupea harengus), the major Baltic Sea zooplanktivore, were studied in a coastal area. The first microstructure (ring) shown in the otoliths (sagittae) was formed at the end of the yolk-sac stage. The following rings occurred regularly and showed a pattern corresponding to daily growth rings, as described in the literature, and we used these rings to age the fish. The average growth rate was estimated al 0.37 mm d(-1) and 0.58 mm d(-1) for larval and metamorphosed herring, respectively. The overall growth for ail young stages could be described with a fourth order polynomial relationship between length and age. Estimated hatching dates were distributed between March and June. This is earlier than normally assumed for the northern Baltic Sea and was probably caused by an early and warm spring in 1993. Our data indicate the highest survival for herring spawned from end of April to the middle of May. In terms of seasonal and yearly fluctuations in body composition, there was an increase in energy content from 2200 to 2800 J g(-1) wet weight and 2900 to 4800 J g(-1) wet weight for larval and metamorphosed herring, respectively, with nearly constant energy content during metamorphosis.

From 1986 to 1991, vertical profiles of water temperature, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a concentration, underwater light irradiance, and Secchi depths were measured at monthly intervals during the ice-free period. Average Secchi depth was 7.5 m. Metalimnetic oxygen maxima were observed every summer. The oxygen peaks were related to Chl a distribution and water transparency. A deterministic one-dimensional model was developed to simulate vertical dissolved oxygen (D.O.) profiles on a daily time scale throughout the open-water season. The model includes oxygen production by photosynthesis and surface reaeration as well as oxygen consumption by plant respiration and biochemical and sedimentary oxygen demand. The measurements suggest that the model must use different Chl a and sedimentary oxygen demand values in the surface mixed layer and below the surface mixed layer in conjunction with high transparency to obtain a metalimnetic oxygen maximum. Measured Chl a values are specified as input to the D.O. model. The model reproduces measured D.O. distributions with a standard error of 1.4 mg liter(-1) and shows the observed metalimnetic oxygen maxima. Model output changes only slightly with starting date of simulation and initial D.O. values. Simulated water temperature and D.O. distributions in the lake, especially the surface mixed-layer depth and the metalimnetic oxygen maxima, are sensitive to changes in water transparency.																			0024-3590					JAN	1995	40	1					105	118		10.4319/lo.1995.40.1.0105	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1995.40.1.0105													WOS:A1995QT29200009

After the cage culture of each family with ten replicates for 57 days, 30 individuals were randomly selected from each cage, totaling 15,300. Four growth traits were measured for genetic analysis in each mussel: shell length, shell height, shell thickness, and body weight. The heritability of each trait was 0.49 +/- A 0.37, 0.27 +/- A 0.29, 0.59 +/- A 0.39, and 0.47 +/- A 0.38, respectively. Phenotypic and genetic correlation between these four traits fell within the range of 0.89-0.95 and 0.97-1.00, respectively. Early growth traits of H. cumingii show sufficient genetic diversity for genetic improvement. Both phenotypic and genetic correlation between the four traits are high, and thus, the modification on one target trait may modify the remaining three traits accordingly.																			0967-6120	1573-143X				OCT	2012	20	5					927	933		10.1007/s10499-012-9518-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10499-012-9518-4													WOS:000308426500008

PRELIMINARY SURVEY OF THE MICROBIAL-POPULATIONS	ECOLOGY												A preliminary survey of 2 Montana lakes, made in the summer of 1951, compared the microbial populations of a large, oligotrophic lake - Flathead Lake - with that of a small, eutrophic lake - Rogers Lake. Water and bottom mud samples were obtained from contrasting situations and soil from adjacent shore areas. The microbial population in general showed a marked increase in numbers from water to mud to soil. Variations in numbers from the different localities of each lake, suggest that the region of the sample is more significant in determining population than the type of lake according to limnological classification. The high populations at the inlet of both lakes were especially notable. Counts also were analyzed for the presence of denitrifiers, urea decomposing micro-organisms, nitrifiers, chromogenic bacteria, Azotobacter, actino-mycetes and fungi.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1956	37	2					351	355		10.2307/1933145	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1933145													WOS:A1956WR62100014
J	Pala, Z; Sevgin, F				Pala, Zeydin; Sevgin, Fatih			Statistical modeling for long-term meteorological forecasting: a case study in Van Lake Basin	NATURAL HAZARDS												Predicting environmental variables for a sustainable environment is vital for effective resource management and regional development, especially in sensitive regions such as the Lake Van basin in eastern T & uuml;rkiye. This study focuses on long-term annual forecasts of important meteorological variables such as mean annual atmospheric pressure, wind speed and surface evaporation in the Van Lake basin. Long-term forecasts made using R-based statistical models such as AUTO.ARIMA, TBATS, EST, NAIVE, THETAF and HOLT-WINTERS are evaluated using mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Here, it has been observed that the AUTO.ARIMA model consistently stands out with better performance than its counterparts in the field of time series analysis when predicting the variables mentioned above. Such scientific studies, which are of great importance especially for the regional structure, add valuable information to the literature by determining a superior prediction model for meteorological events in the specific geographical context of the Lake Van basin. The results of the study have far-reaching implications for further improving predictive modeling techniques, improving the reliability of long-term meteorological forecasts, and decision-making in climate-related research and applications.

Hediye; Turkan, Ismail			Halophytes as a source of salt tolerance genes and mechanisms: a case study for the Salt Lake area, Turkey	FUNCTIONAL PLANT BIOLOGY												The worst case scenario of global climate change predicts both drought and salinity would be the first environmental factors restricting agriculture and natural ecosystems, causing decreased crop yields and plant growth that would directly affect human population in the next decades. Therefore, it is vital to understand the biology of plants that are already adapted to these extreme conditions. In this sense, extremophiles such as the halophytes offer valuable genetic information for understanding plant salinity tolerance and to improve the stress tolerance of crop plants. Turkey has ecological importance for its rich biodiversity with up to 3700 endemic plants. Salt Lake (Lake Tuz) in Central Anatolia, one of the largest hypersaline lakes in the world, is surrounded by salty marshes, with one of the most diverse floras in Turkey, where arid and semiarid areas have increased due to low rainfall and high evaporation during the summer season. Consequently, the Salt Lake region has a large number of halophytic, xerophytic and xero-halophytic plants. One good example is Eutrema parvulum (Schrenk) Al-Shehbaz & Warwick, which originates from the Salt Lake region, can tolerate up to 600mM NaCl. In recent years, the full genome of E. parvulum was published and it has been accepted as a model halophyte due to its close relationship (sequence identity in range of 90%) with Arabidopsis thaliana (L. Heynh.). In this context, this review will focus on tolerance mechanisms involving hormone signalling, accumulation of compatible solutes, ion transporters, antioxidant defence systems, reactive oxygen species (ROS) signalling mechanism of some lesser-known extremophiles growing in the Salt Lake region. In addition, current progress on studies conducted with E. parvulum will be evaluated to shed a light on future prospects for improved crop tolerance.

J	Pollard, AI; Reed, T				Pollard, AI; Reed, T			Benthic invertebrate assemblage change following dam removal in a Wisconsin stream	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Small dams (height <10 m) have transformed stream networks across the United States. Shopiere Dam was removed from Turtle Creek, a fourth order stream in Southeastern Wisconsin in the fall of 1999. We sampled three sites (upstream of the impoundment, immediately below the dam, and farther downstream) before and after dam removal to identify changes in the invertebrate assemblage following removal. Prior to removal, upstream and downstream sites had similar taxonomic composition. In contrast the dam site had more taxonomic variation. The upstream, dam and downstream sites responded differently to dam removal in analyses of diversity, functional feeding groups, and invertebrate composition. Upstream at the reference site, changes in functional feeding group composition appeared to be associated with a decrease in silt coverage. At the dam site, taxonomic composition changed following dam removal, however diversity and functional feeding groups remained similar. At the downstream site, the invertebrate assemblage remained similar in all analyses. Our observations indicate that the effects of dam removal were not uniform through the stream, rather each site responded in a different way.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB 1	2004	513	1-3					51	58		10.1023/B:hydr.0000018164.17234.4f	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:hydr.0000018164.17234.4f													WOS:000220784200005

In 1979/1980 white flocks occurred in Lake Veluwe after the inlet of water with a high calcium content. A high oversaturation with respect to calcite occurred at that time, presently (1985-1987) the oversaturation is much smaller. The intense photosynthesis decreased and maximum summer pH values came down from 10.0 to about 8.5. In laboratory experiments the coprecipitation of phosphate with calcite occurred only when the crystalization was initiated by adding seeds of calcite. Literature and this research show that the incorporation efficiency of phosphate decreases at lower phosphate concentrations. Literature data for the incorporation of P in CaCO3 in mg P [g Ca](-1) are fitted as 10.9 x [P](0.5) with r(2)=0.50. The coprecipitation at the actual low phosphate concentration in Lake Veluwe (1993) is not as efficient as in the period 1985-1987.																			0043-1354					JUL	1995	29	7					1781	1785		10.1016/0043-1354(94)00301-M	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(94)00301-M													WOS:A1995RA05600020
J	JOHNSON, RP				JOHNSON, RP			STUDIES ON THE LIFE HISTORY AND ECOLOGY OF THE BIGMOUTH BUFFALO, ICTIOBUS-CYPRINELLUS (VALENCIENNES)	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												The study was conducted mainly in 1955 and 1956 and was concentrated on two small eutrophic lakes in the Qu''Appelle River drainage of Saskatchewan. The bigmouth buffalo reaches its northern limit of range in the Qu''Appelle drainage. Migration into Saskatchewan was probably through postglacial connections at the headwaters of the Mississippi and Red River systems. In the lakes studied, the species prefers water shallower that 5 m. The relation of standard length to fork length and of fork length to weight is presented graphically, and the latter described by the equation: weight in pounds = (0.00097 fork length in inches)2.91. Length-frequency distributions and age determinations from scale reading show that the population studied was largely the very successful 1948 year-class, produced in a year of extensive flooding. Annulus formation occurred during the second or third week in June. Growth of the 1948 year-class in Pasqua Lake was extremely slow, probably influenced by the cool climate and population density here. Food of young buffaloes was mainly Cladocera and Copepoda. Larger buffaloes ate about 75% Entomostraca and 15% chironomids, the latter more important as the size of fish increased. Analysis of the living habits of the food eaten, and the feeding mechanism of the buffalo, shows that they occupy a food niche overlapping both bottom feeders and limnetic plankton feeders. Sexual maturation, especially of females, was extremely slow both in age and size as compared with southern populations. Examination of gonads suggests spawning occurs about May 18-25. Egg measurements indicate that females do not all spawn each year. The contention by other investigators that spawning is "triggered" by addition of fresh water analogous to normal spring floods of the Mississippi River is supported by the present study. The population in the Qu''Appelle drainage is probably dependent on the very sporadic production of strong year-classes. A more stable population would require association with regular spring floods of a nearby river or marsh. Commercial removal from the viewpoint of greatest productivity is most economical at the smallest marketable size, as yearly weight gains are probably more than offset by natural mortality.																									1963	20	6					1397	1429		10.1139/f63-095	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f63-095													WOS:A1963WV54600003

A calorimetry investigation of glass temperature and fragility of ancient ambers from Texas and Canada	JOURNAL OF NON-CRYSTALLINE SOLIDS												In prior work from this lab it was reported that the glass transition temperature (T-g)-fragility (m) or apparent activation (E-g) energy correlation for a series of ambers was similar to the behavior of aromatic synthetic polymers. In the present work we have broadened the range of ambers studied to include three Texas ambers and three Canadian ambers that have only recently been discovered and/or chemically classified. Upon comparison with the prior data, we find that the results for the Texas ambers fall within the same correlation of fragility and activation energy with glass transition temperature as was found previously. On the other hand, the Canadian ambers exhibit a very different behavior as reflected in very high fragility and activation energy at the Tg. We propose that, the observation is related to the unique crosslinking structure or other subtle chemistry differences in the polymer structure of the studied Canadian ambers.					; McKenna, Gregory/O-1134-2013	Cheng, Sixue/0000-0001-9461-1678; McKenna, Gregory/0000-0002-5676-9930													0022-3093	1873-4812				OCT 1	2019	521								119549	10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2019.119549	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2019.119549													WOS:000484644700052

Part 1: Bacterial abundance, community structure and nutrient levels	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The Arctic hosts a set of unique ecosystems, characterised by extreme environmental conditions and undergoing a rapid change resulting fromthe average temperature rising. We present a study on an aquatic ecosystemof the Revelva catchment (Spitsbergen), based on samples collected from the lake, river and their tributaries, in the summer of 2016. The landscape variety of the study site and the seasonal change in the hydrological regimemodify the availability of nutrients. In general, the upper part of the catchment consists of themountain rocky slopes which are especially abundant in iron minerals, sulphides and phosphorusminerals. The lower part of the catchment is covered by plants-lichens, saxifrages and bryophytes, which are a different source of nutrients. In the analysed water samples, the maximum concentrations of nutrients such as iron, boron and phosphorus were 0.28 mu g L-1, 4.52 mu g L-1 and 1.91 mu g L-1, respectively, in June, while in September, Fe and B reached the concentrations of 1.32 mu g L-1 and 2.71 mu g L-1, respectively. The concentration of P in September was belowthe detection limit of 1.00 mu g L-1, which may be explained by the necessity of bacteria to consume it immediately on current needs. We noted also an increase in TOC concentration between the June and September samples, which could originate both from the biomass accumulation in the catchment and the permafrost melting contributing to the hydrological regime of the river. The bacterial community developed in this environment consisted mainly of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phylum, while the presence of Acidobacteria was less pronounced than in other tundra-related environments. The described catchment shows that despite the relatively small amount of bioavailable nutrients, the Revelva systemis biodiverse and one of the most significant biogeochemical changes occurs there in response to seasonally switching water sources.

Here, we provide a spatially explicit continental-scale assessment of the opportunities for Pleistocene human occupation of Australia, the driest inhabited continent on Earth. We establish the location and connectedness of persistent water in the landscape using the Australian Water Observations from Space dataset combined with the distribution of small permanent water bodies (springs, gnammas, native wells, waterholes, and rockholes). Results demonstrate a high degree of directed landscape connectivity during wet periods and a high density of permanent water points widely but unevenly distributed across the continental interior. A connected network representing the least-cost distance between water bodies and graded according to terrain cost shows that 84% of archaeological sites > 30,000 y old are within 20 km of modern permanent water. We further show that multiple, well-watered routes into the semiarid and arid continental interior were available throughout the period of early human occupation. Depletion of high-ranked resources over time in these paleohydrological corridors potentially drove a wave of dispersal farther along well-watered routes to patches with higher foraging returns.					; Ulm, Sean/A-3854-2010; Bird, Michael/G-5364-2010	O'Grady, Damien/0000-0002-2355-2305; Ulm, Sean/0000-0001-6653-9963; Bird, Michael/0000-0003-1801-8703													0027-8424					OCT 11	2016	113	41					11477	11482		10.1073/pnas.1608470113	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1608470113								27671630					WOS:000384886900058

In two of the lakes, restrictions on fishing reduced mortality rates on adult walleye (Sander vitreus) during the study period. In these lakes, walleye populations increased concurrently with a decline in rainbow smelt populations. As rainbow smelt populations declined in both lakes, native cisco (Coregonus artedi) populations increased. Our analysis of walleye diets illustrated that walleye fed selectively on rainbow smelt but did not feed on cisco during the summer months. When entered into bioenergetics simulations, this information demonstrates that walleye predation alone was enough to cause the observed rainbow smelt declines in our study lakes. Our results indicate that increased walleye density allows for a parallel increase in cisco density. Based on our results, fishery regulations to restore walleye to high densities in lakes invaded by rainbow smelt may restore native planktivores that have co-evolved traits.

Cheshmeh-Sabz Lake (Iran) was screened in winter. The lake water was sampled at 5 degrees C and three strains of Scenedesmus sp. (dominant in BG-11), Ankistrodesmus sp. (dominant in WC), and Chlorella sp. (dominant in BBM) were identified using molecular methods. Strains' growth parameters, lipid content, and lipid productivity were also investigated at 8 and 25 degrees C. Scenedesmus sp. had the most biomass productivity (similar to 0.54 +/- 0.001 g/L*d) with no significant difference at 8 and 25 degrees C and demonstrated the highest amount of lipid productivity at 25 degrees C (9.43 +/- 1.05 g/L*d). Scenedesmus sp. produced the highest percentage of alpha-linolenic acid at 15 and 25 degrees C (10.96 +/- 1.5% and 11.07 +/- 0.31%, respectively) among the strains. There was no significant difference for palmitic acid content at 8, 15, and 25 degrees C (41.05 +/- 5.2, 38.48 +/- 4.25, and 39.82 +/- 1.58% respectively). Biomass productivity decreased in Ankistrodesmus sp. and Chlorella sp. at 8 degrees C in comparison to that of 25 degrees C (similar to 86% and similar to 34% decrease, respectively). Ankistrodesmus sp. produced the highest proportion of alpha-linolenic acid at 8 degrees C (9.98 +/- 0.10%). The highest percentage of palmitic acid was observed in Chlorella at 25 degrees C (44.41 +/- 7.56%). Based on the results, Scenedesmus sp. is the proper choice for outdoor cultivation at different seasons due to its relatively high biomass productivity and the specific growth rate in low and high temperatures (8 and 25 degrees C).

J	POSTEL, SL				POSTEL, SL			WATER - RETHINKING MANAGEMENT IN AN AGE OF SCARCITY	INTERCIENCIA												Viewed globally, freshwater supplies are undeniably abundant. The volume of freshwater naturally renewed each year could meet the needs of 5-10 times the existing world population. But water supplies are not always available where and when they are needed and demands in many water-short regions are escalating rapidly. New management techniques are necessary to stave off economically and environmentally damaging water shortfalls. Signs of stress include shrinking lakes, falling water tables, and diminishing stream flows. In the Soviet Union, the decline of the Aral sea has virtually eliminated regionally important fisheries, and the Caspian Sea''s sturgeon fishery.sbd.from which most of the world''s caviar comes.sbd.is also threatened. Water tables are falling under many of the world''s most produtive irrigated croplands. Farmers in the High Plains of the United States, the north plains of China, southern India, and elsewhere are pumping more water from underground aquifers than is recharged. Rising pumping costs are causing some growers to shift to dryland farming or retire their land from production. One-fifth of the irrigated cropland in the United States is supplied with water from the Ogallala Aquifer, an essentially nonrenewable groundwater supply stretching from southern South Dakota to northwest Texas. Rising pumping costs along with diminishing well yields from the aquifer''s depletion are forcing farmers to take land out of irrigation. In just four years, 1978 to 1982, irrigated area in Texas dropped by 20 percent, and throughout the six states most dependent on the Ogallala, the total area under irrigation declined by 592,000 hectares, or 7 percent. Governments continue to bank on more large dams and river diversion to relieve reginal shortages. But the high economic and environmental costs of these ventures make them risky, and twenty-year construction schedules leave little hope that they will deliver water in time to avert projected shortages. Much of the waste and inefficiency in today''s use of water results from pricing policies that rarely require customers to pay the true cost of the water they use. New legislation, regulations, and pricing arrangements are needed in order to achieve more rational and sustainable water management.																			0378-1844						1985	10	6					290	298																WOS:A1985AUD6200004

Each spring, freshet makes it the largest floodplain in the province of Quebec. Agricultural practices in the littoral increase the water turbidity, which deteriorate the habitat's quality of many fish species. However, measuring spatio-temporal turbidity patterns in the LSP floodplain remain difficult because turbidity is highly variable in space and time. This study aims to evaluate the potential to use an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to measure the water turbidity in the LSP's floodplain. The results show that the UAV can efficiently measure the variation of turbidity in the LSP with a RMSE of 28.22 FNU. We also compared the turbidity retrieved from UAV with those retrieved from Sentinel-2 observations. The results show that the two models are comparable, even if Sentinel-2 yields better results. However, challenges remain when using UAV for turbidity monitoring, such as software limitations for mosaics creation over large water bodies. Nevertheless, the high spatial and temporal information can provide insights into the complex water turbidity patterns which characterize floodplains. The method could help land use management to improve the water quality of these ecosystems.

Assessing the contribution of wet deposition N to intensive croplands is significant for recommending N fertilizers and minimizing environmental hazards. NH(4)(+)-N, NO(3)(-)-N, and total N concentrations in wet deposition, seasonal deposition N fluxes, and N loads in event-based runoff were determined for four consecutive wheat seasons in the Tai Lake Region. Wet deposition N during wheat seasons ranges from 11 to 15 kg ha(-1) (average, 13 kg ha(-1)), 61% of which is in the form of NH(4)(+)-N. NH(4)(+)-N concentrations range from 0.3 to 8.5 mg N L(-1) (average, 1.7 mg N L(-1)), showing greater temporal variations than do those of NO(3)(-)-N, which range from 0.2 to 4 mg N L(-1) (average, 0.8 mg N L(-1)). NH(4)(+)-N concentration in eventbased runoff from wheat fields is much lower than that in rainfall, whereas that of NO(3)(-)-N is equal to or higher than that in rainfall. N loss through runoff reaches 1.8 kg N ha(-1), accounting for 14% of wet deposition N. Results indicate that NH(4)(+)-N in wet deposition is prone to immobilization by the soil-crop system, whereas NO(3)(-)-N is relatively easily lost to runoff. The contribution of 11 kg ha(-1) wet deposition N should be adjusted in fertilizer N recommendations for winter wheat cultivation in this region. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Yet gaps persist in our understanding of water fluxes and their response to increased greenhouse gas forcing. The stable isotope ratios of oxygen and hydrogen in water provide a unique opportunity to evaluate hydrological processes and investigate their role in the variability of the climate system and its sensitivity to change. Water isotopes also form the basis of many paleoclimate proxies in a variety of archives, including ice cores, lake and marine sediments, corals, and speleothems. These records hold most of the available information about past hydrologic variability prior to instrumental observations. Water isotopes thus provide a 'common currency' that links paleoclimate archives to modern observations, allowing us to evaluate hydrologic processes and their effects on climate variability on a wide range of time and length scales. Building on previous literature summarizing advancements in water isotopic measurements and modeling and describe water isotopic applications for understanding hydrological processes, this topical review reflects on new insights about climate variability from isotopic studies. We highlight new work and opportunities to enhance our understanding and predictive skill and offer a set of recommendations to advance observational and model-based tools for climate research. Finally, we highlight opportunities to better constrain climate sensitivity and identify anthropogenically-driven hydrologic changes within the inherently noisy background of natural climate variability.					; Bailey, Adriana/J-2066-2015	Nusbaumer, Jesse/0000-0002-4370-3537; Bailey, Adriana/0000-0002-2614-1560; Dee, Sylvia/0000-0002-2140-785X; NOONE, DAVID/0000-0002-8642-7843														2752-5295				JUN 1	2023	2	2							022002	10.1088/2752-5295/accbe1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2752-5295/accbe1													WOS:001319230300001

We examined the role of altitude, seashore distance, lake size, season, and vegetation cover in affecting bird diversity and abundance on Navarino Island (54-55 degrees S, 67 degrees W) in the CHBR. We determined avian community composition, species richness and relative abundance for wetlands and their adjacent habitats on a seasonal basis. A total of 56 species belonging to 10 orders and 25 families were recorded, and significant seasonal changes for bird species (P = 0,001) and abundance (P < 0,01) were observed, with 33,9% residents, 48,2% winter migrants, and 17,9% With unknown migratory status. The distance of wetlands from the coastline was the main predictor variable for annual species richness (P < 0,01) and total avian abundance (P < 0,05). Wetlands far from the seashore and at higher altitudes had lower diversity and abundance, although the change in elevation was relatively slight (< 300 m). These data show the seasonal patterns and dynamics, as well as the major underlying mechanisms, for birds of wetlands and adjacent habitats in the CHBR.

It has been shown that a tree birch (Betula sect. Betula) grew in Yamal in the early Holocene (10.2-8.7 cal kyr BP) no less than 400 km north of the modern northern limit of distribution of Betula pubescens ssp. tortuosa. Favorable conditions for the existence of birch woodlands at this time were provided by a higher temperature of the growing season, exceeding the modern parameters of the warmest month of the summer season by approximately 3-4 degrees C. At the end of the early Holocene (after 8.5 cal kyr BP), forest vegetation began to degrade, and open landscapes with diverse plant communities of the subarctic tundra and single trees in the river valley spread. About 6.5 cal kyr BP, the northern subarctic tundra began to form the zonal appearance of the study area in climatic conditions close to modern ones.

SBA-15 was synthesized and characterized and used to design a GCE/Naf/MWCNTs/SBA-15 sensor, which was characterized by electrochemical techniques and used for the determination of IC and CBZ. Using the optimum conditions for differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), the peak currents were linear from 1.0 & mu;M to 11.0 & mu;M. The limits of detection for individual measurements were 0.50 & mu;M and 0.57 & mu;M for IC and CBZ, respectively, while those for simultaneous detection were 0.28 & mu;M and 0.30 & mu;M. The interferences studies show that GCE/Naf/MWCNTs/SBA-15 exhibited excellent selectivity. The developed procedure was successfully applied to determine IC and CBZ in spring, tap, and lake water.

We used terminal restriction fragment-length polymorphism (T-RLFP, a molecular genetic technique) to test for seasonal and spatial differences in bacterial composition in these same streams. We then related the above parameters, in conjunction with periphyton biomass and hyporheic respiration, to whole stream estimates of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) in a glacial and nonglacial stream, representing environmental extremes, in one of the catchments. The percentage of organic matter of sediments was 4-14% (0.01-0.04 g AFDM ml sediment(-1)), and counts of bacteria cells per millimeter of sediment averaged 2 X 10(6)-4 X 10(6). Bacteria counts correlated with sediment AFDM only for streams in the catchment with highest sediment AFDM levels. Bacteria composition (based on the presence and absence of terminal restriction fragments from T-RFLP analysis) changed seasonally in the different streams and differed between glacial and groundwater-fed streams. In the one catchment, hyporheic respiration averaged 0.0004 and 0.0003 g O-2 h(-1) kg sediment(-1) and was positively correlated with AFDM (r(2) = 0.23). Ecosystem metabolism displayed a strong seasonality, with GPP averaging 4.5 and 8.4 and ER averaging 5.4 and 9.9 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1) for the two sites, respectively, thus indicating a predominance of heterotrophy (P: R < 1) in these high-elevation, open-canopied systems.

Isotopic and Chemical Assessment of the Dynamics of Methane Sources and Microbial Cycling during Early Development of an Oil Sands Pit Lake	MICROORGANISMS												Water-capped tailings technology (WCTT) is a key component of the reclamation strategies in the Athabasca oil sands region (AOSR) of northeastern Alberta, Canada. The release of microbial methane from tailings emplaced within oil sands pit lakes, and its subsequent microbial oxidation, could inhibit the development of persistent oxygen concentrations within the water column, which are critical to the success of this reclamation approach. Here, we describe the results of a four-year (2015-2018) chemical and isotopic (delta C-13) investigation into the dynamics of microbial methane cycling within Base Mine Lake (BML), the first full-scale pit lake commissioned in the AOSR. Overall, the water-column methane concentrations decreased over the course of the study, though this was dynamic both seasonally and annually. Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) distributions and delta C-13 demonstrated that dissolved methane, primarily input via fluid fine tailings (FFT) porewater advection, was oxidized by the water column microbial community at all sampling times. Modeling and under-ice observations indicated that the dissolution of methane from bubbles during ebullition, or when trapped beneath ice, was also an important source of dissolved methane. The addition of alum to BML in the fall of 2016 impacted the microbial cycling in BML, leading to decreased methane oxidation rates, the short-term dominance of a phototrophic community, and longer-term shifts in the microbial community metabolism. Overall, our results highlight a need to understand the dynamic nature of these microbial communities and the impact of perturbations on the associated biogeochemical cycling within oil sands pit lakes.					; Jessen, Gerdhard/AAG-1605-2020; Slater, Greg/B-5163-2013	Warren, Lesley/0000-0002-1061-2700; Lindsay, Matthew B.

Dilution (decreasing base cation concentrations) was the primary factor in ANC depression during snowmelt, accounting for 75 to 97% of the ANC reduction. In lakes where acidification (increasing anion concentrations) was noted, nitrate and sulfate were equally important during the first half of snowmelt, while sulfate dominated the latter half. A linear model, based on the relationship between minimum and fall-overturn ANC for the lakes in our study, estimated that none of the 114 lakes sampled during the 1985 EPA Western Lakes Survey had been episodically acidified (ANC < 0). Modifications of the model were used to predict that approximately 6 and 10% of Sierran lakes will become episodically acidified with increases in nitrate and sulfate deposition of 50 and 150%, respectively. No lakes will be chronically acidified with these depositional increases.																			0043-1397	1944-7973				SEP	1999	35	9					2793	2804		10.1029/1999WR900151	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/1999WR900151													WOS:000082246800015

This work tests whether TIR remote sensing measurements with thorough spatial and temporal sampling can improve LST retrievals. Multi-temporal TIR data from 2000 through 2019 from Landsat 7 and 8 TIR instruments and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) were used to detect geothermal areas in the geologically active region of the southern Main Ethiopian Rift. In addition, field-based temperature data from 19 sites were evaluated for com-parison to the remotely detected geothermal anomaly areas. We have used the single-channel algorithm and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) method of emissivity retrieval to derive LST for each year. The result shows that the mean LST is highest in 2003 (320.1 K) and lowest in 2019 (303.1 K). The change in mean LST was between-9 K to 13 K. These LST results from ASTER images were validated with MODIS LST products and showed a correlation coefficient 0.6. LST of the year 2003 has been much closer to the actual temperature value from field data. Fifteen sites (79%) fit with the identified geothermal anomaly areas. LST values in known geothermal activity sites show no correlation (< 0.5) with time attesting. That is, even though LST varies with time (e.g., day and night and seasonal changes), the LST of areas with geothermal potential remain more or less constant on yearly basis.

Charcoal particles preserved in lake sediments are a widely employed fire proxy. Although many studies have calibrated the charcoal proxy, the spatial scales of charcoal dispersal and source area remain disputed. Understanding the spatial fidelity of charcoal accumulation is increasingly important in light of recent efforts to aggregate multiple charcoal records to infer changes in regional, continental- and global-scale fire regimes. Using a high-resolution sediment record from Swamp Lake, California, we compare charcoal accumulation rate (CHAR) variations of three size fractions of sedimentary charcoal (63-150, > 150, and > 250 mu m) to historical area burned data. We find that macroscopic ( > 250 and > 150 mu m) and mesoscopic (63-150 mu m) charcoal source areas are within 25, 35, and 150 km of Swamp Lake, respectively. We also use a dispersal model to confirm these findings. Our estimates of charcoal source area fall within the large range of estimates for forest fires in the literature. Further, our methodology shows potential for constraining source areas of charcoal in sedimentary records, which is requisite for the reliable inference of the spatial extent of fire in paleorecords.

Month, year and station were statistically significant factors affecting abundance estimates as were all interactions. Month was the largest source of variance either as a main effect or interaction. The smallest coefficients of variation were associated with subsampling (mean 6.1%) and replicate sampling (mean 15.1%). The between-station coefficient of variation averagedd 39.0% and tended to be highest during the summer. For a given station and month, the between-year coefficient of variation averaged 73.4%, while the between-month coefficient of variation for a single station in a given year averaged 95.1%. A table shows the estimated number of replications necessary to detect a true difference in 2 population means as a function of coefficient of variation. Environmental studies designed to detect spatial alterations should conduct such analyses on a cruise-by-cruise basis. Cruises should consist of a large number of stations and be conducted at least once during each season. Studies designed to detect temporal alterations require more frequent sampling because of the greater variability associated with temporal data sets. Because spatial variability adds little to the overall variability of such data sets, only a few representative stations need be sampled during each cruise.					; Evans, Marlene/NQC-4422-2025	Evans, Marlene/0000-0002-8869-1162; 													0018-8158	1573-5117					1983	99	3					215	223		10.1007/BF00008773	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008773													WOS:A1983QJ78800006

In tropical and subtropical regions, water mixing in these habitats is described as polymictic, yet little description exists for other large river floodplain lakes. In this study, the effect of thermal input on diel mixing was compared between subtropical Gal-gas Lake (GL)(1.2 m depth) connected to the Parana River, Brazil and temperate Crane Lake (CL)(0.5 m depth) connected to the Illinois River, USA. Physical, chemical, and microbial variables were measured at 3 h intervals on clear, nearly windless (avg. < 1.2 m s(-1)) days in summer (GL, 8-9 Jan 02; CL, 8-9 Aug 02). Nocturnal, convective mixing was evident for temperature (range: GL, 28-33 degrees C; CL, 23-32 degrees C) and oxygen (range GL. 23-196%; CL: 24-200%) in each system by nightfall (1930h) and correlated with differences in nitrate and ammonia. Although total bacterial density differed between surface and bottom water samples by afternoon. it was similar at both depths by evening (CL, 2230h) or early morning (GL, 430h). Did l mixing occurred in both systems and has important implications in nutrient cycling, coupling of oxic-anoxic processes. and distribution of microbiota.					; Lemke, Mike/AFC-8860-2022; Pagioro, Thomaz/AAE-4009-2020; Thomaz, Sidinei/A-7331-2013	Lemke, Michael/0000-0002-3714-3617; Pagioro, Thomaz/0000-0002-2169-6989; Lemke, Michael/0000-0002-1253-7767; 													0270-5060	2156-6941				SEP	2010	25	3					373	383		10.1080/02705060.2010.9664380	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2010.9664380													WOS:000281047300007
J	STEWART, KW				STEWART, KW			1ST COLLECTIONS OF THE WEED SHINER, NOTROPIS-TEXANUS, IN CANADA	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												Four collections of Weed Shiners (Notropis texanus) from the Winnipeg River, Manitoba, are the first of this species in Canada. The collections contained 345 specimens, including all size groups from under yearlings to mature adults of both sexes. It does not seem likely that introduction by man can account for this occurrence. Downstream dispersal from the Otter Tail River, Minnesota [USA], into the Red River and Lake Winnipeg is probably blocked by unsuitable habitat. Upstream dispersal from Lake Winnipeg into the Winnipeg River is blocked by a series of rapids and falls in the Winnipeg River, some of which may have been barriers to upstream fish movement. The most likely entry route of Weed Shiners into the Hudson Bay drainage seems to be from Mississippi River headwaters to Rainy River headwaters in Minnesota, even though the species has not been collected in those areas.																			0008-3550					OCT-DEC	1988	102	4					657	660																WOS:A1988U021100009

The single-cut clovers survived relatively well at all locations while the double-cut clovers did not survive well at 1 location during the 1st winter. An analysis of data for total dry-matter yield from 5 environments, i.e., location-year combinations, showed that the single-cut clovers outyielded the double-cut clovers in Newfoundland but yielded lower at the other locations. Among the double-cut cultivars, Florex, Lakeland, Tapiopoly and Violetta were desirable cultivars because they had a high mean yield and did not yield lower than the population average at any of the 5 environments. A large cultivar-environment interaction variance was detected for the double-cut cultivars; therefore, at least 15 test environments are required in future trials in order to detect a yield difference of 6% by multiple comparison procedures.																			0008-4220	1918-1833					1984	64	1					139	144		10.4141/cjps84-017	http://dx.doi.org/10.4141/cjps84-017													WOS:A1984SD37400017

Microbiota relevant interactions	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Antimony is ubiquitously present in the environment as a result of natural processes and human activities. Antimony is not considered to be an essential element for plants or animals. In this third review paper on the occurrence of antimony in natural waters, the interactions of antimony with microbiota are discussed in relation to its fate in natural waters. This paper covers the following aspects: occurrence in microbiota, uptake transport mechanisms, pathways of Sb(III) removal from cells involved in antimony tolerance, oxidation and reduction of antimony by living organisms, phytochelatin induction and biomethylation. This review is based on a careful and systematic examination of a comprehensive collection of papers on the above mentioned aspects of the subject. All data are quoted from the original sources. Relatively little existing information falls within the strict Scope of this review and, when relevant, discussion on the interactions of antimony with reference microorganisms, such as Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and different protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania, has been included.

J	Tomcko, CM; Pierce, RB				Tomcko, CM; Pierce, RB			Bluegill recruitment, growth, population size structure, and associated factors in Minnesota lakes	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												To better understand the differences among populations of bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, we analyzed the relationships between bluegill recruitment, growth, population size structure, and associated factors from approximately 2,600 Minnesota lakes. Potential explanatory variables for our models included bluegill year-class strength, growth, population size structure, the relative abundance and mean weight of predator species, physical and chemical characteristics of lakes, summer air temperature, and season. Bluegill year-class strength, growth, and population size structure were more strongly related to each other than to predator and lake characteristics, temperature, or season. Growth of age-6 bluegills was positively associated with population size structure and inversely related to year-class strength, suggesting density-dependent growth effects for adult bluegills. Growth of age-3 bluegills was inversely related to Secchi depth, so early growth and productivity may be linked. Bluegill population size structure was positively associated with length at age 5, as expected from the analysis of growth, and was inversely associated with mean year-class strength. Bluegill year-class strength was negatively associated with population size structure, length at ages 4 and 5, and lake area. Although predator variables were not included in one- or two-variable regression models, bluegill growth was positively related to the relative abundance of yellow perch Perca flavescens, walleye Sander vitreus (formerly Stizostedion vitreum), black bullhead Ameiurus melas, and brown bullhead A. nebulosus and negatively related to that of largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides and yellow bullhead A. natalis. The results suggest that management strategies for improving bluegill growth and population size structure should focus on bluegill recruitment and growth rather than on external environmental factors.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				FEB	2005	25	1					171	179		10.1577/M04-054.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M04-054.1													WOS:000228031200019

Inland diatoms from the McMurdo Dry Valleys and James Ross Island, Antarctica	BOTANY												Diatom taxa present in the inland streams and lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys and James Ross Island, Antarctica, are presented in this paper. A total of nine taxa are illustrated, with descriptions of four new species (Luticola austroatlantica sp. nov., Luticola dolia sp. nov., Luticola laeta sp. nov., Muelleria supra sp. nov.). In the perennially ice-covered lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, diatoms are confined to benthic mats within the photic zone. In streams, diatoms are attached to benthic surfaces and within the microbial mat matrix. One species, L. austroatlantica, is found on James Ross Island, of the southern Atlantic archipelago, and the McMurdo Dry Valleys. The McMurdo Dry Valley populations are at the lower range of the size spectrum for the species. Streams flow for 6-10 weeks during the austral summer, when temperatures and solar radiation allow glacial ice to rnelt. The diatom flora of the region is characterized by species assemblages favored under harsh conditions, with naviculoid taxa as the dominant group and several major diatom groups conspicuously absent.

J	Han, XX; Chen, XL; Feng, L				Han, Xingxing; Chen, Xiaoling; Feng, Lian			Four decades of winter wetland changes in Poyang Lake based on Landsat observations between 1973 and 2013	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake of China, is well known for its ecological importance as a dynamic wetland system. However, due to the significant seasonality of the lake's inundation area, no systematic study has assessed the wetland changes over the past few decades. We addressed this challenge by using four decades of Landsat observations ranging from 1973 to 2013. The images were acquired in the same season to ensure similar phenological and hydrological conditions during each year. Extensive training and validation samples were collected from high-resolution Quickbird imagery to develop a Support Vector Machines (SVM) method for wetland classification of Poyang Lake. To obtain consistent results from different Landsat instruments, an empirical line correction approach was introduced to adjust the sensor-associated differences in band configurations and spectral responses. Significant changes in the major wetland cover types in Poyang Lake were revealed from long-term classification maps. The vegetation coverage of Poyang wetland showed a statistically significant increasing trend during the overall period (15.9 km(2) year(-1)), and the vegetation tended to spread into the lake center in the Nanjishan Wetland National Nature Reserve (NWNNR) in recent years. At the same time, out-of-phase variability was observed for the mudflats since 1984, with a significant shrinking trend of -12.1 km(2) year(-1) (p < 0.05). Although sand coverage experienced a rapid decrease from 1973 to 1990 (from 544.3 km(2) to 62.9 km(2)), it remained at a relative stable low level (<100 km(2)) in the following period. The two national reserves in Poyang Lake shared change patterns similar to those of the entire lake. Although -70% of the long-term changes in the wetland vegetation area appeared to be explained by local temperature, there was rapid increase after 2002 possibly could be due to the impoundment of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) in 2003. The large sand area in 1973 was potentially linked to previous human activities in China between the 1950s and the 1970s. The method used in this study could be easily extended to other places in the world to assess the decadal wetland changes, and the information provided in this work is critical for future restoration efforts of the Poyang Lake wetland ecosystem.

A key concern for the CryoSat-2 orbit has been its long repeat period of 369 days, which is usually undesirable for river and lake monitoring. However, the results from the method developed in this study involving virtual stations show that the CryoSat-2 data can indeed be used for such monitoring by utilizing the high spatial coverage and the sub-cycle period of 30 days. The results show that it is possible to capture the peak flow occurring during late summer due to monsoonal precipitation and the melting of snow in the Himalayas. The evaluation of ClyoSat-2 river levels is performed by comparing with Envisat data in terms of annual signals and amplitudes. The obtained annual amplitudes agree well with the Envisat data, although CryoSat-2 exhibit larger differences. For five virtual stations in the Brahmaputra River, the mean difference between the obtained amplitudes is similar to 10 cm, whereas the mean phase difference is less than 2.7 days. A virtual station in the Ganges River shows a phase difference of around 5 days and a difference in amplitude of 2 cm. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in the Surface Microlayer of Lake Baikal during Wildfires and Naphthalene-degrading Strains from the Bacterioneuston	MICROBIOLOGY												The summer of 2015 was characterized by a large number of forest fires along the coastline of Lake Baikal. The concentrations of all analyzed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the surface microlayer of Lake Baikal during wildfires in August 2015 were significantly increased compared to August 2017, when there were fewer fires. Among the PAHs, naphthalene, phenanthrene and pyrene dominated in the surface microlayer in August 2015, while in August 2017, only naphthalene and its derivatives were prevalent.

J	HENSON, EB				HENSON, EB			EVIDENCE OF INTERNAL WAVE ACTIVITY IN CAYUGA LAKE, NEW-YORK	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Temperature observations from a station near the southern end of Cayuga Lake, New York, reveal variations in the depths of the isotherms which suggest the presence of temperature seiches, or internal waves. The theoretical period of oscillation of a uninodal internal wave, based on'' summer temperature conditions of the lake, ranges between 55 and 58 hours. A sequence of temperature observations at the level of the metalimnion for the first eight days of August, 1951, are presented, and the observed variations are in accord with the theoretical variations. The winds during the time under consideration were reinforcing and occurred in synchrony with the seiche movements, producing an amplitude in excess of 20 meters which is about twice the normal amplitude. Observations of surface currents and temperatures give supporting evidence for the presence of internal wave activity.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1959	4	4					441	447		10.4319/lo.1959.4.4.0441	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1959.4.4.0441													WOS:A1959WY36500007
J	Bunioto, SC; Arcifa, MS				Bunioto, S. Cristina; Arcifa, Marlene Sofia			Effects of food limitation and temperature on cladocerans from a tropical Brazilian lake	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Food limitation was tested in the laboratory by individual growth and reproduction of two cladoceran species, Ceriodaphnia richardi and Daphnia gessneri, from the shallow tropical Brazilian Lake Monte Alegre. The cladocerans were fed cultivated green alga Scenedesmus spinosus in concentrations of 0.20, 0.10, 0.05, and 0.025 mg C l(-1). Higher biomass and growth rates occurred in the two highest-food concentrations; the two lowest ones negatively affected clutch size and first reproduction. The threshold food concentration is lower than 0.025 mg C l(-1) and the incipient limiting level is a value between 0.10 and 0.20 mg C l(-1). The largest species, D. gessneri, was more sensitive to low food concentrations. The effects of low and high temperatures (19 and 27 degrees C) were evaluated by life table experiments with three cladocerans from the lake-Daphnia ambigua, D. gessneri, and Moina micrura-with no food limitation (1 mg C l(-1) of S. spinosus). Higher population growth rates for the three species were found at 27 degrees C; better performance in most life table parameters was observed for the former two species at the highest temperature, D. gessneri being the most sensitive to the lowest temperature. There are indications that temperature is an important abiotic factor that constrains populations of cladocerans for a short period in winter in the lake, when temperature decreases to 18-19 degrees C. However, its influence cannot be separated from a biotic factor such as food, whose effect is stronger in the cool season, when concentrations are lower and contribution of inedible algae is relatively higher.																			1386-2588					DEC	2007	41	4					569	578		10.1007/s10452-007-9114-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-007-9114-2													WOS:000250578100007

The Identification, Mapping, and Management of Seasonal Ponds in Forests of the Great Lakes Region	WETLANDS												Seasonal ponds are small, isolated wetlands with variable hydrology, often occurring embedded in upland forests, which provide habitat for amphibians and invertebrates uniquely adapted to fishless waters. Seasonal ponds are challenging to identify due to their small size, ephemeral hydrology, diverse vegetation, and occurrence across a range of settings, yet in order to inform their conservation and management, it is essential to understand their distribution and how management impacts them. We conducted a systematic review to define and quantify attributes of seasonal ponds, summarize mapping and inventory methods, and synthesize forest harvesting impacts on ponds in the western Great Lakes and northeastern United States. Definitions of seasonal ponds differ regionally and for scientific vs. regulatory purposes; the necessity of documenting pond-dependent indicator species (e.g., fairy shrimp) is one of the most vexing inconsistencies. Seasonal ponds are most effectively mapped in the spring, using a combination of aerial photographs or radar imagery and topographic information, especially in settings with small ponds or heavy canopies. Combining these mapping efforts with carefully stratified field validation is essential for developing a regional inventory of seasonal ponds. Most guidelines intended to reduce impacts of forest harvesting on pond ecosystems rely on buffers, which most effectively minimize physical or biological impacts when most lightly treated, although some impacts (particularly water levels) appear unavoidable when any harvesting occurs adjacent to seasonal ponds. Overall, distinct physical and biological impacts of harvesting differ in magnitude and direction, though most appear to subside over multi-decadal timescales.

Effects of Hypoxia on Consumption, Growth, and RNA:DNA Ratios of Young Yellow Perch	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												As in various freshwater and coastal marine ecosystems worldwide, seasonal bottom water hypoxia is a recurring phenomenon in Lake Erie's central basin. While bottom hypoxia can strongly affect sessile benthic animals, its effects on mobile organisms such as fish are less understood. We evaluated the potential for bottom hypoxia to affect the growth rates of yellow perch Perca flavescens, a species of ecological and economic importance in the lake. To this end, we (1) conducted laboratory experiments to quantify the effects of reduced dissolved oxygen on consumption, somatic growth, and RNA: DNA ratios (an index of short-term growth) of young yellow perch and (2) explored the effects of bottom hypoxia on young yellow perch growth in Lake Erie's central basin by collecting individuals in hypoxic and normoxic regions of the lake and quantifying their RNA: DNA ratios. Yellow perch consumption and growth in our experiments declined under hypoxic conditions (<= 2 mg O-2/L). While yellow perch RNA: DNA ratios responded strongly to experimental temperature, nucleic acid ratios were not significantly affected by dissolved oxygen or feeding ration. We did, however, observe a positive correlation between yellow perch growth and RNA: DNA ratios at low temperatures (11 degrees C). The nucleic acid ratios of yellow perch collected in Lake Erie varied spatiotemporally, but their patterns were not consistent with hypoxia. In short, while yellow perch consumption and growth rates respond directly and negatively to low oxygen conditions, these responses are not necessarily reflected in RNA: DNA ratios. Moreover, in central Lake Erie, where yellow perch can behaviorally avoid hypoxic areas, the RNA: DNA ratios of yellow perch do not respond strongly to bottom hypoxia. Thus, this study suggests that there is no strong negative effect of bottom hypoxia on the growth of young yellow perch in Lake Erie.

Seasonal and episodic variability in the morphodynamics of an ephemeral inlet, Zinkwazi Estuary, South Africa	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH					12th International Coastal Symposium (ICS)	APR 09-12, 2013	Plymouth Univ, Sch Marine Sci & Engn, Coastal Proc Res Grp, Plymouth, ENGLAND		Plymouth Univ, Sch Marine Sci & Engn, Coastal Proc Res Grp			The inlet dynamics of estuary and lake systems with ephemeral inlets have been little studied compared to systems with semi-permanent tidal inlets. Here we document the meso-scale dynamics of a barrier and its associated ephemeral inlet. The inlet is typically open during the rainy season and experiences closure during winter low flow periods. It does not migrate. The inlet is formed by fluvial overtopping of the barrier and when active, forms a small delta seaward of the channel and a small flood tide delta in the back-barrier. The tidal prism is insufficient to maintain the inlet and it is quickly sealed through wave-reworking of sand from the ephemeral delta when fluvial discharge diminishes. During a large ocean swell event coupled with abnormally high tides in 2007, a departure from this seasonal behaviour occurred. The barrier migrated 100 m landwards and formed a gently (1.74 degrees) seaward dipping sand sheet. Whereas the barrier had previously been narrow, it was widened by 80 m and rose 1.5 m in elevation. A breach later occurred and rapidly migrated northwards, establishing a significantly deeper inlet. This closed following wave reworking of a large ephemeral delta. Since then the barrier has maintained its landward position yet the inlet has continued to function as it did prior to the storm surge. This episodic barrier retreat appears to represent crossing of a morphodynamic threshold that triggered historically unprecedented rates of barrier rollover, creating a new set of inlet morphodynamic processes.

Investigating the invasion of the nonindigenous zooplankter, Eubosmina coregoni, in Lake Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The spread of nonindigenous species (NIS) over land and via interconnecting water bodies is threatening aquatic ecosystems worldwide. This study examines the invasion of the first known NIS zooplankter, Eubosmina coregoni, into Lake Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Analyses of cladoceran microfossils from a sediment core collected in the North Basin of the lake indicate this species first appeared in sediments dated to the late 1980s. An increase in total cladoceran accumulation rates coupled with increasing N, C, P, and chlorophyll a over the last 40 years provides evidence of eutrophication. Extant samples from fall 2002-2005 indicate that E. coregoni is mainly restricted to the North Basin while Bosmina longirostris is present throughout the lake. Results from this study provide baseline data regarding the invasion and establishment of E coregoni, a precursor to future NIS that may have substantial ecological and economic impacts on the Lake Winnipeg ecosystem.

A liquid handling platform with only the pipetting function module was employed to achieve automated multiple-sample pretreatment and eliminate manual errors. Green bio-derived solvents, gamma-valerolactone and eucalyptol, derived from renewable resources and exhibiting high environmental friendliness, were used as dispersant and extractant, respectively. The eucalyptol self-separated from the samples within 5 minutes, eliminating the need for centrifuges and demulsifiers. Four greenness evaluation tools confirmed that the BDS-ADLLME was an environmentally friendly sample pretreatment method meeting the requirements of green chemistry. The linear range was 0.006-3 mu g L-1 with R-2 > 0.999. The limit of detection was 0.002 mu g L-1. The BDS-ADLLME method successfully detected chlorantraniliprole and flubendiamide in tap, river, lake, and spring water samples, with recoveries and relative standard deviations ranging from 83.4-107.7% and 1.7%-5.4%, respectively. The BDS-ADLLME provides a feasible approach for developing automated eco-friendly dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction methods.

However, how the lake surface area expansion has influenced regional precipitation, especially its underlying mechanism, has not been investigated. By selecting the most dramatically expanded lake on the TP as a case study, this paper investigates the magnitude and extent of the precipitation response to lake expansion and its underlying mechanism using twin Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) simulations with and without lake expansion. The results show that the precipitation response to the lake expansion exhibits pronounced spatial and seasonal variations and is generally more intense in the downwind direction than in the upwind direction. During the wet season (the South Asian summer monsoon, SASM), precipitation decreases in the downwind area by -25% +/- 16% and -13% +/- 15% in the 0-50 km and 50-100 km intervals (from the lake's center), respectively. Conversely, the precipitation increases in the downwind area during the dry season (before the freeze and after the SASM) by 27% +/- 36% in the 0-50 km interval. The thermal and evaporative effects, which are generated by lake expansion and propagate in the downwind direction, are the key factors responsible for the precipitation changes. The cooling effect, which generally occurs in the daytime, stabilizes the atmosphere and triggers downward motion, consequently inhibiting precipitation. The warming effect has the opposite effect, and the additional water vapor strengthens this process. However, the effects vary with the seasons, causing seasonal variations in the precipitation response.					; Chen, Deliang/A-5107-2013; Xiong, Lihua/AAQ-3789-2020; Qiu, Yuanlin/KPB-5898-2024	Qiu, Yuanlin/0000-0001-5020-1693; Chen, Deliang/0000-0003-0288-5618; Xiong, Lihua/0000-0001-6990-2414; Li, Wei/0000-0002-7479-6828; 													2169-897X	2169-8996				AUG 16	2023	128	15							e2023JD039274	10.1029/2023JD039274	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023JD039274													WOS:001161692300001
J	BURNHAM, RJ				BURNHAM, RJ			PLANT DEPOSITION IN MODERN VOLCANIC ENVIRONMENTS	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF EDINBURGH-EARTH SCIENCES												Volcanic eruptions and their deposits provide paleobiologists with an array of depositional environments in which to investigate the conditions in which exceptionally preserved flora and fauna are preserved. Studies of vegetation patterns before and after eruptions have shown that tropical vegetation makes a very rapid recovery at the vegetational level (proportion of devastated land covered). The recolonisation of the rare elements of a diversified flora, however, is slow, and so is the rebound of floristic richness, assembled over centuries from surrounding patches of vegetation and from in situ speciation. Two major volcanic events that occurred in the past 15 years were studied in an attempt to understand the processes and complex patterns of plant deposition in volcanic landscapes. Both volcanoes gave rise to terrestrial, andesitic, explosive eruptions that gave little warning of their absolute magnitude or duration. In both eruptions, sediment-dammed lakes were formed in which a large quantity of plant material was trapped. In both instances, forests were killed and both standing and fallen trunks record the composition of the pre-eruption flora. The vegetation present in the vicinity of the volcanoes was, in the case of Mount St Helens (Washington, U.S.A.), dense coniferous forest living in a cool temperate climate and, in the case of El Chichon (Chiapas, Mexico), remnants of paratropical rainforest alternating with patches of agricultural land. Litter layers are present under the tephra at both volcanic sites, yet the pattern of deposition and quality of the plant material differs dramatically between the two, in part because of differences in the types of eruptions and in part because of the nature of the plants available for burial. One of the most significant styles of burial, unexpected in the air-fall ash deposits, is the presence of more than one eruptive layer generated by eruptions only hours apart. These separate eruption layers have different lithological characteristics and the plant deposits buried in the different layers are different in taxonomic composition. Significantly, leaves in the upland volcanic-ash deposits are preserved thus far for 10 years, even in the tropical settings where root growth might be expected to have obliterated all signs of depositional stratigraphy. These impressions and compressions have a high likelihood of entering the fossil record and provide an excellent example of upland deposition and preservation.

Eight littoral sites were sampled with seines, fyke nets, and gill nets in Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, in summer 1990. No one gear sampled the full composition represented by the total catch. Fyke nets best discerned differences among littoral fish assemblages. Young-of-year (age-0) bluegills Lepomis macrochirus and age-0 black crappies Pomoxis nigromaculatus caught in the fyke nets were the strongest discriminators among sites. Gill nets did not differentiate among sites. With the seine and fyke net, analysis of absolute abundance data detected differences among sites; analysis of presence-absence and rank abundance data did not. Fish caught in fyke nets were the most frequent significant correlates in site ordinations based on log-abundance data for taxa, defined as a combination of species, age (age 0 or adult) and gear type. Retention of gear designation in site ordination attributes facilitated the assessment of gears for differentiating littoral fish assemblages.																			0002-8487					NOV	1993	122	6					1111	1119		10.1577/1548-8659(1993)122<1111:AFDLFA>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1993)122<1111:AFDLFA>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1993MM66400008

These factors therefore limit large-scale effective management strategies. Evidence is growing that the quantity of eDNA may be related not only to species presence/absence, but also to species abundance. In this study, the concentrations of environmental DNA (eDNA) from a highly prized sport fish species, Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush (Walbaum 1792), were estimated in water samples from 12 natural lakes and compared to abundance and biomass data obtained from standardized gillnet catches as performed routinely for fisheries management purposes. To reduce environmental variability among lakes, all lakes were sampled in spring, between ice melt and water stratification. The eDNA concentration did not vary significantly with water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH and turbidity, but was significantly positively correlated with relative fish abundance estimated as catch per unit effort (CPUE), whereas the relationship with biomass per unit effort (BPUE) was less pronounced. The value of eDNA to inform about local aquatic species distribution was further supported by the similarity between the spatial heterogeneity of eDNA distribution and spatial variation in CPUE measured by the gillnet method.Synthesis and applications. Large-scale empirical evidence of the relationship between the eDNA concentration and species abundance allows for the assessment of the potential to integrate eDNA within fisheries management plans. As such, the eDNA quantitative method represents a promising population abundance assessment tool that could significantly reduce the costs associated with sampling and increase the power of detection, the spatial coverage and the frequency of sampling, without any negative impacts on fish populations.

Recent dynamics of hydro-ecosystems in thermokarst depressions in Central Siberia from satellite and in situ observations: Importance for agriculture and human life	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Alases, which are thermokarst depressions that are occupied by grasslands and lakes, are an important element of the Central Yakutian periglacial landscape. In recent decades, climatic changes in Central Yakutia have resulted in important changes in environmental conditions. We use different remote-sensing instruments (Landsat 8, TerraSAR-X, ENVISAT-RA2, and Jason-2) alongside in situ observations to investigate 1) the spatial distribution and water regime of alas lakes and their relationships with climatic and geomorphologic factors, 2) the relationship of the alas' grassland productivity with the water regime and 3) the potential of alas grasslands for local agriculture. During the 2002-2010 period, the lake water level rose by 1.3 m on average, resulting in lake expansion throughout the region. Since 2011, the lake area decreased and the water level declined by 70 cm on the middle terraces (low ground-ice content), while the wetting trend continued until 2016 at higher elevations. Small thermokarst lakes (<0.025 km(2)), which indicate regions of young thermokarst, comprise up to 11% of the total lake area and experience high (30%) seasonal variations. In situ observations of the grassland dynamics show their synchronous cyclic variability with the lake extent and a general increasing trend for their productivity since 1985. Around 50% of these dynamics can be explained by the amount of pre-winter precipitation with a delay of two years. We explain this delay through the buffering effect of watershed soils. The cyclic variability of alas hydro-ecosystems strongly affects the local agriculture, which is based on horse and cattle breeding. We estimate that these alas grasslands can provide enough forage supply for local communities. However, the real alas yield is several times less than the theoretical value because of grassland degradation that is caused by recent thermokarst and waterlogging in the most productive phytocenosis.

We also assessed the potential importance of nutrient flux from fish by comparing excretion estimates to empirically derived estimates of algal P demand. Population-level estimates of P excretion across the four lake-years were high relative to other published studies, peaking at 11.7 mg m(-3) d(-1) and occurring when fish densities exceeded 69 fish m(-3). Excretion rates peaked in late summer during maximal algal demand, and P excretion by fish exceeded algal demand in two of the four wetland-years. Detritus was a major diet component (up to 90% by mass), making fish excretion a major nutrient flux from wetland sediments to the water column. Consumer-driven effects could have strong influences on nutrient dynamics in prairie wetlands, ecosystems historically thought to be constrained largely by abiotic factors.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2006	51	1					197	207		10.4319/lo.2006.51.1.0197	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2006.51.1.0197													WOS:000237399700021

To determine if depth distributions shifted coincident with the early 1990s colonization of Lake Ontario by exotic Dreissena mussels, we calculated mean depth of capture for each of the three species during trawl surveys conducted annually during 1978-1997 and examined the means for significant deviations from established patterns. We found that mean capture depth of alewives, rainbow smelt, and age-2 lake trout shifted deeper during the build up of the dreissenid population in Lake Ontario but that timing of the shift varied among seasons and species. Depth shifts occurred first for rainbow smelt and age-2 lake trout in June 1991. In 1992, alewives shifted deeper in June followed by age-2 lake trout in July-August. Finally, in 1993 and 1994, the distribution of lake trout and alewives shifted in April-May. Reasons why the three fishes moved to deeper water are not clear, but changes in distribution were not linked to temperature. Mean temperature of capture after the depth shift was significantly lower than before the depth shift except for alewives in April-May. Movement of alewives, rainbow smelt, and age-2 lake trout to colder, deeper water has the potential to alter growth and reproduction schedules by exposing the fish to different temperature regimes and to alter the food chain, increasing predation on Mysis relicta in deep water and decreasing alewife predation on lake trout fry over nearshore spawning grounds in spring.																			0002-8487					SEP	2000	129	5					1096	1106		10.1577/1548-8659(2000)129<1096:SIDDOA>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(2000)129<1096:SIDDOA>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000165422300003

The present study specifies that 30% storage capacity of the reservoir has been reduced within 60 years because of rapid sedimentation, while the trend analysis indicates that 50% and 100% storage capacity will be blocked within 130 years and 250 years respectively, if the present state continues. Thus it reveals a 250 years' active life span of the dam. Average temporal WLF of the dam is 12 mts and significant at the 5% level of significance (p < 0.05) whereas, seasonal WLF is 8 mts and also significant at the 1% level of significance (p < 0.01). This temporal and seasonal WLF leads to significant rise and fall of water level that poses threat to the people of 92 villages situated within 1 km buffer area of the dam. Nine human risk alternatives (A1-A9) resulted from the WLF of the dam are identified using Delphi Questionnaire then rated and prioritized them using AHP method. Risk prioritization result varies from 9.90 to 10.29 calculated on the basis of consistency measure (CM) value. It indicates that 'Population displacement' (A3) and 'Inundation of settlement' (A2) are the highest (CM 10.29) and lowest (CM 9.90) vulnerable among the risk alternatives obtaining maximum and minimum CM values respectively.

Connectivity and Variability: Metrics for Riverine Floodplain Backwater Rehabilitation	STREAM RESTORATION IN DYNAMIC FLUVIAL SYSTEMS: SCIENTIFIC APPROACHES, ANALYSES, AND TOOLS	Geophysical Monograph Book Series											The importance of floodplain aquatic habitats that are seasonally or periodically connected to the main channel (backwaters) within lowland riverine ecosystems is well established. However, backwaters are becoming rare as development is transforming floodplain landscapes. Therefore, rehabilitation, protection, and management of riverine backwaters are becoming increasingly common, with annual expenditures in the millions of dollars. Even with the increasing number of projects, general criteria for selecting restoration goals and evaluating project outcomes are lacking. To address this need, Kondolf et al. (2006) proposed an approach for evaluating river restorations that is based on assigning a position to the system in a four-dimensional space that represents hydrologic temporal variability on one axis and connectivity in the three spatial dimensions on the remaining three axes. Use of the Kondolf approach for evaluating restoration of a backwater adjacent to a medium-sized river in northern Mississippi is presented as a case study, in which nearby degraded and less impacted backwaters were used as references. The restoration project resulted in a reduction in main-channel connectivity and lower levels of variability for the treated backwater. Additional responses to treatment included increased summer water depth, moderation of severe diurnal water quality fluctuations, and reductions in concentrations of solids, nutrients, and chlorophyll a. Fish species richness, numbers, and biomass were unchanged following rehabilitation, but trophic structure shifted away from omnivorous species and toward predators. Ecological services provided by floodplain riverine backwaters may be enhanced by modest management measures, but regaining and maintaining connectivity with adjacent ecological functional patches remains difficult.

Twelve different physico-chemical water parameters were measured, viz temperature, conductivity, colour, alkalinity, calcium, magnesium, chloride, sulphate, iron, copper, aluminium and pH. In addition nitrogen and phosphorus were analysed. Sampling of animals was carried out with baited traps at different times of the year during a six year period but with a focus on 1995-1998. The main objectives were to investigate the seasonal cycle of the physiological status. The vertical distribution was studied as well. The development of gonads, internal and external eggs, egg development, mating and hatching were noted as well as disease frequency. Females were active from the end of June or beginning of Jury until November. Males (and females without external eggs) were active all the year round. The sex ratio of the trapped crayfish (M:F) from December to June was 5:16, while it was close to one from July until November. Immature eggs were found in the gonads of the females all the year round. In July most females started to develop their eggs which gradually became yellow and finally brown-green. 58-80% of the females developed cement glands and thus prepared to mate. On most occasions the majority of the animals was found in the warmest temperature interval. However, in late autumn when the thermocline disappeared they became fairly evenly distributed from shallow waters down to the bottom. The temperature range of occurrence was 0-24 degreesC. There was no significant relative difference between length groups, nor any real difference between the sexes at various depths during the part of the year when the females were active. On average the length of females were shorter compared to males.																					3-8289-3403-X				1998							413	429																WOS:000168192200034

In 171 (61.1%) of 280 samples, isolates of Acanthamoeba with group II or III morphology, as well as Hartmannella spp. were recovered. Five isolates named "6" (artificial lake), Ep (lake), G2 (soil), R4* (river) and PK (spring water)-all exhibiting a highly efficient proliferation in axenic cultures-were subsequently cloned and subjected to molecular analyses for identification and genotyping In accordance with morphological findings, PCR-based analyses identified four isolates (6, Ep, G2, R4*) belonging to the genus Acanthamoeba. Confirmation of these findings was obtained by phylogenetic analysis using partial sequencing of the 18S rDNA (ASA.S1) Acanthamoeba-gene. Comparison of these sequences with corresponding regions from other Acanthamoeba strains available from GenBank sorted all four isolates into the sequence type group T4 that contains most of the pathogenic Acanthamoeba strains already identified. The fifth isolate (PK) exhibited morphological characteristics matching those of Hartmannella, and scored negative in the Naegleria fowleri and Acanthamoeba PCRs.					; Panaiotov, Stefan/AAR-6396-2021; Siles-Lucas, Mar/B-1113-2012; Walochnik, Julia/AAM-8963-2020; Aspöck, Horst/O-1990-2017; Tsvetkova, Nina/JVZ-5710-2024; Aspock, Horst/O-1990-2017	Panaiotov, Stefan/0000-0001-9997-5198; Siles-Lucas, Mar/0000-0002-1257-2562; Tsvetkova, Nina/0000-0002-4638-9379; Walochnik, Julia/0000-0003-0356-2853; Aspock, Horst/0000-0001-9407-3566													0932-0113	1432-1955				MAR	2004	92	5					405	413		10.1007/s00436-003-1052-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-003-1052-x								14760525					WOS:000220564200009
J	Wei, N; Gong, YF; He, JH				Wei Na; Gong Yuanfa; He Jinhai			Structural Variation of an Atmospheric Heat Source over the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau and Its Influence on Precipitation in Northwest China	ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data and a 47-year precipitation dataset are utilized to analyze the relationship between an atmospheric heat source (hereafter called < Q(1) >) over the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau (QXP) and its surrounding area and precipitation in northwest China. Our main conclusions are as follows: (1) The horizontal distribution of < Q(1)> and its changing trend are dramatic over QXP in the summer. There are three strong centers of < Q(1)> over the south side of QXP with obvious differences in the amount of yearly precipitation and the number of heat sinks predominate in the arid and semi-arid regions of northwest China (NWC), beside the northern QXP with an obvious higher intensity in years with less precipitation. (2) In the summer, the variation of the heat source's vertical structure is obviously different between greater and lesser precipitation years in eastern northwest China (ENWC). The narrow heat sink belt forms between the northeast QXP and the southwestern part of Lake Baikal. In July and August of greater precipitation years, the heating center of the eastern QXP stays nearly over 35 degrees N, and at 400 hPa of the eastern QXP, the strong upward motion of the heating center constructs a closed secondary vertical circulation cell over the northeast QXP (40 degrees-46 degrees N), which is propitious to add precipitation over the ENWC. Otherwise, the heating center shifts to the south of 30 degrees N and disappears in July and August of lesser precipitation years, an opposite secondary circulation cell forms over the northeast QXP, which is a disadvantage for precipitation. Meanwhile, the secondary circulation cell in years with more or less precipitation over the ENWC is also related to the heat source over the Lake Baikal. (3) The vertical structure of the heat source over the western QXP has obvious differences between greater and lesser precipitation years in western northwest China in June and July. The strong/weak heat source over the western QXP produces relatively strong/weak ascending motion and correspondingly constructs a secondary circulation cell in lesser/greater precipitation years.																			0256-1530	1861-9533				SEP	2009	26	5					1027	1041		10.1007/s00376-009-7207-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00376-009-7207-7													WOS:000269640900018

Schrenk spruce (P. schrenkiana) is a natural conifer species endemic to the arid inland areas of Asia. In this study, the relationship between tree-ring parameters of P. schrenkiana and major meteorological factors were analyzed, and the main limiting factors for tree radial growth and stable carbon isotope fractionation were explored. Our results indicate that moisture stress before and during the growing season have an important influence on radial growth of P. schrenkiana, especially, the correlation coefficient between tree-ring width and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) from previous August to current July is as high as-0.622 (n = 51, p < 0.01). Collinearity analysis further supports the conclusion that the limiting factor for the radial growth of P. schrenkiana is moisture. Although the correlation analysis results show that the tree-ring & delta;13Ccorr is significantly positively correlated with sunshine duration (SD), additional analysis based on first order difference variables suggests that the climate factor may not be the only limiting factor for the stable carbon isotope fractionation of tree rings in the Sayram Lake Basin. This lays the foundation for the assessment of forest management practices and carbon sink capacity in light of future climate change.

J	Hwang, SJ; Heath, RT				Hwang, SJ; Heath, RT			Zooplankton bacterivory at coastal and offshore sites of Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Two size classes of zooplankton (microzooplankton: 40-200 mu m: rotifers and nauplii, but protists were excluded; and macrozooplankton: >200 mu m; cladocerans and copepods) bacterivory at coastal and offshore sites in Lake Erie, USA, were determined in situ using both fluorescent and radiolabeled bacteria during the summers of 1993 and 1994. Bacterial abundance, cellular carbon content and productivity were significantly higher at the more eutrophic coastal site (P < 0.01). Bacterivorous rotifers usually dominated total rotiferan abundance at both sites. All cladocerans except Leptodora kindtii grazed bacteria, but most copepods did not. Microzooplankton (especially rotifers) were generally more important bacterial grazers than macrozooplankton (primarily cladocerans) at both sites, and accounted for 56 and 71% of total zooplankton bacterivory at the coastal and offshore sites, respectively. However, on four occasions (out of 16 cases) when cladoceran biomass was >60% of total zooplankton biomass, macrozooplankton bacterivory accounted for 54-95% of total bacterivory. Total zooplankton generally consumed 60% of bacterial productivity at the coastal site, while zooplankton bacterivory often exceeded bacterial productivity at the offshore site. Zooplankton consumed an average of 27 and 14% of daily bacterial standing stock at the coastal and offshore site, respectively. Considering the total community bacterivory, zooplankton were often more important bacterial predators than protists. Our results demonstrate the importance of bacteria as a carbon sourer for zooplankton in the Lake Erie food web, where rotifers can contribute significantly to total zooplankton bacterivory.					; Hwang, Sunjin/AAK-7149-2020	Hwang, Soon-Jin/0000-0001-7083-5036; 													0142-7873					APR	1999	21	4					699	719		10.1093/plankt/21.4.699	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/21.4.699													WOS:000079726200006

The acceleration that occurred in 2016 was unanticipated and exposed the valley bottom and an adjacent damned lake to high risk. This acceleration occurred in an active deep-seated gravitational slope deformation (DSGSD) controlled primarily by deep block-flexural toppling. In 2013, a highly accurate displacement monitoring system was developed and installed in the surroundings of the Great Aletsch Glacier, including a time-lapse camera, GNSS, and robotic total stations. This monitoring system provided unique data during the 2016 slope acceleration which are used in this study to assess failure mechanisms, landslide volumes, and subsurface displacement geometry. Based on a novel displacement vector analysis, we find that three retrogressive secondary rockslides developed during the first six weeks of the slope acceleration, with rupture surface depths of 30 to 40 m, and estimated volumes between 1 and 4 Mm(3). These rockslides display complex deformation features, including head and lateral scarps, which developed during the slope acceleration. The kinematics of these secondary rockslides changed through time, from primarily toppling to combined toppling and sliding. Our results provide a uniquely detailed understanding of the spatial and temporal evolution of deformation features and movement kinematics that occur when several sectors of a slowly moving DSGSD transitions into rapid rockslides.					; Loew, Simon/HMD-1753-2023; Manconi, Andrea/B-8367-2009	Glueer, Franziska/0000-0002-6014-4175; Manconi, Andrea/0000-0003-2930-4422; Aaron, Jordan/0000-0001-8414-106X; Loew, Simon/0000-0003-4014-1425													2169-9003	2169-9011				DEC	2019	124	12					2899	2919		10.1029/2019JF005019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019JF005019		DEC 2019											WOS:000502254600001
J	Haupt, M; Menzler, S; Schmidt, S				Haupt, M; Menzler, S; Schmidt, S			Flexibility of habitat use in Eptesicus nilssonii:: does the species profit from anthropogenically altered habitats?	JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY												In an environment subjected to rapid anthropogenic alterations, the distribution and abundance of mammalian species often reflect their flexibility in habitat use. The northern bat (Eptesicus nilssonii) is patchily distributed in Germany, where it is classified as a critically endangered species, but is abundant in Scandinavia. To assess its flexibility in habitat use, we radiotracked 10 females and 3 males captured at a maternity roost in Lower Saxony, Germany, during the summers 2002-2003. These bats had access to a variety of habitats including pristine areas (unimproved grassland and forest) and anthropogenically altered habitats (pastures, euthrophic lakes, urban area). The widely overlapping home ranges had a median area of 524 ha. They extended asymmetrically around the maternity roost and reflected a preference for elevations around and below roost level, that is, 365 m elevation. Males traveled up to 70 km per night during exploring flights. E. nilssonii used forest habitats opportunistically before birth of the young and avoided them thereafter, whereas most bats preferred urban habitats and especially streetlamps after births. Intraspecific encounters were more frequent after births, particularly around streetlamps, suggesting an increased intraspecific competition at these sites. Interestingly, females spent 27% but males only 3% of their foraging time hunting with conspecifics. Thus, the species is a habitat generalist for which urban areas provide a supplementary seasonal habitat. However, because such habitats may not always remain profitable, natural habitats of forest and grassland will remain essential to the survival of this bat species in Germany.																			0022-2372	1545-1542				APR	2006	87	2					351	361		10.1644/05-MAMM-A-193R1.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1644/05-MAMM-A-193R1.1													WOS:000237125800021
J	Budy, P; Luecke, C				Budy, Phaedra; Luecke, Chris			Understanding how lake populations of arctic char are structured and function with special consideration of the potential effects of climate change: a multi-faceted approach	OECOLOGIA												Size dimorphism in fish populations, both its causes and consequences, has been an area of considerable focus; however, uncertainty remains whether size dimorphism is dynamic or stabilizing and about the role of exogenous factors. Here, we explored patterns among empirical vital rates, population structure, abundance and trend, and predicted the effects of climate change on populations of arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) in two lakes. Both populations cycle dramatically between dominance by small (a parts per thousand currency sign300 mm) and large (> 300 mm) char. Apparent survival (I broken vertical bar) and specific growth rates (SGR) were relatively high (40-96 %; SGR range 0.03-1.5 %) and comparable to those of conspecifics at lower latitudes. Climate change scenarios mimicked observed patterns of warming and resulted in temperatures closer to optimal for char growth (15.15 A degrees C) and a longer growing season. An increase in consumption rates (28-34 %) under climate change scenarios led to much greater growth rates (23-34 %). Higher growth rates predicted under climate change resulted in an even greater predicted amplitude of cycles in population structure as well as an increase in reproductive output (R (o)) and decrease in generation time (G (o)). Collectively, these results indicate arctic char populations (not just individuals) are extremely sensitive to small changes in the number of ice-free days. We hypothesize years with a longer growing season, predicted to occur more often under climate change, produce elevated growth rates of small char and act in a manner similar to a "resource pulse," allowing a sub-set of small char to "break through," thus setting the cycle in population structure.																			0029-8549	1432-1939				SEP	2014	176	1					81	94		10.1007/s00442-014-2993-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-014-2993-8								24969617					WOS:000340680100007
J	ANDERSON, RS				ANDERSON, RS			HOLOCENE FOREST DEVELOPMENT AND PALEOCLIMATES WITHIN THE CENTRAL SIERRA-NEVADA, CALIFORNIA	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The pollen and plant macrofossils in sediments from three high-altitude lakes in the Sierra Nevada, California, document vegetation changes that have occurred over the last 12 500 years. Trees became established around the lakes by c. 10000 years ago. Early Holocene forests were structurally different from those of today; they were more open than at present, with more montane chaparral shrubs. Several, tree species characteristic of modern subalpine forest were rare and restricted to mesic habitats. Significantly drier conditons are inferred. By c. 6000 BB.P., effective precipitation had increased, as shown by an increase in subalpine conifers, principally Tsuga mertensiana (mountain hemlock) and Abies magnifica (red fir). The upper altitudial limits of many subalpine conifers began to fall c.2500 B.P., coincident with the beginning of Neogalcial cooling. The climatic interpretations are consistent with those previously described for the Pacific North-west region of North America, but not consistent with those for the American South-west.																			0022-0477	1365-2745				JUN	1990	78	2					470	489		10.2307/2261125	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2261125													WOS:A1990DX36700014

The 4 balsam fir stands were 25-65 yr old and were defoliated from 20 to 70% by spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem.)); the clearcut site was covered by logging debris and vegetation less than 1 m high. Rainfall interception in the balsam fir stands varied from 15.1 to 38.6%; it tended to decrease with increasing defoliation and to increase with increasing cover. During the summer of 1982, interception in the clearcut and the average for the lake Laflamme forested watershed were 32.3 and 35.0%, respectively. Stemflow (0.3 to 3.8%) was negligible in those stands.

This discovery offered the opportunity to study early changes in a population isolated in an environment quite different from what it previously experienced. The population was sampled in 1982, 1987, and 1991. Variation of plate morph frequencies was studied, and a prediction model for the change in frequencies is proposed. An increasing frequency of specimens with four dorsal spines is observed. This may be related to high summer temperature. Changes in morphology were recorded and compared with those in the marine population from which the isolated population originated. Discriminant analysis was used to reveal differentiation in morphometric characters. The main morphometric change recorded was that the isolated population had developed a more compact body, which is probably an adaptation to a less active, more benthic way of living.																			0008-4301					JUN	1993	71	6					1251	1258		10.1139/z93-171	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z93-171													WOS:A1993LU73200027

The abundance of these fish and possible competitive displacement of native species from aquatic food webs suggest that they will become an important prey item for predatory birds and sport fish. To date, there is very little information on the predation of round gobies by piscivorous birds in the Great Lakes. We used an abdominal palpation technique to stimulate regurgitation by double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) chicks in ground nests from colonies in Hamilton Harbour, western Lake Ontario, during the 2002 nesting season. We collected and identified all fish species present in regurgitated boluses. For tree-nesting birds, we collected fish that were regurgitated and fell to the ground as a result of targeted disturbance of particular nest trees. At all locations and times, alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) was the most abundant fish species present by a large margin. The second most abundant species was the round goby, which was present in the regurgitated stomach contents of chicks in a total of 18 percent of nests surveyed, and made up 1.8 to 11 percent of all individual fish specimens identified. Our results show that the round goby is already an important food item for breeding cormorants in Hamilton Harbour, despite relatively recent establishment of goby populations in western Lake Ontario. Fish species of sport or commercial interest were detected in our samples with extremely low frequency (< 0.1%).

Plankton Biocenoses of the Mountainous Shebety Lake (Zabaikalskii Krai, Russia)	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												Studies of phyto- and zooplankton were performed in summer 2002 and 2016 in the mountain Shebety Lake (Zabaikalskii krai, Russia). According to the hydrochemical composition, the lake waters belong to the hydrocarbonate-calcium type with a total mineralization of 30 mg/L. The littoral plankton biocenosis is characterized by higher species diversity and quantitative parameters in comparison with the pelagic plankton biocenosis. According to the principal component analysis, the hydrochemical composition of lake waters (pH, nutrient, and organic matter concentrations) is the main abiotic factor influencing the structural organization of the plankton community in the pelagic zone; in the littoral zone, these factors are the chemical features of the waters (pH, nutrient content, and cationic composition) and hydrophysical parameters (depth and water temperature). It was found that a combination of abiotic and biotic factors causes a different qualitative distribution of aquatic organisms in different zones of the lake. In the coastal zone, there is a great integration of the community; in the pelagic zone, the community exhibits a multicomponent nature.

However, there is still a lack of CH4 ebullition flux (eFCH(4)) and their temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) in shallow lakes, which might lead to large uncertainties in CH4 emission response from aquatic to climate and environmental change. Herein, the magnitude and regulatory of two CH4 pathways (ebullition and diffusion) were studied in subtropical Lake Chaohu, China, using the real-time portable greenhouse gas (GHG) analyzer-floating chamber method at 18 sites over four seasons. eFCH(4) (12.06 +/- 4.10 nmol m(-2) s(-1)) was the dominant contributing pathway (73.0 %) to the two CH4 emission pathways in Lake Chaohu. The whole-lake mass balance calculation demonstrated that 56.6 % of the CH4 emitted from the sediment escaped through the ebullition pathway. eFCH(4) was significantly higher in the western (WL: 16.54 +/- 22.22 nmol m(-2) s(-1)) and eastern lake zones (EL: 11.89 +/- 15.43 nmol m(-2) s(-1)) than in the middle lake zone (ML: 8.86 +/- 13.78 nmol m(-2) s(-1); p < 0.05) and were significantly higher in the nearshore lake zone (NL: 15.94 +/- 19.58 nmol m(-2) s(-1)) than in the pelagic lake zone (PL: 6.64 +/- 12.37 nmol m(-2) s(-1); p < 0.05). eFCH(4) was significantly higher in summer (32.12 +/- 13.82 nmol m(-2) s(-1)) than in other seasons (p < 0.05). eFCH(4) had a strong temperature dependence. Sediment total organic carbon (STOC) is an important ecosystem level Q(10) driver of eFCH(4). The meta-analysis also verified that across ecosystems the ecosystem-level Q(10) of eFCH(4) was significantly positively correlated with STOC and latitude (p < 0.05). This study suggests that eFCH(4) will become increasingly crucial in shallow lake ecosystems as climate change and human activities increase. The potential increase in ebullition fluxes in high-latitude lakes is of great importance.

Developing a stochastic hydrological model for informing lake water level drawdown management	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Winter drawdown (WD) is a common lake management tool for multiple purposes such as flood control, aquatic vegetation reduction, and lake infrastructure maintenance. To minimize adverse impacts to a lake's ecosystem, regulatory agencies may provide managers with general guidelines for drawdown and refill timing, drawdown magnitude, and outflow limitations. However, there is significant uncertainty associated with the potential to meet management targets due to variability in lake characteristics and hydrometeorology of each lake's basin, making the use of modeling tools a necessity. In this context, we developed a hydrological modeling framework for lake water level drawdown management (HMF-Lake) and evaluated it at 15 Massachusetts lakes where WDs have been applied over multiple years for vegetation control. HMF-Lake is based on the daily lake water balance, with inflows simulated by a lumped rainfall-runoff model (Cemaneige-GR4J) and outflow rate calculated by a modified Target Storage and Release Based Method (TSRB). The model showed a satisfactory performance of simulating historical water levels (0.53 <= NSE <= 0.86), however, uncertainties from meteorological inputs and TSRB determined lake outflow rate affected the result accuracy. To account for these uncertainties, the model was executed stochastically to assess the ability of study lakes to follow the Massachusetts' general WD guidelines: drawdown by Dec 1 and fully refilled by Apr 1. By using the stochastic HMF-Lake, the probabilities of each lake to reach the drawdown level by Dec 1 were calculated for different drawdown magnitudes (1-6 ft ). The probability results suggest it was generally less possible for most of study lakes to achieve a drawdown of 3 ft or more by Dec 1. Moreover, we employed the stochastic model to derive the annual latest refill starting dates that ensure a 95 % probability of reaching the normal water level by Apr 1. We found starting a refill in March for drawdowns up to 6 ft was feasible for most of study lakes.

Climatic comfort areas will increase and thus raising the quality of living in areas. The temperature values felt in the study were calculated with the SSI formula, and then the maps of the study area were classified. The study area was the Hayal Park and its surroundings in the Toros Quarter of Cukurova District, which is surrounded by multi-story and dense buildings in the north of Adana. Although the vertical construction is very high, it is richer in terms of green areas compared to other large central districts. Cukurova, which is one of the largest districts of Adana (according to population), has Seyhan dam lake in the north and Seyhan district in the south. The study area is on the border of Seyhan district and is adjacent to Yuregir and Saricam districts. With the portable Smart SENSOR AS 847 measuring device, temperature and relative humidity were measured at 1.5 m above the ground on Tuesday, August 20 at 07.00, at 14.00, and 21.00. Bioclimatic comfort areas were determined by measuring temperature and relative humidity at 25 points with different textures in the study area. In this study, measured instantaneous temperature (degrees C) and relative humidity (%) data were transferred to GIS medium by ArcGIS 10.6 program and then modeled with the Kriging method, which is one of the interpolation methods, and temperature and relative humidity maps were created. The temperature map created in degrees Celsius (degrees C) by the Kriging method and was converted to Fahrenheit degrees (degrees F) in the Raster Calculator. The reason for this change is that SSI is calculated with the formula Fahrenheit (degrees F). These maps were then calculated on the Raster Calculator using the SSI formula, and sensed temperature values were obtained The SSI, which normally has 8 classes, has 3 classes in the study area. These classes are 83 <= SSI < 91 slightly hot, 91 <= SSI < 100 hot, and 100 <= SSI < 112 very hot. When we look at the maps, the places outside of Hayal Park are in the hot class at 07.00 in the morning, and we can see that the green spaces have a positive effect on the bioclimatic comfort areas. The small area is in a very hot class. When we look at 14.00 h, it is a totally hot class. Normally, the temperature is the highest of these times and also coincides with the multi-story buildings in the study area; asphalt and concrete areas increased the temperature. As a result, there is a very hot air in the study area. It was determined that the maps identified non-comfortable areas. Since urban form and settlement affect climate comfort values, the urban plan should be revised, and the area should be brought to the bioclimatic comfort value range. For reducing the effect of temperature in the working area and creating comfortable areas is increasing the density of green areas compared to asphalt and concrete areas. Considering that the Cukurova district will grow further, urban planning should be done very well to reach the comfort range in the following settlements.					; Adıgüzel, Fatih/C-2998-2019; cetin, mehmet/O-4016-2015; Adiguzel, Fatih/C-2998-2019; Doğan, Mesut/AAC-7936-2020; Kaya, Efdal/JZD-1763-2024; Bozdogan Sert, Elif/ABC-5579-2021	Bozdogan Sert, Elif/0000-0002-4812-2360; KOSE, MUSTAFA/0000-0003-3206-2508; KAYA, EFDAL/0000-0002-5553-0143; cetin, mehmet/0000-0002-8992-0289; Adiguzel, Fatih/0000-0002-5978-2495; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				JUL	2022	194	7							519	10.1007/s10661-022-10172-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-022-10172-y								35731448					WOS:000814671000003

We assess here the suitability of the Optical Plankton Counter for estimating zooplankton abundance, as well as the day-to-day temporal and spatial patterns in its distribution during the open water season. The influence of certain environmental variables on zooplankton abundances is also examined. Abundances of mesozooplankton-sized particles were measured with the Optical Plankton Counter monthly at five stations in a large mesohumic lake from May to September 2005 and agreed rather well with zooplankton abundances counted using a microscope. The poorest agreement was in autumn, when the Counter overestimated the zooplankton abundance, and for some samples in July, when it underestimated the abundance. Fluorescence and chlorophyll a had a significant effect on the Counter readings. Both the intercept and the slope of chlorophyll a varied randomly between depths, because the chlorophyll a decreased much more markedly in deeper waters than did the Counter particle counts. This emphasized the stratified nature of sampling. In addition to seasonal variations, there were also marked short-interval variations (day-to-day) in zooplankton abundances in all the sampling periods. These patterns are highly dynamic and can on some occasions change rapidly in response to fluctuations in the weather. There were no clear differences in zooplankton abundance between the sampling stations. The horizontal heterogeneity was less pronounced than the seasonal and short-interval heterogeneity, possibly because there were no trophic gradients in the basin. While the Optical Plankton Counter provided a rapid assessment of temporal and spatial patterns of zooplankton abundances, it does have limitations. At times it either overestimated abundances due to a large contribution from non-zooplankton particles, or underestimated abundances due to coincidence.																			1463-4988	1539-4077					2010	13	2					164	175		10.1080/14634988.2010.481615	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634988.2010.481615													WOS:000278571700007
J	Young, GS; Sikora, TD				Young, GS; Sikora, TD			Mesoscale stratocumulus bands caused by Gulf Stream meanders	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												Examination of visible and infrared imagery from geosynchronous and polar orbiter satellites reveals the occasional existence of mesoscale cloud bands of unusual width and area, originating over the open northwest Atlantic Ocean during cold-air outbreaks. This phenomenon is of both dynamic and synoptic interest. As a dynamic phenomenon, it represents a mesoscale flow that is driven by transient surface features, which are meanders in the Gulf Stream. The forcing geometry and the resulting cloud pattern are similar in many respects to the anomalous cloud lines observed downwind of Chesapeake and Delaware Bays in similar conditions. These open ocean cloud bands are often of a larger scale, however, because the Gulf Stream meanders represent the largest-scale high-amplitude "coastal features'' in the western North Atlantic. These cloud bands are of synoptic interest because, when present, they play a major role in determining the cloud pattern over much of this oceanic region. Examination of surface and 850-hPa analyses demonstrates that these open ocean cloud bands occur during cold-air outbreaks and that they align approximately with the boundary layer wind. Comparison of visible and infrared satellite imagery with contemporaneous sea surface temperature analyses derived from infrared polar orbiter satellite imagery reveals that the open ocean cloud bands originate at the upwind end of Gulf Stream meanders. Climatological data and synoptic observations from land and sea indicate that these events occur only during that part of the spring season in which coastal temperature differences are small but cold-air outbreaks continue to reach the Gulf Stream. Examination of this observational evidence suggests that these open ocean cloud bands result from mesoscale solenoidal circulations driven by the horizontal gradients in sea surface temperature caused by Gulf Stream meanders.																			0027-0644					SEP	2003	131	9					2177	2191		10.1175/1520-0493(2003)131<2177:MSBCBG>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0493(2003)131<2177:MSBCBG>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000184951700013

Landscape Influence on the Browning of a Lake Watershed in the Adirondack Region of New York, USA	SOIL SYSTEMS												Watershed recovery from long-term acidification in the northeastern U.S. has been characterized by an increase in the influx of dissolved organic matter (DOM) into surface waters. Increases in carbon quantity and shifts to more aromatic and "colored" OM has impacted downstream lakes by altering thermal stratification, nutrient cycling and food web dynamics. Here, we used fluorescence spectroscopy coupled with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) to model predominant carbon quality fractions and their seasonal changes within surface waters along landscape positions of Arbutus Lake watershed in the Adirondack region of NY, USA. All DOM components were terrestrial in origin, however their relative fractions varied throughout the watershed. DOM in headwater streams contained high fractions of recalcitrant (similar to 43%) and microbial reprocessed humic-like OM (similar to 33%), sourced from upland forest soils. Wetlands above the lake inlet contributed higher fractions of high molecular weight, plant-like organic matter (similar to 30%), increasing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations observed at the lake inlet (492.5 mg L-1). At the lake outlet, these terrestrial fractions decreased significantly during summer months leading to a subsequent increase in reprocessed OM likely through increased microbial metabolism and photolysis. Comparisons of specific ultraviolet absorbance between this study and previous studies at Arbutus Lake show that OM draining upland streams (3.1 L center dot mg C-1 m(-1)) and wetland (4.1 L center dot mg C-1 m(-1)) is now more aromatic and thus more highly colored than conditions a decade ago. These findings provide insight into the emerging role that watersheds recovering from acidification play on downstream water quality.

Due to the tremendous changes in the underlying surface environment of the watershed in the past few decades, the watershed has become a typical region of ecological degradation. Drought affects the surface dynamics and characterizes the regional dry and wet environments, while the dynamic variation in lakes and vegetation are indicators of dynamic changes in land surfaces. Thus, a quantitative assessment of the response of lakes and vegetation to drought conditions at multiple temporal scales is critical for assessing the potential impacts of regional climate change on terrestrial ecosystems and ecological restoration. The standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), the spectral water index (NDWI) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were used to analyse the evolution of drought, the variation in lake surface area and the sustainable variation in vegetation. Furthermore, we quantitatively evaluated the response patterns of vegetation to droughts of multiple temporal scales (1-, 3-, 6-, 12-, 24-month). The conclusions showed that (1) overall, the area of Ebinur Lake experienced drastic fluctuations, and the lake area has decreased significantly since 2003, with a dynamic area of 817.63 km(2) in 2003 and 384.60 km(2) in 2015, and the lake area had shrank severely. (2) The interannual variation of wet and dry changed alternately during the observation period, and persistent drought events occurred from 2006 to 2010 across the Ebinur Lake watershed. (3) The vegetation area of cultivated land expanded continuously across the watershed, and the grassland degraded severely. (4) The changes in lake surface area are significantly correlated with the inflow water volume (correlation coefficient = 0.64, P < 0.01). (5) The vegetation of different terrestrial ecosystems exhibited heterogeneous responses to multiple temporal scales of drought in different seasons. The percentage was 72.78% of the total area, which showed a correlation between vegetation and drought conditions during the growing season period, and there were more impacts of drought on vegetation, with values as high as 64.33% of the area in summer, than those in other seasons.					; Wu, Pengfei/JOK-5781-2023; Cao, XiaoYi/H-1548-2017; Wang, Jingzhe/Q-4555-2019; tan, jiao/GRI-9525-2022	Zhang, Junyong/0000-0002-4307-8364; Teng, Dexiong/0000-0001-8742-230X; 													2045-2322					JAN 28	2020	10	1							1354	10.1038/s41598-020-57898-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-57898-8								31992731					WOS:000562863800008

Assessment of gravity wave momentum flux measurement capabilities by meteor radars having different transmitter power and antenna configurations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Measurement capabilities of five meteor radars are assessed and compared to determine how well radars having different transmitted power and antenna configurations perform in defining mean winds, tidal amplitudes, and gravity wave (GW) momentum fluxes. The five radars include two new-generation meteor radars on Tierra del Fuego, Argentina (53.8 degrees S) and on King George Island in the Antarctic (62.1 degrees S) and conventional meteor radars at Socorro, New Mexico (34.1 degrees N, 106.9 degrees W), Bear Lake Observatory, Utah (similar to 41.9 degrees N, 111.4 degrees W), and Yellowknife, Canada (62.5 degrees N, 114.3 degrees W). Our assessment employs observed meteor distributions for June of 2009, 2010, or 2011 for each radar and a set of seven test motion fields including various superpositions of mean winds, constant diurnal tides, constant and variable semidiurnal tides, and superposed GWs having various amplitudes, scales, periods, directions of propagation, momentum fluxes, and intermittencies. Radars having higher power and/or antenna patterns yielding higher meteor counts at small zenith angles perform well in defining monthly and daily mean winds, tidal amplitudes, and GW momentum fluxes, though with expected larger uncertainties in the daily estimates. Conventional radars having lower power and a single transmitting antenna are able to describe monthly mean winds and tidal amplitudes reasonably well, especially at altitudes having the highest meteor counts. They also provide reasonable estimates of GW momentum fluxes at the altitudes having the highest meteor counts; however, these estimates are subject to uncertainties of similar to 20 to 50% and uncertainties rapidly become excessive at higher and lower altitudes. Estimates of all quantities degrade somewhat for more complex motion fields.

Internal and external sources of THM precursors in a midwestern reservoir	JOURNAL AMERICAN WATER WORKS ASSOCIATION												Trihalomethanes (THMs) are contaminants of drinking water produced by the reaction between chlorine and natural organic matter. Determination of THM formation potential (THMFP) is a means of quantifying precursor abundance in waters from diverse sources. THMFP in river water entering and leaving Taylorsville Lake (Ky.) was measured to assess internal and external sources of THM precursors. THMFP in Taylorsville Lake was largely determined by watershed inputs. External inputs from tributary streams accounted for 80% of reservoir THMFP, and internal processes resulted in a net generation of 20%. Chlorophyll concentrations in the main tributary (Salt River) were comparable to those measured in Taylorsville Lake, suggesting that algal production in source waters may be important in regulating precursor supply to the reservoir. The highest THMFP was found in hypolimnetic samples, and peak export from the reservoir occurred during fall turnover, suggesting that decomposition of sedimenting organic matter both delayed and enhanced precursor release.					; Schultz, Richard/J-4015-2015	Bukaveckas, Paul/0000-0002-2636-7818; Schultz, Richard/0000-0003-3198-5263													2164-4535	1551-8833				MAY	2007	99	5					127	136																WOS:000246588600021

Population connectivity and genetic structure of burbot (Lota lota) populations in the Wind River Basin, Wyoming	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Burbot (Lota lota) occur in the Wind River Basin in central Wyoming, USA, at the southwestern extreme of the species' native range in North America. The most stable and successful of these populations occur in six glacially carved mountain lakes on three different tributary streams and one large main stem impoundment (Boysen Reservoir) downstream from the tributary populations. Burbot are rarely found in connecting streams and rivers, which are relatively small and high gradient, with a variety of potential barriers to upstream movement of fish. We used high-throughput genomic sequence data for 11,197 SNPs to characterize the genetic diversity, population structure, and connectivity among burbot populations on the Wind River system. Fish from Boysen Reservoir and lower basin tributary populations were genetically differentiated from those in the upper basin tributary populations. In addition, fish within the same tributary streams fell within the same genetic clusters, suggesting there is movement of fish between lakes on the same tributaries but that populations within each tributary system are isolated and genetically distinct from other populations. Observed genetic differentiation corresponded to natural and anthropogenic barriers, highlighting the importance of barriers to fish population connectivity and gene flow in human-altered linked lake-stream habitats.

A recently proposed SAR configuration for Earth observation called compact polarimetric (CP) SAR could be a good compromised choice between conventional (single or dual) and fully polarimetric SAR for operational sea ice observation. Given its enhanced radar target information compared to conventional SAR systems over wider swath coverage compared to fully polarimetric SAR systems, CP SAR systems could play important role in the new generation of Earth observation systems. In this study, fully polarimetric SAR images were collected over the Resolute Bay area during the fall of 2017. Acquired images are used for the simulation of CP SAR images and the derivation of a set of 23 CP SAR parameters from each image. The derived CP parameters were analysed in relation to the ice thickness and salinity of lake ice and fast sea ice. Results are compared against backscattering and decomposition parameters derived from the fully polarimetric SAR imagery.																			2153-6996		978-1-5386-9154-0				2019							5840	5842		10.1109/igarss.2019.8898560	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/igarss.2019.8898560													WOS:000519270605156

A variety of proxies are used for this purpose, including the Branched and Isoprenoid Tetraether (BIT) index. This is calculated from the concentrations of branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs), derived from unidentified terrestrial bacteria, and crenarchaeol, a marker for aquatic mesophile Thaumarchaeota (Crenarchaeota group I). As the index is a ratio, its value depends on both the crenarchaeol aquatic in situ production and the soil-derived branched GDGT input. Therefore, the BIT index reflects not only changes in the input of terrestrial or soil organic matter but also relative variations in aquatic Thaumarchaeota abundance in the water column. In fact, we show that in oceanic and lacustrine settings, the BIT index can be dominated by the aquatic end-member of the ratio. Consequently, the BIT index by itself can be an unreliable proxy to compare the input of terrestrial matter between sites and over time, and we propose that the quantification of branched GDGT fluxes or concentrations may instead be a better indicator of soil terrestrial inputs.

Social availability of residual woody biomass from nonindustrial private woodland owners in Minnesota and Wisconsin	BIOMASS & BIOENERGY												An important and potentially underused source of biomass that could be utilized in energy production is from nonindustrial private woodlands. We employ the Theory of Planned Behavior to estimate the social availability of woody biomass as a function of landowner behavior intent, landowner characteristics, forest land characteristics, and biomass price on stated willingness to harvest biomass in conjunction with a commercial timber harvest. A mail survey was administered to 1109 nonindustrial private woodland owners in a 26-county region in northeast Minnesota and northwest Wisconsin during the fall of 2009. Using binary logistic regression, we found payment level offered to harvest biomass plays a significant role in landowners' decisions, but that non-monetary factors are also important. Landowner attitudes and opinions regarding soil impacts, aesthetics, and energy independence were important predictors of stated willingness to harvest. Social norms as manifested through the influence of neighbors were also significant. These findings expand existing research and are useful for profiling nonindustrial private woodland owners to identify sustainable sources of biomass to supply a burgeoning bioenergy sector in the Lake States.

J	Jones, RI; Grey, J				Jones, RI; Grey, J			Stable isotope analysis of chironomid larvae from some Finnish forest lakes indicates dietary contribution from biogenic methane	BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												Larval chironomids (mostly Chironomus tenuistylus) were collected from the sediments of five small forest lakes in southern Finland during summer 2002. Carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios of larvae were determined by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Isotope ratio variability among 23 individuals from one lake was appreciable, with delta(13)C showing a range spanning 1.6parts per thousand and delta(15)N values a ran e spanning 5.6parts per thousand. Between the takes, larvae showed considerable variation in delta(13)C with values as low as -55parts per thousand. delta(15)N values were strongly correlated with delta(13)C values. The C-13-depletion found in the benthic chironomid larvae correlated with that found previously in zooplankton from the same lakes. It is argued that the low delta(13)C values are most likely attributable to incorporation of carbon from biogenic methane, and that methane production can therefore make an important contribution to benthic as well as to pelagic food webs in these small forest lakes.

J	KRAFT, CE				KRAFT, CE			ESTIMATES OF PHOSPHORUS AND NITROGEN CYCLING BY FISH USING A BIOENERGETICS APPROACH	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												A modelling approach based on bioenergetics was used to estimate the role of fish in nutrient recycling. Phosphorus excretion (P(or)) and nitrogen excretion by young-of-the-year (YOY) and older yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were estimated for a limnetic system: Lake Memphremagog. This model successfully predicted P(or) by comparison with previous estimates for yellow perch. YOY fish contributed more to limnetic nutrient cycling through excretion than older age-classes, and YOY fish could also serve as an important P sink relative to algal sinking losses. Volumetric P(or) by YOY yellow perch reached a maximum of 0.3 mug P.L-1.d-1; N excretion peaked at 10 mug N.L-1.d-1. The ratio of excreted N:P varied fourfold during the summer. P(or) estimates were also sensitive to changes in fish P content, for which few values have been reported for early life stages.																			0706-652X					DEC	1992	49	12					2596	2604		10.1139/f92-287	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f92-287													WOS:A1992KL53200019

In this study, a fluorinated covalent organic framework (COF) was synthesized at room temperature using tetra-(4-aminophenyl) methane (TAM) and 2,3,5, 6-tetrafluoro-terephthalal (TFTA) as building blocks and named as TAM-TFTA-COF. The adsorption characteristics of PFASs on the TAM-TFTA-COF were investigated through adsorption model-fitting and molecular calculation. The TAM-TFTA-COF was served as the solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridge packing for the enrichment of PFASs. Combined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, the proposed method showed good linearity in the range of 1.25-375 ng<middle dot>L-1, low limits of detection (0.03-0.24 ng<middle dot>L-1), and excellent intraday and interday precisions with RSD <10.3 %. Furthermore, this analytical method can be utilized for the determination of PFASs in tap water, spring water, and lake water with satisfactory accuracy.

Within-population variation in free-living adult and ectoparasitic larval trombiculid mites on collared lizards	HERPETOLOGICA												We quantified within-population variation in the seasonal abundance of free-living adult trombiculid mites and infestation of collared lizards by parasitic mite larvae at the Arcadia Lake Dam in Edmond, OK, U.S.A. Lizards oil one of two habitat patches (front) harbored many more larval mites, and were more rapidly re-infested after mites were removed experimentally. Although female and male lizards and males displaying alternative social tactics had different activity rates, they harbored similar numbers of parasites, which is inconsistent with the hypothesis that the degree of ectoparasitism is positively related to host activity. Heavy mite infestation of front patch lizards was related to greater exposure to vegetation/soil surrounding this habitat patch, and perhaps more favorable physical conditions there for mite reproduction and development. The abundance of free-living adult mites on the rock substrata occupied by collared lizards was temporally dissociated from infestation of lizards by mite larvae. Free-living adult mites were abundant in May, but demand precipitously in June shortly after larvae began to appear oil lizards. Larval parasites remained until lizards entered hibernacula in late summer. There was no effect of marked differences ill larval mite load oil any of the behavioral, and most of the life-historical variables that we measured. The exception was growth rate. First-year males grow faster than all), of the other social classes in this population, and their rates were reduced oil the front habitat patch suggesting a growth cost of heavy parasitism at a time when lizards exhibit maximal growth.																			0018-0831					JUN	2008	64	2					189	199		10.1655/07-052.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1655/07-052.1													WOS:000257417000006

Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding due to leeches is a rare phenomenon that is more common in less developed countries. Common symptoms include melena, hematemesis, pallor, weakness, and fatigue. Due to the similar symptoms of this issue to the main differential diagnoses of GI bleeding in pediatrics, such as diarrhea, constipation, diverticulitis, esophagitis, and anal fissures, it is challenging to differentiate it from the rest. Case presentation: We present a three-year-old boy who was transferred to our center with hematemesis, tarry stool, and a drop in hemoglobin level. He finally was diagnosed with a leech in his stomach. Conclusions: In less developed counties, the inability to reach safe drinking water, swim in lakes or springs, and inadequate awareness of public health information among individuals can be risk factors for leech infestation.

J	Pawluszek-Filipiak, K; Orenczak, N; Pasternak, M				Pawluszek-Filipiak, Kamila; Orenczak, Natalia; Pasternak, Marta			Investigating the Effect of Cross-Modeling in Landslide Susceptibility Mapping	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL												Featured Application Landslide Susceptibility Mapping using landslide inventory generated for the surrounding area can be generally carried out. However, the low reliability of such susceptibility map was observed in areas of critical geological structures. Thus, this should be borne in mind, when performing such a modeling in complex geological regions. To mitigate the negative effects of landslide occurrence, there is a need for effective landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM). The fundamental source for LSM is landslide inventory. Unfortunately, there are still areas where landslide inventories are not generated due to financial or reachability constraints. Considering this led to the following research question: can we model landslide susceptibility in an area for which landslide inventory is not available but where such is available for surrounding areas? To answer this question, we performed cross-modeling by using various strategies for landslide susceptibility. Namely, landslide susceptibility was cross-modeled by using two adjacent regions ("Lososina" and "Grodek") separated by the Ro(z) over dotnow Lake and Dunajec River. Thus, 46% and 54% of the total detected landslides were used for the LSM in "Lososina" and "Grodek" model, respectively. Various topographical, geological, hydrological and environmental landslide-conditioning factors (LCFs) were created. These LCFs were generated on the basis of the Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Sentinel-2A data, a digitized geological and soil suitability map, precipitation, the road network and the Ro(z) over dotnow lake shapefile. For LSM, we applied the Frequency Ratio (FR) and Landslide Susceptibility Index (LSI) methods. Five zones showing various landslide susceptibilities were generated via Natural Jenks. The Seed Cell Area Index (SCAI) and Relative Landslide Density Index were used for model validation. Even when the SCAI indicated extremely high values for "very low" susceptibility classes and very small values for "very high" susceptibility classes in the training and validation areas, the accuracy of the LSM in the validation areas was significantly lower. In the "Lososina" model, 90% and 57% of the landslides fell into the "high" and "very high" susceptibility zones in the training and validation areas, respectively. In the "Grodek" model, 86% and 46% of the landslides fell into the "high" and "very high" susceptibility zones in the training and validation areas, respectively. Moreover, the comparison between these two models was performed. Discrepancies between these two models exist in the areas of critical geological structures (thrust and fault proximity), and the reliability for such susceptibility zones can be low (2-3 susceptibility zone difference). However, such areas cover only 11% of the analyzed area; thus, we can conclude that in remaining regions (89%), LSM generated by the inventory for the surrounding area can be useful. Therefore, the low reliability of such a map in areas of critical geological structures should be borne in mind.

The evaluation result indicates that MODIS AODs (Collection 5, C005) are in good agreement with those from CE318 in dense vegetation regions, but show more differences in those regions with complex underlying surface (such as at lake water and urban surface sites). Reasons for these differences are discussed after removing cases with significant errors caused by validation scheme. The final validation result shows that MODIS AODs are in good agreement with CE318 with a correlation coefficient of 0.85 and RMS of 0.15. 90% of MODIS cases fall in the range of Delta tau = +/-0.05+/-0.20 tau, indicating MODIS aerosol retrieval algorithm, aerosol models and surface reflectance estimate are generally suitably reasonable for aerosol retrieval in YRD. However, MODIS AODs show a systemic errors with fitted line of y=0.75x+0.13, indicating underestimation of AOD when aerosol loadings are high. Aerosol models and surface reflectance estimations are dominant sources of MODIS aerosol retrieval errors. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Bradshaw, EG; Jones, VJ; Birks, HJB; Birks, HH				Bradshaw, EG; Jones, VJ; Birks, HJB; Birks, HH			Diatom responses to late-glacial and early-Holocene environmental changes at Krakenes, western Norway	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												A stratigraphic diatom sequence is presented for the period from 13,870-9,170 cal BP from Krakenes Lake, western Norway. Changes in species assemblages are discussed with reference to the changing environmental conditions in the Allerod, Younger Dryas, and the early Holocene and to the development of the aquatic ecosystem. The site is sensitive to acidification, and diatom-based transfer functions are applied to estimate the past pH status. The combination of rapid sediment accumulation together with an excellent calibrated radiocarbon chronology means that the rate of inferred pH change and associated increase in [H+] can be assessed and compared with recent, anthropogenically acidified situations. The Allerod diatom assemblages are dominated by benthic taxa particularly Fragilaria species, indicating an unproductive, alkaline, turbid, and immature system. Diatoms are absent in the early part of the Younger Dryas, but subsequently a sparse planktonic flora develops reflecting decreased turbidity and/or increased nutrient supply. A clear sequence of diatom assemblages is seen in the early Holocene. A short-lived peak of Stephanodiscus species indicating a period of increased nutrient availability occurred at ca. 11,500 cal BP. Throughout the early Holocene, acid-tolerant species increasingly replaced less acidophilous, circumneutral taxa. The lake became slightly more acid during the Allerod, but this was statistically insignificant in a trend test involving regression of pH or [H+] in relation to age. Diatom-inferred pH declined rapidly during the early Holocene period investigated (9,175-11,525 cal BP) with a statistically significant overall rate of 0.024 pH units per 100 yrs. This consisted of an older (ca. 11,525-10,255 cal BP) phase, where pH fell more rapidly at up to 0.095 pH units per 100 yrs; and a younger phase after ca. 10,500 cal BP where the pH fall was extremely slow (0.008 pH units per 100 yrs) and was not statistically significant. In the Allerod a combination of low catchment productivity together with disturbance, weathering, and minerogenic inwash ensured that the base-cation status remained relatively high. In the Holocene the catchment soils stabilised and base cations were sequestered by terrestrial vegetation and soil. This resulted in reduced base-cation leaching and this, together with the production of organic acids caused the lake to acidify, reaching an equilibrium by ca. 10,000 cal BP.

Stoichiometric relationships in vernal pond plankton communities	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The light-nutrient hypothesis (LNH) predicts that changes in light supply can alter the balance of nutrient and energy limitation in primary producers. We tested this prediction by examining temporal changes in vernal forest ponds, which are highly dynamic systems with respect to seasonal change in light and nutrient supply. In three vernal ponds that differ in productivity, we measured changes in light, total and seston nitrogen and phosphorus, and seston carbon and chlorophyll during the spring, before and after tree leaf-out. We also quantified changes in the population dynamics of the major zooplankton grazers in these systems. 2. In each pond, nutrient levels increased and light levels declined, creating a temporal shift in light-nutrient supply to the plankton. Results generally supported predictions of stoichiometric theory and the LNH, but there were notable exceptions. 3. Seston C : N : P ratios rapidly changed in response to dramatic increases in N and P supply rates. However, seston N : P was typically lower than values for total N : P in the water. Furthermore, as predicted, we observed a decline in seston C : P as the light : nutrient ratio declined, but seston C : N simultaneously increased. These results suggest an unexpected shift towards potential nitrogen limitation. Alternatively, this change in nutrient ratios may be driven by a seasonal change in phytoplankton composition or nutritional mode. 4. Seston carbon concentrations remained stable despite seasonal changes in grazing intensity associated with the phenology of large-bodied Daphnia grazers. However, chlorophyll concentrations declined dramatically as the season progressed, resulting in a simultaneous decline in the C : Chlorophyll ratio of seston. Both pond shading and increased grazing probably contributed to the decline in chlorophyll.

The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) ecohydrological model, an open source program, provides flexibility for modification to capture different components of hydrological processes in a given catchment. In this study, two new approaches were tested to simulate the hydrological processes of a karst system in the Zagros Mountains, Iran. The major modifications used in these two methods included adjusting the percolation rates in karst hydrologic response units (HRUs) using SWAT-Maharlu Lake (SWAT-ML), and modification of the crack flow module using SWAT-Crack Flow (SWAT-CF). Hydrological datasets from 1980 to 2013 were used for calibration and validation of surface runoff, baseflow, crop yields, and actual evapotranspiration. Both modified models outperformed the standard SWAT model in simulating runoff. The respective average Nash Sutcliffe Efficiencies of the original SWAT, SWAT-ML and SWAT-CF were 0.64, 0.68 and 0.66. Also, the results showed that higher deep aquifer infiltration values were estimated in the modified models versus the standard SWAT for a karst HRU, which reflects more accurate levels of recharge to the deep aquifer. However, the results showed that karst conditions and geometry of sinkholes in karst zones did not play a major role in creation of runoff.

However, how thermal stratification responds to rainfalls of different intensities and changing hydrological processes has not been documented very well. Here, high frequency water column profiles at three stations in a large subtropical deep reservoir (Lake Qiandaohu, China) in 2017 were used to elucidate the impacts of rainfall on lake physical process and chemical environment. The impact of rainfalls on the thermal stratification and dissolved oxygen in riverine zone was more impressive than that in transitional and lacustrine zones. The effect on thermal stratification by rainfall was largely affected by the magnitude of rainfall. Moderate and heavy rainfall events could reduce the thermal stability of water column, deepen the mixing layer depth, and shape the thermocline, resulting from decrease of surface water temperature and increased inflows. While rainstorms could totally break up thermoclines in the riverine zone by high volume inflow flushing. In addition, we found that the hypoxia and anoxia initial depths increased during rainfall events in this reservoir, which were well related to the changes of mixing layer depths. This research highlights that quantifying the effects of rainfalls on thermal stratification and dissolved oxygen will be beneficial for optimizing reservoir management.					; Zhang, Yunlin/N-5464-2014; , 张一波/AAY-5453-2020; Shi, Kun/O-2638-2013; Liu, Miao/AAH-9655-2021	Shi, Kun/0000-0002-6124-7512; Zhang, Yunlin/0000-0002-3382-4570; Liu, Miao/0000-0002-3888-1849; Zhang, Yibo/0000-0001-5542-2495													0885-6087	1099-1085				JUL 15	2020	34	15					3387	3399		10.1002/hyp.13826	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.13826		JUN 2020											WOS:000540468400001

We addressed this knowledge gap by developing a methodology that uses existing datasets to locate GDEs (including groundwater-dependent springs, lakes, rivers, wetlands, and species) and assess threats to groundwater quantity and quality. Here we report on the application of this method across the US state of Oregon. Nearly 40% of watersheds in Oregon contain two or more types of GDEs termed "GDE clusters" - indicating the widespread importance of groundwater to ecosystems. Documented problems may underestimate the threat to ecosystems from altered groundwater supply or quality. Although documented occurrences of water-table declines are limited, high densities of permitted wells (for irrigation or other commercial purposes) pose a threat to groundwater availability in 18% of GDE clusters. Furthermore, although only 5% of GDE clusters have known groundwater contamination, our assessment indicates that 30% of GDE clusters are threatened with groundwater contamination by nitrates, 30% by industrial chemicals, and 70% by pesticides. This initial assessment of GDEs and threats to their groundwater supply highlights the ecological importance of groundwater and the need to incorporate protection of GDEs in water management policy.																			1540-9295					MAR	2011	9	2					97	102		10.1890/090108	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/090108													WOS:000288058100014

Applications of a hydro-biogeochemical model and long-term simulations of the effects of logging in forested watersheds	SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE												We simulated hydrological and biogeochemical responses to logging in a forested watershed to determine the vulnerability and/or resiliency of the forest ecosystems in the Lake Shumarinai Basin in northern Hokkaido, Japan. We used a biogeochemical model (PnET-CN) and a rainfall-runoff model (HYCYMODEL) to predict ecosystem responses. The PnET-CN model simulated well the observed NO3 (-) concentrations in streamwater, particularly at high concentrations during snowmelt; however, the model could not simulate small increases in NO3 (-) during the summer. By considering hydrological processes within the watershed and combining the model with the HYCYMODEL (PnET + HYCYMODEL), the seasonality of streamwater NO3 (-) concentrations was better simulated. Using these models, the long-term effects of logging were simulated for coniferous, deciduous, and mixed forests. NO3 (-) concentrations in streamwater increased in response to the logging disturbance in both coniferous and deciduous forests. In the coniferous forest, NO3 (-) concentrations reached a maximum 10 years after logging, and high concentrations persisted for 30 years. In contrast, NO3 (-) concentrations in the deciduous forest reached a maximum within 3-4 years and recovered to pre-disturbance levels after 15 years. We also used the models to determine the effects of different sizes and types (coniferous, deciduous, and mixed forest) of logging areas on Lake Shumarinai. The model results indicated that large areas of cutting require more than 100 years for complete lake recovery. Whereas the annual discharge to the lake minimally increased, the annual NO3 (-) load greatly increased. Our simulation results elucidate the vulnerability and resiliency of forest ecosystems and provide valuable information for ecosystem management.

Three palaeoenvironmental phases are recognized: (1) the Late Glacial, with the inflow of the river before 10,000 yr B.P.; (2) the early to mid-Holocene, with temporary bypassing of the river between 10,000 and 4850 yr B.P.; and (3) the mid- to late Holocene, without river input after approx. 4850 yr B.P. During periods with river input, rhythmites were deposited, Ostracods indicate a well oxygenated hypolimnion, suggesting deep ventilation enhanced by the river inflow. The diatom assemblage indicates eutrophic to mesotrophic conditions and is dominated by generally well preserved periphytic species, The high number of unidentifiable pollen suggests oxidation during transport in the river. During periods without river input, a massive calcareous silt with abundant authigenic calcite was deposited, diatoms indicate a change to mesotrophic and oligotrophic conditions, and decreased sedimentation rates and higher alkalinity enhanced the dissolution of diatoms. Terrestrial and littoral molluscs as well as periphytic diatoms indicate erosion of the shore when the lake level rose or fell with onset or offset of the river inflow, Before 12,600 yr B.P., the patchy vegetation cover led to intensive soil erosion and high sedimentation rates. The lake was still frozen during the winter months. After approx, 12,600 yr B.P. the sediment changed from elastic rhythmites to thinly bedded, non-glacial rhythmites, the vegetation cover became denser, the abundance of ostracods increased, and molluscs started to colonize the profundal zone of the lake. The Younger Dryas (approx. 10,700-10,000 yr B.P.) displays maximum abundance of ostracods, indicating deep ventilation. The transition to the Holocene is characterized by a change in the ostracod assemblage and the river bypassed the lake between approximately 10,000 and 8900 yr B.P. When the river reentered the lake after approximately 8900 yr B.P., a new ostracod species appeared, After two short periods of river bypassing between approximately 7200 and 6950 yr B.P., diatoms indicate a higher trophic level about 6000-5000 yr B.P. associated with higher erosion rates and increased nutrient input due to Neolithic agricultural activities. After approximately 4850 yr B.P, the river bypassed the lake again and the trophic level decreased. In contrast to the early to mid-Holocene periods of decreased oxygen supply, the mid- to late Holocene is characterized by deep ventilation. This is attributed to the northward retreat of the polarfront and enhanced westerlies consequent to decreased insolation after 6000 yr B.P. The change of the river flow pattern correlates with glacier oscillations and may suggest a climatic control. The final cessation of the inflow is attributed to diversion of the river consequent to isostatic uplift and late Neolithic clearance activity. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Fluorescence microscopy coupled with image analysis allows quantifying silicon (Si) deposition over time and a simple distinction between cells that are actively depositing Si and those that are not. Diatom assemblage was exclusively dominated by Fragilaria crotonensis Kitton, which formed pronounced subsurface maxima (2-6.5 m). Concentrations of the main nutrients (Si and phosphorus, P) were low over the whole season; however, at depth, the nutrient availability was higher than at the surface. Fragilaria silica deposition rates were eight times higher at the surface than at depth. Half the population was involved in silica deposition at the surface, while only 20% active cells were doing so at depth. At the surface, silica deposition was limited by P deficiency; the effect of dissolved Si (DSi) was not statistically significant. Silica deposition at depth was significantly constrained by low light availability despite the 1% average light attenuation at depth, which is supposed sufficient for photosynthesis. This study represents the first attempt to employ the PDMPO technique coupled with quantitative image analysis of PDMPO fluorescence in freshwater ecology. On the basis of our results, PDMPO probe appears to be an appropriate proxy for the study of resource limitation in natural diatom populations.

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and phylogenetic tree, strain RCRI7T falls into genus Shewanella. Closely related type strains include Shewanella xiamenensis S4(T) KJ542801, Shewanella profunda DSM15900(T) FR733713, Shewanella putrefaciens LMG 26268(T) X81623 and Shewanella oneidensis MR-1(T) AE014299. Anaerobic incubation of the bacteria in the presence of U(VI) led to uranium removal from the solution and formation of a black precipitate. Analysis of the precipitate using UV-vis confirmed the reduction of U(VI) to U(IV). The effects of pH, temperature, U(VI) concentration and cell density on uranium removal were elucidated. The maximum uranium removal was 97%. As a conclusion, the findings revealed the ability of the local strain RCRI7 for U(VI) bioreduction as an effective bacterium for uranium immobilization.																			0033-8230					FEB	2017	105	2					109	120		10.1515/ract-2016-2628	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/ract-2016-2628													WOS:000394247400003

The biovolume of different phytoplanktonic taxa significantly differed between depth ranges. Different algal taxa showed maximum population density at different depths as a result of different optima of light, physical conditions, and nutrients. The layer at 9-13 m depth showed the greatest abundance of phytoplankton, mainly represented by Bacillariophyceae and Cyanobacteria. Conversely, Chlorophyceae, which require few nutrients and are not inhibited by high light energy, were most abundant at the surface. The vertical heterogeneity in phytoplankton distribution closely paralleled that of nutrients, which in turn depend on the stable thermal stratification of the lake water column. Biovolume of phytoplankton taxa and chemical parameters did not differ significantly between sampling sites some kilometers apart due to large horizontal water movements in the lake that create relatively uniform conditions throughout the basin.

J	VINCENT, WF				VINCENT, WF			THE DAILY PATTERN OF NITROGEN UPTAKE BY PHYTOPLANKTON IN DYNAMIC MIXED LAYER ENVIRONMENTS	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The transport and assimilation of the various forms of biologically available nitrogen by phytoplankton, and the subsequent biosynthesis of N-containing macromolecules, have the potential to respond in different ways during the daily growth cycle. This review examines five types of effect that may influence the daily pattern of nitrogen uptake and metabolism: light versus dark (the day/night cycle); changes in irradiance during the day (including the diurnal rise and fall in photon fluence rates); circadian rhythms (endogenous patterns of variation which may continue in the absence of external environmental forcing); periodic variations in exogenous nitrogen supply, and the 24-hour dynamics of stratification and mixing. The hydrodynamic effects operate through a variety of direct and indirect controls, and can substantially modify the diel rhythmicity of phytoplankton growth.					; Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019	Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				AUG 14	1992	238						37	52		10.1007/BF00048772	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00048772													WOS:A1992JN34700004

The 30 ka Aira caldera eruption sequence consists of Osumi pumice fall (OS), Tarumizu pyroclastic flow deposit (TM), Ito ignimbrite (IT) and co-ignimbrite ash (AT), in ascending order. Oriented samples were collected by drilling for OS, TM and welded ignimbrites, and by cubing for non-welded (unconsolidated) pyroclastic flow deposit. We systematically sampled Ito ignimbrite with the degree of welding as: non-welded (IT1), moderately welded (IT2), and strongly welded (IT3) facies that is limitedly distributed in north of Aira caldera. Mean paleomagnetic directions of OS, TM, IT1 and IT2 are consistent with those previously reported for AT and welded facies of IT. Although OS samples were collected from multiple pumice clasts at proximal locations, we obtained well-defined mean paleomagnetic directions corresponding to those of co-eruptive pyroclastic flow (TM). This suggests that even clast-supported and non-welded pumice fall can retain thermoremanent magnetization at the time of deposition. Significance tests for our mean paleomagnetic directions showed that of all sequential units of the Aira caldera-forming eruption deposits, only IT3 has a different paleomagnetic direction. Based on reported paleosecular variation changing rates in Japan, and on the angular difference associated with error of the two paleosecular directions, we estimate the time gap between IT3 and IT2, to be 24.3 +/- 16.3 years. A conductive cooling model explains this time difference as due to differences in cooling time between quickly, and slowly cooled parts of a thick single ignimbrite unit. Although the possibility that multiple flow units occurred within tens of years of each other cannot be excluded, there are no observations of clear flow unit boundaries in the Ito ignimbrite to support the suggestion that the Aira caldera-forming eruption sequence was deposited within a shorter time than years. In addition, the age of Iwato pyroclastic flow deposit, which has been situated between 60 and 45 ka, was estimated by calculating the angular distance between the mean paleomagnetic direction and the modeled secular variation curve from the GGF100 ka. As the result, we determine the most probable age to be around 56 ka.

J	Nelson, CE; Carlson, CA				Nelson, Craig E.; Carlson, Craig A.			Differential Response of High-Elevation Planktonic Bacterial Community Structure and Metabolism to Experimental Nutrient Enrichment	PLOS ONE												Nutrient enrichment of high-elevation freshwater ecosystems by atmospheric deposition is increasing worldwide, and bacteria are a key conduit for the metabolism of organic matter in these oligotrophic environments. We conducted two distinct in situ microcosm experiments in a high-elevation lake (Emerald Lake, Sierra Nevada, California, USA) to evaluate responses in bacterioplankton growth, carbon utilization, and community structure to short-term enrichment by nitrate and phosphate. The first experiment, conducted just following ice-off, employed dark dilution culture to directly assess the impact of nutrients on bacterioplankton growth and consumption of terrigenous dissolved organic matter during snowmelt. The second experiment, conducted in transparent microcosms during autumn overturn, examined how bacterioplankton in unmanipulated microbial communities responded to nutrients concomitant with increasing phytoplankton-derived organic matter. In both experiments, phosphate enrichment (but not nitrate) caused significant increases in bacterioplankton growth, changed particulate organic stoichiometry, and induced shifts in bacterial community composition, including consistent declines in the relative abundance of Actinobacteria. The dark dilution culture showed a significant increase in dissolved organic carbon removal in response to phosphate enrichment. In transparent microcosms nutrient enrichment had no effect on concentrations of chlorophyll, carbon, or the fluorescence characteristics of dissolved organic matter, suggesting that bacterioplankton responses were independent of phytoplankton responses. These results demonstrate that bacterioplankton communities in unproductive high-elevation habitats can rapidly alter their taxonomic composition and metabolism in response to short-term phosphate enrichment. Our results reinforce the key role that phosphorus plays in oligotrophic lake ecosystems, clarify the nature of bacterioplankton nutrient limitation, and emphasize that evaluation of eutrophication in these habitats should incorporate heterotrophic microbial communities and processes.					; Carlson, Craig/LWI-9996-2024; Nelson, Craig/H-3323-2019	Nelson, Craig/0000-0003-2525-3496; 													1932-6203					MAR 31	2011	6	3							e18320	10.1371/journal.pone.0018320	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0018320								21483836					WOS:000289057200057
J	French, JRP; Jude, DJ				French, JRP; Jude, DJ			Diets and diet overlap of nonindigenous gobies and small benthic native fishes co-inhabiting the St. Clair River, Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus), after successfully reproducing in the early 1990s, decimated populations of mottled sculpins (Cottus bairdi) and possibly logperch (Percina caprodes) in the St. Clair River. Studies were conducted during 1994 to determine whether diets of round and tubenose (Proterorhinus marmoratus) gobies overlapped with those of native forage fishes. In the nearshore zone (depth : 1 m), round and tubenose gobies, logperch, and rainbow darters (Etheostoma caeruleum) of similar sizes (total lengths < 75 mm) consumed mainly small-sized macroinvertebrates (dipterans, Caenis, and amphipods) during June 1994. Logperch and rainbow darters were present in the nearshore zone only during this month. At the crest of the channel slope (depth = 3 m), round gobies and northern madtoms (Noturus stigmosus) ate mostly ephemeropteran nymphs (Hexagenia and Bactisca), while predation on zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) and other mollusks by round gobies was minimal. Northern madtoms did not feed on mollusks. Diet overlap between round gobies and native fishes was not observed at the channel slope (depth = 5 m and 7 m) due to heavy predation on mollusks by round gobies. Young-of-the-year (YOY) round gobies migrated to deeper water in autumn and became prey of mottled sculpins and northern madtoms. Eggs and YOY of mottled sculpins may have become vulnerable to predation by both round gobies and native fishes in deeper water, since adult mottled sculpins were apparently confined to the channel with limited home range because aggressive round gobies occupied preferred shallow habitat, including spawning sites.																			0380-1330						2001	27	3					300	311		10.1016/S0380-1330(01)70645-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(01)70645-4													WOS:000171416600005
J	Zhang, XQ; Jin, Z; Shen, PK; Zheng, D				Zhang, Xueqin; Jin, Zheng; Shen, Pengke; Zheng, Du			Lake surface water-heat flux variation and its correlations with meteorological factors on multiscale in the Yamzhog Yumco, south Tibet	JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES												Lake surface water-heat exchange and its climatic attribution critically influence alpine lakes' evaporation mechanism and water storage balance with climate change. Here, this paper first explored the hourly, daily, and monthly water-heat flux variations of the lake surface and their correlations with meteorological factors based on the eddy covariance turbulent flux observation over the Yamzhog Yumco, an alpine lake in south Tibet in the non-freezing period (April-December) in 2016 and 2017. We found that the average latent heat flux was much higher than the sensible heat flux on the lake surface from April to December. Meanwhile, the water-heat flux exhibited remarkable seasonal variation, with a prominent role of higher air temperature and humidity in summer jointly controlling the lake-air energy exchange. Moreover, the main controlling meteorological factors for the water-heat flux variation of the lake surface differed with diversified timescales. First, the lake-air temperature difference was the most significant meteorological factor related to sensible heat flux on the half-hourly, daily, and monthly timescales. Second, the latent heat flux was strongly positively correlated with wind speed and the synergies of wind speed and water vapor pressure deficit on the daily and half-hourly timescales. Third, the lake surface heat flux was significantly negatively correlated with net radiation flux on the daily and monthly scales. The negative correlation can be attributed to the seasonal variation of the water surface net radiation, and the phase difference in heat flux intensity caused by the lake-air temperature difference and heat capacity contrast. Our findings will hopefully improve the understanding of energy exchange and evaporation mechanisms for alpine lakes in a warming climate.

Mineralization (conversion of organic N to inorganic N) and nitrification (conversion of ammonium [NH4+] to nitrate [NO3-]) rates were measured in pockets of fine material in talus slopes of an alpine catchment of the Colorado Front Range, U.S.A., in 1996. Rates of both processes were higher in patches with vegetation covering >80% of the surface area than in patches with vegetation covering <20% of the surface area. In the mid- to late growing season, net mineralization rates at vegetated sites of 2.49 mg N kg(-1) d(-1) were significantly greater than the 0.39 mg N kg(-1) d(-1) at unvegetated sites (P = 0.03). Net nitrification rates of 1.0 mg N kg(-1) d(-1) at sites with vegetation were significantly greater than the 0.27 mg N kg(-1) d(-1) at unvegetated sites (P = 0.01). These rates of N transformation were comparable to mineralization and nitrification rates reported for well-developed tundra soils nearby on Niwot Ridge. Mineralization and nitrification rates varied inversely with elevation along a transect with a 100 m elevational change (P = 0.005, P = 0.025). Nitrogen mineralization and nitrification in talus may help explain elevated levels of NO3- in alpine streams in mid- to late summer.																			0004-0851					AUG	1998	30	3					266	271		10.2307/1551974	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1551974													WOS:000075994500007
J	Pope, KL; Willis, DW				Pope, KL; Willis, DW			Early life history and recruitment of black crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus) in two South Dakota waters	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												We compared the early life history of black crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus) in Richmond (an impoundment) and Brant (a natural lake) lakes during 1994-1996. We expected variable recruitment (i.e., missing year classes) in the natural lake and more consistent recruitment in the impoundment. Larval black crappie abundance was always higher in Richmond Lake than Brant Lake. Peak abundance of larval black crappie was highest during 1994 in both waters. However, peak larval abundance did not correspond with fall trap-net catch per unit effort (CPUE) of age-0 black crappie, which was highest during 1995. Thus, recruitment of black crappie was not simply a function of the number of larvae hatched. Similar trends in catches of age-0 black crappie with the ichthyoplankton trawl and trap nets for both water bodies during 1994-1996 suggest that broad environmental factors similarly affected reproduction and recruitment in Richmond and Brant lakes.

Total Hg concentrations in precipitation ranged from 2.6 to 36.2 ng/L and showed a strong seasonal pattern with concentrations that were 3 to 4 times higher during summer months. Annual bulk deposition of Hg was 8.3 to 12.4 mu g/m(2) and was similar to deposition rates in the Midwestern and Northeastern U.S. Total Hg concentrations in streams ranged from 0.8 to 13.5 ng/L and were highest in mid-May on the rising limb of the snowmelt hydrograph. Stream-water Hg was positively correlated with dissolved organic carbon suggesting organically complexed Hg was flushed into streams from near-surface soil horizons during the early stages of snowmelt. Methylmercury (MeHg) in stream water peaked at 0.048 ng/L just prior to peak snowmelt but was at or below detection (< 0.040 ng/L) for the remainder of the snowmelt season. Annual export of total Hg in Loch Vale streams ranged from 1.2 to 2.3 mu g/m(2), which was less than 20% of wet deposition, indicating the terrestrial environment is a net sink of atmospheric Hg. Concentrations of MeHg in stream water and corresponding watershed fluxes were low, indicating low methylation rates or high demethylation rates or both.																			0049-6979					JUN	2005	164	1-4					21	42		10.1007/s11270-005-1657-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-005-1657-z													WOS:000230933100002

The water quality of the small lake becomes significantly worse during the summer owing to the occurrence of blue-green algae. Therefore, water quality management is a serious problem. Because the primary method of water quality analysis is direct collection from the target water area, the analysis range is limited, and the analysis of the entire water area is very difficult. Therefore, performing a wider range of analyses by remote sensing is a possible solution. In this study, we analyze near infrared (NIR) data acquired by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). A fuzzy regression analysis is conducted on the UAV data and water measurements. Based on the experimental results of data from August 2015, the NIR data is confirmed to be useful in estimating the water quality conditions in Lake Sakurako. Furthermore, we investigate the noise removal process using a nonlocal mean filter and demonstrate that the process provides more detailed information regarding the lake's water quality.

Distinct freshwater migratory pathways in Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) coincide with separate patterns of marine spatial habitat-use across a large coastal landscape	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Understanding variability in distributions and habitat-use among populations of anadromous salmonids is essential for their sustainable management. Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) is an important cultural and socioeconomic species; however, knowledge of their spatiotemporal habitat-use during the marine phase is limited. Here, a large-scale acoustic telemetry array was used to determine intraspecific variation in Arctic char summer marine habitat-use tied to overwintering lake occurrence in the Amundsen Gulf. Arctic char tagged in the ocean migrated to two main overwintering lakes, corresponding to distinct migration corridors and separate patterns of marine habitat-use, with one individual exhibiting among the longest recorded char marine migration to date (similar to 330 km). Arctic char that undertook longer migration distances initiated travel in the ocean towards fresh water 11 days earlier than those completing shorter migration distances; mean departure days (+/- SD) 2 August (+/- 8.1 days) and 13 August (+/- 6.8 days), corresponding to migration distances of 252 and 131 km, respectively.

The pollen record indicates that the ecotone shifted eastward during 6000-4900, 4400-3900, and 2800-1600 cal. yr BP when steppes occupied this region, whereas it shifted westward during the other intervals when the steppes were replaced by meadows. The quantitative reconstruction of paleoclimate derived from the pollen record shows that monsoon precipitation fluctuated around the present level over the last 6000 years in the central Tibetan Plateau. Three major drought episodes of 5600-4900, 4400-3900, and 2800-2400 cal. yr BP are detected by pollen signals and lake sediments. Comparison of our record with other climatic proxy data from the Tibetan Plateau and other monsoonal regions shows that these episodes are three major centennial-scale monsoon weakening events.

It was found that the studied heavy metals were completely below the detection limit of ICP-OES for water samples. The results showed that most heavy metals (Ni, Cr, Zn, Fe, and Pb) and macroelements (Mg and Na) had their highest values in sediment samples in August. Increases of heavy metals and macroelements may be due to evaporation because of summer stagnation at this period. The average content of studied elements was in the order of Mn>Ni>Cr>Zn>Fe>Pb>Cu in sediment samples. As a non-essential heavy metal, Cr was the most accumulated in all the macrophytes studied. The average Cr concentration was in the order of P. crispus > P. perfoliatus > M. spicatum > C. vulgaris. In C. vulgaris, the accumulation of Ca was the highest compared with other macrophytes. The accumulation of heavy metal was in the order of Fe>Zn>Cu>Pb>Mn>Cr>Ni>Cd in H. sulukii n. sp. The obtained results showed that the heavy metal and macroelement (Na, Ca, Mg, and K) concentrations in water, sediment, macrophytes, and leech are below the risk values according to the aquatic life pollutant data provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Overall, the element contents can be attributable to the geological sources because of the general absence of serious pollution in Kara Lake, Adiyaman, Turkey.

This behavior reduces visual predation on the larvae, but incurs costs. We attempted to determine if patterns existed in the vertical migration of C. punctipennis larvae related to changes in water oxygen concentration. For 13 of the past 19 years, data were collected over a 24-hour period in the fall in Poplar Tree Lake, Shelby County, Tennessee. We determined the mean depth at which larvae were found during the nighttime and daytime. There was no consistent change in either mean nighttime or daytime depth over time (P>0.22). We assumed that an oxygen concentration below 2.0 mg/l could not be tolerated by fish. Comparison of the depths at which this critical oxygen concentration occurred with mean larval depth showed a significant correlation (P<0.05), supporting the hypothesis that diel vertical migration affords protection from fish predation.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				MAR	2001	16	1					145	150		10.1080/02705060.2001.9663797	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2001.9663797													WOS:000166801600016

In this study, we test a high spectrum of climatic signals, not only monthly and seasonal but also on a multi-year scale and include the single tree analysis to answer this issue, focusing on a low-elevation thermophilic old-growth beech forest surrounding the Bracciano Lake in Central Italy. Through a dendroecological and isotope analysis, we evaluate both short- and long-term sensitivity of F. sylvatica and the coexisting better-drought-adapted species Q. cerris to climatic and hydrological variability in terms of growth reduction and delta 13C responses. After the 1990s, beech trees showed a climate-driven decrease in growth compared to oak, especially after 2003 (-20 % of basal area increment), with a significant growth trend reversal between the species. For F. sylvatica, the significant correlations with precipitation decreased, whereas for Q. cerris, they increased, with a higher number of trees positively influenced. However, the temperature highlighted more clearly the contrasting climate-growth correlation pattern between the two species. In F. sylvatica after the '90s, the negative effect of temperatures has significantly intensified, as shown by past summer values up to four years previously, involving about half of the trees. Surprisingly, the water-level fluctuations showed a highly significant influence on tree-ring growth in both species. Nevertheless, it reduced after the '90s. Finally, Q. cerris trees showed a significantly higher ability to recover their growth levels after extreme droughts (+55 %). The growth trend reversal and the shift in iWUE of the last years may point to potential changes in the future species composition, raising the need for climate-adaptive silviculture (e.g., selective thinning) to reduce growth decline, enhance resilience and favour the natural regeneration of the target species for habitat conservation.

The site was covered with 6,600 tonnes of clean sand, to an average thickness of 34 cm. Adequate sand placement accuracy was possible up to. wind speeds of about 30 km/h. Ultimate settlement of sediment due to primary consolidation was measured to range between 6 and 8 cm. Suspended material found in the water column during cap placement was almost entirely composed of fines associated with the cap sand. Core samples showed a sharp interface between the sand;cap and sediments with no signs of extensive mixing. Based on data collected at the site, the sand cap was successfully placed in the designated area without any significant sediment disturbance.																					90-5410-877-0				1997							2289	2295																WOS:A1997BJ46T00387

We determined a geochemical budget for Rn-222, normally found at much higher concentrations in groundwater than surface waters, to assist in constraining the hydrologic estimates. The radon budget accounted for all quantifiable surface sources and sinks including the flux across the sediment-water interface which was determined by application of an advection-diffusion model. All hydrologic parameters and radon concentrations were monitored seasonally from February 1994 to August 1995. Using the water balance approach alone, the average groundwater discharge entering the lake was estimated to have an upper limit of approximately 0.95 +/- 0.13 m(3) s(-1). The groundwater contribution obtained using the combined hydrologic/Rn-222 approach ranged from 0.17 to 0.76 m(3) s(-1) with a best estimate of 0.35 +/- 0.16 m(3) s(-1). Lake profiles show enhanced Rn-222 concentrations in some areas indicating that groundwater enters Par Pond mostly through a small region in the northern portion of the lake, probably via small seeps or springs. Estimates show that groundwater plays a significant role in the overall water budget of the lake, accounting for 10%-33% of the total estimated inflow from all measured sources. Our results show that supplementing a standard hydrological water balance with radon budget considerations helps to constrain estimated groundwater flow into surface reservoirs.

While numerous birds are regularly seen in the fall at Point Barrow, Alaska, until now only one breeding locality has been known for Nunavut, Canada. We found a second breeding locality in Nunavut in the northwestern corner of Prince Charles Island (Foxe Basin). We observed one pair incubating two eggs on a small island (30 m in diameter) situated in a medium-sized lake, on a low plateau at the top of a complex of raised beaches. None of the reports on aerial or land surveys of this region have mentioned the reproduction of this species, though unpublished aerial observations suggest that the species has been present during the 1980s. Outside Siberia, this species seems to be characterized by an irregular and scattered distribution of its breeding sites.					; Béchet, Arnaud/AAA-4398-2021; Martin, Jean-Louis/E-5059-2010; Meister, Peter/ISV-0800-2023; Meister, Peter/B-4770-2010	Bechet, Arnaud/0000-0002-0330-6342; Meister, Peter/0000-0002-6230-4216													0004-0843					SEP	2000	53	3					234	236																WOS:000089687100004

Robert			Movements of common bream Abramis brama in a highly connected, lowland wetland reveal sub-populations with diverse migration strategies	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Studies suggest the migratory behaviours of potamodromous fishes can be highly variable in barrier-free systems, where differing movement types enable populations to exploit a wide range of food and space resources. This intra-population diversity in spatial and temporal resource use is important to our ecological understanding of fish distribution patterns and population structure. Despite this, freshwater ecosystems are increasingly characterised by high levels of fragmentation and degradation that restrict mobile fauna, and limit opportunities to study natural, unconstrained movement behaviour. Common bream Abramis brama (bream) is a potentially strong model species for testing the importance of diverse migration patterns in lowland rivers, but existing studies have been largely restricted to spatially confined and/or anthropogenically modified systems. This study's principal focus was to examine the diversity of bream movement behaviour in a highly connected, lowland system using passive acoustic telemetry, which provided continuous, multi-year data on the movements of 181 bream across a tidally influenced, lowland wetland in eastern England (c. 60 km of continuous river length plus numerous interconnected shallow lakes and dykes). Tracked bream were grouped according to their initial location and timing of tagging. Bream migratory behaviours varied considerably between tagging groups, but with greater consistency within groups. There was little mixing of groups outside of spawning periods, with season and tidal phase being significant predictors of movement. Rates of movement and swimming speeds were highest in spring, with movements also generally occurring in the direction of tidal flows. For fish sampled just prior to spawning, there was considerable diversity in their post-spawning behaviour, with some remaining in the immediate vicinity of the sampling location and others that moved to areas c. 25 km away. These spatially discrete patterns remained until the following spawning period. These results suggest that this lowland fish population is comprised of several distinct, semi-independent subpopulations that only share space resources in their spawning period. This indicates the importance of connectivity in lowland freshwater systems for enabling and maintaining high phenotypic diversity in the movement behaviours of potamodromous fishes.					; Britton, Robert/AAO-6673-2020; Britton, Robert/B-5040-2009	Winter, Emily/0000-0003-1142-1372; Britton, Robert/0000-0003-1853-3086													0046-5070	1365-2427				JUL	2021	66	7					1410	1422		10.1111/fwb.13726	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13726		MAY 2021											WOS:000652003800001

The young-of-the-year fish were simulated from the egg stage until recruitment into the yearling age class. At low initial densities of smallmouth bass in the swim-up larvae stage, recruitment to the yearling age class was roughly proportional to the initial densities of larval fish. However, when the initial densities were sufficiently high decreasing recruitment was observed as a function of further increases in larval density in the model. This occurred because high initial densities prevented all but a small fraction of the smallmouth bass from attaining large enough sizes to escape winter starvation. The addition of significant levels of size-dependent predation greatly altered this result, however. Heavy predation reduced the competition for prey among smallmouth bass and allowed a large number of smallmouth bass to grow rapidly and recruit to the yearling class.

Karst. var. arida (Basidiomycetes, Coniophoraceae) in the Finger Lakes region of New York [USA] in late summer 1986. Larvae of E. oviformis, maintained in the laboratory, aggregated upon the substrate and pupated in one closely-packed group. Pupae hung inverted from the last larval exuvia which were attached to the substrate by the caudal end. In addition, adults and larvae of the endomychids, Mycetina perpulchra (Newman) and Aphorista vittata (F.), also were found in association with the same wood-rotting fungus. The Coniophoraceae-E. oviformis association and the two breeding species of Endomychidae on a host in the Coniophoraceae provide additional evidence for the diversity of Coleoptera feeding on minute Basdiomycetes.																			0013-8797					APR	1987	89	2					215	218																WOS:A1987G944200002

It exhibited a distinct bimodal seasonal cycle in the lake with a primary peak in August-September and a secondary peak in May-June. Correlation witn environmental parameters revealed that temperature and, to a certain extent, pH were the important factors governing the densities of V. cholerae. In the lake, sediment samples harbored high densities of V. cholerae immediately after months when peak counts were observed in plankton, suggesting a cycle of cells between sediment and water. At the other sampling areas, no defined seasonality was observed. Instead, high counts of V. cholerae were observed at these severely polluted sites throughout the study period, including the winter months. All 15 water samples passed via the ligated loop of rabbits yielded pure cultures of V. cholerae, indicating that the rabbit intestine selects out V. cholerae from a mixed flora. Uniformly high isolation rates of V. cholerae were observed from brackish water and freshwater species of export quality prawns, V. cholerae was found to be abundant and was represented by 32 individual Louisiana State University (LSU) serovars, including two new serovars. The 01 serovar could not be isolated from any of the samples examined in this study.

Here, a mesocosm experiment was conducted in winter (when plant growth is low) to compare simultaneously the periphyton community on three submerged macrophytes (Potamogeton lucens, Vallisneria sp. and Cabomba caroliniana) with contrasting leaf structural complexities (leaf fractal dimension=1.12, 1.17 and 1.37, respectively) and on three types of artificial macrophytes with similar morphologies as the natural plants. We also compared intertreatment differences in phytoplankton sampled from mesocosms. Both for natural and artificial macrophytes, the periphyton chlorophyll a (Chl-a) was positively associated with leaf fractal dimension. Although the morphological structure of natural and artificial plants and the physicochemical characteristics of the water were similar, the periphyton community differed between natural and artificial macrophytes, with the difference being dependent on the leaf structural complexity of the macrophytes. For leaves with a simple structural complexity, the abundance and composition of periphyton on natural and artificial plants were not statistically different. In addition, periphyton Chl-a, density and biovolume were higher on the adaxial side than on the abaxial side of natural P.lucens leaves, but no differences were found between sides of the artificial leaves. For leaves with a medium structural complexity, the abundance of periphyton was lower on the natural than artificial plants, and the proportion of diatoms to the total community differed. For leaves with a high structural complexity, periphyton Chl-a of the artificial plants was notably higher than on the natural plants, while no significant differences were found for periphyton density, biovolume, and the proportion of diatoms and green algae. Permutational multivariate analysis of periphyton genus composition confirmed that periphyton composition on the artificial plants (medium and high leaf structural complexities) was different overall from that on the natural plants. Phytoplankton Chl-a, density, biovolume, and diversity did not show any pronounced differences among treatments. Our results suggest that artificial macrophytes cannot fully substitute for natural plants even when they are morphologically similar. Artificial macrophytes should therefore be used with caution when investigating the periphyton community on macrophytes.

Effectiveness of alum in a hypereutrophic lake with substantial external loading	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Brattebo SK, Welch EB, Gibbons HL, Burghdoff MK, Williams GN, Oden JL. 2017. Effectiveness of alum in a hypereutrophic lake with substantial external loading. Lake Reserv Manage. 33:108-118.Water quality conditions in hypereutrophic Lake Ketchum improved to mesotrophic conditions after alum treatments in 2014 and 2015. From 2013 pre-treatment conditions, summer mean epilimnetic total phosphorus (TP) declined from 289 to 34 mu g/L in 2014 and then to 15 mu g/L in 2015 (a total reduction of 95%). Hypolimnetic TP declined 99% overall, and chlorophyll a dropped 70% while there was 135% improvement in transparency over the 2years. Toxic cyanobacteria blooms, a chronic problem in the lake, disappeared in 2015. Maintenance treatment in 2016 continued water quality improvements. The primary driver of water quality changes was a decrease in internal P loading from a mean rate of 25mg/m(2) per day to zero (negative rate) after the alum treatments. The improvements occurred despite application problems with the 2014 treatment, which had to be halted with only 66% of the planned dose (aluminum: 28mg/L or 83.7g/m(2)) applied. The remaining 34% of the original alum dose plus an annual maintenance water column dose and an additional 15% was applied in March 2015. The water quality improvements were achieved even with continuation of a highly enriched (TP: >450 mu g/L) external input from a legacy agricultural source. The changes were consistent with or exceeded predictions of a 2-layer, seasonal mass balance TP model used to evaluate restoration alternatives. These results show that alum treatments can eliminate high internal loading and, when coupled with annual maintenance treatments, provide sustained water quality improvements despite continued external loading.																			1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	2			SI		108	118		10.1080/10402381.2017.1311390	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2017.1311390													WOS:000403102200002

A comparative scenario of water quality among high altitude Himalayan lakes has been also presented. In the post-monsoon season, all major cations increased whereas major anions except NO3- increased in the lake system. The results revealed that major cations in the lakes in post-monsoon increased whereas major anions except NO3- increased in post-monsoon. During pre-monsoon, Ca-HCO3 type and Ca-Mg-SO4 type were the major faces of lake water which changed to Na-SO4 and Ca-Na-HCO3 type in post-monsoon. It was found that wet precipitation of aerosols is the most important source of major ions followed by chemical weathering. The pCO(2) has increased in the post-monsoon probably due to higher atmospheric CO2 during winter than that of rainy season. Factor analysis revealed that weathering, anthropogenic are the main governing process in the pre-monsoon whereas evaporative enrichment and geochemical inputs are the main process in the post-monsoon season. ANOVA analysis showed significant difference for pH, EC, SO42-, NO3-, Na+, K+ indicating input from evaporative enrichment, weathering and long range transport of pollution to lake system.					kumar, manish/KIE-1953-2024; Yamanaka, Tsutomu/E-9277-2014														2395-7611	2395-7697					2016	2	1					69	78		10.3233/JCC-160008	http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/JCC-160008													WOS:000414069000009
J	WANG, W; DRISCOLL, CT				WANG, W; DRISCOLL, CT			PATTERNS OF TOTAL MERCURY CONCENTRATIONS IN ONONDAGA LAKE, NEW-YORK	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Onodaga Lake, located in central New York, received elevated inputs of mercury from a chloralkali facility over the period 1946-1970. Despite marked reductions in mercury loading since that time, concentrations of total mercury in Onondaga Lake remain among the highest values reported in the literature, comparable to other lakes with point sources of mercury. Concentrations of mercury varied markedly in the upper waters of Onondaga Lake during the ice-free period. A large accumulation of mercury was observed in the hypolimnion during the summer stratification. This accumulation coincided with increases in dissolved sulfide concentrations produced during the period of hypolimnetic anoxia. Chemical equilibrium calculations indicate that hypolimnetic waters of Onondaga Lake were oversaturated with respect to the solubility of mercuric sulfide, and mercury sulfide complexes dominate the speciation of aqueous mercury. The formation of strong aqueous complexes with dissolved sulfide may be an important mechanism facilitating the mobilization of mercury from pelagic sediments to the water column.

Retrieval of Lake Ice Characteristics from SAR Imagery	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Boreal lakes ecosystems can remain partially or completely covered by ice and snow during an important portion of the year. Alterations of lake and river ice properties can deteriorate the conditions of local ice roads, negatively influencing Nordic communities and economical activities. Monitoring of lake ice characteristics and dynamics is therefore crucial. In this study, Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imagery is exploited to evaluate changes in the ice regime over shallow and deep high-latitude lakes during the winters of 2018 and 2019. The methodology proposed, based on the combined analysis of SAR intensity and interferometric coherence maps, enables the extraction of important characteristics of ice dynamics. Overall, the lake ice thickness change derived from Differential Interferometric SAR (D-InSAR) increases with the lake depth. The D-InSAR-derived mean rate of growth, in general, agrees with the one estimated from records of in-situ ice thickness measurements. The methodology presented herein could be temporally extended to support the understanding of historical and current climate conditions. This could be done by using archived and newly available imagery to improve lake ice models.																			0703-8992	1712-7971				MAY 4	2022	48	3					379	399		10.1080/07038992.2022.2042227	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07038992.2022.2042227		MAR 2022											WOS:000770279200001
J	Kufel, L; Biardzka, E; Strzalek, M				Kufel, Lech; Biardzka, Elzbieta; Strzalek, Malgorzata			Calcium carbonate incrustation and phosphorus fractions in five charophyte species	AQUATIC BOTANY												To discern the proportion of phosphorus (P) incorporated into plant biomass to that adsorbed on calcium carbonate incrustation, five charophyte species from three calcareous lakes in Poland were studied in summer 2012. Two organic and two inorganic P fractions were analysed after sequential extraction of plant material. Ca content was analysed after dissolution of calcite from separate plant samples in 1 M HCl. The deposition of calcite depended on site conditions - various plant species from the same lake produced similar amount of incrustation. Organic P fraction extracted with NaOH was the largest (50% of TP) and least variable among plant species. The sum of the two inorganic P fractions was not correlated with Ca concentrations in plants suggesting a non-stoichiometric P binding with calcite. Loosely bound inorganic P and calcium-bound P constituted 26% and 21% of TP, respectively, and differed significantly among plant species. The latter fraction may be considered P sink in bottom sediments after plant decay. Further studies based on a larger dataset are needed to test site- and/or species-specific content of calcite incrustations and P fractions in charophytes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Morning flight behavior of nocturnally migrating birds along the western basin of Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY												Many species of birds that normally migrate during the night have been observed engaging in so-called morning flights during the early morning. The results of previous studies have supported the hypothesis that one function of morning flights is to compensate for wind drift that birds experienced during the night. Our objective was to further explore this hypothesis in a unique geographic context. We determined the orientation of morning flights along the southern shore of Lake Erie's western basin during the spring migrations of 2016 and 2017. This orientation was then compared to the observed orientation of nocturnal migration. Additionally, the orientation of the birds engaged in morning flights following nights with drifting winds was compared to that of birds following nights with non-drifting winds. The morning flights of most birds at our observation site were oriented to the west-northwest, following the southern coast of Lake Erie. Given that nocturnal migration was oriented generally east of north, the orientation of morning flight necessarily reflected compensation for accumulated, seasonal wind drift resulting from prevailingly westerly winds. However, the orientation of morning flights was similar following nights with drifting and non-drifting winds, suggesting that birds on any given morning were not necessarily re-orienting as an immediate response to drift that occurred the previous night. Given the topographical characteristics of our observation area, the west-northwest movement of birds in our study is likely best explained as a more complex interaction that could include some combination of compensation for wind drift, a search for suitable stopover habitat, flying in a direction that minimizes any loss in progressing northward toward the migratory goal, and avoidance of a lake crossing.																			0273-8570	1557-9263				JUN	2018	89	2					140	148		10.1111/jofo.12252	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jofo.12252													WOS:000435942300004
J	Dervisoglu, A				Dervisoglu, Adalet			Analysis of the Temporal Changes of Inland Ramsar Sites in Turkey Using Google Earth Engine	ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION												Ramsar Convention (RC) is the first of modern intergovernmental agreement on the conscious use and conservation of natural resources. It provides a platform for contracting parties working together to develop the best available data, advice, and policy recommendations to increase awareness of the benefits of wetlands in nature and society. Turkey became a party of the RC in 1994, and in the years 1994 to 2013, 14 wetlands that reached the Ramsar criteria were recognized as Ramsar sites (RS). With this study, all inland RS in Turkey from 1985 to 2020 were examined, and changes in the water surface areas were evaluated on the GEE cloud computing platform using Landsat satellite images and the NDWI index. The closest meteorological station data to each RS were evaluated and associated with the surface area changes. The reasons for the changes in these areas, besides the meteorological effects, have been scrutinized using management plans and publications. As a result, inland wetlands decreased at different rates from 1985 to 2020, with a total loss of 31.38% and 21,571.0 ha for the spring months. Since the designation dates of RS, the total amount of water surface area reduction was 27.35%, constituting 17,758.90 ha.					dervisoglu, adalet/ABB-3279-2020	Dervisoglu, Adalet/0000-0001-7455-4282														2220-9964				AUG	2021	10	8							521	10.3390/ijgi10080521	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi10080521													WOS:000690533100001

The total concentration of dechloranes in the water and sediments ranged from 1.4 to 4.1ng/L and 9.3 to 36.2ng/g dry weight, respectively. The distribution patterns of dechloranes in the water and sediments were both dominated by DP. The average values of the anti-DP fractional abundances (f(anti)) in the water and sediment samples both were fell in the range of commercial DP mixtures. The relationships of DP in the water with suspended particulate matter (SPM), total organic carbon (TOC), and tides indicated that the combined actions of these environmental factors influenced the distribution of DP in the JRE. The deleterious risk associated with exposure to dechloranes via the water for adults was very low, suggesting that exposure of the local population of dechloranes via water is relatively safe in the JRE.					liu, bin/E-5431-2016														0944-1344	1614-7499				OCT	2018	25	30			SI		30292	30300		10.1007/s11356-018-2874-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-2874-5								30159835					WOS:000446844400050

The extent to which calcite precipitation can be a sink for added P. and thus act as a potential negative feedback to eutrophication, was demonstrated using large enclosures within a Michigan lake. Nitrogen and P were added over 45 days in the summer to produce mesotrophic and eutrophic conditions. Algal biomass and production increased markedly with the nutrient additions, elevating the pH (9-10) and greatly increasing calcite precipitations, reducing concentrations of calcium and alkalinity by up to 60%. Sediment traps indicated that calcite sedimentation was a major sink for added P. By the end of the experiment, only about of the added P remained in the water column. Major ion concentrations in a larger set of Michign lakes showed calcite precipitation to be widespread, reflecting the abundant carbonate minerals in this glacial region.

Organic Pellet Decomposition Induces Mortality of Lake Trout Embryos in Yellowstone Lake	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Yellowstone Lake is the site of actions to suppress invasive Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush and restore native Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri and natural ecosystem function. Although gill netting is effective (Lake Trout lambda <= 0.6 from 2012 through 2018), the effort costs more than US$2 million annually and only targets Lake Trout age 2 and older. To increase suppression efficiency, we developed an alternative method using organic (soy and wheat) pellets to increase mortality of Lake Trout embryos on spawning sites. Decomposition of pellets during two in situ experiments caused dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations to temporarily decline to lethal levels (<3.4 mg/L) within days of application. Embryo mortalities during the first exposure period (days 1-6 following application) were high at all treatment levels (1.75-28.0 kg/m(2)) at the substrate surface and within interstices 20 cm below the surface, varying from 97 +/- 1.8% (mean +/- SE) to 100 +/- 0.0%, but may have been enhanced by a handling effect (exposure to sunlight). Embryo mortalities during the second exposure period (days 11-22) were highest 20 cm below the surface, varying from 78 +/- 9.7% to 100 +/- 0.0%. Almost all (98 +/- 3.1%) Lake Trout embryos died after exposure to DO 200 h during the second period. Pellets caused lethal DO for several weeks below the substrate surface, despite largely dissolving and dissipating from the surface of treated areas by day 39. Broad-scale application of pellets at 1.75 kg/m(2) following the spawning period in autumn may reduce Lake Trout recruitment and enhance population suppression because the area of 14 verified spawning sites is only 11.4 ha (0.03% of lake surface area). Pellet application may be useful in other similar systems as part of an integrated pest management approach targeting multiple life stages of invasive freshwater fish.

A creel survey was conducted from 1985-1995. A 254-mm length limit/15-fish daily creel regulation was placed on the lake I January 1993. Prior to the length limit, the population was characterized as fast-growing and short-lived. Angler harvest steadily increased after the length limit and in the final year of the creel survey, yield (kg/ha) was higher than in 5 of the 8 years data were collected prior to the length limit. Angler acceptance of the length limit was high. Growth rates remained unchanged following implementation of the length limit. Although no differences in mortality rates could be demonstrated using the trap-net data, size and age structure of the crappie population improved. Based on the data collected, the length limit regulation met the objectives as stated.																									1999							80	90																WOS:000169733700011
J	Rossi, PG; Laurion, I; Lovejoy, C				Rossi, Paul-Georges; Laurion, Isabelle; Lovejoy, Connie			Distribution and identity of Bacteria in subarctic permafrost thaw ponds	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Colored permafrost thaw ponds (thermokarst ponds), are abundant freshwater ecosystems in the subarctic. The ponds can emit significant levels of greenhouse gases, which are drivers of climate change, but little is known of their microbial communities. The ponds are vertically stratified for most of the year with suboxic to anoxic hypolimnia, suggesting varied habitats despite their shallow depths (1 to 4 m). Pelagic bacterial communities in 4 contrasting ponds near the coast of Hudson Bay, Quebec, Canada, were investigated by cloning and sequencing the 16S rRNA gene from environmental DNA. Surface and bottom water libraries yielded a total of 109 operational taxonomical units (defined as 97% sequence similarity) from 261 clones. The majority of clones had their closest matches to other environmental clones originating from freshwater environments, especially lakes. Proteobacteria accounted for the majority of sequences (33%), followed by Bacteroidetes (19%), Actinobacteria (13%), Chlorobi (10%), Verrucomicrobia (8%), and Cyanobacteria (7%). There were large differences in the assemblages inhabiting the different ponds and water layers. Bacteroidetes were predominant at the surface, while Chlorobi were found in bottom waters. Sequences with best matches to known methanotrophic bacteria re presented up to 20% of all sequences. Methanotrophs included Methylobacter psychrophilus, Crenothrix polyspora, and Methylocystis parvus as closest matches. Ordination analysis clearly separated surface and bottom waters, where relatively large quantities of organic matter, low light availability, cool temperatures, and suboxic conditions selected for the distinct communities. The separation of surface waters of different ponds showed that bacterial communities could differ between superficially similar environments. This study illustrates the high diversity in bacterial assemblages occurring in ponds separated by a few meters, and thus, the potentially complex response of thaw pond systems to climate change.					; Lovejoy, Connie/A-3756-2008	Laurion, Isabelle/0000-0001-8694-3330; Lovejoy, Connie/0000-0001-8027-2281													0948-3055	1616-1564					2013	69	3					231	245		10.3354/ame01634	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame01634													WOS:000321741400006
J	Coelho, IR; Ribeiro, SP				Coelho, IR; Ribeiro, SP			Environment heterogeneity and seasonal effects in ground-dwelling ant (Hymenoptera: formicidae) assemblages in the Parque Estadual do Rio Doce, MG, Brazil	NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY												This work aimed to explore the response of ant species assemblage to contrasting types of forests in a semideciduous stationary rainforest, in the Parque Estadual do Rio Doce, South Eastern Brazil. We compared antropomorphic borders of this park and natural ecotones, such as lake margins continuous with forests, as well as preserved forests far from ecotones. We investigated whether ground-dwelling ant species richness, abundance and composition Would change according to forest types and ecotones. We expected greater species richness in interior tall forest, compared with low forest or ecotone habitats. In addition, we tested the effect of climate seasonality on ant assemblages found in each studied vegetation type. Each forest type was surveyed based on a minimum transect sampling unit of 150 in long summing up 30 pit-falls per unit. Two sampling events, one in dry season(September of 2001) and another in the rainy season (January of 2002) were performed. For both seasons, tall forest presented greater total number of ant species, however lower mean ant species and abundance per trap than other forest types, thus corroborating the prediction that ecotones might present high alpha diversity. Mean species richness and abundance did not differ between interior low forest and lake edge, or between these habitats and reserve border. In general, species composition were not clearly defined by forest types. Results here found Suggest that species loss or community dominance by generalist species, eventually due to deforestation, is probably a much greater problem than previously thought. However, to understand patterns of insect species diversity and distribution in tropical ecosystem should be taken in account much more comprehensive, spatially explicit sampling designs.					; Rismo Coelho, Igor/IXD-3247-2023; Ribeiro, Sérvio/G-1887-2012	Pontes Ribeiro, Servio/0000-0002-0191-8759; 													1519-566X	1678-8052				JAN-FEB	2006	35	1					19	29		10.1590/S1519-566X2006000100004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1519-566X2006000100004								17352065					WOS:000236243100003

The composition of consumed plants and their proportion in the diet of horses was determined by the microhistological analysis of their feces. The basis of the horse diet for most part of the year is gramineous plants (69-84%); at the end of summer (August), their portion decreases up to 48%. Sedges are present in the diet in small amounts (3-9 %) the year round. The quantitative assessment of food selectivity is made according to shares of plant species in the diet and plant community of a pasture. Rare species of gramineous plants (their shares in the diet and phytocenosis are 21), Stipa sp.(6), Poligonum sp. (14), legumes (6), and sedges (3) are most selectively eaten.

The summer of 1997 was exceptionally warm and dry as compared to the climatological normal period of 1961-1990, and the effects of the high temperature and lowered water table were clearly seen in the CO2 fluxes. The highest individual downward flux densities of about -0.25 mg(CO2) m(-2) s(-1) took place at the end of July, while the highest respiration rates of 0.15 mg(CO2) m(-2) s(-1) were observed later in August. During the first days of measurements in April the median of respiration flux densities through the snow cover was about 0.006 mg(CO2) m(-2) s(-1). In correspondence to the CO2 fluxes the strongest sink terms in the daily net ecosystem exchange (NEE) balances of about -6 g(CO2) m(-2) d(-1) were observed in July. The highest positive balances of about 4 g(CO2) m(-2) d(-1) were observed in early June and in August. The daily balances in April were about 0.6 g(CO2) m(-2) d(-1). The net balances for the sink period (June 15 to August 26, 1997) and for the B-month measurement period were -188 g m(-2) and -30 g m(-2), respectively. The wintertime CO2 balance was estimated by modeling the NEE using the NEE values from the first measurement week in April. The wintertime balances obtained yielded estimates for annual balances in the range of 62 to 72 g m(-2) yr(-1).

We compared the capacity of three process domains-lakes, slow-flowing reaches, and rapids-to disperse and retain plant propagules by releasing small wooden cubes as propagule mimics during the spring flood and recording their final locations. We also measured the geomorphic characteristics (planform, longitudinal profile, cross-sectional morphology, and wood) of each process domain. The three process domains all differed in morphology and hydraulics, and those characteristics were important in shaping the transport capacity of mimics. On average, lakes retained more mimics than slow-flowing reaches but did not differ from the retainment of rapids. Living macrophytes were the most efficient element trapping mimics. In rapids and slow-flowing reaches, most trapped mimics remained floating, whereas in lakes, most mimics ended up on the banks. The decay curves of retention varied substantially among and within process domains. The results suggest that managers who rely on natural recovery of restored sites by means of plant immigration may benefit from understanding landscape patterns when deciding upon the location of restoration measures in stream networks.

Sensitivity of a sediment transport model for Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												A two-dimensional (vertical and cross-shore) sediment transport model was applied to several transects in southern Lake Michigan using observations of waves and currents recorded during the spring of 2000. Conditions during this period included several storms that are among the largest observed in the lake. The observations were used to examine the sensitivity of the model to variations in the input parameters (waves, currents, initial bottom sediment size distribution, settling velocity, and bottom stress required for erosion). The results show that changing the physical forcing (waves and currents) or the initial bottom sediment size distribution affected the results more than varying the particle properties (settling velocity and critical shear stress) or the size classes used to describe the size distribution. This indicates that for this model specification of input parameters are of first order importance and should be specified with some confidence before adding additional complexity by including processes such as flocculation and bed consolidation.

Macroinvertebrate succession during leaf litter breakdown in a perennial karstic river in Western Brazil	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Leaf litter is a major basal resource to stream ecosystems, but few studies addressed their role in karst systems, mainly in intermittent springs and lakes. Patterns of resource use in perennial rivers are poorly known, although the input of leaf litter strongly influences macroinvertebrate assemblage structure. In this study, we evaluated the structure of macroinvertebrate assemblages along the decomposition of leaf litter in a tropical karst river, using leaf litter cages made of coarse nylon mesh (25 mm) to allow colonization by macroinvertebrates. The experiment was followed weekly for 10 weeks. The assemblages were dominated by snails (90.5% of total fauna), hyalellid amphipods, and larval chironomid midges, with highest abundances in the intermediate stages of the experiment, resulting in a gradient in assemblage structure. The large abundance of snails, which are common in other karst systems, suggest that this group may have an important role in decomposer food webs, facilitating or directly contributing to leaf breakdown.

J	WELCH, EB; LINDELL, LT				WELCH, EB; LINDELL, LT			PHOSPHORUS LOADING AND RESPONSE IN LAKE VANERN NEARSHORE AREAS	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												P retention in 5 archipelagic areas of Lake Vanern, Sweden, was estimated, and the observed local impact on trophic state was compared with that predicted from steady state considerations. Only theoretical residence times for water were used to define changes, but other more precise methods are discussed. Five archipelagic areas of Varmlandssjon retained about 38% of the P load, and the open lake retained a similar fraction. Thus 1/2 of the incoming P was retained in nearshore areas. Predicted P content agreed reasonably well with observed, and even estimates of chlorophyll a content from predicted P fell largely within the confidence intervals of chlorophyll a previously predicted from observed P concentrations for whole lake systems. With reasonably good data on P loading, retention coefficient and flushing rate, at least crude predictions of trophic state changes and retention capacity are possible in archipelagic areas of large lakes.																			0013-936X	1520-5851					1978	12	3					321	327		10.1021/es60139a009	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es60139a009													WOS:A1978EM95500019

ArxA, a new clade of arsenite oxidase within the DMSO reductase family of molybdenum oxidoreductases	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Arsenotrophy, growth coupled to autotrophic arsenite oxidation or arsenate respiratory reduction, occurs only in the prokaryotic domain of life. The enzymes responsible for arsenotrophy belong to distinct clades within the DMSO reductase family of molybdenum-containing oxidoreductases: specifically arsenate respiratory reductase, ArrA, and arsenite oxidase, AioA (formerly referred to as AroA and AoxB). A new arsenite oxidase clade, ArxA, represented by the haloalkaliphilic bacterium Alkalilimnicola ehrlichii strain MLHE-1 was also identified in the photosynthetic purple sulfur bacterium Ectothiorhodospira sp. strain PHS-1. A draft genome sequence of PHS-1 was completed and an arx operon similar to MLHE-1 was identified. Gene expression studies showed that arxA was strongly induced with arsenite. Microbial ecology investigation led to the identification of additional arxA-like sequences in Mono Lake and Hot Creek sediments, both arsenic-rich environments in California. Phylogenetic analyses placed these sequences as distinct members of the ArxA clade of arsenite oxidases. ArxA-like sequences were also identified in metagenome sequences of several alkaline microbial mat environments of Yellowstone National Park hot springs. These results suggest that ArxA-type arsenite oxidases appear to be widely distributed in the environment presenting an opportunity for further investigations of the contribution of Arx-dependent arsenotrophy to the arsenic biogeochemical cycle.					; Lowe, Todd/ABJ-5261-2022; Rizzo, Francesca/GXB-2844-2022; Bernick, David/I-5739-2012	Bernick, David/0000-0003-1056-307X; 													1462-2912	1462-2920				JUL	2012	14	7					1635	1645		10.1111/j.1462-2920.2012.02722.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2012.02722.x								22404962					WOS:000305904500004

Burbot are found primarily in three natural-lake systems, Boysen Reservoir on the Wind River, the main stem of the Wind River, and some off-channel man-made lentic systems developed as part of agricultural irrigation projects. Differences in densities, growth, and population structure appear to occur among burbot stocks across the watershed. Known sources of mortality include angling, particularly through the ice during winter, and entrainment of burbot into canal systems that deliver irrigation water to farmlands. It is suspected that the three natural-lake systems serve as sources of burbot recruitment to downstream portions of the watershed. There is a need to assess burbot stocks in lentic waters across the watershed, determine sources of recruitment and downstream movement patterns of juveniles and adults, and identify the effects of angler harvest and entrainment into irrigation canals on the population dynamics of stocks in natural lakes and reservoirs.																			0892-2284		978-1-888569-98-8				2008	59						187	+																WOS:000253841600012

Abundance and composition of the main aquatic bacteria phyla (Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Cytophaga-Flavobacteria) and Archaea were associated with different combinations of physico-chemical parameters of water, and followed temporal variations of temperature, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), aromaticity, and water color. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that water acidity is a less significant predictor of bacterial activity; however, we have found Betaproteobacteria negatively correlated (r = -0.49, p = 0.01), while Actinobacteria positively correlated (r = 0.21, p = 0.05) to pH. This relation was the most significant in the ecotone zone. In the overall bacteria community structure Betaproteobacteria dominated (18.3%) regardless of site or season, except for winter when, at low temperatures and DOC concentrations, Actinobacteria increased to 22.9%. The Archaea fraction was uniform (11%) in seasons and sites and showed no specific preferences to physico-chemical predictors. Although the water parameters from the Sphagnum mat did not differ significantly from pelagic water, its role as a source of allochthonous organic matter is crucial for bacteria activity. The relations between peat bog lake attributes and seasonal changes in bacterial diversity demonstrated a distinct divergent pattern for each prokaryote. Obtaining results will provide support for any future evaluation of the effects of environmental variables on prokaryotic community structures in peat bog lakes.					; Glinska-Lewczuk, Katarzyna/H-9759-2019	GLINSKA-LEWCZUK, KATARZYNA/0000-0002-7845-6353; 														2073-4441				APR	2018	10	4							485	10.3390/w10040485	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10040485													WOS:000434954900139

Patterns of Mercury Accumulation among Seston in Lakes of the Adirondack Mountains, New York	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Mercury (Hg) concentrations in seston (biotic and abiotic particles <200 mu m) were measured during summer thermal stratification in nine lakes in the Adirondack Mountains of Now York State that exhibit a range of physical and chemical characteristics. Fractionation of Hg bound to particulate matter was conducted to identify the influences of seston density and water chemistry on Hg accumulation among various ecologically important seston size classes (0.2-2, 2-20, 20-200, and > 153 mu m). Total dissolved Al (<0.45 mu m) in lace water was significantly related to Hg concentrations in the 20-200 mu m size class, and was positively correlated with Hg concentrations in the other seston size classes. Seston density was negatively correlated with seston Hg concentrations and significantly related to Hg bound by seston in the 0.2-2 mu m size class, The results suggest that surface water Al concentrations and seston density influence Hg accumulation at the base of the aquatic food chain.

Here we show that distinguishing several wetland and lake classes improves our understanding of current and future methane emissions. Our estimate of net annual methane emission (1988-2019) was 34 (95% CI: 25-43) Tg CH4 yr(-1), dominated by five wetland (26 Tg CH4 yr(-1)) and seven lake (5.7 Tg CH4 yr(-1)) classes. Our estimate was lower than previous estimates due to explicit characterization of low methane-emitting wetland and lake classes, for example, permafrost bogs, bogs, large lakes and glacial lakes. To reduce uncertainty further, improved wetland maps and further measurements of wetland winter emissions and lake ebullition are needed. Methane emissions were estimated to increase by similar to 31% under a moderate warming scenario (SSP2-4.5 by 2100), driven primarily by warming rather than permafrost thaw.					; Fluet-Chouinard, Etienne/KIH-8576-2024; Arndt, Kyle/ABC-2565-2021; Olefeldt, David/E-8835-2013; Bruhwiler, Lori/AAQ-8502-2020; Grosse, Guido/F-5018-2011; Hugelius, Gustaf/C-9759-2011; Crill, Patrick/ABC-1357-2021; Varner, Ruth/E-5371-2011; Treat, Claire/P-7160-2018	Kuhn, McKenzie/0000-0003-3871-1548; Grosse, Guido/0000-0001-5895-2141; 													1758-678X	1758-6798				SEP	2025	15	9								10.1038/s41558-025-02413-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41558-025-02413-y		AUG 2025											WOS:001560739200001

Spatial Variation of eDNA Detection Across an Invasion Gradient for Invasive Species Monitoring Programs	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Spatial and temporal distribution data provide critical information for invasive species management. For example, distribution data can help managers with early detection and to guide other response actions. Environmental DNA (eDNA)-based sampling exists as one tool for monitoring invasive species. As part of bigheaded carp Hypophthalmichthys spp. monitoring efforts in the Illinois River, United States, we compared eDNA-based sampling results multiple habitats across an invasion gradient in 2015. Greater densities of carp occurred downriver in the Illinois River, and lower densities occurred upriver. We sampled from five locations along this gradient and from three habitat types (backwater, main channel, and shoreline) within each location. We sampled each location in April and June. A priori, we hypothesized that 1) more eDNA detections would occur downriver, where higher densities of carp occur, 2) more eDNA detections would occur in backwater habitats than in areas of the river with more fish movement, and 3) more eDNA detections would occur in April because bigheaded carps are thought to use our sampling areas more during the spring. We compared the proportion of samples positive across this gradient, the habitat type, and the two sampling time periods. The most downriver location had the highest proportion samples with eDNA detections, the backwater habitats had the highest proportion of samples with eDNA detections, and April had more positive detections than June. Our results highlight the importance of sampling across multiple habitat types and across time to gain a clear understanding of distribution when using eDNA-based sampling. Thus, being cognizant of the interactions between seasonal habitat use and eDNA-based detections is important for managers who rely on eDNA-based monitoring.

From 1975 to 1994, the development of summer blooms of N-2-fixing cyanobacteria, especially Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, became a regular phenomenon in the western part and sometimes in the eastern part of the lake. Since 1995, the biomass of phytoplankton, particularly N-2-fixing cyanobacteria, has decreased dramatically. This paper investigates the change in the akinete abundance of N-2-fixing cyanobacteria in the lake sediment in the 1980s and 1990s. A direct counting method was developed for determination of the abundance of akinetes in the sediment. It was found that in parallel with the reduction in biomass of N-2-fixing cyanobacteria, the abundance of akinetes decreased approximately two orders of magnitude after 1994. However, the results also suggest that the decreasing number of akinetes in the sediment could not cause a 'disappearance' of cyanobacteria from the phytoplankton assemblage.

Dense Microcystis aeruginosa blooms occurred in all the enclosures during the experimental period but not in the surrounding lake water. Generally, the dominant rotifers were Polyarthra vulgalis, Filinia longiseta, Proales sp. and Asplanchna sp. at the beginning of the experiment, followed by a shift to Brachionus calyciflorus, Trichocerca similis, Cephalodella catellina and Anuraeopsis fissa, and finally to F. longiseta, Proales sp. and Keratella cochleris. M. aeruginosa blooms strongly suppressed the larger Diaphanosoma brachyurum but enhanced the development of the smaller cladocerans and rotifers that probably efficiently utilized organic matter from M. aeruginosa through the detritus food chain. The smaller cladoceran and rotifers coexisted successfully throughout the experimental period.

Remote sensing models using Landsat satellite data to monitor algal blooms in Lake Champlain	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Lake Champlain is significantly impaired by excess phosphorus loading, requiring frequent lake-wide monitoring for eutrophic conditions and algal blooms. Satellite remote sensing provides regular, synoptic coverage of algal production over large areas with better spatial and temporal resolution compared with in situ monitoring. This study developed two algal production models using Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) satellite imagery: a single band model and a band ratio model. The models predicted chlorophyll a concentrations to estimate algal cell densities throughout Lake Champlain. Each model was calibrated with in situ data compiled from summer 2006 (July 24 to September 10), and then validated with data for individual days in August 2007 and 2008. Validation results for the final single band and band ratio models produced Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) coefficients of 0.65 and 0.66, respectively, confirming satisfactory model performance for both models. Because these models have been validated over multiple days and years, they can be applied for continuous monitoring of the lake.

This synthesis examines 35 long-term (5-35 years, mean: 16 years) lake re-oligotrophication studies. It covers lakes ranging from shallow (mean depth < 5 m and/or polymictic) to deep (mean depth up to 177 m), oligotrophic to hypertrophic (summer mean total phosphorus concentration from 7.5 to 3500 mu g L-1 before loading reduction), subtropical to temperate (latitude: 28-65 degrees), and lowland to upland (altitude: 0-481 m). Shallow north-temperate lakes were most abundant. 2. Reduction of external total phosphorus (TP) loading resulted in lower in-lake TP concentration, lower chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration and higher Secchi depth in most lakes. Internal loading delayed the recovery, but in most lakes a new equilibrium for TP was reached after 10-15 years, which was only marginally influenced by the hydraulic retention time of the lakes. With decreasing TP concentration, the concentration of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) also declined substantially. 3. Decreases (if any) in total nitrogen (TN) loading were lower than for TP in most lakes. As a result, the TN : TP ratio in lake water increased in 80% of the lakes. In lakes where the TN loading was reduced, the annual mean in-lake TN concentration responded rapidly. Concentrations largely followed predictions derived from an empirical model developed earlier for Danish lakes, which includes external TN loading, hydraulic retention time and mean depth as explanatory variables. 4. Phytoplankton clearly responded to reduced nutrient loading, mainly reflecting declining TP concentrations. Declines in phytoplankton biomass were accompanied by shifts in community structure. In deep lakes, chrysophytes and dinophytes assumed greater importance at the expense of cyanobacteria. Diatoms, cryptophytes and chrysophytes became more dominant in shallow lakes, while no significant change was seen for cyanobacteria. 5. The observed declines in phytoplankton biomass and chl a may have been further augmented by enhanced zooplankton grazing, as indicated by increases in the zooplankton : phytoplankton biomass ratio and declines in the chl a : TP ratio at a summer mean TP concentration of < 100-150 mu g L-1. This effect was strongest in shallow lakes. This implies potentially higher rates of zooplankton grazing and may be ascribed to the observed large changes in fish community structure and biomass with decreasing TP contribution. In 82% of the lakes for which data on fish are available, fish biomass declined with TP. The percentage of piscivores increased in 80% of those lakes and often a shift occurred towards dominance by fish species characteristic of less eutrophic waters. 6. Data on macrophytes were available only for a small subsample of lakes. In several of those lakes, abundance, coverage, plant volume inhabited or depth distribution of submerged macrophytes increased during oligotrophication, but in others no changes were observed despite greater water clarity. 7. Recovery of lakes after nutrient loading reduction may be confounded by concomitant environmental changes such as global warming. However, effects of global change are likely to run counter to reductions in nutrient loading rather than reinforcing re-oligotrophication.

DGGE analysis of 16S-ITS and mcyA genes revealed that only Planktothrix and Microcystis possessed mcy-genes and Planktothrix was the main microcystin producer. qPCR analysis revealed that the proportion of cells with mcy-genes in Planktothrix populations was almost 100%. Microcystin concentration correlated with the number of potentially toxic and total Planktothrix cells and the proportion of Planktothrix within all cyanobacteria, but not with the proportion of cells with mcy-genes in total Planktothrix. The share of Microcystis cells with mcy-genes was low and variable in time. Neither the number of mcy-possessing cells, nor the proportion of these cells in total Microcystis, correlated with the concentration of microcystins. This suggests that it is possible to predict whether the bloom in the Masurian Lakes will be toxic based on Planktothrix occurrence. Two species of toxin producing Planktothrix, P. agardhii and P. rubescens, were identified by phylogenetic analysis of 16S-ITS. Based on morphological and ecological features, the toxic Planktothrix was identified as P. agardhii. However, the very high proportion of cells with mcy-genes suggests P. rubescens.

In particular, phosphates are often regarded as the main hazard because they may activate eutrophication. This article presents the studies conducted in order to understand better the process of phosphate build-up in surface waters of Strzegomka River at the inflow and outflow from Dobromierz Reservoir, Lower Silesia, Poland, Central Europe. The Dobromierz Reservoir is the source of drinking water for over 25,000 people. Daily changes in phosphate concentrations were analysed during the hydrological year XI 2000-X 2001 and in the long-term monthly changes over the period of 15years (2000-2014). Phosphate concentrations monitored in Strzegomka River showed great changeability. Peak phosphate concentrations reaching 1.70mg/L were noted in the catchment in the autumn of the hydrological year 2000/2001. The mean concentration of phosphates on the inflow to the Dobromierz Reservoir (2000-2014) was 0.33mg/L. No statistically significant decreasing trends were detected for phosphorus compounds concentrations at the inflow of the Dobromierz Reservoir. This means that the problems with the quality of water collected from the reservoir and with the treatment thereof are continuing. Additionally, the research results indicated that treatment processes take place during water flow through Dobromierz Reservoir. A significant reduction of phosphate concentrations up to 66% was confirmed and the possibility of eutrophication of the Dobromierz Reservoir was pointed out. The analysis shows that the most important factors influencing P-PO4 loads in the Strzegomka River are precipitation and thus also water discharge.

J	Cui, YF; Hu, LQ; Wang, ZH; Li, Q				Cui, Yuanfeng; Hu, Leiqiu; Wang, Zhihua; Li, Qi			Urban nocturnal cooling mediated by bluespace	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												The spatiotemporal characteristics of air temperature and humidity mediated by urban bluespace are investigated using a combination of dense network of climatological observations in a medium-sized US city, computational fluid dynamics, and analytical modeling approaches. Both numerical simulation and observational results show that the rate of change of hourly averaged air temperature and humidity at 3.5 m over urban areas peaks 2 h after sunset, while it decreases with time monotonically over greenspace, indicating different impacts due to presence of urban lakes. The apparent temperature decreases with distance to lakes in urban area due to higher near-shore humidity. This highlights that urban lakes located near city center can deteriorate the nighttime cooling effects due to elevated humidity. Finally, two analytical models are presented to explain the connection between the surface and air temperature as well as the spatial variation of air temperature and humidity adjacent to the urban lakes. These simplified models with parameters being inferred from the network of measurements have reasonably good performance compared to the observations. Compared to other sophisticated numerical simulations, these analytical models offer an alternative means that is easily accessible for evaluating the efficacy of bluespace on urban nocturnal cooling.

J	Cross, SL; Baker, PA; Seltzer, GO; Fritz, SC; Dunbar, RB				Cross, SL; Baker, PA; Seltzer, GO; Fritz, SC; Dunbar, RB			A new estimate of the Holocene lowstand level of Lake Titicaca, central Andes, and implications for tropical palaeohydrology	HOLOCENE												New evidence from piston cores and high-resolution seismic reflection data shows that water levels in Lake Titicaca were as much as 100 m below the present level during the early to mid-Holocene (between >6 and 3.8 C-14 kyr BP). Climatological and modelling studies indicate that Lake Titicaca rainfall depends on convective activity in upwind Amazonia; the lake-level data therefore suggest a drier Amazon Basin during this time. This view is bolstered by an excellent match between the Titicaca lake-level curve and decreased methane concentrations in Greenland ice, previously ascribed to drying of low-latitude wetlands (Blunier et nl., 1995). The postglacial history of Lake Titicaca fits a global pattern of lake-level change in the tropics, characterized by opposite phasing between the Southern and Northern Hemispheres. This pattern is most likely the result of orbital controls over the intensity of summer insolation.

A Late Holocene explosive mafic eruption of Villarrica volcano, Southern Andes: The Chaimilla deposit	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Villarrica (Chile) is one of the most active volcanoes in South America having erupted about 60 times in the last 460 years. Although its historical eruptive activity has been mainly effusive and weakly explosive, it had strong explosive behaviour in postglacial times. Chaimilla (< 3.1 ka) is one of the best exposed and widely dispersed pyroclastic deposits, related to both fall and flow activity. The deposit is dispersed over an area of 250 km(2) and consists of 8 units (A H) which were grouped into four sequences. Stratigraphic data suggest that the eruption had a relatively short duration and evolved from i) an Opening phase, dispersing ash, lapilli clasts, accretionary lapilli, blocks and bombs, to ii) a Pulsatory phase, originating a series of magmatic explosions, to iii) a Collapsing phase, characterised by unstable plumes which emplaced a series of pyroclastic density currents intercalated with thin fallout layers and finally to iv) a Climactic phase forming a more sustained plume which eventually collapsed generating the final pyroclastic density currents. The deposit (fall and flow) has a minimum cumulative volume of 0.6 km(3), with the main sustained phase being associated with a VEI 4 and the flow units having a minimum estimated total volume of 0.04 km(3). The erupted material has a homogenous chemical composition but displays a remarkable variability in both textural and physical properties. The density distribution of juvenile products shows a clear bimodality characterised by two main populations: P1 and P2. Population P1 consists of highly vesicular clasts (modal density around 1000 kg m(-3)) with mostly sub-spherical bubbles and moderately crystallised groundmass with large-sized microlites. Clasts from population P2 are poorly vesicular (modal density around 1600 kg m(-3)) with irregular to collapsed bubbles and numerous smaller microlites. The variability of both vesicularity and microlite characteristics suggests the involvement of two magma batches with distinct pre-eruptive degassing and rising histories. Our eruption conceptual model implies the arrival of new magma (represented in the deposit by P1 clasts) into a small, outgassed magma body which was accumulated at shallow level (mainly represented by P2 clasts). A new Chaimilla-type eruption could significantly affect the communities that have recently developed around Villarrica volcano and subsist mainly on tourism and forestry. As a result, a better understanding of the dynamics and evolution of the Chaimilla eruption is necessary for the identification of potential hazard scenarios at Villarrica volcano and, ultimately, for the risk mitigation of this populated area of Southern Chile.

J	Power, K; Barnett, J; Dickinson, T; Axelsson, J				Power, Katherine; Barnett, Jamie; Dickinson, Travis; Axelsson, Josefine			The Role of El Nino in Driving Drought Conditions over the Last 2000 Years in Thailand	QUATERNARY												Irregular climate events frequently occur in Southeast Asia due to the numerous climate patterns combining. Thailand sits at the confluence of these interactions, and consequently experiences major hydrological events, such as droughts. Proxy data, speleothem records, lake sediment sequences and tree ring chronologies were used to reconstruct paleo drought conditions. These trends were compared with modelled and historic El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) data to assess if the ENSO climate phenomena is causing droughts in Thailand. Drought periods were found to occur both during El Nino events and ENSO neutral conditions. This indicates droughts are not a product of one climate pattern, but likely the result of numerous patterns interacting. There is uncertainty regarding how climate patterns will evolve under climate change, but changes in amplitude and variability could potentially lead to more frequent and wider reaching hydrological disasters. It is vital that policies are implemented to cope with the resulting social and economic repercussions, including diversification of crops and reorganisation of water consumption behaviour in Thailand.

Feeding was much more common in June than later in the summer, and somewhat more common during the morning and evening than in the afternoon. Individual adult moose appeared to use the lake intensively during 1-4 day visits. Compared to deciduous browse, the aquatic plants and high levels of Na and Fe, less fat and similar levels of crude protein, crude fiber, sulfate and other minerals. In the preferred feeding areas, compared to other parts of the lake, plants were more abundant, had a different species composition and were richer in Fe and Ca. Recent flooding, a flow of water through the feeding areas, and a bicarbonate-rich tributary may all have contributed to the lake''s attraction for moose.																			0105-9327						1980	3	3					218	223																WOS:A1980KL16500009

In this boreal fresh water, a drought decreased lakewater levels, thus exposing to the atmosphere littoral sediments containing reduced sulphur from the previous atmospheric deposition of industrial sulphur dioxide into the lake and its catchment. This exposure caused a reoxidation of sediment sulphur, resulting in a remobilization of acid into the lake water, and thus a decrease in dissolved organic carbon concentrations sufficient to increase by three-fold the depth to which ultraviolet radiation can penetrate.					; Yan, Norman/H-5235-2013; Keller, Wendel/G-1533-2012; Dillon, Ed.D., Paula/JOZ-3837-2023	Yan, Norman/0000-0003-4870-6865; 													0028-0836					MAY 9	1996	381	6578					141	143		10.1038/381141a0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/381141a0													WOS:A1996UK13900044
J	BLACK, JJ; BAUMANN, PC				BLACK, JJ; BAUMANN, PC			CARCINOGENS AND CANCERS IN FRESH-WATER FISHES	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES												Epizootics of neoplasms in freshwater fish species are considered in relation to circumstantial and experimental evidence that suggest that some epizootics of neoplasia of hepatocellular, cholangiocellular, epidermal, and oral epithelial origin may be causally related to contaminant exposure. Although there is concern for the safety of consuming fish affected with neoplasms, this concern may be misdirected as direct transmission of cancer by ingesting cancerous tissue would seem unlikely. Of greater concern is the matter of toxic and cancer-causing chemicals present in edible fish that exhibit neoplasia as a symptom of past exposure via residence in a polluted waterway. There is ample evidence to suggest that contaminant chemicals ingested via contaminated Great Lakes fish may already be affecting both human and ecosystem health, but these effects are subtle and may require new approaches to the study of the affected systems.																			0091-6765	1552-9924				JAN	1991	90						27	33		10.2307/3430842	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3430842								2050071					WOS:A1991FD60300005
J	Sun, FC; Henry, N; Yu, Q				Sun, Fengcheng; Henry, Neil; Yu, Qing			First Report of the Fig Cyst Nematode, Heterodera fici Kirjanova, on Fig Tree, Ficus carica, in Ontario, Canada	JOURNAL OF NEMATOLOGY												Although fig trees are a popular ornamental fruit tree in subtropical regions, some hardy species, such as Ficus carica, have been grown in the west coast of British Columbia and southern Ontario in Canada. The fig cyst nematode, Heterodera fici Kirjanova, is a pest on fig plants, and the heavy infestation can cause retarded growth and yellowing of leaves (Maqbool et al., 1987). In the spring of 2016, a sample of rhizosphere from a potted fig (F. carica) seedling was submitted to the Nematology Laboratory, Canadian Food Inspection Agency. The sample was collected from a nursery in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, Canada, during an inspection to support export certification. The fig trees in the nursery had been grown in the outside fields during the growing seasons and potted and moved to indoor during the winters for last 3 years. The sample was subjected to a nematode extraction process, including decanting and sieving and misting, and lemon-shaped cysts and second-stage juveniles of Heterodera sp. were recovered from the sample examined. The morphological and molecular analyses of the cysts, vulval cone, and second-stage juveniles from both the roots and the crushed cysts identified the species as Heterodera fici Kirjanova. The cysts were characterized by their dark brown color and lemon shape, as well as distinct necks and vulval cones. The vulval cones were observed having an ambifenestrate fenestra (Fig. 1A), dome-shaped bullae scattered around the underbridge plane (Fig. 1B), well-developed underbridge (Fig. 1B), and coarse zig-zag ridges surrounding the fenestra on the surface. The cystmeasurements (n = 3) were length 608.7 +/- 91.6 (506-682) mu m, width = 395.3 +/- 40.9 (366-442) mu m, and length/width ratio = 1.3 +/- 0.2 (1.3-1.7) mu m. The morphometric characters of the vulval cone were fenestral length = 57.3 +/- 2.9 (54-59) mu m, fenestral width = 35.3 +/- 4 (33-40) mu m, and vulval slit = 50.7 +/- 1.2 (50-52) mu m. Second-stage juveniles tapering posteriorly (Fig. 1C). Stylet well developed, basal knobs rounded, directed slightly anteriorly (Fig. 1D). Tail tapering, with hyaline terminal about half of tail length (Fig. 1E). Second-stage juveniles (n = 16) showed the following morphometric characters: body length = 440.9 +/- 20 (408-470) mu m, a = 20.3 +/- 2.3 (16.9-24), b = 2.7 +/- 0.3 (2.3-3.3), c = 8.1 +/- 0.6 (7.3-9.3), c' = 3.8 +/- 0.3 (3.1-4.3), stylet length = 23.2 +/- 0.4 (23-24) mu m, anterior end to median bulb = 71.8 +/- 4.5 (65-79) mu m; maximum body width = 21.9 +/- 2 (17-25) mu m; body width at anus = 14.4 +/- 1.5 (12-17) mu m, tail length = 54.6 +/- 2.9 (50-60) mu m, and hyaline part of tail = 23.7 +/- 2.9 (19-28) mu m. These observations conform to the published descriptions of Heterodera fici Kirjanova (Kirjanova, 1954; Golden et al., 1988). The slides of the cyst vulval cone and juveniles were deposited in the Canadian National collection of Insects, Arachnids, and Nematodes (Accession no. 14851 to 14853 for the second stage juveniles and 14854-14855 for the cyst cones). For molecular analysis, DNA was extracted from individual juvenile (n = 4) from different cysts. A 1,151-bp fragment of ribosomal DNA containing ITS1-5.8SITS2 region was amplified and sequenced using primers 18S (5'-TTGATTACGTCCCTGCCCTTT-3') and 26S (5'-TTTCACTCGCCGTTACTAAGG-3') (Vrain et al., 1992). The sequence was deposited into the GenBank database (Accession no. KY635986 and KY635987) and was compared with published sequences by means of BLAST search in the database (November 2016). The comparison revealed 99.0% to 100% similarity to the sequences of the same genomic region of H. fici from Iran (AF498385) and Georgia (AF274409). Subbotin et al. (2010) summarized the known occurrence of the fig cyst nematode from Belarus, Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Yugoslavia, China, Georgia, Iran, Turkey, Uzbekistan, Australia, New Zealand, United States (California, Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, and Virginia), Brazil, Algeria, and South Africa. It is an exotic pest to Canada. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of the occurrence of H. fici in Canada.																			0022-300X					JUN	2017	49	2					131	132											28706311					WOS:000405289400004
J	Hussain, MI; Khoja, TM; Guerlesquin, M				Hussain, MI; Khoja, TM; Guerlesquin, M			Chemistry, ecology and seasonal succession of Charophytes in the Al-Kharj Irrigation Canal, Saudi Arabia	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We surveyed (Oct. 1991-Sept. 1992) a 16.5-km long irrigation canal in Al-Kharj City, for its water chemistry, and Charophyte periodicity and density. Marked differences occurred between the origin of a cave-lake, and the final discharge. Six species, Chara globularis, C. vulgaris f. contraria, C. vulgaris var. gymnophylla, C. vulgaris var. longibracteata, C. zeylanica, C. zeylanica var. diaphana f. oerstediana heavily encrust, as opposed to C. benthamii and C. fibrosa. The most widespread were Chara zeylanica and C. benthamii. Chara zeylanica dominated station IV for most of the study period, and ousted all its competitors, such that a 100% monospecific stand was observed here between January and February 1992. The second abundant was Chara benthamii (44%, station II). All Charophytes were seen in the month of November and December 1991, suggesting a luxuriant growth in winter. The water was calcareous, with a high amount of Mg++ ((X) over bar = 38 mg l(-1)), Ca++ ((X) over bar = 121 mg l(-1)) and reactive-Si ((X) over bar = 10.8 mg l(-1)). A gradual decrease in elements/ions (Si = 12 - 8 mg l(-1), Cl- = 357-251 mg l(-1) and CaCO3 390-328 mg l(-1)) from source to outlet was demonstrated during June. The heavy encrustation of Charophytes is plausibly related to a high concentration of CaCO3 ((X) over bar = 364 mg l(-1)).																			0018-8158					OCT 9	1996	333	2					129	137		10.1007/BF00017575	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00017575													WOS:A1996VR64000007

Pollen and brGDGTs (a bacterial lipid biomarker proxy) are used as paleothermometers for reconstructing the mean annual air temperature (MAAT) and mean temperature above freezing (MAF), respectively. Both proxies show roughly consistent records. The highest MAAT and MAF occurs during the oldest part of the record (from 6.5 to 4.2 cal ka BP), and the Middle to the Late Holocene shift is marked by a prominent decrease in temperature between 5.4 and 4.2 cal ka BP, coinciding with Bond event 4 and 3. This transition is coeval with a decrease in summer insolation, shift from consistent NAO-conditions to a predominance of NAO+ phase and coincides with the beginning of the Neoglacial cooling in northern latitudes. The warm bias in the MAF reconstruction during the Late Holocene is explained as a change in the lipid provenance or in the composition of the brGDGT producers after 4.2 cal ka BP.

In November 2017 the water level decreased 1.98 m below the hydrometric zero. Vulnerability to eutrophication was investigated by determination of the lake water volume and the related phosphorus concentration. At this purpose, the bathymetry layer of the water body and the application of supervised classification of Sentinel-2 images allowed to quantify the water body and to define the coastline shape. Once calculated the hydrometric reduction in water body after the hydrometric crisis, occurred in 2017, Vollenweider model allowed to estimate nutrient concentration (around 100.93 mu g/l) and the relative increase of the eutrophication status (+2.3% per liter). According to the lake water quality classification proposed by the OECD, we classified the lake as a very eutrophic lake with a hypertrophic level in the period of water crisis. The proposed methodology represents an efficient monitoring tool for assessing the vulnerability of water bodies influenced by eutrophication.

We examined the variations in the biomass of both phytoplanktonic components, in relation to changes in limnological variables. Each lake was sampled at three depths, corresponding to the epi-, meta- and hypolimnion strata, and at five times over the summer season. The APP biomass and its contribution to phototrophic biomass of algae <20 mu m decreased with lake trophy when expressed as total phosphorus (TP), while ANP dominated the <20 mu m algae components in more eutrophic lakes. The critical TP level at which ANP biomass exceeded APP biomass (ANP/APP biomass ratio >1) was around 20-30 mu g . L(-1). The mean values found for APP (75-365 mu g . L(-1) or 16-80 mu g C . L(-1)) and ANP (46-249 mu g . L(-1) or 7-37 mu g C . L(-1)) biomass in Quebec lakes over our range of trophy (TP: 7-73 mu g . L(-1)) were of the same order as those reported in other freshwater environments. Most of the variation in APP and ANP biomass was related to among-lake differences in nutrients (NO3, TP, TDP) and conductivity or pH.

Coastal lagoons of Bass Strait islands, with reference to endemic microflora and microfauna	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Coastal lagoons of the principal islands of Bass Strait, between Australia's mainland and Tasmania, were sampled in two summers. Many, particularly those of low to moderate salinity, contain relatively rich assemblages of microinvertebrates and some endemic Australian freshwater algae. Several species of testate amoebae and rotifers could not be referred to known morphotypes and are probably new species. The presence of certain species on islands of Bass Strait provides a link between populations in mainland Australia and others in Tasmania. Those lagoons are identified that, by virtue of catchments or buffer zones clothed in native vegetation, are favourable for the survival of a native and partly endemic microbiota.																			0003-9136					OCT	2001	152	3					489	510																WOS:000172108800008

Net ecosystem productivity-the difference between atmospheric CO2 uptake and total ecosystem respiration-in these shore areas depends partly on the extent and duration of spring flooding. Ecosystem-atmosphere CO2 fluxes were studied at a boreal lake in Finland to analyze how flooding affects the dynamics of littoral net ecosystem productivity. Two shore transects with different hydrological conditions and vegetation distributions were studied during consecutive ice-free periods with contrasting flooding patterns. Net ecosystem productivity in different vegetation zones did not respond consistently to extended flooding; the response depended on the phenology of plant emergence during the flood and on the decrease in the water level after flooding. The decrease in the water level was steeper in silt-mud sediment than in fen peat, With an exceptionally high water level relative to the height of the vegetation, net ecosystem productivity decreased by 50-100% (net loss, 0.4-7.4 mol m(-2) of CO2 during the wetter open-water period). However, the wetter season could also have a 60-140% higher net ecosystem productivity (net CO2 gain of 0.7 Mol m(-2) to net loss of 6.8 Mol m(-2)) because of the decreased decomposition rate. An extended flooding period greatly reduces the amount of litter produced in a specific year. In both flooding patterns, the littoral zone was an overall net CO2 emitter, but the large variation in the decomposition rate suggests that there are differences in the load of organic matter from the littoral to the pelagic zone.					; Saarnio, Sanna/A-2258-2017	Alm, Jukka/0000-0002-1470-8849; Saarnio, Sanna/0000-0002-1915-0370; 													0024-3590					SEP	2004	49	5					1896	1906		10.4319/lo.2004.49.5.1896	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2004.49.5.1896													WOS:000224979900040

However, there is a paucity of studies conducted in semi-arid aquatic environments. The present study investigated the seasonal variations in the distribution and characteristics of microplastics in water samples of Man Sagar Lake in northwestern India. The findings revealed that the average abundance of microplastics in samples was notably lower during the pre-monsoon season (42.93 +/- 29.72 particles/L) compared to the post-monsoon season (70.54 +/- 36.53 particles/L). A significant difference in microplastic abundance across different sampling locations was observed between the two seasons (F = 7.82, p < 0.0001). The majority of microplastics present in the samples during both seasons measured less than 500 mu m in size, with fragments and fibers being the predominant shapes, and transparent being the most common-colored microplastic. The most abundant polymers detected were polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene. Microplastic contamination factor (MCf) and Pollution Load Index (PLI >1) indicated a moderate to high level of microplastic contamination across all the sampling locations in both seasons. Furthermore, the potential ecological risk index (PERI) indicated that nearly 70 % of the lake area falls under the category of very high ecological risk in both seasons. Additionally, Spearman's correlation and PCA were employed to assess the interactions of microplastics with water quality parameters and potential source identification, respectively. The study's findings could help in developing region-specific remediation and prevention strategies by identifying high-risk areas and potential sources contributing to microplastic contamination.

Geochemistry of rare earth elements in groundwater of South-Eastern Transbaikalia	BULLETIN OF THE TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY-GEO ASSETS ENGINEERING												Relevance. South-Eastern Transbaikalia is known by numerous saline lakes with rare earth elements concentrations up to 1 mg/dm(3,) close to industrially significant levels. Groundwater is the main water source for these lakes. This study investigates the geochemistry of rare earth elements in the regional groundwater, supported by a database of 60 samples, crucial for evaluating the area ore-generating potential. Aim. To analyze rare earth elements geochemistry in the groundwater of South-Eastern Transbaikalia, focusing on sources, migration, fractionation, and the mechanisms of water formation. Objects. Groundwater samples from the upper dynamic zone (60 total), comprising 1 carbonated spring, 3 atmospheric precipitation samples, 10 saline lake samples, and one from the Uldza River. Methods. Rare earth elements concentrations were measured using ICP-MS, and species concentrations were calculated using GWB application, based on equilibrium constants. Results and Conclusions. Rare earth elements concentrations in the groundwater of South-Eastern Transbaikalia is primarily determined by the rare earth elements chemical properties in a specific hydrochemical environment and the water-rock interaction as water exchange slows down. The rare earth elements accumulation in water occurs in one direction with the formation of Na-HCO(3 )groundwaters in the region, and once saturation with carbonates is reached, the rare earth elements concentrations may decline together with equilibrium minerals. The rare earth elements migration in groundwater predominantly occurs in the Ln(CO3)2-species, while in in the carbonated spring the Ln(CO3)+ form is predominated, with the proportion increasing along the La-Lu series depending on pH, Eh, TDS, etc. of groundwater. Additionally, in carbonated waters, significant complexes with simple ionic species are formed by light rare earth elements, their concentrations decreasing along the La-Lu series. The rare earth elements distribution largely reflects the pattern in the magmatic rocks of the primary feeding area. It is suggested that the possible rare earth elements sources input into the waters are aluminosilicates, particularly feldspars, specifically celsian, as well as monazite found in Eastern Transbaikalia.

Within this purpose, number of the machinery in equipment pool of the institutions and companies which are involved in the water well drilling, yearly drilling quantities, drilling equipment preferences and geological data of 2640 water well drilling boreholes opened in 73 provinces between the years of 1998 - 2006 and the results below have been reached: The Municipalities in Turkey meet 95% of their drinking water needs (70% of the population of Turkey namely 49 million people) from groundwater as 60% from wells, 35% from spring water and 5% (30% of the population of Turkey namely 21 million people) by purifying fro surface water. 98% of the villages meet their drinking water needs from groundwater. Such need is being met as 85% from spring water, 13% of from wells, 2% from rivers, dams, lakes and lagoons. Yearly water well drilling need in Turkey is around 18,100 wells and 1,705,000 m. Water well drilling borcholes are opened in Turkey as 50% at old or new river bed alluvial deposits, 20% at limestone, 15% at volcanic rocks such as basalt, andesite, tuff, agglomerate, 10% at river basins where sandy, gravelly and clayey levels of lake beds are, 5% at rocks such as granite, diabase, serpentine. Water well drillings in Turkey approximately are at the depth of <50 m as 14.4%, 50 100 m as 36.6%, 101 - 149 m as 14.6%, 150 - 199 m as 22.3% 200 - 249 m as 7.1%, 250 - 299 m as 2.3%, 300 - 349 in as 1.2%, > 350 m as 1.5 It is observed that rotary drilling which is one of the water well drilling methods are being used as weighted in Turkey. This is caused by economical situations of drilling companies besides the geological conditions. However, it is observed that water well drilling sector's wish to use air drilling increased in recent years.																					978-954-91818-1-4				2008							749	+																WOS:000275795400094
J	Lee, RM; Biggs, TW; Fang, X				Lee, Raymond Mark; Biggs, Trent Wade; Fang, Xing			Thermal and Hydrodynamic Changes under a Warmer Climate in a Variably Stratified Hypereutrophic Reservoir	WATER												We quantified effects of future climate warming on temperature and stability in a variably stratified, hypereutrophic reservoir with large fluctuations in water level by calibrating a 2-D model (CE-QUAL-W2, version 3.7.1, Portland State University, Portland, USA) of reservoir hydrodynamics using a time series (1992 to 2011) of inflow and air and water temperature. The model was then forced with increased air temperature projected by an ensemble of climate models that accounted for complex local topography and seasonality, with greater warming in summer. Warming increased annual evaporation rates by 2.6 to 7.9%. Water temperature increased by 0.44 (whole-reservoir; p < 0.05), 0.47 (epilimnion; p < 0.01), and 0.30 degrees C (hypolimnion; p < 0.05) per 1 degrees C increase in air temperature. Thickness of the epilimnion and hypolimnion diminished, with expansion of the metalimnion. Schmidt stability correlated with mean water depth over a wide range of depths (3.9 to 8.1 m; Adj. R-2 = 0.91 to 0.93; p < 0.001). Increased air temperature increased mean annual stability by 6.1 to 23.6 J m(-2) when depth was large and the reservoir stratified, but when depth was low (due to combined low inflow and, in preceding years, high withdrawals), inhibiting stratification, then water temperatures increased evenly (and more) throughout the vertical profile so change in mean annual stability was near zero (-0.1 to 1.1 J m(-2)). Combined effects of reservoir management (volume, timing, and elevation of water withdrawal) and climate warming (temperature of air and benthic sediment) can impact the hydrodynamic regime differently under variably stratified conditions with implications for release of phosphorus from sediment and vertical transport of phosphorus to the euphotic zone.					; Lee, Raymond/C-7467-2013; Fang, Xing/AAC-4760-2021	Lee, Raymond/0000-0003-4625-9707; Biggs, Trent/0000-0003-4978-1779; Fang, Xing/0000-0003-4188-9013														2073-4441				SEP	2018	10	9							1284	10.3390/w10091284	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10091284													WOS:000448821900176

Catch Rates and Cost Effectiveness of Entrapment Gears for Asian Carp: A Comparison of Pound Nets, Hoop Nets, and Fyke Nets in Backwater Lakes of the Illinois River	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We compared three entrapment gears to determine which method was the most effective for capturing invasive Bighead Carp Hypophthalmichthys nobilis and Silver Carp H. molitrix in terms of numbers of fish captured and labor invested. Gears were deployed concurrently in two backwater lakes of the Illinois River during the summers of 2012-2014. Overall, the nightly catch rates of all fishes, Bighead Carp, and Silver Carp were one to three orders of magnitude greater in pound nets than in either fyke nets or hoop nets. Pound nets collected larger Bighead Carp than hoop nets and fyke nets. Hoop nets were ineffective at catching Asian carp in backwater lakes. Estimation of the effort required to deploy, maintain, and remove each gear type indicated that pound nets were the most cost-effective gear due to their high catch rates of Asian carp relative to the labor hours invested to collect the catch. Pound nets appear to be an effective means of removing Asian carp in backwater lake habitats of the Illinois River.

Bacterial production and biomass were positively proportional to the degree of lake water eutrophication. The rates of production of bacteria and their biomass turnover were primarily dependent on concentrations of microbiologically labile organic substrates in the DOC pool. In lakes with high content of suspended particulate detritus (hypereutrophic and polihumic lakes) attached bacteria significantly predominated in total bacterial production. Importance of the "bottom-up" and "top-down" mechanisms in ecological regulation of bacterial production and biomass in the studied lakes is widely discussed.

This increased discharge and increased air temperature due to climate change are both expected to have an impact on the water quality of the river. The Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program (WASP7) was used to model current and future water quality of the upper Qu'Appelle River. The model was calibrated and validated to characterize the current state of the water quality of the river. The model was then used to predict water quality [nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) concentrations and oxygen dynamics] for the years 2050-2055 and 2080-2085. The modelling results indicate that global warming will result in a decrease in ice thickness, a shorter ice cover period, and decreased nutrient concentrations in 2050 or 2080 relative to 2010, with a greater decrease of nutrient concentrations in open water. In contrast to the effect of warmer water temperatures, increased flow through water management may cause increases in ammonium, nitrate, and dissolved oxygen concentrations and decreases in orthophosphate concentrations in summer.

Over 100 isolates were chosen for this study, representing 44 species from 27 genera. Interactions with Fe3+ and other metal(loid) cations such as Mg2+, V3+, Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Se4+ and Te2+ were tested using a chromeazurol S assay to detect siderophore or metallophore production, respectively. Representatives from 20 species in 14 genera of alpha-Proteobacteria, or 30% of strains, produced highly diffusible siderophores that could bind one or more metal(loid)s, with activity strength as follows: Fe > Zn > V > Te > Cu > Mn > Mg > Se > Ni > Co. In addition, gamma-proteobacterial Chromocurvus halotolerans, strain EG19 excreted a brown compound into growth medium, which was purified and confirmed to act as a siderophore. It had an approximate size of similar to 341 Da and drew similarities to the siderophore rhodotorulic acid, a member of the hydroxamate group, previously found only among yeasts. This study is the first to discover siderophore production to be widespread among the aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs, which may be another key method of metal(loid) chelation and potential detoxification within their environments.					; Hughes, Elizabeth/AFR-3449-2022; Kuzyk, Steven/JWQ-0585-2024	Kuzyk, Steven B./0000-0002-9046-0371; 														2076-2607				MAY	2021	9	5							959	10.3390/microorganisms9050959	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9050959								33946921					WOS:000662354000001

Conservation of noble crayfish (Astacus astacus) populations is becoming particularly important since the number of individuals is rapidly declining across the distribution range of the species in Europe. Five crayfish populations in northwestern Poland have been constantly monitored for two decades. However, the genetic structure of these populations has not been analysed, although this information is important to devise effective conservation strategies. Methods. Noble crayfish were collected in the autumn of 2014 by scuba diving in Lakes Graniczne, Babinki, Biwakowe, Seki and Kwisno, all of which are situated in the Bytow Lakeland of northwestern Poland. Genetic diversity of the five populations was assessed based on allele variability in nine SSR regions and six AFLP primer combinations. Results. Microsatellite results analysed with AMOVA showed that the diversity between populations corresponds to 18% of total variability, which was confirmed by similar results obtained using AFLP. Additionally, significant genetic diversity was revealed by high average F-ST values. All of the studied crayfish populations significantly deviated from the expected Hardy-Weinberg genetic equilibrium and were characterised by negative values of inbreeding coefficient (F-IS). Discussion. The invariably negative inbreeding coefficients (F-IS) suggest a low number of mating individuals, a possible consequence of the phenomenon known as genetic bottleneck. However, additional comprehensive analyses are needed to assess the genetic structure, origin and vulnerability of the remaining populations of noble crayfish in the Bytow Lakeland of northwestern Poland, which have high conservation value and are particularly important as a live genetic bank for breeding and restitution purposes.

Exploitation of the Upper Jurassic limestone reached about 30 m below the static water level. Flooding process was started in 1992 after the mine abandoning and finished in the summer 1997 after extremely flood event. As a result of the high relative depth of the pit lake the stratification of the water column is observed. The deepest part of the "Zakrzowek" reservoir contain water with highest TDS and also the anoxic zone is present on a depth of 20 m.

J	ARCHIBOLD, OW				ARCHIBOLD, OW			THE EFFECT OF STAND THINNING AND STRAW MANAGEMENT ON THE PRODUCTIVITY OF LAKE GROWN WILD RICE IN SASKATCHEWAN	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												The effects of stand thinning, straw mulching and straw removal on the productivity of lake grown wild rice [Zizania palustris], was investigated in northern Saskatchewan. Thinning, carried out by hand at the aerial leaf stage, removed from 50 to 75% of the stems. Although increased tillering was noted in some treatments, the number of tillers produced was not great enough to significantly increase stem densities and overall grain production was reduced. Grain production increased by about 3.5% in plots from which straw was removed in the spring using an aquatic weed harvester. Plots in which the bulk of the straw was mulched and returned to the lake bed were the most productive, suggesting that nutrients released from decomposing straw may be important for good growth of wild rice, However, none of the treatments appear to be justified as annual stand management practices designed to increase yields.																			0146-6623					JAN	1990	28						46	49																WOS:A1990CQ52800012

The Biodiversity and Geochemistry of Cryoconite Holes in Queen Maud Land, East Antarctica	MICROORGANISMS												Cryoconite holes are oases of microbial diversity on ice surfaces. In contrast to the Arctic, where during the summer most cryoconite holes are open', in Continental Antarctica they are most often lidded' or completely frozen year-round. Thus, they represent ideal systems for the study of microbial community assemblies as well as carbon accumulation, since individual cryoconite holes can be isolated from external inputs for years. Here, we use high-throughput sequencing of the 16S and 18S rRNA genes to describe the bacterial and eukaryotic community compositions in cryoconite holes and surrounding lake, snow, soil and rock samples in Queen Maud Land. We cross correlate our findings with a broad range of geochemical data including for the first time C-13 and C-14 analyses of Antarctic cryoconites. We show that the geographic location has a larger effect on the distribution of the bacterial community compared to the eukaryotic community. Cryoconite holes are distinct from the local soils in both C-13 and C-14 and their isotopic composition is different from similar samples from the Arctic. Carbon contents were generally low (<= 0.2%) and older (6-10 ky) than the surrounding soils, suggesting that the cryoconite holes are much more isolated from the atmosphere than the soils.

Bull Trout Movements Match the Life History of Sockeye Salmon: Consumers Can Exploit Seasonally Distinct Resource Pulses	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Resource pulses provide consumers with opportunities to feed at high rates. The spawning and die-off of semelparous Pacific salmon provide consumers with feeding opportunities that contribute substantially to annual energy budgets. The life history of Pacific salmon also includes the downstream migration of smolts, which could provide similar opportunities for consumers to exploit. We tracked seasonal movements of adult Bull Trout Salvelinus confluentus in and out of the Chilko Lake-River outlet in interior British Columbia, which is characterized by a large Sockeye Salmon Oncorhynchus nerka population. Use of the outlet, lake, and river habitats were compared with the timing of out-migrations of Sockeye Salmon smolt and the spawning events of Sockeye Salmon, Chinook Salmon O. tshawytscha, and Coho Salmon O. kisutch. Bull Trout activity and residency in the outlet increased during the spring Sockeye Salmon smolt out-migration, and 40% of Bull Trout were found to return to the outlet in successive years. During Sockeye Salmon spawning, Bull Trout residency was increased in the river where most Sockeye Salmon spawning occurs. Therefore, Bull Trout may exploit both life history events, although direct consumption of eggs was not observed. Spawning by Chinook Salmon and Coho Salmon in the river did not appear to attract Bull Trout; Bull Trout residency increased in the lake (where spawning does not occur) during these times. Bull Trout residency in the lake also increased when outlet water temperatures were >16 degrees C, and thus the lake may provide thermal refuge when river temperatures are above optima for this coldwater char. This research demonstrates that movements of aquatic consumers can depend upon smolt out-migrations, and such movements can allow exploitation of multiple pulses that are seasonally distinct. These results also highlight the ecological significance of Pacific salmon for consumers in freshwater systems.

Here we developed a sediment proxy for the concentration of summer surface dissolved CO2 concentration and used it to reconstruct changes over the past 150years for three large lakes that have been affected by climate warming, changes in nutrient load, and detrital terrigenous supplies. Initially CO2 neutral to the atmosphere, all three lakes subsequently fluctuated between near equilibrium and supersaturation. Although catchment inputs have supplied CO2 to the lakes, internal processes and reallocation have ultimately regulated decadal changes in lake surface CO2 concentration. Nutrient concentration has been the dominant driver of CO2 variability for a century although the reproducible, nonmonotonic relationship of CO2 to nutrient concentration suggests an interplay between metabolic and chemical processes. Yet for two of these lakes, climatic control of CO2 concentrations has been important over the last 30years, promoting higher surface CO2 concentrations, likely by decreasing hypolimnetic carbon storage. This new approach offers the unique opportunity to scale, a posteriori, the long-term impact of human activities on lake CO2.					alric, benjamin/F-5068-2019; Pignol, Cecile/K-1348-2014; Maberly, Stephen/J-3361-2012; Pignol, cecile/AAC-2872-2020	Perga, Marie-Elodie/0000-0002-9003-0769; Naffrechoux, Emmanuel/0000-0003-0931-4068; Pignol, Cecile/0000-0003-4411-8898; 													0886-6236	1944-9224				FEB	2016	30	2					93	104		10.1002/2015GB005286	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2015GB005286													WOS:000372963900001

However, this type of water may contain organic contaminants, which must be removed before releasing the used water into rivers and lakes. Because of the presence of a wide range of pollutants (including phenolic compounds and humates), efficient, cheap removal processes are needed. In order to demonstrate their capability in thermal water cleaning, clay minerals were applied for the removal of phenol and humic acid via adsorption. To determine the most efficient removal strategy for the aforementioned pollutants, the following parameters were investigated: the type of the clay mineral, the organophilization strategy (in situ or pre-organophilization), and the individual or simultaneous removability of the model pollutants. The current study revealed that the applied low cost, in situ prepared clay mineral adsorbents are applicable in the removal of pollutants from thermal water.

J	VERTUCCI, FA; EILERS, JM				VERTUCCI, FA; EILERS, JM			ISSUES IN MONITORING WILDERNESS LAKE CHEMISTRY - A CASE-STUDY IN THE SAWTOOTH MOUNTAINS, IDAHO	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												A probability-based sample of 48 of the 152 lakes in the Sawtooth Wilderness, Idaho was conducted in summer 1988. Results from this sample were compared to the Environmental Protection Agency's 1985 probability survey of lakes throughout the western United States, which included 17 lakes in the Sawtooth Wilderness. Although methods differed in several respects, including year, season, sampling location within the lakes, holding times, and sample size, general characterization of lake chemistry for the population of lakes in the wilderness based on the two surveys was very similar. The results indicate that general lake characterization in difficult-to-access wilderness areas of the West can be achieved with a modest investment in resources with the use of volunteers. However, accurate measurement of some non-conservative and low-level analytes such as NO3-,NH4+, total P, and aluminiun in the lakes probably requires more rigorous attention to sampling protocols and holding times. A two-stage sampling strategy employing extensive use of conductivity on a large number of lakes and intensive detailed chemical characterization on a smaller number of lakes offers an alternative design for describing large populations of wilderness lakes. The relatively high concentrations of fluoride and sulfate in many of the study lakes reflect the weathering of minerals not usually identified on geologic maps. These natural sources of acid anions violate the assumptions in commonly employed empirical models of acidification.																			0167-6369					DEC	1993	28	3					277	294		10.1007/BF00545771	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00545771								24221189					WOS:A1993MR91900007

Although the relics of interdune lakes are generally considered as good palaeoenvironmental records, their evolutions and relevance to paleoenvironment change are poorly understood due to limited age control. In this study, quartz optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and K-feldspar post-infrared infrared stimulated luminescence (pIRIR) were used to establish a chronological framework for limnic relics in order to reconstruct the evolution of interdune lakes. Our results indicate that limnic relics were deposited in MIS 5 and MIS 1, due to a lake level transgression and humid environmental condition. During the Holocene, humid conditions occurred at early to middle Holocene, immediately preceded and followed by aridity. The last 600 years have been characterized by high rates of aeolian activity. Based on field observation and luminescence ages, we propose that climate fluctuations since the Late Pleistocene have played a pivotal role in the formation of the unique landform assemblages.

Water level thresholds of benthic macroinvertebrate richness, structure, and function of boreal lake stony littoral habitats	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We investigated the role of water level fluctuation on benthic macroinvertebrate communities of stony littoral habitats located in the Boreal Shield Ecozone. Using the reference condition approach (RCA), regression analysis, nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), and analysis of variance (ANOVA), we analyzed the benthic macroinvertebrate community structure of 20 natural lakes and 28 hydroelectric reservoirs to determine if they are structured by change in water level (amplitude). Along a gradient of amplitude intensity, we found that taxa richness decreases with increasing amplitude (r(2) = 0.47-0.60). Littoral benthic macroinvertebrate community structure is significantly different in reservoirs that experience amplitudes > 2.0 m. Out of 28 reservoirs, 13 fell outside the 95.5% confidence ellipse determined by 20 reference lakes. Functional mobility group and functional feeding group composition are also altered with increasing amplitude (nonparametric ANOVA, P < 0.05). Further, a change in benthic macroinvertebrate functional composition occurs after a change in taxa richness. Interestingly, reservoirs that experienced amplitudes < 2.0 m had benthic macroinvertebrate communities whose structural and functional composition is similar to lakes experiencing natural water level fluctuations.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				OCT	2011	68	10					1695	1704		10.1139/F2011-094	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F2011-094													WOS:000298208400001

Quantifying brood predation in Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides) associated with catch-and-release angling of nesting males	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides) is a highly popular and widely exploited sport fish that provides paternal care to its offspring during the reproductive season each spring. During a catch-and-release angling event, brood predators (e.g. genera Lepomis and Ambloplites) can enter Largemouth Bass nests and consume embryos, reducing the parental male's reproductive success. While the negative impacts of angling nesting bass have been well documented, factors affecting the rate at which embryos are consumed by nest predators have not been studied at either the individual or population scale. We conducted field observations in nine lakes in southeastern Ontario and southwestern Quebec with abundant Largemouth Bass populations and varying brood predator densities to assess what factors affect how quickly brood predation begins once the male is removed, how quickly a male returns to his nest after release, and which males abandon their nests. Brood predator densities varied among lakes, and when predation occurred (65 % of all nests), it began sooner after the male was angled in nests with higher densities of brood predators nearby. The mean return time of a male was 30.0 min after being held in a live well for 15 min. The mean consumption rate (on a per-predator basis) for all nests that experienced predation was 20.9 free swimming fry predator(-1) min(-1), and the rate was higher in nests with higher mating success. The number of free swimming fry consumed was positively correlated with brood predator densities near the nest prior to angling, and the change in brood size was predictive of whether the male abandoned its nest. Predator density, parental male quality, and mating success were not associated with differences in abandonment decisions.

Projects considered in this paper include the draining of the Kopais Lake, generally agreed to be one of the greatest engineering achievements of early antiquity; the cistern at Mycenae with its corbelled access tunnel cut deep into the bedrock of the citadel; the twin springs at Tiryns, with their underground passageways approached through the massive 'cyclopean' walls; and the North Fountain on the Mycenaean Acropolis of Athens. These Mycenaean systems are compared with the remarkable underground water supply system at Troy uncovered by the recent excavations led by Manfred Korfmann, a structure which may date to the beginning of the 3rd millennium and which appears to be invoked among the deities of Wilusa (Troy) in the early-13th century treaty between Muwattalli II of Hatti and Alaksandu of Wilusa (and which may be a precursor of the famous Persian qanats).																			1606-9749		978-1-84339-610-9				2007	7	1					77	84		10.2166/ws.2007.009	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/ws.2007.009													WOS:000247339900009
J	Diffenbaugh, NS; Sloan, LC				Diffenbaugh, NS; Sloan, LC			Mid-Holocene orbital forcing of regional-scale climate: A case study of western North America using a high-resolution RCM	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Within the context of anthropogenic climate change, paleoclimate modeling has become a key technique for studying climate system responses to changes in external forcing. Of current interest is the response of regional-scale climate to global-scale changes in climate forcing, a problem made particularly difficult in regions of topographic complexity. In an effort to understand the role that regional-scale climate processes play in shaping the response of regional climate to changes in external forcing, the sensitivity of a high-resolution regional climate model (RCM) to mid-Holocene orbital forcing was tested, focusing on the Pacific coast region of the western United States as a case study. Mid-Holocene orbital forcing resulted in RCM-simulated summer warming of 1degrees-2.5degreesC over most of the western United States. This result is in strong agreement with proxy reconstructions, suggesting that regional mid-Holocene temperature change can be explained by direct orbital forcing alone, independent of climate system feedbacks. In contrast, positive anomalies (mid-Holocene-control) in mean annual precipitation 2 evaporation (P - E), dominated by changes in atmospheric circulation in the seasonal transition months of March and November, were in disagreement with proxy reconstructions from the Pacific coast. This model-data mismatch in moisture characteristics suggests that direct orbital forcing of regional-scale atmospheric processes was not the sole influence shaping the mid-Holocene moisture record of the Pacific coast. It also indicates that consideration of regional-scale climate system feedbacks and extraregional process interactions is critical for the application of RCMs to both paleoclimate problems and future climate change scenarios.

Crop Tree Release Guidelines for 71-to 94-Year-Old Oak Stands Based on Height and Financial Maturity	JOURNAL OF FORESTRY												Thousands of acres of northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.) in the upper Midwest of the United States exceed 70 years of age, and silvicultural guidelines are needed for these stands. The objectives of this study were to develop crop tree release guidelines for northern red oak and estimate the maximum size at which financial returns justify release. Trees from 25 sites were used to develop a model that predicted crown size using diameter at breast height and tree height. Data collected from crop trees on nine sites (site indexes 63-74 ft) were used to estimate individual tree rates of return based on potential product grade and prevailing market prices at the time of the study. We present crop tree release guidelines based on the growing space needs of individual trees. Generally, once trees reached their highest potential product class, the rate of value growth after release fell below typical minimum acceptable rates of return.																			0022-1201	1938-3746				MAY	2018	116	3					217	221		10.1093/jofore/fvx012	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jofore/fvx012													WOS:000432260100001

Near-inertial wave driven dissolved oxygen transfer through the thermocline of a large lake	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The offshore regions of large temperate lakes are characterized by strong summer temperature stratification that limits vertical mass flux, and enables near-inertial internal wave motions. Here, we investigate the contribution of near-inertial baroclinic velocity shear on enhancing the vertical transport of dissolved oxygen (DO) through the thermocline of the central basin of Lake Erie. The lake is prone to severe annual hypoxia in the hypolimnion and also has strong near-inertial Poincare wave activity. Using field measurements, analytical arguments and a numerical model under idealized conditions, we show that the near-inertial waves drive baroclinic shear instabilities that enhance the vertical turbulent diffusivity and reduce the rate of DO depletion in the hypolimnion by up to 12% over the entire basin. Results from modeling large-spatial variability in the enhanced thermocline flux to match the distribution of near-inertial wave energy density, indicate that the observed oxygen budgets will vary as a function of location of sampling.

Yet, much remains unknown about the photoreactivity of Adirondack lake waters. We quantified the apparent quantum yields (Phi(app,RI)) of photochemically produced reactive intermediates (RIs), such as excited triplet states of dissolved organic matter ((DOM)-D-3*), singlet oxygen (O-1(2)), and hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot), for surface waters collected from 16 representative Adirondack lakes. Phi(app), (DOM)-D-3* and Phi(app),O-1(2) for native Adirondack lake waters fell within ranges reported for whole waters and DOM isolates from various sources, while Phi(app), (OH)-O-center dot were substantially lower than those measured for other aquatic samples. Orthogonal partial least squares and multiple linear regression analyses identified the spectral slope coefficient from 290 to 400 nm (S290-400) as the most effective predictor of Phi(app, RI) among measured water chemistry parameters and bulk DOM properties. Phi(app, RI) also exhibited divergent responses to controlled pH adjustment and aluminum or iron addition simulating hypothetical scenarios relevant to past and future water chemistry conditions of Adirondack lakes. This study highlights the need for continued research on changes in photoreactivity of acid-impacted aquatic ecosystems in response to browning and subsequent impacts on photochemical processes.

Total of 39 phytoplankton genera under Division Chlorophyta, Cyanophyta, Chrysophyta and Pyrrophyta were reported from the study site. Among these, 36 genera were observed from the aquaculture sites while only 30 genera from the non-aquaculture sites. Results of the density revealed that availability of phytoplankton was significantly higher in the aquaculture than the non-aquaculture sampling stations for all major phytoplankton divisions. Highest monthly density was also recorded during the summer months of March to May 2014 and lowest in the month of January 2014 due to sulphur upwelling. The most dominant phytoplankton based on importance value for both sampling sites was Microcystis followed by Merismopedia in aquaculture sites and Oscillatoria in non-aquaculture sites, all under division Cyanophyta, indicating the organic pollution and eutrophication of Taal Lake.

The size and shape of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, which determined the mean positions of storm tracks, may have been the primary control on late Pleistocene water budgets of Great Basin lakes.																			0091-7613					FEB	1997	25	2					155	158		10.1130/0091-7613(1997)025<0155:LBFAGC>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0091-7613(1997)025<0155:LBFAGC>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1997WG66300015

Dynamics of stream water TOC concentrations in a boreal headwater catchment: Controlling factors and implications for climate scenarios	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Two different but complementary modelling approaches for reproducing the observed dynamics of total organic carbon (TOC) in a boreal stream are presented. One is based on a regression analysis, while the other is based on riparian soil conditions using a convolution of flow and concentration. Both approaches are relatively simple to establish and help to identify gaps in the process understanding of the TOC transport from soils to catchments runoff. The largest part of the temporal variation of stream TOC concentrations (4-46 mg L-1) in a forested headwater stream in the boreal zone in northern Sweden may be described using a four-parameter regression equation that has runoff and transformed air temperature as sole input variables. Runoff is assumed to be a proxy for soil wetness conditions and changing flow pathways which in turn caused most of the stream TOC variation. Temperature explained a significant part of the observed inter-annual variability. Long-term riparian hydrochemistry in soil solutions within 4 m of the stream also captures a surprisingly large part of the observed variation of stream TOC and highlights the importance of riparian soils. The riparian zone was used to reproduce stream TOC with the help of a convolution model based on flow and average riparian chemistry as input variables. There is a significant effect of wetting of the riparian soil that translates into a memory effect for subsequent episodes and thus contributes to controlling stream TOC concentrations. Situations with high flow introduce a large amount of variability into stream water TOC that may be related to memory effects, rapid groundwater fluctuations and other processes not identified so far. Two different climate scenarios for the region based on the IPCC scenarios were applied to the regression equation to test what effect the expected increase in precipitation and temperature and resulting changes in runoff would have on stream TOC concentrations assuming that the soil conditions remain unchanged. Both scenarios resulted in a mean increase of stream TOC concentrations of between 1.5 and 2.5 mg L-1 during the snow free season, which amounts to approximately 15% more TOC export compared to present conditions. Wetter and warmer conditions in the late autumn led to a difference of monthly average TOC of up to 5 mg L-1, suggesting that stream TOC may be particularly susceptible to climate variability during this season.

Microcystin concentrations varied largely and were present at acute toxicity levels only in some wind concentrated scums of blue-green algae (>90% Microcystis, primarily M. botrys, M. viridis and some M. wesenbergii) in Hamilton Harbour. In Hamilton Harbour, microcystin-RR was the main microcystin with microcystin-YR and -LR also present. The two samples of August 17 and September 7, taken during the peak of the cyanobacterial bloom, contained 60 and 400 mug/L, respectively. A few dying birds were seen in the Hamilton scums. The concentrations of microcystins at the Lake Erie sites were less than 1 mug/L, yet dead birds were common. The major limitation with this approach is that current analysis (ELISA and HPLC) methods are unable to measure covalently bound microcystins, the form that is assimilated into the food chain.

These fisheries have been affected by the damming of many of the major water-ways for hydroelectric generation. To create fisheries in reservoirs that would be otherwise inaccessible, elvers have been transferred from the base of dams into habitats upstream. Operations in three catchments: the Patea River (Lake Rotorangi), Waikato River (eight reservoirs notably the two lowermost, lakes Karapiro and Arapuni), and Rangitaiki River (lakes Matahina and Aniwhenua) are discussed. In all reservoirs, the transfers have successfully established fishable populations within six years of the first transfers and, in Lake Arapuni eels have reached the marketable size of 220 g in less than four years. In comparison, it typically takes from 13 to 17 years before eel populations are fishable in the lower Waikato River where direct access to the sea is available. Telemetry and monitoring at the screens and tailraces of several power stations have been used to determine migration timing, triggers, and pathways of mature eels. Successful downstream transfer of mature migrating adults has been achieved by spillway opening and netting in headraces during rain events in autumn, but means of preventing eels from impinging and entraining at the intakes are still required. An integrated, catchment-wide management system will be required to ensure sustainability of the fisheries.

J	Ogashawara, I				Ogashawara, Igor			The Use of Sentinel-3 Imagery to Monitor Cyanobacterial Blooms	ENVIRONMENTS												Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CHABs) have been a concern for aquatic systems, especially those used for water supply and recreation. Thus, the monitoring of CHABs is essential for the establishment of water governance policies. Recently, remote sensing has been used as a tool to monitor CHABs worldwide. Remote monitoring of CHABs relies on the optical properties of pigments, especially the phycocyanin (PC) and chlorophyll-a (chl-a). The goal of this study is to evaluate the potential of recent launch the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) on-board the Sentinel-3 satellite to identify PC and chl-a. To do this, OLCI images were collected over the Western part of Lake Erie (U.S.A.) during the summer of 2016, 2017, and 2018. When comparing the use of traditional remote sensing algorithms to estimate PC and chl-a, none was able to accurately estimate both pigments. However, when single and band ratios were used to estimate these pigments, stronger correlations were found. These results indicate that spectral band selection should be re-evaluated for the development of new algorithms for OLCI images. Overall, Sentinel 3/OLCI has the potential to be used to identify PC and chl-a. However, algorithm development is needed.

A major nutrient contributor is agricultural land use, specifically tile drainage discharge. Small lakes and ponds are at elevated risk for HAB appearance, as they are uniquely sensitive to nutrient input. HABs introduce exposure risk to microcystin (MC), hepatotoxic and potentially carcinogenic cyanotoxins. To investigate the impact of anthropogenic land use on small lakes and ponds, 24 sites in central Ohio were sampled over a 3-month period in late summer of 2015. MC concentration, microbial community structure, and water chemistry were analyzed. Land use intensity, including tile drainage systems, was the driver of clustering in principle component analysis, ultimately contributing to nutrient deposition, a driver of HABs. Relative abundance of HAB-forming genera was correlated with elevated concentrations of nitrate and soluble reactive phosphate. One location (FC) showed MC concentrations exceeding 875 mu g/L and large community shifts in ciliates (Oligohymenophorea) associated with hypoxic conditions. The prokaryotic community at FC was dominated by Planktothrix sp. These results demonstrate the impact of HABs in small lakes and ponds, and that prevailing issues extend beyond cyanotoxins, such as cascading impacts on other trophic levels.

In the littoral zone, roach was always more numerous than perch, while perch dominated in the open water. Intraspecific diet overlap values were higher than interspecific values. In the pelagic zone, perch <155 mm fed mainly on the cladoceran Leptodora kindtii, while small bosminids were most important food items for roach. Large perch were piscivorous, feeding mainly on smelt Osmerus eperelanus. In the littoral zone small perch foraged on zooplankton and chironomid larvae and large perch on chironomids and fish (small perch). Small roach fed mainly on bosminids and detritus, while for roach >185 mm macrophytes (Elodea canadensis, Lemna trisulca) were also of importance. Detritus was more common in the food of roach in Laitialanselka than in Enonselka. The slower growth rate of roach in Laitialanselka compared with Enonselka was probably connected with this. However, considering the latitude of the lake, the growth rate of both roach and perch was relatively fast in both basins. The results indicated that in a large lake both perch and roach are able to utilize effectively the different habitats and diverse food resources. By segregation in food resource utilization they are able to co-exist in large quantities, at the same time maintaining a relatively fast growth rate.

The birds were diagnosed as having subacute lead poisoning due to ingestion of spent lead shot. The main gross findings were bile-stained liver, edematous or gelatinous bone marrow, bile-stained lining with hyperkeratosis and lead pellets in the gizzard, and proventricular impaction. Histopathologically, there was lead-hemolytic jaundice of the liver, hemosiderosis in the liver and spleen, and hypoplasia of the bone marrow with increased numbers of polychromatic erythroblasts. Acid-fast intranuclear inclusion bodies were seen in kidneys of seven swans. Under electron microscopy, inclusion bodies had frayed contours and consisted of high-electron-dense fine granules. The lead concentration of the liver ranged from 5.5 to 44.3 mg/kg wet weight. It was suggested that these changes resulted from excess breakdown of erythrocytes, inhibition of heme synthesis, and impaired erythropoiesis caused by lead shot.

J	Wu, BL; Wang, XCC; Dzakpasu, M				Wu, Baolei; Wang, Xiaochang C.; Dzakpasu, Mawuli			Genetic characterization of fecal impacts of seagull migration on an urban scenery lake	WATER RESEARCH												A microbial source tracking scheme was devised to differentiate fecal impacts of seagulls from that of human activities on an urban scenery lake in southern China, which is a major wintering ground for the black-headed seagull. Fecal contamination of seagulls was characterized by quantifying a novel genetic marker targeting Catellicoccus marimamalium. Quantification of this marker was combined with those of Escherichia coli, human-associated Bacteroidales, thermophilic Campylobacter and Helicobacter. Findings of a year-round study indicate that C marimamalium levels correlated strongly, both spatially and temporally, with seagull migration. A steady increase in C marimammalium concentrations was recorded between October 2014 and March 2015, which peaked at about 5-log copies/100 mL in January. However, a background level of about 2.1-log copies/100 mL was noticeable from April through September when seagulls were absent, probably due to other host sources or secondary habitats for C marimammalium. Seagull migration also caused an apparent elevation of E. coli concentrations (86% and 60%, respectively for qPCR and culture method; p < 0.001) as well as Campylobacter and Helicobacter (66% and 68%, respectively; p < 0.001). Nonetheless, in contrast to the declining levels of E. coli, Campylobacter and Helicobacter, the human-specific Bacteroidales marginally increased in the seagull-absent season, indicating a limited influence of human activities, compared with seagull migration, on the seasonal variations in microbial water quality of the lake. The elevated levels of FIB, Campylobacter and Helicobacter along with C marimammalium may imply human health risk of the lake water due to seasonal seagull migration, which requires further investigation for risk assessment.

J	Swanberg, TR				Swanberg, TR			Movements of and habitat use by fluvial bull trout in the Blackfoot River, Montana	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The seasonal movements and habitat use by fluvial bull trout Salvelinus confluentus in the Blackfoot River drainage, western Montana, were investigated by using radiotelemetry and snorkel surveys from May 1994 to October 1995. Twenty-four bull trout made upriver migrations (mean distance, 63 +/- 21 km), 33% of which were related to spawning. In June of both years fish began migrations, which appeared to be cued by an increase in maximum daily water temperature (to 17.7 degrees C in 1995) and a decrease in discharge from peak runoff. Larger fish began moving at cooler temperatures and earlier dates than smaller fish. Migrations occurred nocturnally and were generally rapid (grand mean, 4.4 +/- 2.2 km/d). Daily rates of migration were correlated with maximum daily temperatures. Spawning bull trout ascended tributaries in late June to early July, 67 +/- 10 d before spawning. Nonspawning fish entered the lower portions of these tributaries after spawning fish and remained in them 28 +/- 18 d before returning downriver in late August. While in Monture Creek, a major spawning tributary for the Blackfoot River, adult bull trout used deep pools and were positively associated with habitat units containing mountain whitefish Prosopium williamsoni. Eighty-six percent of migrants returned downriver to within 20 m of sites occupied in the spring. In 1994, two nonmigrating fish in the Blackfoot River used the confluence of a cold tributary, but no such behavior was observed in 1995. Results suggested that water temperature influenced the movement of fluvial bull trout and that tributary habitat was important for both spawning and nonspawning fish. Results also demonstrated the large spatial scale and diversity of habitats required to sustain fluvial bull trout populations.																			0002-8487					SEP	1997	126	5					735	746		10.1577/1548-8659(1997)126<0735:MOAHUB>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1997)126<0735:MOAHUB>2.3.CO;2													WOS:000071083800002

Due to the complex anadromous life cycle, it remains difficult to assess the degree of connectivity among groups of C. nasus in the Yangtze River, its connecting lakes, and adjacent seas. In this study, laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) was used to analyze the element composition in the otolith nucleus region of C. nasus specimens from the Yangtze River Estuary, Poyang Lake, and Nantong coastal waters in the estuary adjacent to the Yellow Sea. The content ratios of seven elements (Na, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Sr, and Ba) to Ca in the nucleus indicated a close relationship among C. nasus specimens collected from the Yangtze River Estuary (Spring group), Poyang Lake, and Yellow Sea, suggesting a possible connectivity mechanism for anchovies in the three water bodies.

Algal taste and odour is usually associated with open water blooms and eutrophic systems. However, some algal species can produce high biomass under ice-cover, even at low nutrient concentrations, that can impact water quality. This paper describes a winter odour outbreak in oligotrophic Glenmore Reservoir (Calgary, Alberta, Canada), the major algal species, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and some treatment implications. 2. Using sensory, chemical and microscope analyses, we monitored odour, algal biomass and taxa, bacteria and major nutrients. In a preliminary assessment of the effectiveness of standard water treatment with this type of algal biomass and odour, we used bench-scale tests and sampled raw water from the Glenmore treatment plant at successive treatment stages. 3. In the winter of 1999-2000 Glenmore ice-cover was delayed, nutrients were characteristically low (TP < <similar to>5 mug L-1), but organic carbon and bacteria were higher than in previous years. 4. During this period there was an increase in algal biomass dominated by the mixotrophic chrysoflagellate Dinobryon divergens. Temporal dynamics of this species were inversely correlated with bacteria, and biomass declined following the establishment of ice-cover, while depth profiles showed the highest abundance at subsurface layers. This suggested that the population outbreak was triggered by high bacteria abundance but depended on a minimum amount of light, consistent with in vitro studies of other mixotrophic chrysophytes. 5. Other non-bactiverous taxa were also numerous, notably Asterionella formosa, cryptomonads, dinoflagellates and the synurophyte Synura petersenii. 6. Raw water odour was characteristically fishy, mainly caused by the VOCs 2,4,7-decatrienal, 2,4-heptadienal and 2,4-decadienal. Based on algal population and VOC dynamics, these compounds were attributed to Dinobryon. Trace amounts of 2,6-nonadienal (S. petersenii) and 1,3,5 and 1,3,6-octatriene (A. formosa) were also detected. It was concluded that 2,4,7-decatrienal was the major source of the raw water odour. 7. Sensory and microscopic analyses of pre- and post-treatment samples in the treatment plant indicated a complete removal of odour, but only a 30-60% removal of algal biomass and evident rupture of residual algal cells. Laboratory experiments showed that using standard treatment, chlorination rapidly oxidized 2,4,7-decatrienal and 2,6-nonadienal but had little effect on 2,4-hepta- and decadienal.																			0046-5070					NOV	2001	46	11					1553	1567		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2001.00769.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2001.00769.x													WOS:000172341400010

Annual averages accounted for 30, 35 and 43% of total ciliate numbers in the uppermost 20 m of the water column in 1987, 1988 and 1989 respectively. Highest cell numbers were observed in early spring, simultaneously with the first phytoplankton maximum. The small ciliate (mean length 15-mu-m, mean cell volume 1300-mu-m3) is a raptorial feeder and predominantly consumes phytoplankton. In laboratory cultures, P.planctonicum grew well on a diet of Rhodomonas sp. (Cryptophyceae). Maximum growth rates increased from 0.46 day-1 at 5.5-degrees-C to 1.52 day-1 at 18.5-degrees-C, while temperatures above 21-degrees-C were lethal. Depending on food concentration, 0.2-4.4 Rhodomonas cells were ingested per ciliate and hour.																			0142-7873					JAN	1991	13	1					247	262		10.1093/plankt/13.1.247	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/13.1.247													WOS:A1991EV89300020

The comparison of the measured total phosphorus with the reference level based on the morphoedaphic index, shows that the water quality could be estimated as 'moderate' in lake Peipsi and 'good' in Vortsjarv despite that the measured TP values were higher in the latter. Comparing the changes observed in different quality elements with the normative definitions for quality classes given in the Water Framework Directive yielded quality estimates from 'high'to 'moderate' for both lakes. Applying the "one-out all-out" principle according to which the ecological status is determined by the biological quality element, which shows the greatest anthropogenic disturbance, both lakes fall unequivocally into the 'moderate' category. Averaging the quality estimates for lakes Peipsi and Vortsjarv no matter whether on a quality element level or a single parameter level would indicate good status in both lakes that is close to the subjective cognitive expert opinion of the authors.

Suspended particulate matter (SPM) dynamics has a significant impact on inland water ecology and water resource management. In-situ data in this region are scarce and, consequently, the environmental factors triggering SPM variability are yet to be understood. This study addresses these issues using remote sensing optical data. Turbidity and SPM of the Agoufou Lake in Sahelian Mali were measured from October 2014 to present, providing a large range of `values (SPM ranging from 106 to 4178 mg/L). These data are compared to satellite reflectance from Landsat (ETM+, OLI) and MODIS (MOD09GQ, MYD09GQ). For each of these sensors, a spectral band in the near infrared region is found to be well suited to retrieve turbidity and SPM, up to very high values (R-2 = 0.70) seldom addressed by remote sensing studies. The satellite estimates are then employed to assess the SPM dynamics in the main lakes and ponds of the Gourma region and its links to environmental and anthropogenic factors. The main SPM seasonal peak is observed in the rainy season (June to September) in relation to precipitation and sediment transport. A second important peak occurs during the dry season, highlighting the importance of resuspension mechanisms in maintaining high values of SPM. Three different periods are observed: first, a relatively low winds period in the early dry season, when SPM decreases rapidly due to deposition; then, a period of wind-driven resuspension in JanuaryMarch; and lastly, an SPM deposition period in April-May, when the monsoon replaces the winter trade wind. Overall, a significant increase of 27% in SPM values is observed between 2000 and 2016 in the Agoufou Lake. The significant spatio-temporal variability in SPM revealed by this study highlights the importance of high resolution optical sensors for continuous monitoring of water quality in these poorly instrumented regions.					; Diawara, Mamadou Oumar/NYS-5568-2025; Merlet, Sébastien/U-2565-2018; Martinez, Jean-Michel/AAK-4410-2020	DIAWARA, Mamadou Oumar/0000-0002-7958-4525; Martinez, Jean-Michel/0000-0003-3281-8512; ROBERT, Elodie/0000-0003-3865-1194; 														2072-4292				DEC	2017	9	12							1272	10.3390/rs9121272	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs9121272													WOS:000419235700068

In the transformation from "Pit to Park" the use of Nutrifor(TM) (GVRD's biosolids) and Nuttifor compost was proposed as a soil amendment to assist in the establishment of vegetation over the site. Extensive public consultation was conducted in both final land use planning and the use of organic amendments in achieving mutual objectives. As the gravel pit and park are located over the sensitive Abbotsford Sumas aquifer, there was concern that the addition of organic amendments would further compromise aquifer quality. Local area residents, some on shallow well water, were also concerned about the possible impact of the application on their drinking water source. Local area wells were included in the monitoring program and stakeholders were involved in the decision-making and progress of the reclamation activities through public meetings, tours, direct mail-outs and newspaper advertisements. A lysimeter study was completed to quantify the environmental effects of the proposed applications on the groundwater, soil and vegetation prior to reclamation. This study assisted in refining and verifying amendment application rates that are protective of the environment. Upon receiving a BC Ministry of Environment, Lands and Parks Approval, approximately 12 hectares of the recontoured pit were reclaimed with 930 bulk tonnes (235 dry tonnes) of biosolids and 3918 bulk tonnes (1884 dry tonnes) of biosolids compost as a 1: 1:4 by volume mix (compost:biosolids:native soil) in September, 1999. After the removal of the last sand stockpile expected in Summer 2000, final applications will be made in the late summer to the remaining areas. Environmental monitoring showed a post application increase in soil nutrients. No effect on groundwater or surface water was observed. The gravel pit within Aldergrove Lake Regional Park will soon be a parkland green space, complete with picnic area, concert bowl, and a canoeing lake with three islands.																									2000							38	51																WOS:000189456000005
J	Bahr, MA; Shrimpton, JM				Bahr, MA; Shrimpton, JM			Spatial and quantitative patterns of movement in large bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) from a watershed in north-western British Columbia, Canada, are due to habitat selection and not differences in life history	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Movement and habitat use by bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) was examined using radio telemetry in the Morice River watershed, north-western British Columbia, between April 2000 and November 2001. Bull trout principally utilised mainstem habitat. Throughout the watershed, little movement was observed during the winter months. From June to September, movement increased and was correlated with migration into tributaries. We directly observed spawning bull trout only in tributaries of the Morice River and never in the mainstem. Many of the fish (N = 48) migrated to the nearest potential spawning sites, but a few fish (N = 7) made extensive migrations to other regions of the watershed to spawn. Fish that spawned in both years of the study returned to the same spawning location. Variation in spatial and movement data, therefore, appears to be linked to availability of suitable habitat and not differences in life history that have been observed in large bull trout.																			0906-6691	1600-0633				DEC	2004	13	4					294	304		10.1111/j.1600-0633.2004.00071.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.2004.00071.x													WOS:000225078400007

Lake-specific variation in growth, migration timing and survival of juvenile sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka: separating environmental from genetic influences	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Time series on juvenile life-history traits obtained from sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka were analysed to assess lake-specific environmental influences on juvenile migration timing, size and survival of fish from a common gene pool. Every year for the past two decades, O. nerka have been spawned at a hatchery facility, and the progeny released into two lakes that differ in average summer temperatures, limnological attributes and growth opportunities. Juveniles reared in the warmer, more productive Crosswind Lake were larger and heavier as smolts compared to those from the cooler, less productive Summit Lake and had higher in-lake and subsequent marine survival. Crosswind Lake smolts migrated from the lake to sea slightly earlier in the season but the migration timing distributions overlapped considerably across years. Fry stocking density had a negative effect on smolt length for both lakes, and a negative effect on in-lake survival in Summit Lake. Taken together, the results revealed a strong effect of lake-rearing environment on the expression of life-history variation in O. nerka. The stocking of these lakes each year with juveniles from a single mixed-source population provided a large-scale reverse common-garden experiment, where the same gene pool was exposed to different environments, rather than the different gene pools in the same environment approach typical of evolutionary ecology studies. Other researchers are encouraged to seek and exploit similar serendipitous situations, which might allow environmental and genetic influences on ecologically important traits to be distinguished in natural or semi-natural settings.

J	ZOHARY, T; BREEN, CM				ZOHARY, T; BREEN, CM			ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS FAVORING THE FORMATION OF MICROCYSTIS-AERUGINOSA HYPERSCUMS IN A HYPERTROPHIC LAKE	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Hyperscums are crusted buoyant mats of densely packed cyanobacteria, often decimeters thick, that persist for periods of weeks to months at the same site. In Hartbeespoort Dam, a hypertrophic lake in South Africa, hyperscums of the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa that cover more than a hectare and contain up to 2 tons of chlorophyll a typically form in winter and persist for 2-3 months. This paper reports on the environmental conditions that favour hyperscum formation. Reynolds and Walsby (1975) postulated that cyanobacterial bloom formation depended on the coincidence of three preconditions: a pre-existing population, a significant proportion of the organisms having positive buoyancy, and turbulent mixing that is too weak to overcome the tendency of the cells to float. This model of bloom formation is evaluated in the context of hyperscums, based on a case-study from Hartbeespoort Dam. We examine the occurrence of hyperscums and the dynamics of their formation and breakdown in relation to diurnal and seasonal changes in the wind regime and in relation to the population dynamics and buoyancy of Microcystis. We conclude that Reynolds and Walsby''s preconditions are essential but not sufficient to explain hyperscum formation. The additional preconditions are prolonged low speed wind regime, suitable lake morphometry, large cyanobacterial standing crops, and high insolation. The rare co-occurrence of these conditions make hyperscums an uncommon phenomenon, but with increasing eutrophication worldwide the frequency and distribution of hyperscum occurrence are likely to increase.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL 17	1989	178	3					179	192		10.1007/BF00006025	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006025													WOS:A1989AK64700001

This study is the first analysis of hydrochemical spatial differentiation in the stable isotopes of surface waters in this watershed. 75 samples were collected from rivers, springs, lakes, rain and snow during the rainy season in July and August of 2016. Stable isotopes of O-18 and H-2 were studied for all samples, and cation ratios (Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca) were also determined for lake water samples. Stable isotope values from precipitation scattered around the Local Meteoric Water Line (determined from Urumqi Station of the global network of isotopes in precipitation (GNIP)), together with values of the Deuterium excess parameter (d) from 15.3aEuro degrees to 30.5aEuro degrees, with an average of 19.8aEuro degrees, indicating that the moisture sources are primarily from regions with low relative humidity. The delta O-18 and delta H-2 values were significantly different between the river and lake samples, indicating that regional evaporation caused the isotopic enrichment of lake water. Geospatial autocorrelation, measured by Moran's I coefficient, indicated weak spatial autocorrelation within stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in the surface waters of the studied area, which is primarily an effect of climate during the water chemistry evolution. The cation ratios Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca in lake water samples were not correlated with the concentration of total dissolved solids, but did show correlation with stable isotopic values, which is significant for paleoenvironmental reconstruction.					ma, long/JHU-2289-2023; Li, Yaoming/HSG-0973-2023	ji, li li/0000-0001-8483-1554; Ma, Long/0000-0002-8233-8640; Li, Yaoming/0000-0003-2948-4590													1672-6316	1993-0321				FEB	2018	15	2					254	263		10.1007/s11629-017-4499-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-017-4499-4													WOS:000425160200003
J	Rawat, AS; Sah, R				Rawat, Ajay S.; Sah, Reetesh			Traditional knowledge of water management in Kumaon Himalaya	INDIAN JOURNAL OF TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE												Water resources regime in Kumaon Himalaya is a product of its specific environmental conditions. Major river systems, lakes along with a plethora of streams and springs are the main sources of water in this region. In pre-colonial Kumaon. communities took pride in their water systems and the local communities had the right of ownership over the use of local natural resources. They managed their water bodies on their own and this gave birth to a unique water harvesting civilization. Water was revered and regarded as sacred as is evidenced by the exquisite ornamentations and architecture of the structures around water bodies. An amazing aspect of these structures and systems is their longevity. But the colonial intrusion disturbed the community mode of management and gave precedence to private and state property rights over common property rights. The situation did not change even after Independence. The paper throws light oil the water harvesting methods and the linkages of water with forests. It also focuses On the watershed approach for managing water resources in the present scenario.																			0972-5938					APR	2009	8	2					249	254																WOS:000266308200018

Defining acceptable levels for ecological indicators: An approach for considering social values	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Ecological indicators can facilitate an adaptive management approach, but only if acceptable levels for those indicators have been defined so that the data collected can be interpreted. Because acceptable levels are an expression of the desired state of the ecosystem, the process of establishing acceptable levels should incorporate not just ecological understanding but also societal values. The goal of this research was to explore an approach for defining acceptable levels of ecological indicators that explicitly considers social perspectives and values. We used a set of eight indicators that were related to issues of concern in the Lake Champlain Basin. Our approach was based on normative theory. Using a stakeholder survey, we measured respondent normative evaluations of varying levels of our indicators. Aggregated social norm curves were used to determine the level at which indicator values shifted from acceptable to unacceptable conditions. For seven of the eight indicators, clear preferences were interpretable from these norm curves. For example, closures of public beaches because of bacterial contamination and days of intense algae bloom went from acceptable to unacceptable at 7-10 days in a summer season. Survey respondents also indicated that the number of fish caught from Lake Champlain that could be safely consumed each month was unacceptably low and the number of streams draining into the lake that were impaired by storm water was unacceptably high. If indicators that translate ecological conditions into social consequences are carefully selected, we believe the normative approach has considerable merit for defining acceptable levels of valued ecological system components.

Strong thermal stratification reduces detection efficiency and range of acoustic telemetry in a large freshwater lake	ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY												Background The successful use of acoustic telemetry to detect fish hinges on understanding the factors that control the acoustic range. The speed-of-sound in water is primarily a function of density, and in freshwater lakes density is primarily driven by temperature. The strong seasonal thermal stratification in the Great Lakes represent some of the steepest sound speed gradients in any aquatic system. Such speed-of-sound gradients can refract sound waves leading to greater divergence of acoustic signal, and hence more rapid attenuation. The changes in sound attenuation change the detection range of a telemetry array and hence influence the ability to monitor fish. We use 3 months of data from a sentinel array of V9 and V16 Vemco acoustic fish tags, and a record of temperature profiles to determine how changes in stratification influence acoustic range in eastern Lake Ontario. Result We interpret data from an acoustic telemetry array in Lake Ontario to show that changes in acoustic detection efficiency and range correlate strongly with changes in sound speed gradients due to thermal stratification. The steepest sound speed gradients of 10.38 m s(-1)/m crossing the thermocline occurred in late summer, which caused the sound speed difference between the top and bottom of the water column to be greater than 60 m/s. V9 tags transmitting across the thermocline could have their acoustic range reduced from > 650 m to 350 m, while the more powerful V16 tags had their range reduced from > 650 m to 450 m. In contrast we found that when the acoustic source and receiver were both transmitting below thermocline there was no change in range, even as the strength of sound speed gradient varied. Conclusion Changes in thermal stratification occur routinely in the Great Lakes, on timescales between months and days. The acoustic range can be reduced by as much as 50% compared to unstratified conditions when fish move across the thermocline. We recommend that researchers consider the influences of thermal stratification to acoustic telemetry when configuring receiver position.

Application of an Analytical Solution for Near-Shore Talik Development in Expanding, Shallow, Thermokarst Lakes	COLD REGIONS ENGINEERING 2019					18th International Conference on Cold Regions Engineering and the 8th Canadian Permafrost Conference (ICCRE/CPC)	AUG 18-22, 2019	Quebec, CANADA	Canadian Geotechn Soc Eastern Quebec & Natl, Canadian Permafrost Assoc, Int Permafrost Assoc, Canadian Natl Comm, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Cold Reg Engn Div				Permafrost is generally sustained in tundra lakes beneath water depths less than 2/3 of the maximum ice thickness. Few talik development models consider areas of shallow water even though widespread talik development beneath shallow water may result from environmental change. In thaw lakes where frost does not penetrate the lake bottom, talik development has been successfully predicted using models such as the Stefan solution based on mean annual lake-bottom temperatures (T-lb). In the nearshore zone of the tundra lakes of Old Crow Flats, YT, frost penetrates the lake bottom sediment in early winter, yet T-lb are greater than 0 degrees C and permafrost sustainability is controlled by the thermal offset. This research assessed whether the Stefan solution can provide reasonable estimates of talik development under such conditions. We compared model results to talik depths measured by water-jet drilling along transects perpendicular to four receding shores. The Stefan solution predicted talik depth and shape well where seasonal freezing and thawing of the sediment was limited in duration by rapid subsidence of the lake bottom beneath maximum lake-ice thickness. Prediction accuracy increased when talik depth was calculated in two stages to reflect an increase in T-lb once the lake bottom subsided to depths exceeding maximum lake-ice thickness. The Stefan solution was ineffective where shore erosion was slow (<0.2 m a(-1) over 50 years) and water depth was shallow (<0.5 m) over an extended area near shore, because variations in snowpack thickness determined permafrost sustainability and degradation rates, resulting in irregular talik geometry.

Testing the capabilities of climate models to properly describe past and forecast future short-term hydroclimatic phenomena such as floods requires verification against suitable geological archives. However, determining flood frequency during changing climate is rarely achieved, because modern and paleoflood records, especially in arid regions, are often too short or discontinuous. Thus, coeval independent climate reconstructions and paleoflood records are required to further understand the impact of climate change on flood generation. Dead Sea lake levels reflect the mean centennial-millennial hydrological budget in the eastern Mediterranean. In contrast, floods in the large watersheds draining directly into the Dead Sea, are linked to short-term synoptic circulation patterns reflecting hydroclimatic variability. These two very different records are combined in this study to resolve flood frequency during opposing mean climates. Two 700-year-long, seasonally-resolved flood time series constructed from late Pleistocene Dead Sea varved sediments, coeval with significant Dead Sea lake level variations are reported. These series demonstrate that episodes of rising lake levels are characterized by higher frequency of floods, shorter intervals between years of multiple floods, and asignificantly larger number of years that experienced multiple floods. In addition, floods cluster into intervals of intense flooding, characterized by 75% and 20% increased frequency above their respective background frequencies during rising and falling lake-levels, respectively. Mean centennial precipitation in the eastern Mediterranean is therefore coupled with drastic changes in flood frequencies. These drastic changes in flood frequencies are linked to changes in the track, depth, and frequency of midlatitude eastern Mediterranean cyclones, determining mean climatology resulting in wetter and drier regional climatic episodes.					; Enzel, Yehouda/AAV-5829-2021; ben dor, yoav/LJW-0144-2024; Armon, Moshe/GWQ-4177-2022	Ben Dor, Yoav/0000-0002-5345-0297; Tjallingii, Rik/0000-0002-9723-3622; Brauer, Achim/0000-0002-6655-9451; 													2045-2322					MAY 31	2018	8								8445	10.1038/s41598-018-25969-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-25969-6								29855515					WOS:000433547600006

A.; Reid, Neil			Abiotic and biotic correlates of the occurrence, extent and cover of invasive aquatic Elodea nuttallii	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Biological invasions, especially invasive alien aquatic plants, are a major and growing ecological and socioeconomic problem worldwide. Freshwater systems are particularly vulnerable to invasion, where impacts of invasive alien species can damage ecological structure and function. Identifying abiotic and biotic factors that mediate successful invasions is a management priority. Our aim was to determine the environmental correlates of Elodea nuttallii; a globally significant invasive aquatic species. Elodea nuttallii presence/absence (occurrence), extent (patch area) and percentage cover (density) was visually assessed from a boat throughout Lough Erne (approximately 144 km(2)), County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland during the active summer growth season (July-September). In addition, substrate type and zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha occurrence was recorded. Fourteen water chemistry variables were collected monthly from 12 recording stations throughout the lake during the 9 years before the survey to spatially interpolate values and establish temporal trajectories in their change. Shoreline land use was derived from CORINE land cover maps. Environmental associations between E. nuttallii, substrate, D. polymorpha, water chemistry and land use were assessed. Elodea nuttallii occurrence was positively associated with water conductivity, alkalinity, suspended solids, phosphorus (both total and soluble) and chlorophyll-a concentrations, but negatively associated with pH and total oxidised nitrogen. E. nuttallii patch extent and proportional cover were positively associated, to varying degrees, with the presence of D. polymorpha, biological oxygen demand, water clarity and soft substrate, but negatively associated with urban development and ammonium. Elodea nuttallii displayed high levels of phenotypic plasticity in response to environmental variation, allowing it to adapt to a wide range of conditions and potentially gain competitive advantage over native or other invasive macrophytes. It is evident that multiple abiotic and biotic factors, including facilitation by co-occurring invasive dreissenid mussels, interact to influence the distribution and abundance of E. nuttallii. Thus, it is necessary to consider a more comprehensive environmental context when planning Elodea management strategies.

Differing Modes of Biotic Connectivity within Freshwater Ecosystem Mosaics	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												We describe a collection of aquatic and wetland habitats in an inland landscape, and their occurrence within a terrestrial matrix, as a "freshwater ecosystem mosaic" (FEM). Aquatic and wetland habitats in any FEM can vary widely, from permanently ponded lakes, to ephemerally ponded wetlands, to groundwater-fed springs, to flowing rivers and streams. The terrestrial matrix can also vary, including in its influence on flows of energy, materials, and organisms among ecosystems. Biota occurring in a specific region are adapted to the unique opportunities and challenges presented by spatial and temporal patterns of habitat types inherent to each FEM. To persist in any given landscape, most species move to recolonize habitats and maintain mixtures of genetic materials. Species also connect habitats through time if they possess needed morphological, physiological, or behavioral traits to persist in a habitat through periods of unfavorable environmental conditions. By examining key spatial and temporal patterns underlying FEMs, and species-specific adaptations to these patterns, a better understanding of the structural and functional connectivity of a landscape can be obtained. Fully including aquatic, wetland, and terrestrial habitats in FEMs facilitates adoption of the next generation of individual-based models that integrate the principles of population, community, and ecosystem ecology.

Late Quaternary hydroclimatology of a hyper-arid Andean watershed: Climate change, floods, and hydrologic responses to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation in the Atacama Desert	GEOMORPHOLOGY					39th Annual Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium	OCT 09-11, 2008	Austin, TX					Although certain characteristics of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are well known on contemporary timescales, less is known about the magnitude-frequency relationships of this atmospheric phenomenon on longer timescales or its relationship to widespread flooding, especially in its core zone along the sub-tropical Andes where La Nina or El Nino episodes control regional hydroclimatology. Using a combination of stratigraphic evidence, geochronologic dating (C-14 and OSL), stable isotope analyses, and water geochemistry along the Rio Moquegua in the northern fringes of the Atacama Desert, we assemble a paleoflood chronology for mainstem and tributary sections for the past ca. 20 ka and ascertain the variation in ENSO frequency and magnitude. Because of the inherent watershed structure and regional hydroclimatology, mid-valley tributaries of the Rio Moquegua only flood during El Nino episodes and thus provide an important proxy of extreme El Ninos while mainstem stratigraphy records both La Nina and El Nino episodes. El Nino floods appear to have been pronounced during the Late Pleistocene and up to at least the Younger Dryas (similar to 12,000 cal yr BP) while stratigraphic evidence of large El Nino floods is lacking in tributary systems during the Mid-Holocene. Flood stratigraphy in a similar to 2 ka 7 in high terrace along the mainstem indicates an increased frequency and magnitude of large floods between ca. 700 and 1610 AD as compared to the period from ca. 160 BCE to 700 AD with "mega-Ninos" occurring ca. 1330 AD and ca. 1650 AD. Water geochemistry and radiocarbon dating indicate that at least two major aquifers exist, with wells and springs in the mid-valley dating to 710 and 3100 C-14 yr BP, respectively, while water from a spring in the headwaters dates to 10,320 C-14 yr BP. This range in dates suggests that groundwater flow in the mid-valley is neither fossil water nor exclusively recharged from local precipitation while the older date for headwater sections suggests a more fossil groundwater source and lack of contemporary recharge. The O-18 similarity between groundwater in the mid-valley and the regional meteoric water line (MWL) suggests a Pacific moisture source and the role of El Nino precipitation in recharging local aquifers. Thus, El Ninos and Pacific-sourced moisture are an important component of the regional hydroclimatology and the variation in ENSO frequency and intensity has significant social and hydrologic repercussions in these hyper-arid settings.

J	OVERMANN, J; TILZER, MM				OVERMANN, J; TILZER, MM			CONTROL OF PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF PHOTOSYNTHETIC BACTERIA IN A MEROMICTIC KETTLE LAKE - MITTLERER-BUCHENSEE, WEST-GERMANY	AQUATIC SCIENCES												During 1986 planktonic primary production and controlling factors were investigated in a small (Ao = 11.8 .cntdot. 103 m2, Zmax = 11.5 m) meromictic kettle lake (Mittlerer Buchensee). Annual phytoplankton productivity was estimated to ca 120 gC .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. a-1 (1,42tC .cntdot. lake-1 .cntdot. a-1). The marked thermal stratification of the lake led to irregular vertical distributions of chlorophylla concentrations (Chla) and, to a minor extent, of photosynthesis (Az). Between the depths of 0 to 6 m low Chla concentrations (< 7 mg .cntdot. m-3) and comparatively high background light attenuation (kw = 0,525 m-1, 77% of total attenuation due to gelbstoff and abioseston) was found. As a consequence, light absorption by algae was low (mean value 17,4%) and self-shading was absent. Because of the small seasonal variation of Chla concentrations, no significant correlation between Chla and areal photosynthesis (.SIGMA.A) was observed. Only in early summer (June-July) biomass appears to influence the vertical distribution of photosynthesis on a bigger scale. Around 8 m depth, low-light adapted algae and phototrophic bacteria formed dense layers. Due to low ambient irradiances, the contribution of these organisms to total primary productivity was small. Primary production and incident irradiance were significantly correlated with each other (r2 = 0.68). Although the maximum assimilation number (Popt) showed a clear dependence upon water temperature (Q10 = 2.31), the latter was of minor importance to areal photosynthesis.

J	Rundgren, M				Rundgren, M			Biostratigraphic evidence of the Allerod-Younger Dryas-Preboreal oscillation in northern Iceland	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Basal sediments of Lake Torfadalsvatn, northern Iceland, record changes in terrestrial and limnic environments in the period 11,300-9000 C-14 yr B.P. These changes were probably forced by climate and connected with displacements of the marine polar front and sea-ice margin. Pollen, spores, green algae (Pediastrum), saturation isothermal remanent magnetization, and carbon content of the basal sediments provide the first detailed biostratigraphic record of the last glacial-interglacial transition in Iceland. During the first pioneer phase, beginning at ca. 11,300 C-14 yr B.P., grasses and fell-field herbs became established, and lake productivity was very low. At ca. 10,900 C-14 yr B.P., climatic and soil conditions became favorable for shrubs and dwarf shrubs. This change, together with increased limnic productivity, clearly indicates long seasons without ice-cover in the sea immediately north of Iceland. A return to a colder climate (Younger Dryas), probably in connection with a southward displacement of the marine polar front, occurred by 10,600 C-14 yr B.P. Shrub and dwarf-shrub vegetation disappeared, and limnic productivity diminished. A second pioneer vegetation phase, dominated by Oxyria/Rumex and grasses, was initiated by a change to longer seasons without sea ice at ca. 9900 C-14 yr B.P. This warming is also evident as a contemporaneous increase in lake productivity. After ca. 9400 C-14 yr B.P. the reestablishment of dwarf-shrub heaths and very high limnic productivity indicate further warming.

Part I: Spatial and temporal observations of PBDEs	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The Stockholm Convention (SC) on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) calls for the Parties' effectiveness evaluation of those measures taken to meet the reduction and eventual elimination of POPs from the environment. With that goal, air concentrations of different POP families have been measured uninterruptedly since 2008 under the Spanish Monitoring Program (SMP) by means of passive air sampling. This work focuses on data for polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) determined in a total of 321 samples collected seasonally each year in 5 urban and 7 background sites. Neither significant temporal trends nor significant seasonal variations for total PBDE air burdens were detected. In contrast, significant variations were found among PBDE congeners. Those related to the octa-PBDE formulation significantly decreased in the study period. However, PBDEs related to the penta-formulation showed steady concentrations while PBDE-209, the congener found at the greatest levels, showed increasing or steady levels inmost sampling sites. Seasonal variations were also markedly different among congeners. Concentrations of the lightest PBDEs (tri-to penta-substituted) were highly influenced by ambient temperature (T), showing maximum values in summer probably due to higher volatilization rates compared to those of heavier PBDEs. Contrarily, no clear seasonal trends were found for hexa-to deca-PBDEs, which were negatively related to precipitation; thereby, indicating an efficient atmospheric wash out by wet deposition episodes. Regarding spatial patterns, overall significant greater PBDE levels were found in cities compared to background areas, pointing out the role of highly populated areas as sources for these pollutants in Spain. Yet and especially in the case of PBDE-209, our results suggested the presence of significant unknown sources of PBDEs in some background sites. Further monitoring efforts are needed to assess potential unknown sources in the sampling network as well as to ensure temporal trends of these pollutants in Spain. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Influence of variable rainbow smelt and gizzard shad abundance on walleye diets and growth	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Fincel MJ, Dembkowski DJ, Chipps SR. 2014. Influence of variable rainbow smelt and gizzard shad abundance on walleye diets and growth. Lake Reserv Manage. 30:258-267. Prey availability influences growth and condition of walleye (Sander vitreus) in large systems. In Lake Oahe, South Dakota, rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) and gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) are primary prey of walleye, but their abundance varies substantially year to year. To evaluate the influence of gizzard shad and rainbow smelt on walleye diets and growth in Lake Oahe, we compared recent estimates of walleye diets and growth in 2008 through 2010 with those from the late 1990s and early 2000s. Walleye diets differed seasonally with increased piscivory in July and October. In 2008, gizzard shad were the dominant prey item of walleye, representing about 60% of the diets by weight; however, by 2009, gizzard shad declined appreciably in the diet (22%) and were completely absent from walleye diets by 2010. Conversely, rainbow smelt abundance represented 12%, 27%, and 90% of walleye diets by weight in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. Changes in growth corresponded to changes in diets, with the slowest growth occurring when gizzard shad were dominant in the diets and increasing growth every year thereafter. Because gizzard shad are only available during short periods (<3 months) in late summer, walleye can only achieve about 50% of their annual maintenance energy requirements from this prey source. Conversely, rainbow smelt, which are available and consumed year round, provide a continuous energy source that contributes to high growth rates. Nonetheless, when abundant, gizzard shad may provide an important subsidy to Lake Oahe walleye during periods of low rainbow smelt abundance.																			1040-2381	2151-5530				JUL 3	2014	30	3					258	267		10.1080/10402381.2014.914989	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2014.914989													WOS:000335942800005

In water, bacteria ranged from 9.37-46.5 x 10(5) cells per ml, VLP were 1.97-5.68 x 10(6) per ml, and virus: bacteria ratios (VBRs) were 0.42-3.49. In leaf samples, bacteria were 2.09-49.5 x 10(8) per g, VLP were 4.81-21.8 x 10(8) per g, and VBRs were 0.40-2.55. In sediment samples, bacteria were 1.85-7.07 x 10(7) per g, VLP were 4.71-8.91 x 10(6) per g and VBRs were 0.09-0.45. Bacterial numbers in water were comparable to previous studies and were highest in spring. Occasionally, VLP numbers in water were significantly higher than bacterial counts. In contrast, VLP numbers were often lower than bacterial numbers in leaf and sediment samples and did not vary as much among dates. Only in the leaf samples was there a significant linear relationship between VLP and bacterial abundance based on regression analysis. Compared to lakes and marine systems, VLP abundance was low in this system and a virus-bacteria relationship was generally not apparent. In lotic ecosystems, rapid changes in environmental conditions may result in a less direct virus-bacteria connection than in other aquatic ecosystems.

Restoration of a Lake Ontario-connected fen through invasive Typha removal	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Lake-level regulation that began in 1960 eliminated large fluctuations of Lake Ontario water levels, altering coastal wetland plant communities. More than a half century later, the altered hydroperiod supports dense, monotypic stands of invasive cattail (Typha angustifolia and Typha x glauca), which have diminished overall plant community diversity. As a result, Lake Ontario coastal wetlands are less capable of providing many of their traditional ecological functions. One such wetland is Buttonwood Fen, a floating, lake-connected peatland on Lake Ontario's southern shore near Rochester, NY. We implemented cattail-control measures from 2016 to 2018 with the goal of decreasing live and dead cattail biomass and increasing cover of native fen taxa. Site manipulation included removal of dead cattail biomass, cutting new cattail growth when rhizome carbohydrate reserves were at their lowest, and hand-wicking regrowth with herbicide in early fall. Results showed a decrease in live cattail stem density and cover and dead biomass cover, as well as an increase in cover of fen taxa. Although not a replicated study, our results suggest that removing dead cattail biomass and targeted treatment of live cattail stems via cutting and hand-wicking with glyphosate can reduce cattail and improve site quality.																			1061-2971	1526-100X				APR	2022	30	4							e13562	10.1111/rec.13562	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.13562		SEP 2021											WOS:000700961900001

Three lakes, Verde, Pata and Dragdo, which occupy separate watersheds on the hill, provide the most detailed image yet obtained of ice-age conditions in lowland Amazonia. Well-dated sedimentary records for fossil palynological, charcoal, cation, and pigment, data are presented. The data indicate the continuous presence of mesic forest throughout the last ice age. Oscillations of lake level are recorded and the lowstands are attributed to reduced precipitation inputs to systems delicately balanced between water loss (leakage through the floor of the basin) and gain (precipitation). Gross stratigraphy, algal remains, and paleochemistry suggest that the stands of high and low lake level were cyclic, apparently correlating precessional orbital variation. Times of lake lowstand coincide with wet season (December January February, DJF) insolation minima. The strongest of eight lowstand cycles occurred ca. 35,000 to 27,000 cal BP. Even during lowstand episodes, pollen is well preserved and provides a clear signal of uninterrupted forest cover. The principal lowland elements are continuously present in the record, suggesting the long-term (Quaternary) availability of the lowland forest biome in this region. However, during the late Pleistocene the forest changed in composition with the expansion or invasion of montane floral elements creating communities of the mesic forest biome without modem analogs. While precipitation cycles were causing lake levels to rise and fall, the principal influence on vegetation appears to have been cooling. In the late Pleistocene, the population expansion of montane elements at lower elevations is consistent with a cooling of 4-5degreesC. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	FORTNER, RW; MAYER, VJ				FORTNER, RW; MAYER, VJ			OHIO STUDENTS KNOWLEDGE AND ATTITUDES ABOUT THE OCEANS AND GREAT-LAKES	OHIO JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												A program to develop instructional materials for implementing marine and aquatic education in Ohio middle schools was begun by the Ohio Sea Grant in 1977. This was followed 3 yr later by a grant to disseminate the materials to schools in Ohio. To determine the effectiveness of the dissemination process a baseline study was conducted in the autumn of 1980. The survey obtained information on attitudes and knowledge of the Great Lakes and oceans from 5th and 9th grade students in randomly selected schools within 3 arbitrarily determined zones: the lake region, the central region and the Ohio River region. Students responded to items to determine their perceptions of the sources of their knowledge. Students exhibited low levels of knowledge of marine and aquatic topics, with the poorest performance in those topics related to the humanities. The 9th graders scored significantly higher on all topics. Knowledge scores were related to attitudes and high scorers had more positive attitudes than low scorers. Students in the lake region did not have appreciably more water related experiences than those students in the other 2 regions. In both grades television was rated the most important source of aquatic information. A similar survey was begun in Sept. of 1983 on completion of the dissemination project. Any changes in 9th graders'' knowledge and attitudes can in part be attributed to the program, provided 5th graders'' behaviors have not changed appreciably.																			0030-0950						1983	83	5					218	224																WOS:A1983SB14500001

Hydro-acoustic data obtained during a field campaign in 2017 show laminated sediments in the north-western and deepest (up to -m) part of the lake, where a similar to 6-m-long sediment core (Co1412) was retrieved. The sediment core was studied with a multi-proxy approach including sedimentological and geochemical analyses. The chronology of Co1412 is based on C-14 AMS dating on plant fragments from the upper 4.65 m and by extrapolation suggests a basal age of c. 57 cal. ka BP. Pronounced changes in the proxy data indicate that early Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 was characterized by unstable environmental conditions associated with short-term temperature and/or precipitation variations. This interval was followed by progressively colder and likely drier conditions during mid-MIS 3. A lake-level decline between 32.0 and 19.1 cal. ka BP was presumably related to increased continentality and dry conditions peaking during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). A subsequent rise in lake level could accordingly have been the result of increased rainfall, probably in combination with seasonally high meltwater input. A milder or wetter Lateglacial climate increased lake productivity and vegetation growth, the latter stabilizing the catchment and reducing clastic input into the lake. The Bolling-Allerod warming, Younger Dryas cooling and Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) are indicated by distinct changes in the environment around Lake Emanda. Unstable, but similar-to-present-day climatic and environmental conditions have persisted since c. 5 cal. ka BP. The results emphasize the highly continental setting of the study site and therefore suggest that the climate at Lake Emanda was predominantly controlled by changes in summer insolation, global sea level, and the extent of ice sheets over Eurasia, which influenced atmospheric circulation patterns.

Foraging locations of Double-crested Cormorants in the Beaver Archipelago of northern Lake Michigan: Potential for impacts on Smallmouth Bass	WATERBIRDS												The breeding population of Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) increased in the Beaver Archipelago of northern Lake Michigan, while simultaneously, a Smallmouth Bass (Micropterus doloinieui) population in the region declined. However, the role that cormorants played in this decline has remained uncertain. During summer 2003, VHF rachotelemetry and rafting locations were used to determine whether birds foraged primarily in bass habitat. The foraging activities of ten breeding cormorants were monitored by radiotelemetry from both land and water on a daily basis, weather permitting, throughout the breeding season. In addition, cormorant foraging raft locations were documented by boat survey throughout the breeding season. Rachotelemetry indicated that cormorants typically foraged 2.5 km away from their colonies, at the northeastern end of Beaver Island. This area overlaps with the area determined from rafting locations; however the latter were centered further south. These data allow for better estimation of foraging patch use by archipelago cormorants and indicate that birds are not typically concentrating their foraging in Smallmouth Bass habitat. Cormorants forage in open water in areas with dramatic changes in depth, and these locations agree with diet data that indicates that Alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) are important prey. Data gathered has led to a better understanding of cormorant foraging patterns in the study area, and indicate that if cormorant foraging areas remain spatially separate from bass habitat, the probability of birds directly impacting these fish is low.																			1524-4695					DEC	2006	29	4					473	480		10.1675/1524-4695(2006)29[473:FLODCI]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/1524-4695(2006)29[473:FLODCI]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000243554800008

Analysis of changes in the Great Lakes hydro-climatic variables	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												A study of changes in hydro-climatology of the Great Lakes was performed incorporating the nonparametric Mann-Kendall trend detection test and a recently developed Bayesian multiple change point detection model. The Component Net Basin Supply (C-NBS) and its components (runoff, precipitation, evaporation) as well as water levels of Great Lakes were analyzed for gradual (i.e. trend type) and abrupt (i.e. shift type) nonstationary behaviors at seasonal and annual scales. It was found that the C-NBS experienced significant upward trends only in the lower Great Lakes (Erie, Ontario) during the summer portion of the year. At an annual scale upward trends were observed only in Lake Ontario. Change point analysis suggested an upward shift in Great Lakes C-NBS in the late 1960s and early 1970s. A combination of gradual and abrupt change analysis of Great Lakes water levels indicated a common upward shift along with a change in trend direction around the early 1970s. It was also found that precipitation and runoff are on a plateau and in some cases on a decreasing course following an increasing trend in the early twentieth century. Results obtained from this study show that the hydro-climatology of Great Lakes is characterized by nonstationaiy behavior. Changes in this behavior have caused the Great Lakes water levels to decrease during the last few decades. This study provides valuable insights into the nature of the nonstationary behavior of hydro-climatic variables of Great Lakes and contributes useful information to the future water management planning.

JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												The variability of extreme precipitation in eastern central Asia (ECA) during summer (June-August) and its corresponding mechanisms were investigated from a multiscale synergy perspective. Extreme precipitation in ECA displayed a quasi-monopole increasing pattern with abrupt change since 2000/01, which was likely dominated by increased high-latitude North Atlantic SST anomalies as shown by diagnosed and numerical experiment results. Increased SST via adjusting the quasi-stationary wave train that related to the negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the east Atlantic/western Russia (EA/WR) pattern guided the cyclonic anomaly in central Asia, deepened the Lake Balkhash trough, and enhanced the moisture convergence in ECA. These anomalies also exhibited interdecadal enhancement after 2000. On the synoptic scale, two synoptic transient wave trains correlated with extreme precipitation in ECA by amplifying the amplitude of the quasi-stationary waves and guiding transient eddies in ECA. The induced transient eddies and deepened Lake Balkhash trough strengthened positive meridional vorticity advection and local positive vorticity, which promoted ascending motions, and guided the southerly warm moisture in ECA especially after 2000. Meanwhile, additional mesoscale vortices were stimulated and strengthened near the Tianshan Mountain in front of the wave trough, which, together with the enhanced meridional circulation, further increased extreme precipitation in ECA.

J	Elliott, JA				Elliott, J. Alex			Is the future blue-green? A review of the current model predictions of how climate change could affect pelagic freshwater cyanobacteria	WATER RESEARCH												There is increasing evidence that recent changes in climate have had an effect on lake phytoplankton communities and it has been suggested that it is likely that Cyanobacteria will increase in relative abundance under the predicted future climate. However, testing such a qualitative prediction is challenging and usually requires some form of numerical computer model. Therefore, the lake modelling literature was reviewed for studies that examined the impact of climate change upon Cyanobacteria. These studies, taken collectively, generally show an increase in relative Cyanobacteria abundance with increasing water temperature, decreased flushing rate and increased nutrient loads. Furthermore, they suggest that whilst the direct effects of climate change on the lakes can change the timing of bloom events and Cyanobacteria abundance, the amount of phytoplankton biomass produced over a year is not enhanced directly by these changes. Also, warmer waters in the spring increased nutrient consumption by the phytoplankton community which in some lakes caused nitrogen limitation later in the year to the advantage of some nitrogen-fixing Cyanobacteria. Finally, it is also possible that an increase in Cyanobacteria dominance of the phytoplankton biomass will lead to poorer energy flow to higher trophic levels due to their relatively poor edibility for zooplankton.

Assessing Lakebed Hydraulic Conductivity and Seepage Flux by Potentiomanometer	GROUND WATER												Potentiomanometers (PMs) are commonly used to determine flux directions across interfaces between surface waters and aquifers. We describe a complementary function: estimating small-scale hydraulic conductivity (K) in a lakebed, using the constant-head injection test (CHIT) by Cardenas and Zlotnik (2003) with the PM designed by Winter et al. (1988). A piezometer with a small screen is inserted into the lakebed. Local head potential is obtained by measuring the head difference between the test point and the aquifer interface. The piezometer is then used for water injection. This technique is illustrated by measurements taken from Alkali Lake in the Sand Hills, Nebraska, United States. Lakebed K and seepage fluxes ranged from 0.037 to 0.090 m/d and Darcy velocities ranged from 0.004 to 0.027 m/d. Results were consistent with the supplementary data gathered using a modified CHIT and a cone penetrometer. The compact size of the device and the small volumes used for injection enable this method to estimate lakebed K values as low as 0.01 to 0.1 m/d, a range seldom explored in lake-aquifer interface systems.																			0017-467X	1745-6584				MAR-APR	2011	49	2					270	274		10.1111/j.1745-6584.2010.00717.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6584.2010.00717.x								20497483					WOS:000287584100020

Seasonal cues of Arctic grayling movement in a small Arctic stream: the importance of surface water connectivity	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												In Arctic ecosystems, freshwater fish migrate seasonally between productive shallow water habitats that freeze in winter and deep overwinter refuge in rivers and lakes. How these movements relate to seasonal hydrology is not well understood. We used passive integrated transponder tags and stream wide antennae to track 1035 Arctic grayling in Crea Creek, a seasonally flowing beaded stream on the Arctic Coastal Plain, Alaska. Migration of juvenile and adult fish into Crea Creek peaked in June immediately after ice break-up in the stream. Fish that entered the stream during periods of high flow and cold stream temperature traveled farther upstream than those entering during periods of lower flow and warmer temperature. We used generalized linear models to relate migration of adult and juvenile fish out of Crea Creek to hydrology. Most adults migrated in late June - early July, and there was best support (Akaike weight = 0.46; w (i) ) for a model indicating that the rate of migration increased with decreasing discharge. Juvenile migration occurred in two peaks; the early peak consisted of larger juveniles and coincided with adult migration, while the later peak occurred shortly before freeze-up in September and included smaller juveniles. A model that included discharge, minimum stream temperature, year, season, and mean size of potential migrants was most strongly supported (w (i) = 0.86). Juvenile migration rate increased sharply as daily minimum stream temperature decreased, suggesting fish respond to impending freeze-up. We found fish movements to be intimately tied to the strong seasonality of discharge and temperature, and demonstrate the importance of small stream connectivity for migratory Arctic grayling during the entire open-water period. The ongoing and anticipated effects of climate change and petroleum development on Arctic hydrology (e.g. reduced stream connectivity, earlier peak flows, increased evapotranspiration) have important implications for Arctic freshwater ecosystems.

J	Bruch, RM				Bruch, RM			Management of lake sturgeon on the Winnebago System - long term impacts of harvest and regulations on population structure	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY					3rd International Symposium on Sturgeons (ISS)	JUL 08-11, 1997-1998	PIACENZO, ITALY	ENEL, Regione Lombardia, Italian Minis Polit Agricole				The Winnebago System, Wisconsin, supports one of the largest self sustaining stocks of lake sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens, in North America. Winter spearing harvest of the Winnebago sturgeon population has been actively regulated since 1903 and actively assessed since the 1940's. While historic population assessments have shown a steady increase in sturgeon densities in the system, recent surveys indicated overexploitation of adult females. From 1991-97, 13714 sturgeon were assessed through harvest and spawning surveys to characterize the status of the current population. and historical data from DNR fries were reassembled and analyzed to discern population trends over the last 40 years. A summary of management actions since 1903 was completed and reviewed in the contest of long term population trends. 1991-97 annual harvests averaged 1337 sturgeon with adult females comprising 46% of the annual harvests from 1991-96 and 34% of the harvest in 1997 following a reduction in the minimum size limit. With the higher size limit, estimated annual exploitation of adult females was 2 to 3 times higher than that of adult males. Historic harvest and population trends showed the benefits of conservative bag limits and harvest season lengths combined with strict law enforcement, and habitat protection, which resulted in an estimated 58% reduction in the annual harvest between 1955 and 1965 and a four fold increase in legal stock densities from 1955 to 1990. The analyses of the historic data reinforced the necessity of standardized long term harvest and population assessments for effective management of sturgeon populations and fisheries. Public involvement is also identified as an integral component to effective sturgeon management.																			0175-8659	1439-0426				SEP	1999	15	4-5					142	152		10.1111/j.1439-0426.1999.tb00224.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0426.1999.tb00224.x													WOS:000082903500033

It was found that the absolute value of the Sr-88/(86) Sr fractionation factor,Delta Sr-88/86, increases as a function of calcite accumulation rate (Delta Sr-88/86 [%] = -0.05 to 0.042.log(R) [mu mol.m(-2).d(-1)], where R is the accumulation rate). Furthermore, the Sr-87/Sr-86 and Sr-88/(86) Sr ratios in the freshwater and brines that enter the lake were used to calculate the contributions of these sources to the lake Sr budget. The Sr-88/(86) Sr and Sr-88/(86) Sr ratios were measured in primary calcite, aragonite shells of live Melanopsis, lake water and various water sources to the lake. While the lake's Sr-88/(86) Sr ratios are determined by the mixture of freshwater of the Jordan River and saline springs, the Sr-88/(86) Sr ratios of the lake reflect a more complex mass balance that includes the effect of isotopic fractionation associated with the precipitation of primary calcite. Data analysis suggests that long-term accumulation of inorganic calcite depleted in the heavy isotope Sr-88, results in an increase of the delta Sr-88/86 value of the lake water by 0.05%. In contrast to the primary inorganic calcite, biogenic aragonite of the Melanopsis shells show a rather constant (88) Sr/(86) Sr water-CaCO3 fractionation of Delta Sr-88/86 = -0.21%. Similar Delta Sr-88/86 values were reported for the precipitation of coralline and inorganic aragonite from seawater and the precipitation of inorganic calcite from various continental waters. The Delta Sr-88/86 value of inorganic calcite is modulated by the rate of carbonate precipitation, as noted above and shown by precipitation experiments. Massive precipitation of primary calcite with a wide spread of accumulation rates occurs during the spring phytoplankton bloom in Lake Kinneret. The bloom dictates the degree of calcite saturation in the lake and hence the stable Sr isotopic composition of the precipitating calcite. The correlation between Delta(88) Sr/Sr-86 and the calcite accumulation rate can be therefore used as a tool to reconstruct environmental and ecological variations in the historical lake by analyzing the (88) Sr/(86) Sr ratio in the primary CaCO3 recovered from the lake's sedimentary archives.

However, there has been little researches on the interaction between N fertilizer rates and N losses via runoff from the paddy water during the summer rice-growing seasons. In the present study, we monitored the rice grain yield, N agronomic efficiency (AEN), and N losses via runoff from fertilizer N rate-response experiments applied to rice in the Taihu Lake region over 6 years. Total N loss via runoff averaged 19.3 kg ha-1 per rice season, corresponding to 7.1% of fertilizer N input at the regional N rate of 270 kg ha-1. Seasonal cumulative ammonium-N, organic N, and total N losses via runoff were all positively correlated with the fertilizer N rates (n = 1141, P < 0.01). The ammonium-N and calculated organic N were the predominant forms in the paddy water. Reducing fertilizer N decreased the risk of ammonium-N and total N losses via runoff but not nitrate-N (consistently low nitrate). Seasonal changes of fertilizer N losses via runoff contributed to the fluctuant rice yields, and the rice yields responses of lower N rates (<135 kg ha-1) might be more susceptible to the massive fertilizer N losses. Reducing the fertilizer N rates by 10-50% (i.e., 135-243 kg ha-1) sustained the current level of rice yields for any single year. By connecting the runoff N loss, rice yield curves, and varying market prices, the mean socially optimum N rates (221 kg ha-1) were proposed for the aim of profit maximization. For the aim of sustainable intensification, however, using less N rates (<221 kg ha-1) was better at controlling runoff losses, and meanwhile sustaining the rice yield. The 135 kg N ha-1 was thus recommended after multiple comparisons of AEN, N losses via runoff and net returns among different N treatments. Our findings indicated that continuously reducing N fertilizer without modifying other practices is essential and feasible in Eastern China. Reducing N losses via runoff would greatly increase the benefits of society, economy, and environment in responses to unpredictable events.					; Schwenke, Graeme/HGF-2096-2022; , De Li Liu/Y-4656-2019	Schwenke, Graeme/0000-0002-2206-4350; Liu, De Li/0000-0003-2574-1908; 													0167-8809	1873-2305				FEB 1	2022	324								107724	10.1016/j.agee.2021.107724	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2021.107724		OCT 2021											WOS:000719323800002

In the Dome, the Lower Lahar unit (LLU) is a lahar-type debris flow overlying near-shore marine sediments. The event that emplaced the LLU likely originated from sector collapse on a neighboring volcanic edifice. Freshwater mollusc fossils in the LLU indicate that swamps or shallow lakes lay between the edifice and the current Dome area. 40Ar/39Ar analyses on homblende separates from six pumice lenses suggest that the LLU was deposited as early as 1.90 +/- 0.02 Ma. The event resulting in deposition of the LLU transformed late Pliocene near-shore marine environments into estuarine and marsh settings. Shortly thereafter, glacioeustatic sea level falls completed the local transition to fully terrestrial environments that attracted Homo erectus to southernmost Sunda in the Early Pleistocene.

The PNz and PPz were assessed for a period of 10 years (1999-2008) in relation to water level (WL) changes which occurred during that period. We estimated PNz and PPz, based on crustacean N and P content measured seasonally over 2 years, and a 10-year record of zooplankton densities. Mean cladoceran N and P contents were 8.7 and 1.2% of dry weight, respectively, while for copepods they were 9.5 and 1.5% of dry weight, respectively. Zooplankton density, and hence PNz and PPz, changed dramatically during the 10 years, concurrent with extreme variations in the lake's WL. The lowest mean values of PNz and PPz occurred during high WL years and the highest PNz and PPz were during low WL years. PNz and PPz were negatively correlated with the total PN and PP concentrations, respectively, in the lake. The reduction in zooplankton contribution to the particulate N and P during high WL is probably due to higher loading of particulate matter in wet years, causing an increase of PN and PP concentration in the lake, as well as lower densities of zooplankton, caused by higher fish predation pressure, both are a by-product of the large water influx during extreme wet winters.					; Berman-Frank, Ilana/NGR-4939-2025	Berman-Frank, Ilana/0000-0003-3497-1844; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2010	655	1					121	135		10.1007/s10750-010-0413-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0413-6													WOS:000282179900011

One to three spawning pairs are put together with an artificial nest in a net-cage. After spawning the eggs attached to the nest are transported to a hatchery 1 day before hatching begins. The production of newly hatched fry, 30 million in 1994, is used for fingerling production in ponds with natural food. The production of pike-perch fingerlings in Finland increased rapidly in the 1980s and reached 10 million fish in 1994. The fingerlings are stocked into lakes particularly in central Finland, where many lakes lost their native pike-perch populations in the 1960s. In some lakes pike-perch fingerling stockings have been profitable and new populations have been established. Experiments on intensive rearing of newly-hatched pike-perch fry have not been successful.

Sebastien			Sediment logy and vertebrate taphonomy of the Moradi Formation of northern Niger: A Permian wet desert in the tropics of Pangaea	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Pangaean paleogeographic models place the Tim Mersoi basin of northern Niger in a 5000-km-wide corridor between Gondwana and Laurasia approximately 15 degrees south of the paleoequator. Late Permian paleoclimate models position this basin between tropical summer-wet to the north and desert to the south. Recent investigations of the fossil vertebrates and paleosols in the late Permian (Lopingian) Moradi Formation confirm that the climate was warm and hyperarid with highly seasonal monsoonal rainfall. Possibly as a result of these unusual "wet desert" conditions, the tetrapod fauna shows a high degree of endemism. This study tests existing paleoclimate models by providing additional data on sedimentary environments and vertebrate taphonomic processes. The Moradi red bed sequences accumulated in a gently subsiding sag basin to the west of the tectonically active Massif de l'Afr. Low angle gravelly alluvial fans prograded westward from the massif and at times impinged on a large stable northward flowing meandering channel system. The interchannel mudrock sequences are over-thickened by the accumulation of loessic silts and preserve isolated skull and post crania of amphibians (Nigerpeton and Saharastega) as well as semi-articulated captorhinids (Moradisaurus). Detailed surface mapping of a fossil-rich exposure revealed an anastomosed network of loess-filled distributary channels incised into the floodplain mudrocks. This provided a locus for the accumulation and rapid burial of at least 15 associated skeletons of the pareiasaurian Bunostegos. Semi-permanent ponds are evidenced by patches of fissile red mudstone containing rare bivalves and spiral coprolites. In the distal floodplains away from the main river channels, the combination of a generally high groundwater table, warm mean annual temperatures, and deflation of fines from the floodplain surface promoted the formation of gypsiferous paleosols and end-point playa lakes. Carbonate-rich mud accumulated around the lake margins and provided ideal conditions for the imprinting and preservation of tetrapod trackways. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

PROXIMATE CONTROL OF REPRODUCTION	AUSTRALIAN WILDLIFE RESEARCH												Populations of P. sulcirostris and P. melanoleucos at a group of freshwater lakes were sampled approximately monthly between March 1972 and May 1975. Both species displayed strong gonadal cycles. In P. sulcirostris these were not regularly related to change in any one environmental component, though linear combination of a cyclic factor (temperature or daylength) with water level and food availability accounted for 85.2% of variation in the testis cycle. In a drought year significantly fewer males produced sperm, and the ratio of those producing much sperm to those producing little was significantly lower than in the 2 succeeding wet years. Eggs were laid in the wet years but not in the drought year, when there was no secluded, flooded timber in which to nest. In P. melanoleucos the date of onset of testis maturation was regular but that of regression was variable. Gonadal maturation was evidently initiated by increasing daylength and regression was initiated by low temperature, falling water level and perhaps lack of social stimulation. Eggs were laid in each year, but in the drought year not until the lakes refilled. Both major breeding seasons concluded abruptly with the widespread abandonment of eggs and young. In both species laying was completely synchronous within and slightly staggered between subunits of a colony, and very different between colonies.																			0310-7833						1980	7	1					85	101																WOS:A1980JR10600009

SPRING ICE HAULOUTS AND BEHAVIOR OF THE BAIKAL SEAL (PUSA SIBIRICA GMELIN, 1788, PHOCIDAE)	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL												The objective was to determine whether the behavior of seals on ice and on shore rookeries differs, based on new data on molting and relaxation haulouts of Baikal seals (Pusa sibirica Gm.) occurring on floating ice in spring. Surveys conducted in the northern part of Lake Baikal in May-June 2022-2023 using small UAVs served as material. As ice conditions are heterogeneous habitats, in the context of the research topic we distinguished seven ice types, where the size-age composition and density of animals in rookeries, the orientation of animals on ice relative to water, and their resting and sleeping position vary. On all ice types, adult females and males (55-62%) predominate in haulouts; the preferred orientation of seals is at the edge of the ice floe (44-82%), with their head towards the water (37-71%). The preferred resting and sleeping position is the safest for quickly leaving the ice if necessary: lying on the stomach, with flippers pressed against the body (54-86%). The choice of ice floes for haulouts is likely to be determined by the physiological state of the seals, particularly the molting stage, based on the nature of the substrate (area and thickness of ice floes, and whether the surface is hard or "soft"). In late May and early June on different ice types, the relative number of seals with completed molting ranged from 22 to 76%. A comparison of the behavior patterns of seals in ice haulouts with their behavior in coastal rookeries showed that, when dispersed on ice, a larger minimum individual distance is maintained between the seals (commensurate with body size). This minimizes mutual contacts between animals, this being reflected by their behavior: most patterns of peaceful behavior described for seals lying on land are preserved, but neither aggressive nor even pacifying patterns are recorded. Various reactions of seals lying on ice to UAV flight were noted depending on the flight altitude, the number of seals in a group of haulouts, the type of ice (substrate), the physiological state of individuals (molting/molted), and individual behavioral characteristics.																			0044-5134					MAR	2025	104	3					82	99		10.31857/S0044513425030073	http://dx.doi.org/10.31857/S0044513425030073													WOS:001460244900001

Lake energy balance response to 21st century warming in the tropical high Andes	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												The response of Andean high-alpine lakes (>4000 m above sea level) to atmospheric warming is poorly understood, in part due to a lack of long-term limnological and meteorological observations. Here, we use in situ observations, reanalysis data, satellite-derived data, and climate modeling output data paired with a one-dimensional lake energy balance model to investigate the response of lake thermal properties to observed and projected 21st century warming in the tropical high Andes of Peru. The lake model configuration is based on Lake Sibinacocha (13.86 degrees S, 71.02 degrees W, 4860 m a.s.l.), the largest high-alpine lake in the Andes and one of the few such lakes with temperature observations sufficient for model calibration. Relationships between recent air and lake temperature changes were investigated using the model forced with 21st-century ERA5-Land climate reanalysis data, CERES satellite-based observations, and future relationships were investigated using two CMIP6 future climate scenarios with CESM2 (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). Results show that Sibinacocha whole-lake average temperature stayed relatively consistent between 2000 and 2023 due to high interannual variability. Lake Sibinacocha temperatures also display interannual variability that aligns with air temperature variations, suggesting that broad climatic teleconnections that affect Andean air temperatures also influence lake temperature and stratification. Under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, the model indicates an acceleration of Lake Sibinacocha's whole-lake warming rate. By 2091-2100, Lake Sibinacocha is projected to increase 2.5 degrees C to 5.9 degrees C. Lake Sibinacocha is projected to warm unevenly, with greater warming in the top 20 m and austral spring, contributing to increased weak stratification in spring. Lake Sibinacocha is anticipated to respond more slowly to warming simply due to its large size. Therefore, our results should be considered a conservative end-member for other lakes in the tropical high Andes, which, due to their shallower sizes, will likely respond more quickly to atmospheric warming.					; Smol, John/A-8838-2015	Sae-Lim, Jarunetr/0000-0001-7997-4016; 													0921-8181	1872-6364				MAY	2025	248								104741	10.1016/j.gloplacha.2025.104741	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2025.104741		FEB 2025											WOS:001428939700001

Influence of sampling sufficiency on biodiversity analysis of microperiphyton communities for marine bioassessment	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												With quick responses to environmental changes, easy sampling, relative immobility, increasing availability of easily used taxonomic references, and allowing standardization for temporal and spatial comparisons, the biodiversity measures of microperiphyton communities have widely been accepted as useful indicators to evaluate environmental stress and anthropogenic impact. The influence of sampling sufficiency for biodiversity analysis of microperiphyton communities was studied using a range of statistical methods in coastal waters of the Yellow Sea, northern China, from May to June 2010. Samples were collected from two depths using an artificial substrate. Sampling sizes represented a significant influence on biodiversity analysis of microperiphyton communities, e.g., 20 slide replicates (350 cm(2)) were sufficient for the microperiphyton communities at both depths, while 10 slide replicates (175 cm(2)) could meet the sampling strategy only for the samples with colonization times of 10 days or more at a depth of 1 m for recovering 90% species during the study period. Otherwise, more slide replicates were required with the increase of water depths and shortening colonization times for recovering microperiphyton species, e.g., for recovering 90% species of a "mature" microperiphyton community (> 10 days), similar to 10 slide replicates (similar to 175 cm(2)) were sufficient at a depth of 1 m, while for the "young" samples (> 10 days) much more (15-30) slide replicates were required at both depths in this study. Furthermore, to achieve < 10% standard errors, six (105 cm(2)) and nine (similar to 160 cm(2)) slide replicates were required for biodiversity analysis of the microperiphyton communities with various colonization times at depths of 1 and 3 m during the summer season, respectively. These results suggest that sampling sizes represented a significant influence on biodiversity analysis of microperiphyton communities for monitoring programs and ecological conservation researches in marine ecosystems.

Extensive growth of small blue-green algae (Oscillatoria cfr. trichoides, Pseudanabaena galeata) and chlorococcal green algae (Scenedesmus spp., Monoraphidium contortum, Actinastrum hantzschii) induced a pH rise to 10.5 in July. Fish were driven into the rivers and many that did not escape died. After the fish had disappeared Daphniae multiplied explosively and grazed away the major part of the phytoplankton. Ammonia concentrations rose and O2 concentrations dropped to noxious levels for highly sensitive fish in Aug.-Sept. Larger phytoplankton species (Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, Pediastrum boryanum, Pandorina morum) were not grazed by the daphniae and gave rise to a maximum of copepods in Sept. Fish returned to the lake in Oct., when pH, ammonia and O2 levels had normalized.																			0020-9309						1984	69	3					389	405		10.1002/iroh.19840690305	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19840690305													WOS:A1984TA02800004
J	Oyadomari, JK; Auer, NA				Oyadomari, JK; Auer, NA			Inshore-offshore distribution of larval fishes in Lake Superior off the western coast of the Keweenaw Peninsula, Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We surveyed the larval fish community in Lake Superior off the western coast of the Keweenaw Peninsula, Michigan, as a first component in understanding how the Keweenaw Current affects larval fish distribution and survivorship. On transects at Ontonagon, Houghton, and Eagle Harbor, we collected larval fishes with a I -m diameter plankton net towed through surface and deep (below metalimnion) waters at an inshore location (I km from shore) and an offshore location (5-9 km from shore) during day and night in 1998 and 1999. The most abundant larvae caught were lake herring (Coregonus artedii), rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), burbot (Lota Iota), deepwater sculpin (Myoxocephalus thompsoni), and spoonhead sculpin (Cottus ricei). Lake herring was generally most abundant at the surface during the day, while the other four species avoided the surface by day but not at night. Overall, larval fish density was greater inshore than offshore, with exceptions for particular locations and seasonal periods (1.24x for lake herring, 12.93x for rainbow smelt, 1.27x for burbot, 1.25x for deepwater sculpin, and 4.26x for spoonhead sculpin). Differences in the sizes of larvae between inshore and offshore locations, in conjunction with density patterns, suggest a seasonal inshore to offshore movement. Despite the presence of the Keweenaw Current, the overall distribution patterns of larval fishes follow those of previous studies conducted in the Great Lakes, but with lower densities.																			0380-1330						2004	30			1			369	384		10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70398-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70398-6													WOS:000227991500026
J	Ferreira, LV				Ferreira, LV			Effects of the duration of flooding on species richness and floristic composition in three hectares in the Jau National Park in floodplain forests in central Amazonia	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Rivers in Central Amazonia show annual water level fluctuations of up to 14 m; the flooding period ranges from 50 to 270 days between the rising and falling phases. Differences in duration and type of flood in Amazonian floodplain forests result in a mosaic of habitats which include lakes, grasslands, forests, streams etc. To study the floristic composition, structure, variation on number of species and diversity in a forest that is seasonally flooded by a black-water river in Brazilian Amazonia, 200 km NE of Manaus, I surveyed three hectares in habitats which included lake, river margin, and stream. The number of species per hectare ranged from 44 to 137. The number of trees varied from 796 to 1130. Total basal area ranged from 22.3 m(2) to 41.8 m(2). Leguminosae was the most abundant and dominant family in the river margin and stream plot, while Euphorbiaceae and Leguminosae were, respectively the most abundant and dominant families in the lake plot. The most dominant species in the river margin and stream plots was Aldina latifolia (Leguminosae), while Amanoa oblongifolia (Euphorbiaceae) was the most abundant and dominant species in the lake plot. Mean water level and flooding period decreased significantly from lake to the river margin to the stream. The mean number of species and the Shannon diversity increase significantly from the lake to the river margin to the stream habitats plots. Similarity indexes varied from 0.3 to 0.55% between the three plots sampled in this study.																			0960-3115	1572-9710				OCT	1997	6	10					1353	1363		10.1023/A:1018385529531	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1018385529531													WOS:A1997YB23200003

A Small Number of Genes Underlie Male Pigmentation Traits in Lake Malawi Cichlid Fishes	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART B-MOLECULAR AND DEVELOPMENTAL EVOLUTION												Pigmentation patterns are one of the most recognizable forms of phenotypic diversity and an important component of organismal fitness. While much progress has been made in understanding the genes controlling pigmentation in model systems, many questions remain about the genetic basis of pigment traits observed in nature. Lake Malawi cichlid fishes are known for their diversity of male pigmentation patterns, which have been shaped by sexual selection. To begin the process of identifying the genes underlying this diversity, we quantified the number of pigment cells on the body and fins of two species of the genus Metriaclima and their hybrids. We then used the CastleWright equation to estimate that differences in individual pigmentation traits between these species are controlled by one to four genes each. Different pigmentation traits are highly correlated in the F2, suggesting shared developmental pathways and genetic pleiotropy. Melanophore and xanthophore traits fall on opposite ends of the first principal component axis of the F2 phenotypes, suggesting a tradeoff during the development of these two pigment cell types. J.

One such event is the formation of a landscape scar at Zonag Lake caused by a climate change-induced outburst flooding event that occurred on 15 September 2011. During the winter, the scar region became a new birthplace for sandstorms, and since the flooding, remote sensing monitoring shows that between 2011 and 2020, there were 285 sandstorm days (between November and March), relative to none prior. The outburst flooding event and consequential sandstorms threaten the key lambing area of the Tibetan antelope (Chiru), affect the water balance of the Zonag Lake and downstream lakes, and may even impact on the flow in the Yangtze River. Active human intervention may be needed to repair this new desert spit and reverse the slew of consequences which may otherwise lead to significant population declines in one of the major Chiru breeding grounds due to the progressive loss of vegetation productivity across their main breeding area.

In recent years, the water quality and area of the Hongjiannao Lake have continued to decline, which is closely associated with the economic development in the Hongjiannao basin. To explore the coupling relationship between the water quality and economic development in the Hongjiannao basin, the water quality and economic development index of the basin has been analyzed in terms of the monthly water quality and socio-economic development from 2013 to 2020. The coupling relationship and interaction mechanism between water quality and regional economic development has been studied by coupling coordination degree model. The results show that the water pollution increased and then decreased with the seasons, while the water quality was the worst in the summer. The coordinated degree between the water quality and economic development in Hongjiannao shows an upward trend from 2013 to 2020, which has transformed from the process of lagging economic development to the process of primary coordination, finally to the process of lagging water environment. The coupling relationship between water quality and economic development changed from a state of nearly un-coordination to primary coordination from 2013 to 2016, with economic development lagging behind. The coupling relationship between the two systems changed from barely coordinated to the primary coordinated from 2017 to 2018, with the rapid development of economy and slight decline in water quality. After 2018, those two systems gradually stepped into a virtuous cycle during 2019-2020, but the phenomenon of lagging water quality still existed. Therefore, in order to maintain the stable economic development of resource-based cities, it is necessary to keep improving the current situation of water environment and water shortage in Hongjiannao, which will promote the coordinated and sustainable development of water environment and economy.

E.; Tang, Hui; Xie, Yunxu			Overtopping volume of impulse waves in glacier lakes: Experimental and numerical investigation using rigid dams	ENGINEERING GEOLOGY												Glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs) that result from the breaching of moraine dams are typical disasters in high mountain regions of the Tibetan Plateau, which endanger vital infrastructures such as the Sichuan-Tibet Railway and Highway. Breaching can be caused by tsunami-type waves, resulting from glaciers calving and falling into impounded lakes, which overtop and destroy their natural boundaries. In this work, we develop an equation for the overtopping volume based on the simplified geometry of fluids running up an incline. Specifically, we propose that overtopping can be viewed in terms of the run-up of solitary waves impacting a structure from which relationships with the dam and wave properties can be established. This equation is tested and verified against physical experiments and numerical simulations of waves overtopping rigid, impermeable triangular structures which serve as idealized natural dams. The proposed equation is found to adequately account for the first-order dependencies of the overtopping volume on the different dam and wave properties. We extend the applicability of this analysis to erodible dams made up of glacier tills, wherein we show the basic dependence of the overtopping volume on the erodibility of the dams and flood scales.					; Cui, Kahlil Fredrick/ADT-8349-2022	Cui, Kahlil Fredrick/0000-0002-4249-0330; , lu xue qiang/0000-0002-8457-1657; 													0013-7952	1872-6917				SEP 5	2022	306								106763	10.1016/j.enggeo.2022.106763	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2022.106763		JUN 2022											WOS:000824556500003
J	SCHELSKE, CL; HODELL, DA				SCHELSKE, CL; HODELL, DA			RECENT CHANGES IN PRODUCTIVITY AND CLIMATE OF LAKE-ONTARIO DETECTED BY ISOTOPIC ANALYSIS OF SEDIMENTS	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Cores from Lake Ontario provide a record of lake responses to increased phosphorus loading that began after early forest clearance in the mid-1800s. We measured C-13/C-12 ratios of organic and inorganic C (calcite) in the sediments to infer recent trends in primary production. The delta-C-13 of organic C increased in response to historic increases in P enrichment until the mid- 1970s and then decreased in response to reduced P loading. The delta-C-13 of calcite increased after 1940 but did not decrease in response to reduced P loading. We conclude that the results differ because delta-C-13 of organic C is determined by primary production early in the seasonal cycle when flux of organic C to the sediments is greatest, whereas delta-C-13 of calcite depends on the isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic C during late summer when calcite is precipitated. Calcite accumulation and its delta-C-13 ratio oscillated after 1940 with peaks estimated at 1948, 1966, 1977, and 1983. These peaks correspond to minima in delta-O-18 values, indicating calcite precipitation at higher temperature, and to years of early thermal stratification. We hypothesize that calcite accumulation and its stable isotopic ratios are controlled by interannual variability in onset of thermal stratification of the lake. Our results thus suggest a direct link from climate (i.e. thermal stratification) to interannual variation in lake productivity and to carbonate precipitation and its delta-C-13 signature.																			0024-3590					JUL	1991	36	5					961	975		10.4319/lo.1991.36.5.0961	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1991.36.5.0961													WOS:A1991GP59400011

New evidence of long distance pollen transport to southern Greenland in late spring	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												New observations of long-distance pollen transport to southern Greenland are recorded during the last 2 weeks of May, 2003. The results indicate northeastern North America as the source area of the transported pollen grains as shown in earlier investigations. Backward trajectories indicate that transport occurred twice during the first week corresponding to a time of maximum pollen flux emitted to the atmosphere in the source area. A large percentage of exotic pollen grains were identified, about 11% of the total counted. However, transport during the second week appears to have occurred during a single day at a time of reduced pollen emission into the atmosphere, which was subjected later to severe washout. As a result, only 1% of the total pollen spectra was identified as exotic grains. The back trajectories modeled by the HYSPLIT application differ somewhat from those previously identified in 2002. Although in both years air passing over southern Greenland at 3000 in carried out the main transport, additional transport could have occurred at a much lower altitude in 2003. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In reconstructing climate-forced glacier fluctuations from proglacial lacustrine sediments it is important to understand how climate affects glacier dynamics. A glacier system is complex with many factors influencing sediment production, transport and deposition. Fluvial and mass movement processes in the proglacial environment may affect lake sedimentation substantially. We argue that it is easy to over-interpret glaciolacustrine sediment variability by ignoring these complications. The sediment records may contain individual layers resulting from single precipitation or melt events, as well as persistent changes in climate-forced glacier dynamics. We conclude that it is necessary to consider all possible influencing factors in order to derive reliable palaeoclimate data from lacustrine sediment sequences.					; Jansson, Peter/B-5761-2012	Rosqvist, Gunhild/0000-0002-9195-607X; Jansson, Peter/0000-0002-8832-8806													0435-3676	1468-0459					2005	87A	1					37	50		10.1111/j.0435-3676.2005.00243.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0435-3676.2005.00243.x													WOS:000230002700004
J	Burton, AW; Aherne, J				Burton, Andrew W.; Aherne, Julian			Changes in the Chemistry of Small Irish lakes	AMBIO												A re-survey of acid-sensitive lakes in Ireland (initial survey 1997) was carried out during spring 2007 (n = 60). Since 1997, atmospheric emissions of sulfur dioxide and deposition of non-marine sulfate (SO42-) in Ireland have decreased by similar to 63 and 36%, respectively. Comparison of water chemistry between surveys showed significant decreases in the concentration of SO42-, non-marine SO42-, and non-marine base cations. In concert, alkalinity increased significantly; however, no change was observed in surface water pH and total aluminum. High inter-annual variability in sea salt inputs and increasing (albeit non-significant) dissolved organic carbon may have influenced the response of pH and total aluminum (as similar to 70% is organic aluminum). Despite their location on the western periphery of Europe, and dominant influence from Atlantic air masses, the repeat survey suggests that the chemistry of small Irish lakes has shown a significant response to reductions in air pollution driven primarily by the implementation of the Gothenburg Protocol under the UNECE Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution.																			0044-7447	1654-7209				MAR	2012	41	2					170	179		10.1007/s13280-011-0177-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-011-0177-x								22396096					WOS:000303464700006
J	Tang, CY; Li, YP; He, C; Acharya, K				Tang, Chunyan; Li, Yiping; He, Chao; Acharya, Kumud			Dynamic behavior of sediment resuspension and nutrients release in the shallow and wind-exposed Meiliang Bay of Lake Taihu	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Wind-induced sediment resuspension frequently occurs in Lake Taihu, a typical large shallow lake in China. Internal nutrients release accompanied by sediment resuspension is supposed to sustain the eutrophic status and algal boom persistence. In this study, high-frequency and synchronous in situ observation of the wind field, currents, waves, suspended sediments, and nutrients were collected to understand the dynamic behaviors of sediment and nutrients under multiple natural disturbances in Meiliang Bay, Lake Taihu. Results suggest that both wind speed and wind fetch length could effectively activate the sediment layer and trigger particles entrainment into the overlying water. Wind speed of 4 m/s with long wind fetch (between east and southeast wind direction) was the critical value for sediment resuspension. Furthermore, wind-induced wave shear stress and stochastic nature of turbulence at the water-sediment interface were the driving force for sediment resuspension. Specifically, incipient motion of sediment occurred when shear stress was ranging from 0.02 to 0.07 N/m(2). Wind-induced sediment resuspension had significantly contributed to nutrients release of particulate N and P, whereas dissolved nutrients concentration was less affected. Internal nutrients release by wind could maintain a significant potential for obstinate eutrophication and algal bloom. This study has revealed the dynamic response of nutrients release to sediment resuspension and wind-induced hydrodynamics. Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanism of internal nutrients release will benefit the effective and sustainable management of the shallow and wind-exposed lakes. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

J	ALBIN, DP				ALBIN, DP			FIRE AND STREAM ECOLOGY IN SOME YELLOWSTONE LAKE TRIBUTARIES	CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME												Some effects of forest fires on streams in selected tributaries to Yellowstone Lake, Yellowstone National Park [Wyoming, USA], were studied in partial evaluation of the Park''s natural burn fire management policy. In a stream in a watershed burned 45 and 36 yr ago (Passage Creek) some changes were found, when compared to a similar stream in an unburned adjacent watershed (Chipmunk Creek). Summer stream temperatures averaged about 1.5.degree. C higher in Passage Creek. Streamflow showed a greater seasonal fluctuation and a higher water yield in Passage Creek. Water quality conditions in both streams were similar, but mineral export was greater in Passage Creek due to greater water yield. Aufwuchs accumulation of artificial substrates showed no significant difference between the 2 streams. Benthic sampling suggested a general increase in benthic macroinvertebrates in Passage Creek. The fry of Yellowstone cutthroat trout Salmo clarki lewisi appeared to emerge from the gravel earlier in Passage Creek than in Chipmunk Creek. Based on stream temperature differences, the difference in egg incubation time was calculated to be 4 days. Two other streams were studied during and immediately after a fire burned their watersheds (streams 173 and 174). No harmful effects were found. Concentrations of Ca, Mg, K, chloride, sulfate, phosphate and total organic C were raised somewhat during a rainstorm, apparently as a result of ash leached into surface runoff.																			0008-1078	2331-0405					1979	65	4					216	238																WOS:A1979HT20600002

Biogeochemistry and cyanobacterial blooms: investigating the relationship in a shallow, polymictic, temperate lake	ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY												The shallow, polymictic Ornamental Lake in the Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne, Australia, has suffered significant blooms of toxic Anabaena then Microcystis species every summer over the last decade. Although the hydrodynamic conditions of the water column are conducive for algal growth, the prolific growth is controlled by the bioavailable phosphorus concentration. Springtime phosphorus fluxes of 0.1-0.2 mmol m(-2) day(-1) from the sediment contribute to bloom development. These rates are also observed in anoxic sediment core incubations. Diel stratification, combined with high oxygen consumption associated with organic carbon loading, favour P release. Release rates may be amplified by the effects of sulfate reduction on P sorption onto Fe(III) (oxyhydroxide) surfaces. Sulfate concentrations are at the threshold where methanogenesis is inhibited in anoxic conditions. Effective bloom mitigation will require a > 100-fold reduction in P concentrations, which may be achieved through macrophyte planting and inducing greater water flow through the lake system.

J	ZUROWSKI, W				ZUROWSKI, W			BUILDING ACTIVITY OF BEAVERS	ACTA THERIOLOGICA												Observations on the building activity of European beavers, Castor fiber Linnaeus, 1758, were carried out in two dissimilar lakelands in Poland to which beavers were being reintroduced from 1974 to 1985. Reintroduced beavers occupied 62 sites, and lodges were built in 76% of the sites. Several sites contained two or more lodges. Most lodges had a circular or oval base (83%) and a conical side view (85%). The size of lodges differed significantly (p = 0.051) between the two lakelands, with larger lodges at sites characterized by water scarcity. Beavers built lodges immediately after their settlement in 50% of sites, while in the other sites lodges appeared 1 - 8 years later. Lodge construction is frequently related with the first appearance of kits. In the study area beavers built 27 dams in 17 sites, apparently to improve water conditions and to get safe access to new stores of winter food. Dams usually were built without acoustic stimuli. Behaviour of reintroduced beavers suggest threat as their main motivation for any building activity.																			0001-7051						1992	37	4					403	411																WOS:A1992KU58500009

Despite small differences in nutrient and phytoplankton levels among the lakes, there was a strong positive correlation between these parameters and the density and diversity of the communities. Other factors, including maximum summer water temperature, lake depth and surface area had little overall effect on the communities. The densities of 2 ultra-oligotrophic chironomids (Heterotrissoclaudius oliveri and Micropsectra cf. groenlandica) increased markedly in cold deep lakes. The abundance of the majority of species, most notably Procladius denticulatus, Tanytarsus sp. and Stictochironomus sp., was not affected by temperature. Other species, (Pontoporeia affinis, Monodiamesa bathyphila and Dicrotendipes nervosus) were probably restricted in their northern distribution by temperature. Surface area usually had little effect on the densities of all common species.																			0020-9309						1978	63	6					757	771		10.1002/iroh.19780630605	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19780630605													WOS:A1978GU13100002

Since cellular concentrations of ATP are acceptable indicators of live biomass among natural microbial populations, the ratio of chlorophyll a to cellular ATP reveals the extent of pigment production per unit biomass under diverse environmental conditions. In general, mixed systems, i.e., epilimnion of most lakes sampled, showed good consistency of cellular chlorophyll a:ATP ratios. Under thermal stratified conditions at Lake Tahoe, extensive modifications of the ratio occurred, leading to a 10-fold increase in the ratio at the bottom of the euphotic zone by late summer. The applicability of chlorophyll a as a quantitative algal biomass indicator is greatly restricted in lakes having thermally stratified euphotic zones.

Two, and in sunfish 3, feeding peaks per 24-hr. period were indicated. Perca flavescens was diurnal; Lepomis macrochirus, L. gibbosus, and Fundulus diaphanus were largely diurnal (with a nocturnal component); and Ambloplites rupestris was equally nocturnal and diurnal. In the 2 sunfish there were clearcut differences in the organisms eaten by day and night. The technique developed here is a useful method for determining the mean minimum daily ration for a population of fish in the field. The results are comparable with those obtained by other workers in aquarium feeding experiments.																									1968	25	6					1133	+		10.1139/f68-099	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f68-099													WOS:A1968B308800003
J	Mann, RHK				Mann, RHK			Temporal and spatial variations in the growth of 0 group roach (Rutilus rutilus) in the River Great Ouse, in relation to water temperature and food availability	REGULATED RIVERS-RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT												In the River Great Ouse, a highly flow-regulated lowland river in eastern England, the most common cyprinid fish, roach (Rutilus rutilus), showed marked variations in growth both between years and between sites. Growth rates were highest at the most downstream sites and also in a large marina into which many 0 group roach migrated in midsummer. Between-year differences in growth rates in early summer were not always associated with parallel deviations in water temperature (degree days >12 degrees C). Instead, variations in prey (zooplankton) abundance may also influence the initial growth rates of roach larvae. A switch in the diet of 0 group roach in late June from small invertebrates (Cladocera, Chironomidae larvae, etc.) to one dominated by detrital aufwuchs may explain the discrepancies between observed growth rates and those predicted from a temperature growth model.

Small water bodies include headwater streams, springs, ditches, flushes, small lakes, and ponds, which represent important freshwater resources. However, the relatively narrow and fragmented nature of small water bodies makes it difficult to monitor chlorophyll-a via medium-resolution remote sensing. In the present study, we first fused Gaofen-6 (a new Chinese satellite) images to obtain 2 m resolution images with 8 bands, which was approved as a good data source for Chlorophyll-a monitoring in small water bodies as Sentinel-2. Further, we compared five semi-empirical and four machine learning models to estimate chlorophyll-a concentrations via simulated reflectance using fused Gaofen-6 and Sentinel-2 spectral response function. The results showed that the extreme gradient boosting tree model (one of the machine learning models) is the most accurate. The mean relative error (MRE) was 9.03%, and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) was 4.5 mg/m(3) for the Sentinel-2 sensor, while for the fused Gaofen-6 image, MRE was 6.73%, and RMSE was 3.26 mg/m(3). Thus, both fused Gaofen-6 and Sentinel-2 could estimate the chlorophyll-a concentrations in small water bodies. Since the fused Gaofen-6 exhibited a higher spatial resolution and Sentinel-2 exhibited a higher temporal resolution.					; Yue, Yao/KIC-2405-2024; jiarui, shi/JAC-4211-2023; xu, wenting/GVR-8851-2022	Yao, Yue/0000-0001-5671-6399; shi, jiarui/0000-0003-3929-9655														2072-4292				JAN	2022	14	1							229	10.3390/rs14010229	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14010229													WOS:000744035700001

It is increasingly apparent that abiotic data are insufficient to explain variability within the cyanobacterial community, with biotic factors such as heterotrophic bacterioplankton, viruses and protists emerging as critical drivers. During the Australian summer of 2012-2013, a bloom that occurred in a shallow ephemeral lake over a 6-month period was comprised of 22 distinct cyanobacteria, including Microcystis, Dolichospermum, Oscillatoria and Sphaerospermopsis. Cyanobacterial cell densities, bacterial community composition and abiotic parameters were assessed over this period. Alpha-diversity indices and multivariate analysis were successful at differentiating three distinct bloom phases and the contribution of abiotic parameters to each. Network analysis, assessing correlations between biotic and abiotic variables, reproduced these phases and assessed the relative importance of both abiotic and biotic factors. Variables possessing elevated betweeness centrality included temperature, sodium and operational taxonomic units belonging to the phyla Verrucomicrobia, Planctomyces, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. Species-specific associations between cyanobacteria and bacterioplankton, including the free-living Actinobacteria acI, Bacteroidetes, Betaproteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia, were also identified. We concluded that changes in the abundance and nature of freshwater cyanobacteria are associated with changes in the diversity and composition of lake bacterioplankton. Given this, an increase in the frequency of cyanobacteria blooms has the potential to alter nutrient cycling and contribute to long-term functional perturbation of freshwater systems.

Since the mid-summer 2018, along with Moina salina which had previously been reported from the lake, the yearround presence of further two cladoceran species, Chydorus sphaericus and Bosmina (Eubosmina) coregoni, was recorded there for the first time. None of those species had ever been registered from hypersaline waters anywhere else. Their introduction seems to have occurred because of a salinity decrease, even though the modem level of salinity has been observed the same at least for the last 20 years.

Here we explore an alternative model where Mn-carbonates form in redox-stratified water columns linked to calcium carbonate dissolution. In ferruginous Brownie Lake in Minnesota, USA, we document Mn-carbonates as an HCl-extractable phase present in sediment traps and in reducing portions of the water column. Mn-carbonate becomes supersaturated in the Brownie Lake chemocline where dissolved oxygen concentrations fall below 5 mu M, and Mn-oxide reduction increases the dissolved Mn concentration. Supersaturation is enhanced when calcite originating from surface waters dissolves in more acidic waters at the chemocline. In the same zone, sulfate reduction and microaerobic methane oxidation add dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) with negative delta C-13. These observations demonstrate that sedimentary Mn enrichments may 1) develop from primary carbonate phases, and 2) can occur in environments with dissolved oxygen concentrations <5 mu M. Primary Mn-carbonates are likely to originate in environments with high concentrations of dissolved Mn (>200 mu M), and where Mn and Fe are partitioned by S cycling, photoferrotrophy, or microaerophilic Fe-oxidation. A shallow lysocline enhances Mn-carbonate production by providing additional DIC and nucleation sites for crystal growth. This carbonate model for Mn-enrichments is expected to be viable in both euxinic and ferruginous environments, and provides a more nuanced view of the relationships between Mn and carbon cycling, with applications throughout the rock record.

J	Robinson, CT; Matthaei, S				Robinson, Christopher T.; Matthaei, Sebastian			Hydrological heterogeneity of an alpine stream-lake network in Switzerland	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Water source and lake landscape position can strongly influence the physico-chemical characteristics of flowing waters over space and time. We examined the physico-chemical heterogeneity in surface waters of an alpine stream-lake network (>2600 m a.s.l.) in Switzerland. The catchment comprises two basins interspersed with 26 cirque lakes. The larger lakes in each basin are interconnected by streams that converge in a lowermost lake with an outlet stream. The north basin is primarily fed by precipitation and groundwater, whereas the south basin is fed mostly by glacial melt from rock glaciers. Surface flow of the entire channel network contracted by similar to 60% in early autumn, when snowmelt runoff ceased and cold temperatures reduced glacial outputs, particularly in the south basin. Average water temperatures were similar to 4 degrees C cooler in the south basin, and temperatures increased by about 4-6 degrees C along the longitudinal gradient within each basin. Although overall water conductivity was low (<27 mu S cm(-1)) because of bedrock geology (ortho-gneiss), the south basin had two times higher conductivity values than the north basin. Phosphate-phosphorus levels were below analytical detection limits, but particulate phosphorus was about four times higher in the north basin (seasonal average: 9 mu g 1(-1)) than in the south basin (seasonal average: 2 mu g 1(-1)). Dissolved nitrogen constituents were around two times higher in the south basin than in the north basin, with highest values averaging >300 mu g 1(-1) (nitrite + nitrate-nitrogen), whereas particulate nitrogen was approximately nine times greater in the north basin (seasonal average: 97 mu g 1(-1)) than in the south basin (seasonal average: 12 mu g 1(-1)). Total inorganic carbon was low (usually <0.8 mg 1(-1)). silica was sufficient for algal growth, and particulate organic carbon was 4.5 times higher in the north basin (average: 0.9 mg 1(-1)) than in the south basin (average: 0.2 mg 1(-1)). North-basin streams showed strong seasonality in turbidity, particulate-nitrogen and -phosphorus, and particulate organic carbon, whereas strong seasonality in south-basin streams was observed in conductivity and dissolved nitrogen. Lake position influenced the seasonal dynamics in stream temperatures and nutrients, particularly in the groundwater/precipitation-fed north-basin network.

J	Vucinic, L; O'Connell, D; Coxon, C; Gill, L				Vucinic, Luka; O'Connell, David; Coxon, Catherine; Gill, Laurence			Back to the future: Comparing yeast as an outmoded artificial tracer for simulating microbial transport in karst aquifer systems to more modern approaches	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Bacterial contamination of karst groundwater is a major concern for public health. Artificial tracing studies are crucial for establishing links between locations where pollutants can rapidly reach the aquifer systems and subsequent receptors, as well as for enhanced understanding of pollutant transport. However, widely used solute artificial tracers do not always move through the subsurface in the same manner as particles and microorganisms, hence may not be ideal proxies for predicting movement of bacterial contaminants. This study evaluates whether a historically used microbial tracer (yeast) which is readily available, inexpensive, and environmentally friendly, but usually overlooked in modern karst hydrogeological studies due to challenges associated with its detection and quantification in the past, can reemerge as a valuable tracer using the latest technology for its detection. Two field-based studies on separate karst systems were carried out during low-flow conditions using a portable particle counter along with flow cytometry measurements to monitor the recovery of the yeast at the springs. Soluble fluorescent dyes were also injected simultaneously with the yeast for comparison of transport dynamics. On one tracer test, through a karst conduit of much higher velocities, the injected yeast and fluorescent dye arrived at the same time at the spring, in comparison to the tracer test on a conduit system with lower groundwater velocities in which the yeast particles were detected before the dye at the sampling site. Both a portable particle counter and flow cytometry successfully detected yeast during both tests, thereby demonstrating the applicability of this tracer with contemporary instrumentation. Even though no significant advantages of flow cytometry over the portable counter system can be reported on the basis of the presented results, this study has shown that flow cytometry can be successfully used to detect and quantify introduced microbial tracers in karst environments with extremely high precision.					; Gill, Laurence/D-2592-2014	O'Connell, David William/0000-0002-1974-8145; Vucinic, Luka/0000-0002-9370-3308													0269-7491	1873-6424				MAY 15	2024	349								123942	10.1016/j.envpol.2024.123942	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2024.123942		APR 2024						38604303					WOS:001233672300001

The lakes of Naivasha, Elmenteita, Nakuru (counted since 1991) and Bogoria are close to each other in the southern Rift Valley and hold the bulk of both resident and migrant waterbirds counted each year. Levels of the four lakes fluctuate substantially and all but Naivasha are saline. By contrast, Dandora Ponds near Nairobi is a site with stable water levels. We compared trends in numbers of birds, categorized by family and by migratory status, with an earlier analysis in 1996 and between tire fluctuating Rift Valley lakes and Dandora Ponds. Flamingo numbers remained highly variable at all sites, showing no long-term trends. In 1996, significant declines were found in many piscivorous waterbird groups, including grebes, pelicans, cormorants, storks, terns and gulls, mainly associated with falling lake levels at Lake Nakuru; by 2000, numbers had recovered. Consistent declines in rallids, birds of prey and kingfishers were evident in 1996, mainly due to falling numbers at Lake Naivasha. By 2000, kingfisher numbers had fully, and raptor numbers had partially, recovered. Rallids, mainly Red-knobbed Coot (Fulica cristata), continued to decline sharply through 1998, but recovered slightly to 1996 levels by 2000. After notably high numbers in 19961999, Palaearctic ducks declined dramatically in 2000 to a ten-year low. With the exception of rallids, none of the groups that had declined from 1991-1996 showed any trend in numbers over the extended time period. At Dandora, numbers of most waterbird groups fluctuated substantially despite constant conditions. The fluctuations showed little synchrony with between species or with those at the southern Rift Valley lakes, suggesting waterbirds were responding to the availability of suitable wetlands over a large area. The declines from 1991-1996 in the southern Rift Valley were temporary; recoveries in waterbird numbers were not attributable to improved environmental management (human pressures on these wetlands intensified front 1997-2000), but to higher lake levels in 1997/98. The ten-year data set covers it full cycle of low and high lake levels, which the six-year dataset did not, and may now form an adequate baseline for monitoring.																			1524-4695	1938-5390				JUN	2002	25	2					191	201		10.1675/1524-4695(2002)025[0191:TIWNIT]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/1524-4695(2002)025[0191:TIWNIT]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000176179900008

While such time-intensive activities may not be cost effective for routine operational forecasts, they may be crucial for the success of costly field experiments, The Lake-Induced Convection Experiment (Lake-ICE) and the Snowband Dynamics Experiment (SNOWBANDS) were conducted over the Great Lakes region during the 1997/98 winter. Project forecasters consisted of members of the academic as well as the operational forecast communities. The forecasters relied on traditional operationally available data as well as project-tailored information from special project soundings and locally run mesoscale models. The forecasting activities during Lake-ICE/SNOWBANDS are a prime example of how the man-machine mix of the forecast process can contribute significantly to forecast improvements over what is available from raw model output or even using traditional operational forecast techniques.

Movement and habitat use of juvenile Lake Sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens, Rafinesque, 1817) in a large hydroelectric reservoir (Nelson River, Canada)	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												Movement and habitat utilization of juvenile Lake Sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) were examined in Stephens Lake, a large hydroelectric reservoir on the Nelson River, Manitoba, Canada, between 21 June 2011, and 15 October 2012. Stephens Lake is defined by a sharp hydraulic gradient at the upstream end (Gull Rapids) and a pronounced reservoir transition zone (RTZ), characterized by a change in substrate composition from coarse to fine. Twenty juvenile Lake Sturgeon <600mm fork length were captured in the RTZ, implanted with acoustic transmitters, and tracked using stationary receivers. Our primary hypothesis considered that, if foraging behaviour was contingent on sand substrate, these fish would spend the majority of the open-water season foraging in the relatively small area where hydraulic gradients dictate sand deposition. Data indicated that tracked individuals were highly bottom oriented, and utilized deeper thalweg habitats exclusively during the first open-water season. On average, juveniles spent only 22% of their open-water time in the RTZ (river kilometer [rkm] 4.5-7.0). Most fish spent more time upstream as opposed to downstream, but a few individuals did utilize backwatered thalweg areas, suggesting that silt-overlay habitats may be suitable for foraging. A seasonal spatial shift in distribution was also observed. Juveniles vacated the RTZ as winter progressed, moving further downstream and occasionally laterally into backwatered shallows, potentially avoiding extreme ice conditions and a large hanging ice dam that develops downstream of Gull Rapids. After ice break-up, most individuals with active tags returned to the upstream end of Stephens Lake. The results add to the growing body of evidence that suggests factors other than habitat suitability influence Lake Sturgeon movement and utilization patterns, raising questions about the mechanisms for core-area affinity in this species.

Emerging Contaminant Sources and Fate in Recharged Treated Wastewater, Lake Havasu City, Arizona	ENVIRONMENTAL & ENGINEERING GEOSCIENCE												In 2008, Lake Havasu City, Arizona, began a treated wastewater subsurface recharge program at its North Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant (NRP) to store treated wastewater, which is planned to be seasonally recovered for irrigation during the summer months. As a proactive measure, the city decided to monitor a suite of pharmaceuticals and other emerging contaminants (PECs) along with required regulatory constituents, e. g., nitrate. Potential contributing sources of PECs throughout the water system were identified, resulting in only six constituents detected in the untreated drinking water and treated drinking water, all at concentrations less than 50 ng/L. Thirty-three of 40 PECs analyzed were identified in the city's treated wastewater streams, with concentrations ranging from just above the detection level to 9000 ng/L (pseudoephedrine), clearly showing the dominating local urban use of these compounds. NRP treated wastewater is recharged via vadose zone injection wells. It migrates through alluvial fans sediments, some containing interstitial clays, forming a water mound and blending with groundwater of the Colorado River Aquifer. Sixteen of 33 PECs present in the NRP treated wastewater have concentrations above detection limits (>10 ng/L) within 150 m (492 ft) of the injection wells. Six PECs (sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, primidone, phenytoin, N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide [DEET], and meprobamate) remained above their respective detection limit in monitoring wells that penetrate sediments largely free of clay more than 560 m (1,840 ft) away from the injection wells.																			1078-7275	1558-9161				AUG	2013	19	3					231	251		10.2113/gseegeosci.19.3.231	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/gseegeosci.19.3.231													WOS:000327864200003

The annual outbreak of a dinoflagellate bloom strictly governs the nature of the macro and micro food web and ultimately determines water quality. The freshwater dinoflagellate Peridinium gatunense is subject to a wide range of environmental stresses through-out the spring bloom period. It was confirmed that SOD played an important antioxidative maintainance role throughout the bloom, especially during periods of relatively high photosynthetic activity (820 mg C m(-2) day(-1)), when activity reached similar to 500 Units SOD mg protein(-1). In addition, high light stress (>300 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) induced SOD activity, despite the low dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations at the end of the bloom (1.3 mM). Catalase activity was only significant at the end of the bloom, peaking at 120 mu mol O-2 mg protein(-1) min(-1) when induced by photorespiratory activity. A series of experiments with Peridinium cultures showed that 2 x 10(-4) M ascorbate inhibited catalase activity >50% within 15 min incubation, both in vivo and in vitro. It is suggested that the high concentrations of ascorbate, found previously in Peridinium during early and mid-bloom (0.2-1.6 mM), not only eliminate H2O2 build-up, but also prevent (directly or indirectly) the induction of catalase.																			0921-8971	1573-5176					1996	8	4-5					403	407		10.1007/BF02178584	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02178584													WOS:A1996WP39700017

The study region lies in the northwestern marginal zone of the east Asian summer monsoon and is sensitive to climate change. The dating results combined with environmental proxies indicate that the Holocene Climate Optimum period, took place from 8.5 to 5 ka ago and was marked by lake development. After similar to 5 ka ago, the region became arid, as inferred from lake regression and fluvial activity. Deposition of fluvial sediments lasted from similar to 5 ka to similar to 2 ka ago. At about 2 ka ago, incision of the Sala Us River was initiated into the underlying sediments, with a down-cutting rate of similar to 3-4 cm/yr. Since 2 ka ago, human activities also played an important role in causing environmental change in the region.					sun, ji min/F-1240-2018; Sun, Jimin/F-1240-2018; Li, Bo/B-8974-2016	sun, ji min/0000-0003-3516-1413; Li, Bo/0000-0003-4186-4828													0959-6836	1477-0911				APR	2012	22	4					397	404		10.1177/0959683611425543	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683611425543													WOS:000301500500002

A time series of data from Landsat was used to generate a series of three maps at decadal time step to show how surface water has changed from 1991 to 2011 in the high northern latitudes of North America. Previous attempts to characterize the change in surface water in this region have been limited in either spatial or temporal resolution, or both. This series of maps was generated for the NASA Arctic and Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE), which began in fall 2015. These maps show a "nominal" extent of surface water by using multiple observations to make a single map for each time step. This increases the confidence that any detected changes are related to climate or ecosystem changes not simply caused by short duration weather events such as flood or drought. The methods and comparison to other contemporary maps of the region are presented here. Initial verification results indicate 96% producer accuracy and 54% user accuracy when compared to 2-m resolution WorldView-2 data. All water bodies that were omitted were one Landsat pixel or smaller, hence below detection limits of the instrument.

The results of water chemistry and phytoplankton, based on basic limnological methods, from five epiglacial and two supraglacial seasonal lakes are presented from western Dronning Maud Land, an area where only physical studies have been previously carried out. Electric conductivity varied mostly between 0.1 and 10 mS m(-1) (25 A degrees C), phosphorus concentration was < 5 mg m(-3), and nitrogen concentration was < 300 mg m(-3) except in some shore areas, and water pH ranged from 6 to 11. Low phytoplankton biomasses (in most cases < 10 mg m(-3)) supported the ultraoligotrophic status of the lakes. Phytoplankton was found from both types of lakes, but less was found from supraglacial lakes. The charophyte Mesotaenium cf. berggrenii dominated the supraglacial lakes, while cyanoprokaryotes such as Gloeocapsopsis cf. magma, Planktothrix prolifica/rubescens, Nostoc cf. sphaericum, Cyanothece sp. and Phormidium sp. dominated the biomass in some epiglacial lakes. Chrysophytes (e.g. Pseudopedinella-type flagellates) were observed in both types of lakes, and they were occasionally dominant. The green alga Botryococcus braunii, some diatoms (Cyclotella sp., Diatoma tenuis, Luticola muticopsis), and non-planktonic microalgal colonies visible to the eye (incl. the cyanoprokaryote Nostoc commune) were also found. Signs of a living ecosystem with a food web were observed in one epiglacial lake, but not elsewhere, which indicates extreme circumstances in the Antarctic seasonal lakes. Altogether, only some 25 taxa were discovered.

J	Bonham, J; Koth, B				Bonham, Jennifer; Koth, Barbara			Universities and the cycling culture	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT												Environmental analysis consistently shows transport as being amongst the top three contributors to a university's ecological footprint. This paper reports on a study undertaken at the Mawson Lakes Campus of the University of South Australia into cycling as a sustainable transport option. First, the paper analyzes the campus as a text: an artifact which addresses a particular audience and is actively read and interpreted by those who travel through it. In reading the campus, we go beyond examining levels of cycling infrastructure provision to consider the way infrastructure provision constitutes and positions different travelers as (ab)normal. Second, the paper looks at different groups of cyclists on campus, why some commuted to university and others did not and the experiences of each of these groups. It is found that cyclists are largely written out of the Mawson Lakes text which challenges their legitimacy as travelers and as users of campus space. The research also found substantial differences between groups of commuter and non-commuter cyclists and this division fell along staff and student lines. We conclude by suggesting ways that this and other universities might legitimize cyclists and facilitate cycling as a mode of travel. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The biomass of invertebrate predators was approximately 2.5 times higher in the invertebrate-dominated year (1992) than in the fish-dominated year (1991), while the density of non-predatory invertebrates in 1991 was ca half that in the invertebrate-dominated year. The decrease was due to a sharp fall in the density of epiphytic chironomids, with the density of plant-mining chironomids being far less affected. Marked declines in the density of non-predatory invertebrates in the invertebrate-dominated year were most probably caused by invertebrate predators. Once freed from suppression induced by fish, invertebrate predators were able to control the density of epiphytic prey more effectively than fish.																			0018-8158					JAN 17	1997	342						377	381		10.1023/A:1017095508464	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017095508464													WOS:A1997WZ13900040

Rather different pattern of samples differentiation was obtained by estimating variability of six microsatellite DNA loci. Regional complexes of the eastern and western coasts of Kamchatka were identified. Moreover, sockeye salmon from the Palana River fell into the cluster of Western Kamchatka populations, while the population from the Okhota River and Meynypilgin lake-river system (Chukotka), confined to the subperiphery of the range, where the most differentiated from the others. The possible reasons for the discrepancies and high divergence of the Palana River and the Okhota River sockeye salmon populations, inferred from the SNP markers analysis, are discussed.

The sites were located in the inner and outer bay and contrasted in food quantity and quality. ETS ranged from 2 to 40 mug O-2 mg DW-1 h(-1) over the study period. Both ETS and respiration were strongly related to temperature, and maximum values were found between June and August. ETS also peaked in June/July when assays were conducted at a constant temperature (25 degreesC), indicating other factors besides temperature affected metabolic activity. R:ETS ratios decreased with increased temperature at the inner bay site, but trends were minimal at the outer bay site. In late summer, blooms of the cyanophyte Microcystis occurred in the inner bay, likely depressing filtration rates, and leading to lower respiration rates relative to ETS. ETS activity was consistently higher in the outer bay and was likely a result of higher food quality. Despite these spatial differences, annual mean R:ETS ratios varied only from 0.04 to 0.09 at the two sites over the 2-year period. Based on these values, ETS may be useful as an indicator of long-term metabolic activity in annual energy budgets of D. polymorpha. However, food conditions differentially affect respiration relative to ETS, and variability in this ratio must be considered when interested in shorter time scales.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				APR	2001	448	1-3					61	70		10.1023/A:1017582119098	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017582119098													WOS:000169863400008

Stratigraphic revision of the early Miocene Kiahera Formation from Rusinga Island, Lake Victoria, Kenya	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												Decades of research in Early Miocene deposits on Rusinga Island, Lake Victoria, Kenya, have made its fossil record pivotal for interpreting floral and faunal evolution in eastern Africa during the early Neogene. Paleontological research has largely focused on Rusinga Island's fossil-rich Hiwegi Formation, and because that work has largely motivated geological research a similar bias can also be found in stratigraphic studies of the island's deposits. Hence, the resolution of paleoclimate, paleohabitat, and floral and faunal community reconstructions from other formations is limited, and discrepancies in stratigraphic placement and correlations among outcrops limit our ability to fully assess the interplay of climate and evolution. New lithostratigraphic and sedimentologic analyses of the Kiahera Formation on Rusinga Island clarify these discrepancies. Our work demonstrates that the Kiahera Formation comprises ten facies and can be divided into three discrete clastic units (from bottom to top): Nyamita Spring Member, Ukowe Member, and Rondo Member. The lithofacies in the formation are composed of conglomerates, sandstones, airfall tuffaceous units, and paleosols. Conglomerates, sandstones, and paleosols are found primarily within fluvially-dominated sediments in the Nyamita Spring and Rondo Members, interpreted to represent little to no volcanic input. Tuffaceous units occur within the middle Ukowe Member and record a series of eruptions of the neighboring Kisingiri Volcano. Importantly, reassessment of the type section of the Wayando Formation, which previous researchers identified as the oldest formation on Rusinga Island, demonstrates that it is stratigraphically and lithologically equivalent with the upper member of the Kiahera Formation. Other deposits historically attributed to the Wayando Formation can likewise be correlated with sections of the Kiahera Formation. Hence, the Kiahera Formation represents the oldest sediments on Rusinga. Finally, our revised descriptions and analysis enabled us to identify the basal member of the Kiahera Formation in outcrops on neighboring Mfangano Island, but stratigraphically well above where previous researchers had positioned them. This provides a new basis for interpreting the relationship between Mfangano Island's important fossil assemblages and the better-known assemblages from Rusinga Island. In total, clarification and consolidation of Rusinga Island's Kiahera Formation significantly impact paleontological and paleoecological characterizations of this unit and of the entire Early Miocene geological sequence on the island, further informing interpretations of how Rusinga's fossil sites formed with respect to the evolving Kisingiri Volcano.

In addition to the differences in gillraker counts, they also differ in growth, size of mates, and vertical distribution in summer. Higher numbers of gillrakers were associated with a greater the proportion of planktonic food items in the diet. The two sparsely-rakered forms that lived near the bottom were found to already have a high proportion of benthic food during the first years of life, and their food consisted mainly of benthic fauna as adults, as well. The proportion of planktonic food was high in the densely-rakered form. The highest diet overlap indices occurred among small-sized individuals of all three forms, but Schoener's index of diet overlap was small among large fish, indicating substantial food segregation.

A short extraction with oxine at pH 8.3 separated inorganic monomeric and organic Al from the polymeric and amorphous forms. The organic fraction was eliminated by equilibrium dialysis prior to extraction. In many cases, the inorganic fraction was also estimated from free and total fluoride [F-] measurements. The 2 methods agreed well in artificial solutions (R2 = 0.997) and reasonably well in natural waters (R2 = 0.82), although the computed estimates tended to be slightly lower than the directly measured values. During spring snowmelt in the Muskoka-Haliburton region of Central Ontario, little polymeric and amorphous Al was found, and most of the inorganic monomeric fraction was in the F- complexes. An empirical model that predicted inorganic monomeric Al in these waters (R2 = 0.90) using total organic C and the Al measured by a short extraction without dialysis was presented.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1984	41	5					766	776		10.1139/f84-089	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f84-089													WOS:A1984SV66300005

Groundwater fluctuations are largest on the upper and lower foreshore, where the elapsed rainfall and position of the shoreline are the dominant controls. Fluctuations are smallest in the mid foreshore. This pattern is the reverse of that found in oceanic beaches where tidal oscillations in sea level control the level of the water table in the foreshore. Beach morphology is affected by the groundwater in 2 ways such that spring sapping of the water table from the top of the foreshore during heavy rains produces rill channels, and shore-normal exchanges of sediment associated with changes in lake level are accelerated.																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1978	12	1					51	57		10.1080/00288330.1978.9515722	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1978.9515722													WOS:A1978FN25600006

The structure of GO-ss-CD was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The results of batch adsorption experiment indicate that the maximum recoveries for UO22+ ions are observed at pH 4.5. The Langmuir isotherm model fits the adsorption data, which stands for the chemisorption mechanism. The obtained adsorption capacity of 87.7 mg g(-1) indicates a great potential of the synthesized adsorbent in the UO22+ ions preconcentration. The GO-ss-CD exhibits high resistance to high ionic strength (up to 2 mol L-1), indicating that high salinity samples can be treated with the evaluated preconcentration procedure. The obtained limit of detection values were 0.40 mu g L-1 for the EDXRF and only 0.014 mu g L-1 for TXRF analysis. The accuracy of the method was verified by analyzing certified reference material (spring water NIST-SRM 1640a) and spiked water samples (mineral, lake, river, and artificial sea water).

Interspecific relationships and environmentally driven catchabilities estimated from fisheries data	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												A modelling framework is proposed to investigate possible interactions among fisheries, species, and shared environmental drivers. Two hypotheses that introduce temporal dependence among commercial and recreational catch and effort data from Lake Erie's walleye (Sander vitreus) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) stocks are evaluated using state space models. First, alternative forms of association between the mortality, recruitment, or migration of the two species are explored by modelling dependence in the interspecific process noise. Second, annual phosphorus inputs into Lake Erie, which are linked to the development of hypoxia, are tested for associations with the catchabilities of the fisheries. Interspecific process noise was positively associated, which suggests that mortality, recruitment, or migration is linked between walleye and yellow perch. Only for yellow perch, however, was annual phosphorus loading associated with catchability. The estimated probability that either stock fell below a common management benchmark was affected by the form of temporal dependence, which exemplifies the need to consider how interspecific interactions, shared environmental factors, and uncertainty in the process dynamics and observations affect stocks and their fisheries.

J	Lougheed, VL; Stevenson, RJ				Lougheed, VL; Stevenson, RJ			Exotic marine macroalga (Enteromorpha flexuosa) reaches bloom proportions in a coastal lake of Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The exotic marine algae Enteromorpha flexuosa subsp. flexuosa and subsp. paradoxa were first observed in Muskegon Lake during autumn 2003. In September 2003, the littoral zone had between 10 and 80% cover of macroalgae, which grew largely on submerged macrophytes, and was composed almost entirely of Enteromorpha. Enteromorpha formed dense mats, fouled the boat motor and was found washed up in large quantities on the shoreline. Eleven other waterbodies in the region were surveyed: two others had Enteromorpha composing 5 to 20 % of the macroalgal community, four had no apparent macroalgae and the remaining five were dominated by Cladophora. Possible reasons for the success of Enteromorpha in these coastal lakes include nutrient enrichment, a history of industrial activity resulting in increased salinity of the water, as well as an absence of grazing pressure. Potential effects on littoral zone food webs are uncertain; however, we found low epiphytic diatom densities on Enteromorpha, which is a concern in these systems where epiphytic diatoms are important components of the food web. Currently, this new macroalgal invader has been found in only three coastal waterbodies of Lake Michigan; however, it is possible that Enteromorpha could spread beyond its current range, if it has not already done so. Given its ability to form nuisance blooms in a coastal lake of Lake Michigan and its reported impacts in marine systems, it is imperative that the possible impacts of this invasive marine macroalga on the Great Lakes ecosystem be determined.																			0380-1330						2004	30	4					538	544		10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70369-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70369-X													WOS:000226952000007

Recent studies of ice effects in the shore zone have included investigations of ice-congested and protected shores in the north-west Canadian Arctic Archipelago, processes involved in the construction by ice of large shore ridges in the same region, direct ice scour and enhanced hydrodynamic scour in the presence of ice (strudel scour and ice wallow), particularly as potential hazards to buried pipelines in the Beaufort Sea, and the dynamics of boulder-strewn tidal flats and boulder barricades in eastern Canada. The extent and frequency of shore nourishment by ice and details of the processes involved, including die relative importance of ride-up versus pile-up, remain important research questions. Reports emphasizing the contribution of ice rafting to shoreface retreat along the Alaskan coast of the Beaufort Sea suggest the need for quantitative studies of this phenomenon in Canada, in particular with respect to prodelta sedimentation at the mouth of the Mackenzie River. The coastal zone in the Beaufort Sea is particularly sensitive to climate change through effects on thermokarst processes, rising sea level, the relation between ice cover and wave energy through fetch limitation, and potential changes involving ice dynamics and freeze-up processes.

To this aim, 82 water samples were taken from wells and spring across the plains and chemically were analyzed in the laboratory. Descriptive statistics and correlation matrix of the studied parameters were obtained by SPSS software. Correlation matrix showed that four parameters including electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO), total soluble solids (TDS) and pH had the highest correlations with salinity compared to the other parameters. Therefore, the mentioned parameters selected as inputs and salinity were the output according to the purpose of the study. After standardization, data were entered into the MATLAB environment and groundwater salinity was predicted using ANFIS-FCM and ANFIS-SCM methods. The models' results showed that the estimated groundwater salinity for ANFIS-SCM model had very good accuracy and more correlation than the measured values. As a result, ANFIS-SCM intelligent method has been an effective, efficient and accurate method to estimate the parameters in the study area.

The lake is species-depauperate, with no major lake trout embryo predators. We hypothesized that without this predation threat, lake trout free embryo feeding and growth may be greater than in their native range, leading to increased survival of age-0 individuals and rapid population growth. We compared length, developmental rate, and feeding patterns of lake trout free embryos captured at a spawning site in Yellowstone Lake with free embryos captured in their native range in Lake Champlain, Vermont. More embryos were feeding, contained more food, and were significantly longer at the same developmental stages in Yellowstone Lake. With an abundance of available food and minimal threat of predation, free embryos remained on the spawning site in Yellowstone Lake later into the summer than in Lake Champlain and achieved a greater maximum length before they dispersed. Greater food consumption and associated growth likely leads to high survival of lake trout free embryos in Yellowstone Lake, contributing to rapid population growth.

We examined the texture, organic content and macrofossils of eight cores and obtained 29 radiocarbon dates on transitions between sedimentary units. The water level fell between about 8000 C-14 yr BP and 6000 C-14 yr BP, and remained low until after 5000 C-14 yr BP. The water level may have begun rising as early as 4750 C-14 yr BP, with the most rapid increase occurring from 3225 C-14 yr BP to 2780 C-14 yr BP. This interpretation varies at some points from an earlier assessment of Mansell Pond's Holocene lake levels that was based on pollen and charcoal evidence from a single core. Records of Holocene lake levels from eastern Canada, the Lake Ontario region and southern New England are inconsistent with each other, suggesting that the influence of dominant air masses has been highly localized in this region.																			0959-6836	1477-0911				MAR	2001	11	2					189	201		10.1191/095968301677768783	http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/095968301677768783													WOS:000167169700005

The bloom was spatially very heterogeneous. Bloom size, duration, and presumably N2 fixation vary from year to year, but in 1979 about 900 t of nitrogen were fixed in 2 months in this large deep lake. The annual rate of N2 fixation was about 2 g m-2. In this year of low inflow the Truckee River provided 54 t of inorganic nitrogen and 83 t of organic nitrogen. Planktonic N2 fixation has not been measured during high inflow years and may have been small relative to river input. Lakewide average heterocyst to vegetative cell (h : c) ratios followed seasonal trends in N2 fixation, but synoptic samples showed only weak relation between h : c and N2 fixation. N2 fixation was induced by low epilimnetic levels of inorganic nitrogen and ended before lake overturn in the fall. High rates of N2 fixation were confined to the upper 5% of the epilimnetic volume and thus occurred only in calm weather when Nodularia colonies floated to the lake surface. Access to freshly dissolved atmospheric CO2 may account for the near-surface dependence, since the lake pH is normally about 9.2. We predict that Nodularia will not show the same degree of near-surface dependence in near-neutral lakes or in the ocean.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1985	30	6					1229	1239		10.4319/lo.1985.30.6.1229	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1985.30.6.1229													WOS:A1985AVJ1000009

Of particular interest are the climatic conditions during the Epiclassic period (ad 600-900), as droughts have been associated with a cultural demise occurring aroundad 900-1000. We reconstruct the hydroclimate history of the last 2000 years based on a sediment record from a drought-sensitive lake located near one of the most important Epiclassic city-states in Mesoamerica. Titanium concentrations, pollen and diatoms give a consistent environmental signal of five droughts occurring at about: (i)ad 50-250, (ii)ad 700-950, (iii)ad 1200-1300, (iv)ad 1450-1550 and (v)ad 1760-1820. Some droughts were associated with cooler climatic conditions, and all of them framed major historical events. Our results show that the great cultural development of the Epiclassic period (ad 600-900) was framed by a scenario of drought conditions followed by abandonment atad 900-1000. A brief return to moister conditions is recorded before another drought during the time of the fall of the city-state of Tula (1200). European contact (1521) and the War of Independence (1810-20) also occurred during times of drought.

These marshes consist of emergent vascular plants rooted in a surface mat of live and dead roots that grades downward into a decomposing peat layer. The mat floats over a layer of free water underlain by highly decomposed sludge. We sampled the floating marsh surrounding Lake Boeuf, Louisiana, every 10 weeks over a 16 month period in 1982-1983 to quantify the concentrations of nitrogen (total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), nitrite-nitrate and ammonium) and phosphorus (total phosphorus (TP) and phosphate) contained in interstitial water from the root mat and peat layer. Determinations were also made for water from the free-water zone beneath the floating mat, the adjacent lake and the encircling swamp. TKN and TP were analyzed in particulate samples from above-ground plants, roots, mat, peat and sludge. Both nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations in marsh water samples were consistently higher than in lake and swamp water samples, which were similar. Within the floating marsh, a gradient with depth existed for TKN from the mat (160-mu-g-atoms l-1) to the peat (205-mu-g-atoms l-1) to the free-water zone (400-mu-g-atoms l-1). Inorganic N (primarily as ammonium) accounted for a large part of this trend. TP was also highest in the free-water zone (22-mu-g-atoms l-1) and lower in the mat and peat layers (11-13-mu-g-atoms l-1). In below-ground solid samples, a TKN gradient with depth also existed, and highest concentrations were in the sludge (28 mg g-1), decreasing upward in the peat (25 mg g-1), mat (18 mg g-1) and roots (10 mg g-1). The floating marsh rises and falls with changes in local water level. When water from the adjacent lake moves under the mat during periods of rising water, the high nutrient concentration in the free-water zone beneath the mat is diluted. As water levels fall, nutrients move out from under the floating mat. This flux of nutrients from the floating marsh may be an important contribution to the overall budget of the system.																			0304-3770					SEP	1991	41	4					317	331		10.1016/0304-3770(91)90051-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(91)90051-6													WOS:A1991GF86200005
J	BURNS, CW; RIGLER, FH				BURNS, CW; RIGLER, FH			COMPARISON OF FILTERING RATES OF DAPHNIA ROSEA IN LAKE WATER AND IN SUSPENSIONS OF YEAST	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Filtering rates of Daphnia rosea in natural lake water and in pure cultures of a yeast, Rhodotorula glutinis, were measured by adding p32-labeled yeast cells to the medium. The effects of the concentration of food, body length, and water temperature on filtering rates and feeding rates were examined. Results showed that filtering rate increased with increasing body length and increasing temperatures up to 20C. Above a concentration of 0.25 x 105 yeast cells/ml, filtering rate decreased with increasing cell con-centration; below this concentration, filtering rate was maximal. From the results of these experiments, theoretical maximum filtering rates for the Daphnia population in Heart Lake over summer were predicted. A comparison of these theoretical rates and those measured in lake water in the laboratory revealed that from June to November the Daphnia were filtering at less than maximal rates.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1967	12	3					492	+		10.4319/lo.1967.12.3.0492	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1967.12.3.0492													WOS:A19679928600013
J	MCNAMARA, KJ; AWRAMIK, SM				MCNAMARA, KJ; AWRAMIK, SM			STROMATOLITES - A KEY TO UNDERSTANDING THE EARLY EVOLUTION OF LIFE	SCIENCE PROGRESS												Stromatolites are sedimentary structures produced by the sediment-trapping, binding and/or precipitation activity of microbial communities, in particular by photosynthetic cyanobacteria. They occur today in a wide range of aquatic habitats, both marine and non-marine, from shallow subtidal to supratidal and in lakes, streams and thermal springs. Although uncommon today, stromatolites were widespread in the past, and are the most conspicuous fossils in Precambrian rocks. The earliest examples, from 3500 million-year-old rocks, represent the earliest evidence for life on Earth. For the succeeding 3000 million years the microbial communities that constructed these structures dominated life on Earth. It has been suggested that these microbes played a major role in the development of the banded-iron formations that are widespread in Precambrian rocks, and that they played a crucial role in the formation of atmospheric oxygen. Like other ecosystems, the microbial communities that construct stromatolites today are under threat from human activity.																			0036-8504						1992	76	301-02	3-4				345	364																WOS:A1992PL54300005

Between April 1989 and March 1991, 542 harvestable-sized (>75 cm) paddlefish, Polyodon spathula, were measured, tagged, and returned to the reservoir. Using the Fisher-Ford method, we estimated the population at 1,689 paddlefish with an annual survival rate of 91%. The reservoir contains a higher density of paddlefish, 8.8 per hectare, than Lake Barkley (Cumberland River). A low level of exchange occurs between paddlefish in South Cross Creek Reservoir and Lake Barkley, with immigration and emigration occuring during spring flooding when the Cumberland River overflows into the subimpoundment. Fish movement appears to be more dependent upon the water temperature at the time of flooding than the level of flooding. If the water temperature does not exceed 10 degrees C, the paddlefish may not be stimulated to migrate to spawning areas outside of the subimpoundment.																			0270-5060					DEC	1995	10	4					421	431		10.1080/02705060.1995.9663465	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1995.9663465													WOS:A1995TJ40400013

Normally this strain consisted mainly of single cells in cultures. However, if exposed for 48 h to either water with live Daphnia or to O.1-mu m filtered water from a culture with Daphnia present, these unicellular "Chodatella" stages were induced to form colonies (coenobia). Colony induction was not unique to Daphnia; other zooplankters (rotifers and copepods) were able to induce colonies in S. acutus as well. This morphological response could also be evoked when Scenedesmus was exposed to 0.1-mu m filtered lake water during high zooplankton abundances. Especially during early spring, a clear relationship was found between rotifer abundance and colony formation in our test alga in the laboratory. Filtered lake water, incubated nonaxenically for at least 2 d at 20 degrees C, did not induce colony formation, possibly due to microbial degradation. The morphological changes in Scenedesmus could promote grazing resistance in small zooplankters and can be interpreted as an adaptive antipredator strategy.					van Donk, Ellen/B-7272-2008	van Donk, Ellen/0000-0003-3279-4936													0024-3590					JUN	1997	42	4					783	788																WOS:000071037700018

Nonlinear effects of aqueous calcium concentration on antipredator response in Daphnia	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Calcium decline is an emerging environmental concern for thousands of soft-water lakes. Daphnia, an important freshwater herbivore, has reduced reproduction, a weaker, less-rigid carapace, and decreased survival under low aqueous calcium concentrations, but there has been little attention to study how calcium decline will influence predator-prey relationships. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to determine the joint effects of calcium concentration (0.3, 1.2, and 2.3 mg/l) and kairomones from Chaoborus americanus, a ubiquitous invertebrate predator, on Daphnia minnehaha populations. In the presence of Chaoborus kairomones, chemical signals of Chaoborus presence, Daphnia populations had delayed peak abundance and grew antipredator neck spine defenses. However, aqueous calcium concentration influenced the strength of the response. Daphnia in both 0.3 and 2.3 mg Ca/l had stronger neck spine responses and larger reproductive delays than Daphnia in 1.2 mg Ca/l. Our results suggest that as lake calcium concentrations continue to fall, Daphnia populations will respond in complex, nonlinear ways.

However, after peaks in 2006 and 2011/2012, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions began decreasing, respectively. To assess the biogeochemical response of forest ecosystems to the changing atmospheric deposition, flux observations of rainfall outside forest canopies (RF), throughfall and stemflow (TF + SF), and stream water (SW) chemistry were conducted in a Japanese cedar plantation in Kajikawa (KJK) on the Sea of Japan coast in central Japan. Fluxes of S and N by RF and TF + SF at KJK significantly decreased during the observation period (2002-2018). The non-sea salt sulfate (SO42-) flux by TF + SF peaked in 2006/2007 and decreased thereafter, which likely reflected the S emission trends. Accordingly, SO42- concentrations in SW at KJK decreased with increasing alkalinity. Similar decreases in SO42- concentrations beginning in 2006, 2007, and 2008 were observed at eight monitoring lakes in Japan. Thus, the SW chemistry at KJK and possibly that of Japanese lakes were sensitive to atmospheric S deposition reductions. However, as of late, the net S export at KJK has been increasing, exhibiting budget discrepancies in 2014/2015 and 2017/2018. Sulfur isotopic analysis suggested that the S deposited from the atmosphere was retained/cycled in the forest before it was gradually discharged into SW. Thus, a slightly weakened reaction of the output due to the internal cycle and residual effects of previous years may have caused the S budget discrepancies. The nitrate (NO3-) concentration in the SW at KJK has also been continuously increasing. N deposition and other factors, such as the maturation of the planted trees, may play an important role in NO-(3)leaching in plantations.

J	Nakamura, Y; Kerciku, F				Nakamura, Y; Kerciku, F			Effects of filter-feeding bivalves on the distribution of water quality and nutrient cycling in a eutrophic coastal lagoon	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												The horizontal variation of water quality was investigated through field surveys in a cross-section of Lake Shinji, the littoral region of which is densely populated by the filter-feeding bivalve, Corbicula japonica. The distributions of chlorophyll a (chl. a) and nutrients (NH4-N and PO4-P) in the lake are greatly affected by the filtration and excretion rates of C. japonica. Minimum values for chi. a and maximum values for nutrients were both found to occur in the littoral region during summer. Chi. a concentration peaked about 1 km from the shoreline, indicating that the presence of the bivalve not only reduces the biomass of phytoplankton in the near shore region through filtration, but also stimulates primary production further offshore by supplying nutrients through excretion. Calculated results of a mathematical model reproduced well the observed horizontal distributions of chi. a and nutrients, indicating that the interaction between the filter-feeding bivalve and phytoplankton populations dominates material cycling and water quality distribution in the lake. Water mass exchange between littoral and pelagic water enables the nutrient exchange between the bivalves in the benthic zone and the phytoplankton in the pelagic zone, thereby forming a benthic-pelagic zone coupling. Other related findings were that seasonal patterns of water quality variations in the north-south cross-section were affected by metabolic rates of C. japonica, and that differences in concentrations between pelagic and littoral regions are largest when water temperature is optimal for bivalve activity.

We assessed the vertical distribution and behavior of bloaters (C. hoyl) in Lake Michigan with bottom and mid-water trawls in late summer 1987 and with acoustics in August 1995. Biomass of bloaters on the lake bottom was reduced by 84 % at night, Mean size of bloaters increased with depth as did the reduction in night biomass. Juvenile bloaters (<160 mm total length) occurred both in warm surface waters and in the hypolimnion where adults were aggregated. Hypolimnetic bloaters were 10 to 50 m above the bottom at night, but DVM was confined to the hypolimnion. The greater historical [species] diversity of deepwater ciscoes in Lakes Michigan and Huron compared with Lake Superior may be a function of reduced availability of mysids in Lake Superior.																			0071-1128		3-510-47052-4				1998	50						207	217																WOS:000078180200021

During summer, its abundance and large size (10-13 mm) significantly contribute to the elimination of much filtering zooplankton. A quantitative evaluation of the predator's dynamics was carried out with two sampling techniques: a 5-l zooplankton sampler and a bongo net installed in front of a boat. Variability of the data obtained using the zooplankton sampler was one order of magnitude higher than that from the bongo net. In midsummer (July), a high density (2360 ind m(-3)) of L. kindti coincided with a distinct decrease in abundance of the dominant filtrator, Daphnia cucullata (from 111 000 to 19 000 ind m(-3)), confirmed by a positive correlation between the number of D. cucullata eliminated by L. kindti and the death rate of D. cucullata in the pelagic zone.

When its <<echo>> comes back, it generates a new bloom outburst, and a next cycle occurs. It is supposed that the resonance of self-supporting oscillations in populations with periodic solar influences led to standing waves, which provide for biosystem stability and cyclic recurrence of phytoplankton bloom. To test the model, an analysis of the interannual dynamics (from 1941 to 1998) of the pelagic phytoplankton in the southern basin of the lake Baikal was carried out. The discovered 11-year cycles with 32/3-year cycles within them conform. well to the model, which made it possible to explain not only the cyclic recurrence but also a number of other obscure aspects of phytoplankton life in the lake Baikal, The next bloom burst is predicted to take place in 2001.

J	EMERY, BM; LEDIG, FT				EMERY, BM; LEDIG, FT			PROVENANCE VARIATION IN EUCALYPTUS-CAMALDULENSIS DEHNH IN CALIFORNIA	SILVAE GENETICA												In California, the Lake Albacutya provenance of river red gum was clearly superior in volume growth to 22 other provenances collected throughout the range of the species in Australia. It had at least 2.5 times the volume of the plantation mean at 5.5 years, consistent with its performance in other countries with Mediterranean climates like California''s. Other provenances from the southeastern Australia, particularly those in the Murray River basin, also performed well. The Murray River trees tended to be more crooked and have more forking than those from other areas, and also were among the most heavily flowering in the plantation. The Lake Albacutya trees were somewhat straighter and less forked than those from the Murray River drainage proper. All successful provenances had a high rainfall pattern correlation (RPC), a statistic defined as the correlation of monthly precipitation at provenance origin with precipitation at the planting site. Cluster analysis on monthly precipitation, mean maximum temperature, and length of frost season linked provenances from the Murray River drainage and Lake Albacutya. Successful provenances had an RPC > 0, long frost periods > 120 days, and low summer mean maximum temperatures < 34.degree. C. When the planting site was included in the cluster analysis, it also joined the Lake Albacutya and Murray River group. RPC and the multivariate techniques provide a basis for objectively recognizing homoclimes.																			0037-5349	2509-8934					1987	36	3-4					172	180																WOS:A1987L348400011
J	Carrillo, P; Reche, I; CruzPizarro, L				Carrillo, P; Reche, I; CruzPizarro, L			Intraspecific stoichiometric variability and the ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus resupplied by zooplankton	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. An in situ experiment was carried out in a high-mountain oligotrophic lake (La Caldera) to quantify the specific release rates of ammonium and phosphorus in different phases of the seasonal succession of plankton. The zooplankton community was dominated by the calanoid copepod Mixodiaptomus laciniatus. 2. The rates of release of N and P (from non-detectable to 3.58 mu gN mg(-1) DW h(-1) and from 0.26 to 2.29 mu g P mg(-1) DW h(-1), respectively) and the N : P released ratio (not detectable to 4.77) fell within the range typical of oligotrophic lakes dominated by copepodite assemblages. 3. The values of the zooplankton N : P ratio (5 : 1 to 10 : 1 by weight) were lower than those established for other species of calanoids, and followed a well-established pattern of seasonal variation from year to year with higher values after ice thaw and lower values as individual size increased (ontogenetic development). 4. The elemental composition of the zooplankton depended on individual size, while the released N : P ratio was inversely related to the N : P ratio of the food. This pattern conforms to the predictions of the homeostasis theory of Sterner (1990). 5. A feedback regulation was established between the stoichiometric composition of the zooplankton, their food and the released N : P ratio that can help explain changes in pelagic community structure during the ice-free period.

However, there are notable discrepancies between different temperature time series. Here we report a high-resolution temperature reconstruction based on branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) from annually laminated sediments of the Sihailongwan maar lake in northeastern China and compare it with temperature records from pollen and long-chain alkenones. The brGDGTs-based mean lake water temperature reconstruction shows a mean temperature of 6.1 degrees C for the Older Dryas, followed by an increase of 2.6 degrees C until the peak of the B & oslash;lling-Aller & oslash;d, a decrease to 7.8 degrees C during the Younger Dryas, and a warming from the beginning of the Holocene until 6 ka BP, and finally a gradual decrease until modern times. Although seasonal biases and interpretations differ in different proxy-based reconstructions, all records show broadly similar temperature changes since the last deglaciation. The results suggest that the temperature variations recorded in Sihailongwan maar lake are coupled with high latitude ice-sheet dynamics through atmosphere-ocean circulation systems. The gradual temperature changes could be mainly associated with the ice-volume, while the abrupt variations of the temperature could be related to the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, the intensity of the East Asian winter monsoon and solar activity.					; Rioual, Patrick/H-5140-2018; Qi, LI/AAF-3389-2019; Song, Shuguang/B-8592-2008	Zhu, zeyang/0000-0002-3933-5807; Rioual, Patrick/0000-0001-9491-9197; Li, Pingping/0009-0005-9232-1534													0277-3791	1873-457X				FEB 1	2025	349								109139	10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.109139	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.109139		DEC 2024											WOS:001385522900001

EARLIEST MICROBOTANICAL EVIDENCE FOR MAIZE IN THE NORTHERN LAKE MICHIGAN BASIN	AMERICAN ANTIQUITY												There is no recorded maize (Zea mays spp. mays) from sites predating circa cal AD 800 in the northern Lake Michigan or Lake Superior basins of the western Great Lakes, despite the presence of maize microbotanicals including phytoliths and starches in Michigan, New York, and Quebec as early as 400 cal BC. To evaluate the potential for an earlier maize presence in the northern Lake Michigan basin, samples of carbonized food residues adhering to 16 ceramic vessels were obtained from the Winter site (20DE17) located on the Garden Peninsula in the northern Lake Michigan basin. Each sample was split and sent to two analysts. Both analysts identified low incidences of maize starch and phytoliths in multiple samples, with overlapping identifications on several. Three direct accelerator mass spectrometry dates on the carbonized residues reveal maize incorporated into the residues as early as the second century cal BC, 800 years before any regional macrobotanical evidence. Although the method of dispersal cannot be determined, these results support the proposition that initial northern dispersal of maize in the region may have been nearly 800 years earlier than macrobotanical evidence would suggest and is consistent with the timing of its introduction to the lower Great Lakes area.

However, due to weak correlation between adjacent multibeam sonar data and difficulties in inter-frame feature matching, the resulting underwater mapping accuracy frequently falls short of the desired level. To address this issue, this study presents the development of a multibeam data processing system, which includes functionalities for sonar parameter configuration, data storage, and point cloud conversion. Subsequently, an Iterative Extended Kalman Filter (iEKF) algorithm is employed for odometry estimation, facilitating the initial construction of the point cloud map. To further enhance mapping accuracy, we utilize the Generalized Iterative Closest Point (GICP) algorithm for point cloud registration, effectively merging point cloud data collected at different times from the same location. Finally, real-world lake experiments demonstrate that our method achieves an Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) of 15.10 m and an average local point cloud registration error of 0.97 m. Furthermore, we conduct measurements on various types of artificial targets. The experimental results indicate that the average location error of the targets calculated by our method is 4.62 m, which meets the accuracy requirements for underwater target exploration.					; Wang, Zewen/GZL-7034-2022; Tan, tf/HPD-7070-2023	Tan, Tingfeng/0009-0001-8414-1243; cao, chun/0009-0000-4544-0411; Zhang, Feihu/0000-0002-1774-727X; 														2077-1312				JUL	2024	12	7							1222	10.3390/jmse12071222	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jmse12071222													WOS:001277313800001

A note on species lists and ecosystem shifts: Black Sea tintinnids, ciliates of the microzooplankton	ACTA PROTOZOOLOGICA												We investigated tintinnid (planktonic ciliate protists) in the Black Sea, a system which has undergone marked changes. Obvious shifts in the Black Sea began with eutrophication from the 1960's to the 1980's, followed by blooms of the carnivorous comb jelly Mnemiopsis in the late 1980's-early 1990's and finally de-eutrophication and the decline of the comb jelly since the mid-1990's. Here we document historical changes in apparent species inventories which correspond with ecosystem changes. Tintinnid ciliates have been studied in the Black Sea for over 130 years. Records were assembled by year of publication, ignoring all variability in sampling methods, geographic location and extent of sampling, season of collection, etc. Time lines were constructed for each species. The number of species reported increased steadily from the 1870's to the mid-1960's. With eutrophication and the damming of the Danube River, the frequency of new species records declined from the 1960's to the 1990's but with no apparent species losses. The 1990's to the present corresponds with rise and fall of blooms of the comb jelly and the collapse and recovery of the anchovy fishery. For this last period, we found an increase in the numbers of both new species records and 'apparent' losses of tintinnid species.

As the instrument is fitted to a Lister-type heat-flow instrument, combined thermal and electrical conductivity measurements are possible. The probe incorporates no moving mechanical parts, is built to operate in water-depths up to 4000 m and is relatively easy to deploy. Two separate electrode arrays provide for an instant repeatability test and rapid data quality assessment. The probe was extensively tested in the laboratory. Field tests in Lake Konstanz and in the North Sea produced consistent results. This paper gives a description of the design of the probe and the test results. A theoretical derivation of the probe's configuration factor is presented and theoretical results are verified in laboratory tests. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Carlson, AE				Carlson, Anders E.			Why there was not a Younger Dryas-like event during the Penultimate Deglaciation	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The Younger Dryas cold event is a relatively unique feature of the last deglaciation when compared to previous deglaciations, suggesting a unique trigger rather than the commonly held forcing mechanism of North American freshwater routing to the North Atlantic. Here, I compare the last (T-I) and penultimate (T-II) deglaciations and provide new support for the argument that the lack of a Younger Dryas-like event during T-II is due to the rapidity of Northern Hemisphere ice sheet retreat under greater boreal summer insolation forcing. Faster ice retreat suppressed Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) until near the end of T-II, while during T-I AMOC increased relatively early. During T-I, the eastward routing of freshwater that caused the Younger Dryas happened after AMOC resumption, whereas during T-II this routing occurred prior to the resumption of AMOC. Thus the increased flux of freshwater to the North Atlantic during T-II had little effect on AMOC, explaining the lack of a Younger Dryas-like climate oscillation during this deglaciation.

Seasonal dynamics of zooplankton in Lake Huetzalin, Xochimilco (Mexico City, Mexico)	LIMNOLOGICA												We quantified the seasonal changes in the zooplankton abundances collected from the Huetzalin Lake (Mexico City, Mexico) for two years (February 2003-January 2004 and then March 2005-February 2006). Selected physicochemical variables (Secchi depth, temperature, pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, phosphorus, nitrogen, carbon and chlorophyll a concentration) were also measured at the time of zooplankton collection. The data on zooplankton abundances and the physicochemical variables were subjected to multiple correlation analysis and we also derived Shannon-Wiener species diversity index. Secchi depth ranged from 9 to 65 cm. Generally the lake was alkaline (pH 7-12). The conductivity ranged from 500-1000mScm(-1), while the mean water temperature was 20.5 degrees C. Dissolved oxygen levels were generally > 3 mg L-1 and were higher in the winter than warmer months. Nitrates (90-95 mu g L-1) and phosphates (.2-.5 mg L-1) indicated that the water was eutrophic. Chlorophyll a levels ranged from 143 to 696 mu g L-1 during the study period. The zooplankton community was dominated by rotifers (46 species), followed by cladocerans (9 species) and there were only two copepod species. The dominant rotifer species were Brachionus angulans, Brachionus calyciflorus, Brachionus havanaensis, Brachionus quadridentatus, Lecane bulla and Polyarthra vulgaris. Rare rotifer species in Lake Huetzalin were Lecane ohioensis, Dicranophorus forcipatus, Lecane pyriformis, Lindia torulosa, Pleurotrocha petromyzon and Brachionus durgae. Highest densities (occasional peaks of 400 ind L-1) of B. quadridentatus occurred between April and December, while B. havanaensis reached peak densities, during June to October. e. calyciflorus reached densities higher than 1240 ind L-1 during May-September. Cladoceran and copepod densities in Lake Huetzalin were much lower than that of the rotifers. This study confirmed the earlier findings that Xochimilco system of canals is dominated by rotifers and the crustacean zooplankton have much lower abundances possibly due to predation from fish.

Levels of DP were measured in surface soils from e-waste recycling areas and industrial areas in South China. Higher DP levels were found in e-waste recycling areas (undetectable-47.4 ng/g) than those in industrial areas (0.0336-4.65 ng/g) in South China. The highest DP concentration (3327 ng/g) was found at the e-waste recycling site in Qingyuan, while DP levels fell dramatically with increasing distance away from the recycling site, suggesting that the e-waste recycling activities are an important source of DP emissions. The mean ratios of anti-DP to total DP (f(anti)) for different sampling areas ranged from 0.58 to 0.76 and showed no significant difference from the ratio for the technical DP products (t-test, p > 0.05). Further intensive studies are needed to investigate the process of DP degradation and its degradation products. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Li, XJ; Huang, MT; Wang, RH				Li, Xiaojuan; Huang, Mutao; Wang, Ronghui			Numerical Simulation of Donghu Lake Hydrodynamics and Water Quality Based on Remote Sensing and MIKE 21	ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION												Numerical simulation is an important method used in studying the evolution mechanisms of lake water quality. At the same time, lake water quality inversion technology using the characteristics of spatial optical continuity data from remote sensing satellites is constantly improving. It is, however, a research hotspot to combine the spatial and temporal advantages of both methods, in order to develop accurate simulation and prediction technology for lake water quality. This paper takes Donghu Lake in Wuhan as its research area. The spatial data from remote sensing and water quality monitoring information was used to construct a multi-source nonlinear regression fitting model (genetic algorithm (GA)-back propagation (BP) model) to invert the water quality of the lake. Based on the meteorological and hydrological data, as well as basic water quality data, a hydrodynamic model was established by using the MIKE21 model to simulate the evolution rules of water quality in Donghu Lake. Combining the advantages of the two, the best inversion results were used to provide a data supplement for optimization of the water quality simulation process, improving the accuracy and quality of the simulation. The statistical results were compared with water quality simulation results based on the data measured. The results show that the water quality simulation of chlorophyll a and nitrate nitrogen mean square errors fell to 17% and 24%, from 19% and 31% respectively, after optimization using remote sensing spatial information. The model precision was thus improved, and this is consistent with the actual pollution situation of Donghu Lake.																				2220-9964				FEB	2020	9	2							94	10.3390/ijgi9020094	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi9020094													WOS:000522449700034
J	Bedard, C; Knowles, R				Bedard, C; Knowles, R			Some properties of methane oxidation in a thermally stratified lake	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Profiles of (CH4)-C-14 and (CO)-C-14 oxidation and concentrations of CH4, NH4+, and nitrogen oxides (N2O, NO2-, NO3-) were studied in Lake St. George, Ontario, during late summer stratification. Metalimnetic maxima of the nitrogen oxides occurred and high rates of oxidation of CH4 and CO were limited to a narrow band (<1 m) below the nitrogen oxide peaks at the oxic-anoxic interface. Oxidation of CH4 and CO was strongly inhibited by the nitrification inhibitor allylthiourea. The affinity of the oxidizers for CH4 (approximate K-m = 4.6 mu M), their sensitivity to picolinic acid, and the ratio of CH4 oxidation to allylthiourea-sensitive CO oxidation together suggest that methanotrophs were responsible for the observed CH4 oxidation. Pure cultures of Nitrosomonas europaea, although less sensitive to picolinic acid than the CH, oxidizers of Lake St. George,were affected by the inhibitor (approximate K-i for inhibition of NH4+ oxidation = 51 mu M).																			0706-652X					JUL	1997	54	7					1639	1645		10.1139/cjfas-54-7-1639	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-54-7-1639													WOS:A1997XW70100020

Water quality, zooplankton, benthos and sediments were monitored at three sites of greater-than-or-equal-to 20 m depth from 1989 to 1991 to determine the effects of rainbow trout cage culture on the lake environment. Nutrient and chlorophyll a levels remained low ([PO4]: < 0.20 mg/l; [NH4]: < 0.10 mg/l; [NO3]: < 2.2 mg/l; [chl a]: < 10 mg/1) despite loading from the farm (1990:780 kg of P). An oxygen depletion occurred in the vicinity of the cages due to respiration of the farmed fish. About 90% of the zooplankton counted were Daphnia sp. They were less abundant during summer in the area of the cages than at control sites (Friedman's ANOVA SS = 11.20, P < 0.001). Benthic invertebrates were rare at all three sites of the lake. The sediments below the cages had a pH and % organic matter comparable to areas of the lake receiving the natural input of allochthonous material. Sediment available P levels were higher at the farm than at control sites (Friedman's ANOVA SS = 11.64, P < 0.005) and showed peaks coinciding with periods of overfeeding. These results indicated that at its present production level, the farm had short-term, localized impacts on the lake environment.																			0044-8486					JAN 15	1992	109	2					101	117																WOS:A1992KD84400001

The numbers of Oligochaeta were mostly higher in Aug. than in May. Regional differences could be found although the lake seems to be very homogenous. Temporal and vertical variations were detectable in separate subareas. The oligochaete biomass was maximal at 2 m depth. In soft bottom sediments the oligochaetes composed 15.9% of macrobenthos biomass and 12.2% of numbers, but on the stony bottom only 1.9% of numbers. The ratio of Oligochaeta/Chironomidae was similar to those in profundals of oligotrophic lakes. Correlation coefficients between species and 2 measures of niche overlap were in partial agreement. A temporal niche seems to occur: when the chironomid larvae decrease during the summer, the oligochaetes increase.																			0105-9327						1982	5	4					396	404																WOS:A1982PP19200007

Impacts of forest harvest on cold season land surface conditions and land-atmosphere interactions in northern Great Lakes states	JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS												Land cover change, including temporary disturbances such as forest harvests, can significantly affect established regimes of surface energy balance and moisture exchange, altering flux processes that drive weather and climate. We examined the impacts of forest harvest on winter land-atmosphere interactions in a temperate region using high-resolution numerical modeling methods in paired simulations. Using the WRF-ARW atmospheric model and the Noah land surface model, we simulated the balance of surface sensible and latent heat fluxes and the development and dissipation of a stable nocturnal boundary layer during generally calm synoptic conditions. Our results show reduced daily-average snow-covered land surface sensible heat flux (by 80%) and latent heat flux (by 60%) to the atmosphere in forest clearings due to albedo effects and rebalancing of the surface energy budget. We found a land surface cooling effect (-8 W m(-2)) in snow-covered cleared areas, consistent with prior modeling studies and conceptual understanding of the mechanisms for midlatitude deforestation to offset anthropogenic global warming at local scales. Results also demonstrate impacts of forest clearing on the passage of a weak cold front due to altered near-surface winds and boundary layer stability. We show significant differences in both surface conditions and fluxes between harvested and undisturbed forest areas. Our results demonstrate the potential utility of high-resolution remote sensing analyses to represent transient land cover changes in model simulations of weather and climate, which are usually undertaken at coarser resolutions and often overlook these changes at the land surface.

Twelve species of platyhelminths were recovered, including 9 spp. of Digenea [Quinqueserialis quinqueserialis, Echinostoma revolutum, Wardius zibethicus, Notocotylus urbanensis, Nudacotyle novica, Plagiorchis proximus, Schistosomatium douthitti, Echinoparyphium sp., Opisthorchis tonkae] and 3 spp. of Cestoda [Hymenolepis evaginata, Taenia tenuicollis, Andrya macrocephala]. Muskrats collected from the streams and backwaters of the Miramichi River area harbored 9 spp. of parasites compared with 7 spp. recovered from both the Magaguadavic Lake area and the St. John River area, and 5 spp. recovered from muskrats on the Jolicure marshes. Q. quinqueserialis showed the highest incidence of infection in all muskrats examined. N. novicia and Echinoparyphium sp. showed the highest intensities of infection. O. tonkae and A. macrocephala are recorded from muskrats in Canada for the 1st time.

This disappearance was followed by the addition of P32 to the water of a small, non-stratified fresh-water lake. The P32 was found to be taken up by the mud and living organisms (solids) of the lake until P32 equilibrated between water and solids. The curve of decline of water P observed in this and other expts. using P32, and in analyses of soluble P following spring overturn, and following fertilization with phosphates, can be explained by postulating an active exchange between P in water and P in solids. For the lakes considered, turnover time for P in water varied from 2.4 to 30 days, and for P in solids from 37 to 176 days. Eutrophication may consist of the drainage into a lake, of more nutrients than can be equilibrated with the solid phase.																			0022-0477	1365-2745					1952	40	1					202	216		10.2307/2258030	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2258030													WOS:A1952YD68300012

SOIL EROSION RISK ASSESSMENT IN A CATCHMENT AREA FOR ECOLOGICAL MONITORING OF PROTECTED AREAS USING GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY												Soil is a considerable natural resource which is one of the cores of the natural ecosystems and is also under constant pressure. The sustainable environmental management of the natural resources necessitates the soil conservation and the systematic monitoring of the sensitive ecosystems, which are regularly exposed in desertification processes in the Mediterranean region. The Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in many cases function as a tool to the protected areas ecological management due to spatial modelling and quantitative methods. In the present study, in the catchment area of the artificial lake of Aoos Springs in the Northwest Greece, the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) is implemented in order to assess the soil erosion risk. The combination between the derived soil erosion risk assessment and the Natura 2000 network, which is the ecological network of protected areas, provided an insightful view for any soil erosion impact on the natural habitat types. Preservation of the representative ecosystems is significant for the biodiversity worldwide and thus the sustainable ecological planning process for protected areas and soil conservation supply resilience in mitigating the environmental challenges of the climate change.

Productivity of Osprey, Pandion haliaetus, nesting on natural and artificial structures in the Kawartha Lakes, Ontario, 1991-2001	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												Ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) declined throughout the Great Lakes basin during the 1950s to 1970s due to usage of organochlorine pesticides. Following the banning of DDT in 1972, artificial elevated nest structures were erected in the Kawartha Lakes region of south-central Ontario to aid in their recovery. As the population grew, large stumps of flooded trees, < 1 m above the surface of the water became important nesting sites, despite their propensity to flood in turbulent weather conditions. We compared the productivity of Ospreys among nest substrates and longevity of the nests in this area from 1991 to 2001. Of 260 individual nesting attempts made over the 11 years, 57% used man-made structures, primarily either quadrupod nesting platforms or utility poles. Of nests on natural substrates, stump nests accounted for 37% of total nesting attempts; elevated tree nests were relatively uncommon (6%). Productivity of stump nests was significantly greater than that of artificial or tree nests (1.48 versus 1.16 and 0.73 chicks produced per occupied nest, respectively). Nevertheless, survivorship of stump nests was less than that of platform nests after 3 years of age, as high water levels, storms or winter ice activity destroyed some of these low nests between breeding seasons. Ospreys were able to attain greater productivity in these stump nests than on man-made nesting substrates.																			0008-3550					JAN-MAR	2005	119	1					58	63		10.22621/cfn.v119i1.81	http://dx.doi.org/10.22621/cfn.v119i1.81													WOS:000238507500008

C. curvispinum breeds from April to October, producing three generations per year. The breeding season was strongly correlated with water temperature. Reproduction generally began in March and was well established by May. The overwintering generation died during June/July, but reproduction continued until October as a result of breeding of summer generation individuals. Females comprised 60 to 80 % of the population. The percentage of males was lowest in May/June. The mean number of eggs per brood of C. curvispinum in the Lower Rhine is one of the highest ever recorded for the species and showed a positive correlation with chlorophyll-a. A significant difference between sites (Lobith and Nijmegen) was observed for brood size. In contrast, no significant differences were found between sites for breeding season, population structure and sex ratio. The percentage egg loss from the brood pouch of C. curvispinum is high when compared with other Corophium species. Our results suggest that water temperature can be regarded as an important factor in regulating breeding seasons in the Lower Rhine, but that brood size could vary in association with food availability. The life history traits and environmental factors which facilitate the success of C. curvispinum in the Lower Rhine are discussed.					van der Velde, Gerard/C-7776-2011; Rajagopal, Senthilkumar/AGR-0600-2022														0003-9136					FEB	1999	144	3					305	325																WOS:000079331400004

Whereas removal of N and P in lakes and reservoirs can be compensated for by anthropogenic inputs in the drainage basins, no such compensation occurs for DSI. The resulting changes in the nutrient composition (DSI:N:P ratio) of river discharges seem to be responsible for dramatic shifts in phytoplankton species composition in the Black Sea. In the Baltic Sea, DSI concentrations and the DSI:N ratio have been decreasing since the end of the 1960s, and there are indications that the proportion of diatoms in the spring bloom has decreased while flagellates have increased. The effects on coastal biogeochemical cycles and food web structure observed in the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea may be far reaching, because it appears that the reductions in DSi delivery by rivers are probably occurring worldwide with the ever increasing construction of dams for flow regulation.					; Humborg, Christoph/C-4756-2015; Ittekkot, Venugopalan/AAC-3437-2022	Ittekkot, Venugopalan/0000-0003-2667-5068; Conley, Daniel Joseph/0000-0001-9668-9284; Humborg, Christoph/0000-0002-0649-5599; 													0044-7447	1654-7209				FEB	2000	29	1					45	50		10.1639/0044-7447(2000)029[0045:SRIRBF]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1639/0044-7447(2000)029[0045:SRIRBF]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000087739500007

Lake Geneva is presently an oligo-mesotrophic lake, and As-unpolluted. The water column never becomes anoxic but the oxygen saturation at the bottom of the Grand Lac is now below 30% owing to lack of water column mixing since 2012. Thus, this lake offers excellent conditions to study As behaviour in an unpolluted, oxic freshwater body. The following 'dissolved' As species: iAs(iii), iAs(iii + v), MA(iii), MA(iii + v), DMA(iii + v), and TMAO were analysed by HG-CT-ICP-MS/MS. Water column measurements were complemented with occasional sampling in the main rivers feeding the lake and in the interstitial waters of a sediment core. The presence of MA(iii) and TMAO and the predominance of iAs(v) in lake and river samples has been confirmed as well as the key role of algae in the formation of organic species. While the total 'dissolved' As concentrations showed nearly vertical profiles in the Petit Lac, As concentrations steadily increase at deeper depths in the Grand Lac due to the lack of mixing and build up in bottom waters. The evaluation of 25 years of monthly data of 'dissolved' As concentrations showed no significant temporal trends between 1997 and 2021. The observed seasonal character of the 'dissolved' As along this period coincides with a lack of seasonality in As mass inventories, pointing to a seasonal internal cycling of As species in the water column with exchanges between the 'dissolved' and 'particulate' (i.e., algae) fractions.					; Loizeau, Jean-Luc/AAA-1165-2022; Matousek, Tomas/JCE-3386-2023	Matousek, Tomas/0000-0002-7603-1773; Loizeau, Jean-Luc/0000-0002-0611-0388													2050-7887	2050-7895				APR 26	2023	25	4					850	869		10.1039/d2em00431c	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2em00431c		FEB 2023						36924114					WOS:000949107500001

Investigation of XoxF methanol dehydrogenases reveals new methylotrophic bacteria in pelagic marine and freshwater ecosystems	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												The diversity and distribution of methylotrophic bacteria have been investigated in the oceans and lakes using the methanol dehydrogenase mxaF gene as a functional marker. However, pelagic marine (OM43) and freshwater (LD28 and PRD01a001B) methylotrophs within the Betaproteobacteria lack mxaF, instead possessing a related xoxF4-encoded methanol dehydrogenase. Here, we developed and employed xoxF4 as a complementary functional gene marker to mxaF for studying methylotrophs in aquatic environment. Using xoxF4, we detected OM43-related and LD28-related methylotrophs in the ocean and freshwaters of North America, respectively, and showed the coexistence of these two lineages in a large estuarine system (St Lawrence Estuary). Gene expression patterns of xoxF4 supported a positive relationship between xoxF4-containing methylotroph activity and spring time productivity, suggesting phytoplankton blooms are a source of methylotrophic substrates. Further investigation of methanol dehydrogenase diversity in pelagic ecosystems using comparative metagenomics provided strong support for a widespread distribution of xoxF4 (as well as several distinct xoxF5) containing methylotrophs in marine and freshwater surface waters. In total, these results demonstrate a geographical distribution of OM43/LD28-related methylotrophs that includes marine and freshwaters and suggest that methylotrophy occurring in the water column is an important component of lake and estuary carbon cycling and biogeochemistry.

J	Roy, CL; Berdeen, JB; Clark, M				Roy, Charlotte L.; Berdeen, James B.; Clark, Mark			A Demographic model for ring-necked ducks breeding in minnesota	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Population models can provide insights into how perturbations of demographic vital rates influence population growth rates (lambda) and help prioritize efforts to achieve management goals. Although population models have been developed for numerous duck species, this tool has not been developed for ring-necked ducks (Aythya collaris). Ring-necked ducks are a late-nesting species that may not be surveyed well by the May Waterfowl Survey, which is timed optimally for earlier nesting ducks like the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). Information specific to ring-necked ducks would help identify important influences on the rate of population growth and the direction of population change. We used data from our own research during 2008-2012, long-term (1975-2016) survey data from northcentral Minnesota, USA, vital rate estimates from the literature, and long-term (1987-2016) banding data to develop a population model for ring-necked ducks. We estimated annual survival and recovery rates of after-hatching-year and hatching-year female ring-necked ducks in Minnesota. Survey results and our matrix models indicated that ring-necked ducks are declining in the forested portion of Minnesota. Thus, we examined a boom-or-bust simulation scenario that might maintain a population through periodic occurrence of exceptional reproductive years in conjunction with high hatching-year survival. Our results indicated that long-term persistence is only expected in this population if reproductive output doubled at the same time that hatching-year survival was at its highest value, or if the population is maintained through immigration. Sensitivity analysis indicated that unit changes in 30-day brood survival will produce the most change in lambda in the parameter space observed, although elasticity analysis indicated that proportional changes in annual survival of adult females will produce the largest proportional changes in lambda. Management to improve brood survival to increase lambda might include improving the habitat quality of brood-rearing lakes, especially those with more open water and less nesting habitat than those used for nesting. Our findings might also help explain disparities between annual breeding waterfowl surveys, which indicate stable or increasing populations, and hunter experiences in the fall. In Minnesota, hunter experiences have not matched expectations based on historical fall numbers and this could occur if regional production declined and fewer young birds were available for harvest. Our findings highlight the need for further study to inform management in this rapidly changing region. (c) 2019 The Wildlife Society.
