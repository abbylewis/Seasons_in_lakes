(1) A primary succession: The vegetation responded to the rapid rise of temperatures around 14,685 yr BP, with a primary succession on a decadal to centennial time scale. The succession between ca 15,600 and 13,000 yr BP included: (1.1.) The replacement of shrub-tundra by woodland of Juniperus and tree birch (around 14,665 yr BP) (1.2.) The response of Juniperus pollen to the shift in oxygen isotopes in less than 20 yr, (1.3.) A sequence of population increases of Hippophae rhamnoides (ca 14,600 yr BP), Salix spp. (ca 14,600 yr BP), Betula trees (ca.14,480 yr BP), Populus cf. tremula (ca. 14,300 yr BP), and Pinus cf. sylvestris (ca. 13,830 yr BP). (2) Biological processes: Plants responded to the rapid increase of summer temperatures on all organisational levels: (2.1) Individuals may have produced more pollen (e.g. Juniperus); (2.2) Populations increased or decreased (e.g. Juniperus, Betula, later Pinus), and (2.3) Populations changed their biogeographical range and may show migrational lags. (2.4) Plant communities changed in their composition because the species pools changed through immigration and (local) extinction. Some plant communities may have been without modern analogue. These mechanisms require increasing amounts of time. (2.5) Processes on the level of ecosystems, with species interactions, may involve various time scales. Besides competition and facilitation, nitrogen fixation is discussed. (3) The minor fluctuations of temperature during the Late-Glacial Interstadial, which are recorded in delta O-18, resulted in only very minor changes in pollen during the Aegelsee Oscillation (Older Dryas biozone, GI-1d) and the Gerzensee Oscillation (GI-1b). (4) Biodiversity: The afforestation at the onset of Bolling coincided with a gradual increase of taxonomic diversity up to the time of the major Pinus expansion. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Generally, there are two types of drinking water sources: the first type is surface waters, including lakes, rivers, and streams and the second type is groundwaters existing in aquifers. Amongst aquifers, karst aquifers play an important role in supplying water sources of the world. Therefore, protecting these aquifers from pollution sources is of paramount importance. COP method is amongst the methods to investigate the intrinsic vulnerability of this type of aquifers, so that areas susceptible to contamination can be determined before being contaminated and these sources can be protected. In the present study, COP method was employed in order to spot the regions that are prone to contamination in the region. This method uses the properties of overlying geological layers above the water table (0 factor), the concentration of flow (C factor), and precipitation (P factor) over the aquifer, as the parameters to assess the intrinsic vulnerability of groundwater resources. In this regard, geographical information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) were utilized to prepare the mentioned factors and the intrinsic vulnerability map was obtained. The results of COP method indicated that the northwest and the west of the region are highly and very vulnerable. This study indicated that regions with low vulnerability were observed in eastern areas, which accounted for 15.6% of the area. Moderate vulnerability was 40% and related to the northeast and southeast of the area. High vulnerability was 38.2% and related to western and southwestern regions. Very high vulnerability was 6.2% and related to the northwest of the area. By means of the analysis of sensitivity of the model, it was determined that the focus factor of the flow has the greatest impact on the creation of vulnerability in the region. Also, these results were validated through electrical conductivity and discharge time series of the regional springs that are located in the vulnerable zones.					; Oliveri Conti, Gea/N-4034-2016; kalantari, nasrollah/AAI-8903-2021; Derakhshan, Zahra/AAG-2767-2021; Ferrante, Margherita/B-2781-2011	Derakhshan, Zahra/0000-0003-1920-3011; Oliveri Conti, Gea/0000-0003-1857-8612; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				JUL	2018	25	19					18960	18979		10.1007/s11356-018-1911-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-1911-8								29721789					WOS:000437264700068

Tectonic and climatic controls on fan systems: The Kohrud mountain belt, Central Iran	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Late Pleistocene to Holocene fans of the Kohrud mountain belt (Central Iran) illustrate the problems of differentiating tectonic and climatic drivers for the sedimentary signatures of alluvial fan successions. It is widely recognised that tectonic processes create the topography that causes fan development. The existence and position of fans along the Kohrud mountain belt, NE of Esfahan, are controlled by faulting along the Qom-Zefreh fault system and associated fault zones. These faults display moderate amounts of historical and instrumental seismicity, and so may be considered to be tectonically active. However, fluvial systems on the fans are currently incising in response to low Gavkhoni playa lake levels since the mid-Holocene, producing incised gullies on the fans up to 30 m deep. These gullies expose an interdigitation of lake deposits (dominated by fine-grained silts and clays with evaporites) and coarse gravels that characterise the alluvial fan sediments. The boundaries of each facies are mostly sharp, with fan sediments superimposed on lake sediments with little to no evidence of reworking. In turn, anhydrite-glauberite, mirabilite and halite crusts drape over the gravels, recording a rapid return to still water, shallow ephemeral saline lake sedimentation. Neither transition can be explained by adjustment of the hinterland drainage system after tectonic uplift. The potential influence in Central Iran of enhanced monsoons, the northward drift of the Intertopical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and Mediterranean climates for the early Holocene (similar to 6-10 ka) point to episodic rainfall (during winter months) associated with discrete high magnitude floods on the fan surfaces. The fan sediments were deposited under the general influence of a highstand playa lake whose level was fluctuating in response to climate. This study demonstrates that although tectonism can induce fan development, it is the sensitive balance between aridity and humidity resulting from changes in the climate regime of Central Iran that influences the nature of fan sequences and how they interrelate to associated facies.

J	Perret-Gentil, N; Rey, F; Gobet, E; Tinner, W; Heiri, O				Perret-Gentil, Nina; Rey, Fabian; Gobet, Erika; Tinner, Willy; Heiri, Oliver			Human impact leads to unexpected oligotrophication and deepwater oxygen increase in a Swiss mountain lake	HOLOCENE												Human impacts on lakes can lead to nutrient release, increased algal productivity and consequently low oxygen concentrations in deepwater environments. Here we report the unexpected and contrasting finding of a pronounced shift to chironomid and invertebrate assemblages suggesting oligotrophication and oxygen increase in Lac de Champex, a Swiss mountain lake, due to human activities during the Mediaeval period. Chironomid assemblages in the lower part of the lake sediment record show changes that agree with known climatic shifts during the Lateglacial period and early Holocene and a progressively stronger influence of peat development, and possibly humic conditions, from ca. 8500 calibrated 14C years BP (cal. BP) onwards. This resulted in low chironomid influx and assemblages with high abundances of Procladius and Chaoborus ca. 2000-3000 cal. BP. These assemblages resemble those found in relatively nutrient-rich, oxygen-poor lakes and may have developed due to natural, long-term development to more nutrient-rich and possibly humic conditions, and from the Bronze Age (ca. 4000 cal. BP) onwards, due to human activities such as pasturing. Ca. 1000 cal. BP, an abrupt increase in sediment accumulation, chironomid influx and distinct changes in the chironomid assemblage composition were observed, coinciding with evidence for local human activities from pollen data. A major transition in chironomid and invertebrate assemblages followed ca. 500 cal. BP with the disappearance of Chaoborus, a decrease in Procladius, and the increase or appearance of several chironomid taxa, including several rheophilous groups. We conclude that Late-Holocene human impact led to re-oligotrophication and increased oxygen availability for invertebrates in the lake. This reversal of the long-term Holocene trend was possibly promoted by increased erosion from the Mediaeval period onwards and from ca. 500 cal. BP likely by the construction of an irrigation canal (bisse), leading to inflow of clear, cool water which changed the lake's hydrological characteristics.					; Tinner, Willy/F-6727-2013; Heiri, Oliver/JCE-4598-2023	Rey, Fabian/0000-0002-0737-3921; Heiri, Oliver/0000-0002-3957-5835; Tinner, Willy/0000-0001-7352-0144; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				FEB	2024	34	2					189	201		10.1177/09596836231211821	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836231211821		DEC 2023											WOS:001113053600001
J	Partanen, SB; Apell, JN; Lin, JM; McNeill, K				Partanen, Sarah B.; Apell, Jennifer N.; Lin, Jianming; McNeill, Kristopher			Factors affecting the mixed-layer concentrations of singlet oxygen in sunlit lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS												The steady-state concentration of singlet oxygen within a lake ([O-1(2)](SS)) is an important parameter that can affect the environmental half-life of pollutants and environmental fate modelling. However, values of [O-1(2)](SS) are often determined for the near-surface of a lake, and these values typically do not represent the average over the epilimnia of lakes. In this work, the environmental and physical factors that have the largest impact on [O-1(2)](SS) within lake epilimnia were identified. It was found that the depth of the epilimnion has the largest impact on depth-averaged [O-1(2)](SS), with a factor of 8.8 decrease in [O-1(2)](SS) when epilimnion depth increases from 2 m to 20 m. The next most important factors are the wavelength-dependent singlet oxygen quantum yield relationship and the latitude of the lake, causing variations in [O-1(2)](SS) by factors of 3.2 and 2.5 respectively, over ranges of representative values. For a set of representative parameters, the depth-averaged value of [O-1(2)](SS) within an average epilimnion depth of 9.0 m was found to be 5.8 x 10(-16) M and the near-surface value of [O-1(2)](SS) was found to be 1.9 x 10(-14) M. We recommend a range of 6 x 10(-17) to 5 x 10(-15) M as being more representative of [O-1(2)](SS) values within the epilimnia of lakes globally and potentially more useful for estimating pollutant lifetimes than those calculated using [O-1(2)](SS) values that correspond to near-surface, summer midday values. This work advances our understanding of [O-1(2)](SS) inter-lake variability in the environment, and provides estimates of [O-1(2)](SS) for practitioners and researchers to assess environmental half-lives of pollutants due to reaction with singlet oxygen.

J	MacKenzie, RA; Kaster, JL; Klump, JV				MacKenzie, RA; Kaster, JL; Klump, JV			The ecological patterns of benthic invertebrates in a Great Lakes coastal wetland	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled in the summer of 1997 using a standard D frame kick net along a transect across the Peshtigo wetland, a river delta wetland on the coast of Green Bay, Lake Michigan, to describe the spatial and temporal dynamics of the invertebrate community. Various abiotic factors, including sedimentation rates determined from Pb-210 and Cs-137 as a proxy for delivery of riverine organic matter, were also measured to determine which factors influenced these dynamics. Significant decreasing gradients in dissolved oxygen and pH with distance from the river, coupled with trends in sedimentation rates, chloride, and sum nitrate (nitrate + nitrite), revealed that riverine water was mixing with wetland water up to 100 in from the wetland-river interface. Aboveground primary production and total invertebrate densities exhibited Weibull type distributions, with highest rates and numbers occurring 20 to 100 in from the Peshtigo River. Invertebrate densities were largely represented by Asellus sp. isopods (12-53%) and exhibited highest numbers in September. Invertebrate diversity at the genus level linearly decreased with distance from the river based on the Simpson's index of diversity (r(2) = 0.60, p < 0.05) and the Shannon- Wiener function (r(2) = 0.73, p < 0.01). Patterns observed suggest that there is an "optimal" zone for benthic invertebrates in the Peshtigo wetland 20 to 60 m from the Peshtigo River that is protected from high-energy events (e.g., storms, boating) in the Peshtigo wetland by a buffer zone (0 to 20 in) but is close enough to benefit from replenished levels of dissolved oxygen, nutrients, and organic matter delivered via the Peshtigo River.																			0380-1330						2004	30	1					58	69		10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70329-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70329-9													WOS:000220858500006

As a step toward the development of such a system, 15 physical-chemical variables from 34 stream stations in North America and Europe were subjected to cluster and discriminant analyses to determine if discrete groupings were present and, if so, which variables were most closely related to the among-group variability. The log transformed data provided 5 meaningful clusters of stream sites. Further interpretation of the canonical discriminant axes revealed that the 1st variable accounts for 83.5% of the among-group variability: high positive correlations (> 0.7) were observed with watershed area, phosphate concentration, total dissolved solids and solar radiation; high negative correlations (> -0.6) with annual precipitation, the ratio of stream length to watershed area, and terrestrial litter input. The 2nd canonical variable accounts for an additional 9.8% of the among-group variability and has high positive correlations with temperature fluctuation and nitrate concentration. The 3rd canonical variable accounts for only 4.8% of the among-group variability and has a high positive correlation with summer base flow. It may not be presently possible to construct a simple and universally useful classification of running waters which includes physical, chemical and biological aspects. Inclusion of biological variables is necessary to further assess the usefulness of the approach described.																			0003-9136						1980	89	3					343	352																WOS:A1980KG63800004
J	Jassby, AD				Jassby, AD			Interannual variability at three inland water sites: Implications for sentinel ecosystems	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS					Workshop on Ecological Resource Monitoring - Change and Trend Detection	MAY 01-03, 1996	LAUREL, MD	Sustainable Biosphere Initiat, Ecol Soc Amer, Ecol Soc Amer, Stat Ecol Sect, Amer Stat Assoc, Stat & Environ Sect				In the sentinel-site approach to monitoring ecological resources, relatively small numbers of locations are chosen for intensive study, each location being selected to represent a certain, preferably large, class of ecosystems. This paper examines long-term studies at three inland aquatic ecosystems in California that, although never intended as sentinel sites, nevertheless illustrate the challenges posed by sentinel-site networks. The main mechanisms of interannual variability in primary productivity or producers are described for Castle Lake, Lake Tahoe, and northern San Francisco Bay. The external forces behind the variability include climate (in the form of both snowfall and total precipitation), fishing intensity, anthropogenic nitrogen emissions, spring weather systems, intrinsic population cycles, forest fires, water diversions, and invasions of exotics. Each mechanism is associated with certain critical ecosystem features (such as hydraulic residence time) that condition a responsiveness to one or a combination of these external forces (such as precipitation); these critical features are identified for each mechanism. Three demanding conditions must be fulfilled in order for a sentinel site to function with regard to a given stressor: (1) some subset of the network must encounter the stressor; (2) at least some sites in the subset must have the critical features that cause responsiveness to that stressor; and (3) the background variability at those sites must not disguise the response to the stressor of interest. In practice, reliable extrapolation from sentinel-site networks to regional trends appears to be beyond our ecological understanding at the present time.																			1051-0761					MAY	1998	8	2					277	287																WOS:000073447900007

Nine extreme floods have occurred over 8400 years in a non-stationary series, the youngest five of which are stationary, and the youngest three of which occurred during wet periods produced by variations of the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) modulated by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The magnitudes of these floods are similar, with one possible exception (in 2007 CE). The extreme floods in the region lie close to, or above, the Australian flood envelope curve showing that floods larger than the expected are possible. Their magnitudes also approximate the Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) but with a much higher frequency than expected. The annual exceedance probability (AEP) of the palaeofloods is 0.3%, which may also be the AEP for the rainfall. These results will be used as input to the design of an artificial landform at the Ranger uranium mine, within the East Alligator catchment, that has to last for 10,000 years. The 2007 CE flood was probably the most extreme flood (and associated rainfall) likely to occur in the vicinity of Ranger under the current climate and will occur in the future along with climate change. Because of the uncertainties associated with projections of future extremes the best design rainfall AEP for the Ranger landform is 0.3%. Crown Copyright (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Considering that climate change affects snow accumulation and glacial melting, it is essential to understand the runoff generation and hydrological dynamics in these type of systems. Andean glaciers have shown a retreating and thinning pattern since the start of the 21st century. Regarding this, the stable isotopic composition of waters is useful to assess the contributions from different sources (i.e., glaciers, precipitation, and tributaries' inputs) to rivers. Several Patagonian mountain rivers have Andean glaciers in their headwaters, one of which is the Manso River. In this basin, over the last 30 years, the Ventisquero Negro Glacier (Manso Glacier's regenerated tongue) experienced a rapid thinning and recession that generated a proglacial lake, called Manso proglacial Lake. In this study, topographic effects upon the stable isotopic composition of river waters (delta H-2 and delta O-18) are recognized, particularly, the altitude effect. The stable isotope composition of the Manso River varies downstream, evolving to a composition more enriched in heavy isotopes in the lower basin, likely due to altitude effects and the progressive evaporation that mainly occurs in the lakes' surfaces that the river crosses. Results show that glacial meltwater is the major water contributor in the upper basin during early fall. In the rest of the basin the stable isotopic composition of the Manso River is mainly controlled by the lakes' isotopic signatures and is highly influenced by two tributary rivers. The concordance between isotopic models and hydrological data demonstrates that stable isotopes constitute a valuable tool to quantify the contribution of different water sources. This has the potential to be particularly useful in areas where discharge data is unavailable.					; Lecomte, Karina/KHD-3796-2024; Temporetti, Pedro/IUO-8407-2023; Martin, M.

Nutrient enrichment in the High Arctic associated with Thule Inuit whalers: a paleolimnological investigation from Ellesmere Island (Nunavut, Canada)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Cultural eutrophication is one of several environmental stressors that represents a significant ecological threat as the human population continues to grow and encroach on aquatic ecosystems. However, until recently, the environmental impacts of ancient human populations that had low population densities were thought to be largely insignificant relative to those of post-industrial urban society. Based on paleolimnological and archeological data, we have shown that Thule Inuit whalers living in small, nomadic communities were altering High Arctic pond ecology centuries before industrialization. Changes in diatom species assemblage and spectrally inferred aquatic primary production indicate a period of increased production in a pond (E-Knud) on Knud Peninsula, Ellesmere Island, which can be linked to the effects of the Thule from about 810-340 years ago. This site is near the northernmost region of past Thule occupation. Input of nutrients from bowhead whale carcasses, used by the Thule Inuit for sustenance and the construction of winter settlements, as well as other Thule activities (e.g., sealing, human waste, etc.), resulted in an increase in delta N-15, which coincided with ecologically significant diatom abundance changes, including an increase in Amphora ovalis. Diatom and nutrient changes also coincided with increased primary aquatic production, as measured by spectrally inferred chlorophyll a concentration. In addition, we recorded relative increases in diatom taxa such as Craticula halophila and Achnanthidum minutissimum in the more recent sediments, which we attribute to recent climate warming, manifested by lower water levels and associated evapo-concentration. Specific conductivities recorded during three sampling years (2004, 2006, 2009) show a trend of increasing conductivity in pond E-Knud in response to declining water levels. Together these changes in diatom species abundance suggest that multiple environmental stressors, operating several centuries apart, have led to marked limnological changes in E-Knud pond.

Turning back the effects of anthropopression demands taking immediate action not only within the lake basin in the form of technological remediation measures. Primarily, these should be protective action, involving the organization of water supply and sewage disposal in the basin and (which is much more difficult) reduction of biogenic substance flow to the lake. Remediation ventures have been applied throughout the world, not always with success. They are thought to be risky, long-term and demanding considerable financial outlays. For this reason, they must be carefully planned by a team of experts and conducted under permanent supervision. These conditions were not fully met in the case of Lake Gleboczek, whose remediation brought only a slight and, unfortunately, short-lived improvement. The aim of the study carried out was to estimate the sanitary state of waters in Lake Gleboczek on the basis of selected groups of microorganisms. In terms of microbiological gauges of the water of the lake Gleboczek didn't exceed permissible values, according to Dz.U.Nr 183/2002, poz. 1530.

These relic shorelines provide direct geomorphic record to reconstruct past lake level fluctuation history and water volume changes, linked closely to variations in paleo-climatic controls including Asian monsoon, westerlies and glacial meltwater. In this study, 27 near-shore sediment samples from three of eight paleo-shorelines at north of Nam Co were dated by Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) technique, using coarse grains of quartz and potassium feldspar. Our results indicate that: 1) S1 is the highest/most developed shoreline (+26 m). Sediment from upper part of S1 has a consistent age of similar to 25 ka (nine samples from 3 gullies), suggesting a high lake level of Nam Co occurred around 25 ka. An overflow point west of Nam Co has a close elevation to that of S1 and thus limits the presence of higher lake levels; 2) sediment profile from the slightly lower S2 (+22 m) contains two parts, silty sand (6.9-8.9 ka) at the bottom and shoreline deposits atop (similar to 2.3 ka), suggesting Nam Co maintained a relative high lake level in the early Holocene and such lake level occurred again at about 3.0-2.0 ka; 3) In contrast to the swift variations of monsoon precipitation and glacial meltwater in the late Quaternary, water level of Nam Co remained relatively stable during the period from similar to 25 ka to about early Holocene (from +26 m to +22 m), implying a continuous outflowing stage and lake infill constantly exceeds evaporation; 4) S5 (+11 m) has an age of 0.7-1.4 ka. Nam Co showed a much accelerated pace of shrinkage since about 2.0 ka in the late Holocene in roughly two steps: it dropped from +22 m to +11 m from similar to 2.0 ka to 1.4 ka, and subsequently dropped another 11 m after 0.7 ka.

Species Diversity and Driving Factors of Benthic and Zooplanktonic Assemblages at Different Stages of Thermokarst Lake Development: A Case Study in the Lena River Delta (Middle Siberia)	DIVERSITY-BASEL												Global climate change might result in permafrost thaw and the formation of thermokarst landscapes that release long-term carbon stocks as greenhouse into the atmosphere, thereby initiating a positive climate feedback. These processes are mediated by biological activity, including by microbes, vascular plants and animals, whereas the role of invertebrates in thermokarst ecosystems remains poorly understood. We investigated the diversity and assemblage structures of zooplankton (mainly Copepoda, Cladocera), microbenthos (testate amoebae) and meio- (Copepoda and Cladocera) and macrozoobenthos (mollusks, crustaceans, insects and annelids) from a range of water bodies representing different stages of thermokarst lake formation in the southern part of the Lena River Delta (Central Siberia). Altogether, 206 species of testate amoeba, mollusk, crustacean, insect and annelid taxa were identified. A total of 60 species of macrozoobenthos (mainly insects) and 62 species of testate amoebae were detected in the water bodies of the Lena River Delta for the first time. The species richness of zooplankton and meio- and macrozoobenthos was greater in the large thermokarst lakes than in the polygonal ponds due to the freezing of the latter in the winter. In contrast, the species richness of protists was higher in the polygonal ponds, which was related to the habitat preferences of testate amoebae. Fish grazing strongly affected the macrobenthos assemblages but not the smaller-sized organisms. Water acidity and temperature were the main environmental drivers of the assemblage structure of testate amoeba and microcrustacean. The species structure of the macroinvertebrate assemblages was significantly explained by water acidity, permafrost depth and size of the water area. It means that small size organisms with their short generation times are sensitive to more dynamic factors such as temperature and may serve as indicators of ecosystem changes due to global climate warming. In contrast, large size organisms are affected by driven factors that appear during thermokarst lakes formation and permafrost degradation.

We also examined the shape of those relationships to identify discontinuity thresholds where small changes in landscape character were associated with marked shifts in the fish assemblages. After completing a geographic analysis of second- and third-order watersheds in the western Lake Superior drainage, we randomly selected 48 streams along mature forest and watershed storage gradients in 2 hydrogeomorphic regions as our study sites. During the summers of 1997 and 1998, we used electrofishing to sample fish assemblages from each stream. Each of the landscape factors was significantly associated with fish assemblage structure and function based on analysis of covariance. Watershed storage was related to the greatest number of fish assemblage characteristics, but hydrogeopmorphic region and mature forest cover were strongly associated as well. The hydrogeomorphic region also mediated relationships between watershed character and fish assemblages. Discontinuity thresholds for our fish assemblages averaged 11% for watershed storage and 50% for watershed mature forest cover based on piecewise regression analysis. Although many of the landscape-fish relationships might have been manifest through effects on in-stream habitat, our results highlight the importance of management and land-use planning decisions at the watershed and landscape scales.																			0364-152X					JUN	2004	33	6					855	875		10.1007/s00267-004-3031-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-004-3031-0								15517683					WOS:000223464700008
J	Prasad, KVR; Ghosh, M; Gaur, JP				Prasad, KVR; Ghosh, M; Gaur, JP			A reconnaissance of species-environment relationships in pond phytoplankton at Varanasi (India)	BIOLOGIA												A survey of summer phytoplankton assemblages of 15 ponds at Varanasi (India) revealed the significance of pH and nutrient ratios for the structure of the assemblage. Definite relationships between various nutrient ratios and distribution of phytoplankton groups emerged out of this study. The cyanophytes mainly dominated ponds with a high pH and an inorganic N:P ratio less than 11:1 suggesting their being superior ill competitors, whereas low pH and high N:P ratio generally favoured the chlorophytes and diatoms. Euglenophyte abundance was associated with high levels of ammonia and organic matter. Despite the high Si:P ratio in the study ponds, diatoms seldom assumed dominance except for some macrophyte-covered ponds due probably to nitrogen limitation. The macrophyte-covered ponds had low algal biomass and were dominated by green algae and diatoms. Canonical correspondence analysis clearly elucidated the preference of cyanophytes to high pH and low nitrate-nitrogen and of chlorophytes to high phosphate, nitrate and low pH. The broad range of N:P ratio in the study ponds indicates both N and P limitation with different species becoming dominant at different ratios. The most commonly occurring species were Microcystis aeruginosa and Chlorella vulgaris, with the former attaining maximal biomass in a pond with N:P ratio of 9:1. The latter species, however, occurred over a wider range of N:P ratio.																			0006-3088	1336-9563				FEB	2000	55	1					35	42																WOS:000086347200003

Material and methods Water samples were collected from seven stations selected on the reservoir monthly in 2018-2019 and total of 28 water quality parameters were measured in water samples. WQI was used for evaluating the water quality by using the parameters of pH, EC, Cl, NO2, NO3, SO4, Na, Pb, Cu, Cd, Hg, Ni, Zn, and PCA was used for evaluating the water quality by using the variables of pH, BOD, EC, salinity, dissolved oxygen, total hardness, temperature, total alkalinity, Hg, Ca, NO3, NO2, NH4, SO4, Mg, Ca, Fe, Ni, Cl, Zn, Cd, S, Na, K, Pb, Cu. Results and conclusions According to data observed, water of the Yassialan Dam Lake has 1st - 2nd Class water quality in general and according to the results of WQI, although it was determined that the water quality decreased significantly in summer period, the reservoir was found as "A Grade - Excellent" water quality (<50) in all the investigated months and at all the investigated stations. WQI values recorded in the dam lake were found as 15.3 - 26.1 and the detected limnologic parameters did not exceed the specified drinking water standards in all the investigated months and at all the investigated stations. According to the results of PCA, 3 factors explained 84.2% of total variances.

J	Xu, XD; Dong, LL; Zhao, Y; Wang, YJ				Xu, Xiangde; Dong, Lili; Zhao, Yang; Wang, Yinjun			Effect of the Asian Water Tower over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the characteristics of atmospheric water circulation	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE												From the perspective of regional and global atmospheric moisture circulation, this paper summarizes the unique thermal and dynamic mechanisms present in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) and their effects on the formation of the Asian Water Tower, which provides a theoretical basis for characterizing its atmospheric moisture circulation and global influence. The results show that the mechanisms of atmospheric moisture circulation in the QTP not only reflects the interaction between westerly and monsoon moisture flow but also highlight that the QTP is a key area for global and inter-hemispheric exchanges of energy and moisture. With a comprehensive dynamic analysis of the three-dimensional structure of the wind field based on apparent heat source calculations and the stream function, we revealed that the powerful ground radiation heating and the atmospheric heat source in the QTP lead to a hollow "heat island" and "wet island" in the middle troposphere. Driven by thermal forcing, a typhoon-like self-excited feedback dynamic structure with high and low circulation systems that occur in opposite directions occur over the plateau, which drive the convergence and pumping of atmospheric vapor over the Asian Water Tower. The vector field analysis of the water vapor flux also showed that the QTP can continuously capture water vapor from tropical areas at low latitudes, and its source area extends from the subtropical Indian subcontinent to the Bay of Bengal in the tropics, and it even crosses the equator into the southern hemisphere. In view of the frequent convection and abnormal cloud precipitation over the roof of the world, the large eddy simulation further revealed the unique trigger effect of the low air density on the convective clouds. We propose that the structure of atmospheric moisture circulation under the thermal drive of the QTP can be regarded as a global atmospheric water tower. According to a comprehensive analysis of the three-dimensional dynamic and thermodynamic structures, this atmospheric moisture circulation supplies the water storage in the Asian Water Tower over the QTP. This occurs, in particular, over the plateau glaciers, snowpacks, and lakes as a reservoir with a downstream outward pipeline of rivers from the plateau. With the synergy of westerlies and monsoons, the interaction of the low-latitude ocean with plateau glaciers, lakes, rivers, and the atmosphere can construct a special system of a global ocean and air, land, and hydrological processes with the core area in the QTP. A physical picture of the land-sea-air interaction is suggested for the Asian Water Tower over the QTP.																			0023-074X	2095-9419					2019	64	27					2830	2841		10.1360/TB-2019-0203	http://dx.doi.org/10.1360/TB-2019-0203													WOS:000496463900009

Assessment of phosphorus-microbe interactions in Lake Ontario by multiple techniques	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Conventional and newly-developed techniques to determine the phosphorus (P) status of Lake Ontario phytoplankton were employed in September 2003, immediately after the passage of the storm system associated with Hurricane Isabel. Surface water (1-5 m) was collected at 29 stations, with selected stations sampled throughout the water column. Chemical estimates of total P concentrations were compared with proxies of P bioavailability: P enrichment bioassays of lake water, alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), and P-dependent bioreporter assays. Average total P (314 nM) and total chlorophyll-a (2.12 mu g/L) concentrations measured in pelagic surface waters from throughout Lake Ontario suggest an oligotrophic status prevailed across much of this lake during the sample period. Autotrophic picoplankton (0.2-2 pm) displayed the highest growth rates and were grazed at the highest rate, whereas P-enrichment bioassays favored the production of autotrophic nanoplankton (2-20 mu m) and autotrophic microplankton (> 20 mu m) biomass. Average concentrations of bacteria (2.61 X 10(10) cells/L) were higher than those measured during summer in a similar lake (Erie), whereas the average viral density (1.38 x 10(10) virus particles/L) was similar. Pelagic stations exhibited higher APA than coastal stations; cyanobacterial bioreporter responses did not show high correlation with APA suggesting that proxies of P-demand based on residual effects (e.g., enzyme production) were not indicative of shorter-term biological responses related to planktonic growth (bioreporter genetic response). The combination of traditional chemical, biochemical (APA), and cutting-edge biological methods (bioreporter) provided information on nutrient concentrations and primary productivity throughout Lake Ontario, while concurrently allowing real-time assessment of P bioavailability.					; Wilhelm, Steven/B-8963-2008; Bullerjahn, George/F-4428-2010	Bullerjahn, George/0000-0001-5319-7896; Wilhelm, Steven/0000-0001-6283-8077; 													0380-1330						2006	32	3					455	470		10.3394/0380-1330(2006)32[455:AOPIIL]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2006)32[455:AOPIIL]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000241299100006

Tundra lakes dynamics is a robust indicator of global climate processes, and is still not well understood. Satellite data, particularly, from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a suitable tool for tundra lakes recognition and monitoring of their changes. However, manual analysis of lake boundaries can be slow and inefficient; therefore, reliable automated algorithms are required. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage approach, comprising instance deep-learning-based segmentation by U-Net, followed by semantic segmentation based on a watershed algorithm for separating touching and overlapping lakes. Implementation of this concept is essential for accurate sizes and shapes estimation of an individual lake. Here, we evaluated the performance of the proposed approach on lakes, manually extracted from tens of C-band SAR images from Sentinel-1, which were collected in the Yamal Peninsula and Alaska areas in the summer months of 2015-2022. An accuracy of 0.73, in terms of the Jaccard similarity index, was achieved. The lake's perimeter, area and fractal sizes were estimated, based on the algorithm framework output from hundreds of SAR images. It was recognized as lognormal distributed. The evaluation of the results indicated the efficiency of the proposed approach for accurate automatic estimation of tundra lake shapes and sizes, and its potential to be used for further studies on tundra lake dynamics, in the context of global climate change, aimed at revealing new factors that could cause the planet to warm or cool.

In an effort to quantify key aspects of ecosystem function of D. geminata mats in Patagonia, we describe for the first time photosynthesis-irradiance (P-E) curves of this species, associated P-E parameters (R, P-max and alpha) and their relationship to other functional (alkaline phosphatase activity [APA] enzyme activity and chlorophyll a) and environmental variables (soluble reactive and organic phosphorous, electrical conductivity). Mats of D. geminata from lakes and rivers representing east and west sides of the Andes from 40 degrees S to 46 degrees S (i.e. much of current known distribution) varied mostly in the a and Pmax parameters of P-E curves. Southern systems showed a higher a and lower Pmax parameters than more northern sites on the east slope of the cordillera. None of the P-E curves showed photoinhibition. P-E parameters for the two lakes fell within the range of values for riverine mats; although, soluble reactive P was notably higher in the lakes. We used two different statistical approaches to evaluate associations across environmental, functional or P-E parameters, finding a strong relation between APA and Pmax and a weak one between soluble reactive phosphorus, pH, dissolved organic phosphorus and functional parameters. Our results do not contradict previous observations on the importance of P availability in communities of D. geminata; although the variability in response across P-E parameters suggests a more complex mechanism of regulation than implied in the existing literature.					; GonzalezPolo, Marina/KFR-2509-2024; Torres, Rodrigo/J-8442-2019	Torres, Rodrigo/0000-0003-0416-4291; Baffico, Gustavo D./0000-0002-6178-3542; 													0031-8884	2330-2968					2016	55	2					118	125		10.2216/15-83.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2216/15-83.1													WOS:000372601000002

This paper identifies the positive (POL+) and negative (POL-) phases of the POL pattern through applying a novel approach, i.e., self-organizing maps, to daily 500-hPa geopotential height fields in May over 1948-2017. The POL+, POL1(-), and POL2(-) patterns defined by this method represent actual physical modes. The POL+ pattern features a wave train from the northeastern Atlantic/northern Europe via the subarctic regions of Eurasia to Lake Baikal. The POL1(-) pattern is characterized by a planetary-scale dipole pattern with a positive anomaly band over subarctic Eurasia and a negative anomaly band from central Asia to the Sea of Okhotsk. The anomaly centers of the POL2(-) pattern are basically anti-symmetrical to those of the POL+ pattern. The POL+ pattern increases the blocking frequency over the northeastern Atlantic/northern Europe and northeastern Asia, where high-frequency transient eddies are highly recurrent in the north. Accordingly, precipitation increases apparently in the subarctic Asian continent and western Siberia, and decreases around Europe and Lake Baikal. A mimic wave train is also observed in the surface air temperature anomaly field. During the POL1(-) period, the blocking frequency is abnormally high over Eurasia, whereas high-frequency transient eddies are apparently suppressed over northern Eurasia. Correspondingly, significant precipitation deficits are observed in northern Eurasia. The POL1(-) pattern also causes a remarkable temperature increase in the subarctic seas of Eurasia and a considerable temperature drop in the midlatitude Asian continent. As the POL2(-) pattern prevails, the blocking frequency decreases over the North Atlantic/Europe but strengthens over the Asian continent. The POL2(-) pattern also causes wavelike anomalies of precipitation and surface air temperature over northern Eurasia.

This study aims to identify the main factors that influence the flooding process of the remaining gaps of open-pits comprising essentially the velocity and duration of flooding, but also the stability of in situ and dump slopes during and after the flooding and the water quality in order to ensure the takeover of the future function of the land as soon as possible and the safety of objects and local communities. Methods. Establishing the three categories of factors that influence from a quantitative and qualitative point of view the flooding of the remaining gaps of the open pits. Analysis of the key factors in the flooding process of the remaining gaps, in terms of their contribution to reducing or increasing the flood duration and to reducing or increasing the stability reserve of different types of slopes. Findings. The interdependence and cumulative action of factors that influence the flooding process of remaining gaps and the stability of in situ and dump slopes materializes in worsening the strength characteristics of rocks and changing the state of stress and deformations in the rock mass. Originality. The paper provides a detailed description of the key factors and the interactions between these and their influence on the flooding process, stability, and the factor of safety. Their influence and interactions are highlighted through a case study conducted at the Pesteana mining perimeter level. Practical implications. The flooding of the remaining gaps can cause loss of slope stability during and after the flooding process. Unexpected geotechnical phenomena such as landslides, liquefaction, suffosis, rock falls and/or the water quality of the pit lake can be hazardous to natural and/or anthropic objects and local communities. Safety is essential. Therefore, this study suggests taking into account the most important factors that influence the flooding process when evaluating the flooding possibility of remaining gaps. Engineers, researchers, mine planers, local authorities, and students will have essential information and will know when and where special attention will be needed in the case of flooding of former open- pits.					; Florin, Faur/Q-5953-2019; Apostu, Izabela - Maria/ITU-7837-2023; Lazar, Maria/L-4901-2019	Apostu, Izabela Maria/0000-0002-6456-6148; Lazar, Maria/0000-0003-2149-6415; Faur, Florin/0000-0002-0880-0913													2415-3435	2415-3443					2021	15	2					124	133		10.33271/mining15.02.124	http://dx.doi.org/10.33271/mining15.02.124													WOS:000659332800015

In contrast, interspecific hybrids (P. glaucus mother x P. canadensis father) had significant adult eclosion or pupal survival at both 30degrees and 36degreesC. All surviving hybrid pupae were only females (the heterogametic sex, which are known to express the prolonged diapause due to Haldane effects). The southern species, P. troilus, had almost all (81%) normal (non-deformed) adults eclose at 30degreesC, whereas only 20% of the A canadensis females and ca 30% or the A canadensis males eclosed to produce non-deformed adults. Unlike the case with P. troilus and P. canadensis, no hybrid females eclosed at 30degreesC (only males did). Unlike P. troilus and P. canadensis pupae, hybrid (female) pupae remain viable, some of which have already successfully emerged after the chamber experiments. A follow-up study using P. glaucus, P. canadensis (from Vermont), and their hybrids with more normal lower thermal regimes included (27degrees, 30degrees, 33degrees, and 36degreesC) again showed higher hybrid survival as uneclosed (living) pupae at 36degreesC.

Early Successional Forest Management on Private Lands as a Coupled Human and Natural System	FORESTS												Facilitating voluntary conservation on private lands is a crucial element of policies that seek to mitigate forest habitat loss and fragmentation around the world. Previous research emphasizes the role of social factors (e.g., landowner characteristics, economics) in forest management, but environmental outcomes of past management can also affect landowner decisions. Our objective was to evaluate how positive outcomes for wildlife and habitat might reinforce or amplify landowner efforts to manage forest habitats. We applied the lens of coupled human and natural systems to investigate private lands management for early successional forests, which are declining along with associated wildlife in rural areas of the eastern U.S. Efforts to restore early successional forest in this region involve active forest management to create patches of successional forest in native, mature mixed hardwood stands. By integrating field-based monitoring of wildlife with surveys of landowner perceptions, we examined how landowners observed, interpreted, and responded to property-scale ecological outcomes of forest management. We recorded presence of Golden-winged Warbler (Vermivora chrysoptera) and American Woodcock (Scolopax minor) and estimated bird species richness in spring 2015 and/or 2016 on private properties located in the Appalachians (Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania) and Upper Great Lakes (Minnesota, Wisconsin). These properties were enrolled in early successional forest management programs administered through the Natural Resources Conservation Service. Bird surveys were paired with landowner responses to a telephone survey conducted from January to May 2017 (n = 102). Most (71.6-81.6%) landowners' perceptions of avian presence on their properties matched monitoring results. These perceptions were informed by personal observations and by outreach from agency partners and field technicians. Landowners who already completed their conservation program contracts (n = 85) continued managing early successional forests. Continued management for early successional habitat was positively associated with perceived benefits to birds, forest health, and scenery. Our findings give insight into how private landowners respond to environmental effects of forest management. We conclude that positive environmental outcomes of these conservation programs are related to continued early successional forest conservation by private landowners.					; Rodewald, Amanda/I-6308-2016	Dayer, Ashley/0000-0002-8105-0776; Rodewald, Amanda/0000-0002-6719-6306														1999-4907				JUN	2019	10	6							499	10.3390/f10060499	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f10060499													WOS:000475305000039

Assessment of Sulfate Sources under Cold Conditions as a Geochemical Proxy for the Origin of Sulfates in the Circumpolar Dunes on Mars	MINERALS												Determining aqueous sulfate sources in terrestrial cold environments can provide an insight into the surface hydrological conditions and sulfur cycle on Mars. In this study, we analyzed sulfur and oxygen isotope compositions of secondary sulfate salts (e.g., gypsum, thenardite) in the surficial sediments and soils of the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV), Antarctica to determine contributions of sulfate from bedrock chemical weathering and atmospheric deposition under persistent dry polar conditions. The sulfate showed wider variation of delta S-34 (+15.8 parts per thousand to +32.5 parts per thousand) compared to smaller ranges of delta O-18 (-8.9 parts per thousand to -4.1 parts per thousand). In contrast, the delta S-34 of bedrock sulfide showed significantly lower and consistent values across the studied area (-0.6 parts per thousand to +3.3 parts per thousand). Based on the delta S-34 trends, sulfide weathering may contribute up to 20-50% of secondary sulfate salts in the MDV. While the remaining 50-80% of sulfate inputs may originate from atmospheric deposition (e.g., sea aerosols, dimethulsulfide oxidation), the subglacial brines derived by relicts of seawater and/or lake/pond water influenced by microbial sulfate reduction could also be important sulfate endmembers particularly in the Antarctic lowland thaw zones. Additional field observations of frost, ponding water, and thin gypsum crusts on the terrestrial gypsum dunes at White Sands supports reactivity of gypsum on the surface of these dunes during cold winter conditions. Combined with our improved geochemical model of the sulfur cycle for cold Antarctic settings, we propose that transient liquid water or frost was available in near-surface environments at the time of gypsum formation in the north polar region on Mars. Ice and/or water interaction with basaltic sand of the basal unit (paleo-erg) would have enhanced leaching of sulfate from both sulfide oxidation and atmospheric deposition and resulted in formation of secondary gypsum salts.																				2075-163X				MAY	2021	11	5							507	10.3390/min11050507	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/min11050507													WOS:000662438500001

Use of an Incremental Triploid Grass Carp Stocking Strategy for Maintaining Vegetation Coverage in a Riverine Texas Reservoir	BALANCING FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND WATER USES FOR IMPOUNDED RIVER SYSTEMS	American Fisheries Society Symposium				4th North American Reservoir Symposium on Balancing Fisheries Management and Water Uses for Impounded River Systems	JUN 07-09, 2007	Atlanta, GA	Amer Fisheries Soc, SE Div Reservoir Comm				Lake Austin is a 648-ha riverine impoundment of the Colorado River located in central Texas and Supports a trophy (>= 5.9 kg minimum weight) largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides fishery. Much of the reservoir is bordered by waterfront homes and, in addition to largemouth bass anglers, also is used by recreational boaters. Aquatic vegetation management on this reservoir has been ail issue of concern since the 1950s. Parrot feather Myriophyllum aquaticum and Eurasian watermilfoil M. spicatum were the traditional species of concern but were Successfully controlled with winter drawdowns. In 1999, hydrilla Hydrilla verticillata (9 ha) was documented for the first time, and by 2002, coverage had expanded to 130 ha. A hydrilla management plan was developed by a multistakeholder group that included biological (including triploid grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella), mechanical, physical (reservoir drawdowns), and chemical management options. Of these options, most attention was given to the use of triploid grass carp. Many waterfront property owners viewed grass carp as the only reasonable solution, while largemouth bass angling groups vehemently opposed this management option. After much discussion, the stakeholder group decided that a slow methodical approach to triploid grass carp use, with a number of incremental stockings, might have a chance of successfully reducing hydrilla coverage without denuding the reservoir of all aquatic vegetation. The strategy was to increase the number of grass earl) slowly until there were just enough in the reservoir to control hydrilla but not so many as to eliminate less preferred plant species. After ail initial stocking in February 2003, the number of additional grass carp stocked was based on results of hydrilla coverage surveys conducted at 2-4-month intervals during the growing season. From February 2003 through November 2004, a total of 8,125 triploid grass earl) were stocked in six stockings. The number of grass carp per hectare of hydrilla ranged from 29.2 to 68.3 until coverage declined in December 2004 to 34 ha. From February 2005 to March 2007, hydrilla coverage ranged from only 1 to 27 ha (0.1-4.2% coverage) while other plant species less preferred by grass earl), primarily Eurasian watermilfoil expanded. As a result, mean total vegetation coverage from February 2005 to March 2007 was 17% and Continued to provide habitat for largemouth bass. Grass carp stockings were reinitiated in October 2006 when hydrilla coverage increased to 27 ha. In 2005 and 2006, the incremental stocking strategy implemented at Lake Austin appeared to help control hydrilla without denuding the reservoir of all aquatic vegetation. Cooperators and interest groups seemed satisfied With the strategy and results.																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-06-6				2008	62						543	+																WOS:000263597300035

Despite a growing number of ENSO reconstructions, the overall picture of Holocene ENSO variability is inconsistent. Here, we revisit the iconic Holocene ENSO sediment record of Lake Pallcacocha, Ecuador (Rodbell et al., 1999). We asked: (i) How coherent are the records of clastic layers (flood layers) in the sediments of Lake Pallcacocha and adjacent Lake Fondococha? (ii) What are the synoptic-scale atmospheric conditions that lead to intense precipitation and, potentially, to alluvial activity promoting the deposition of clastic layers in these lakes? (iii) Is intense precipitation in this area associated with El Nino, or not? We analyzed clastic layers in Late-Holocene sediments from multiple cores in Lakes Pallcacocha and Fondococha from Cajas National Park, southern Ecuadorian Andes. Additionally, we investigated precipitation data from 13 nearby meteorological stations to test if intense precipitation (percentiles P-0.95, P-0.99, P-0.995) is predominantly related to El Nino conditions or not (based on 15 different ENSO indices). Our results show that the absolute flood frequencies (clastic layers per 100 years) differ substantially from lake to lake. This indicates that the frequency of clastic layers reflects different sensitivities (thresholds of precipitation) of the catchments to alluvial activity. 210 Pb ages suggest that neither the 1982/83 nor the 1997/98 very strong El Ninos produced clastic layers comparable to those found in the late Holocene. Daily precipitation records from meteorological stations close to Lake Pallcacocha including a high-altitude station from the western slope of the Andes did not show unusually high precipitation during the super El Nino 2015/16. We further find that intense precipitation in this area occurs at roughly equal probability under El Nino, La Nina and neutral conditions. Although the spectral properties of the late Holocene clastic layers in Lake Pallcacocha fall into the typical ENSO frequency band, we do not find evidence in the recent sediments and the meteorological data that would support a diagnostic link between alluvial activity in Lake Pallcacocha and strong El Nino events. Our data do not support the idea that the (late) Holocene flood record of Lake Pallcacocha is a conclusive paleo-El Nino record.

Diversity of planktonic cyanobacteria and microcystin occurrence in Polish water bodies investigated using a polyphasic approach	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Microscopic measurements of fresh biomass and 16S rRNA gene sequences from clone libraries and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) were used to investigate cyanobacterial diversity in Polish water bodies in 2002. In addition, measurements of microcystin (MC) concentrations were made. Thirty water samples were taken from 11 water bodies; of these samples, 18 were obtained from the Sulejow Reservoir during regular monitoring from June to October. Intra- and extracellular MC concentrations in Sulejow samples were measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The extracellular MC concentration was assessed using a protein phosphatase inhibition assay (PPIA) in additional lakes. Additionally, physicochemical parameters were measured (total nitrogen [TN], total phosphorus [TP], TN:TP ratio, chlorophyll a concentration, temperature). In Sulejow, high intracellular MC concentrations corresponded to large cyanobacterial biovolumes and to low TN:TP ratios. In the other lakes, extracellular MCs were not linked to any measured parameters. The combination of the microscopic and molecular data showed that Aphanizomenon and Microcystis were the dominant genera during the summer period in the Sulejow Reservoir. At the genetic level, there was a succession of 2 different operational taxonomic units (OTUs) belonging to the lineage Anabaenal Aphanizomenon. In the other water bodies, the most frequent populations were Aphanizomenon, Anabaena, Microcystis and Planktothrix. Small populations of Romeria, Snowella, Woronichinia, Limnothrix and Pseudanabaena were observed, and an enigmatic cluster affiliated with Prochlorothrix was genetically retrieved. Anabaena and Microcystis were presumed to be the main genera responsible for the MC production.					; Komarkova, Jaroslava/G-1149-2014; Mankiewicz-Boczek, Joanna/J-2427-2018; Izydorczyk, Katarzyna/KHD-2599-2024; Wilmotte, Annick/H-1686-2011	Jurczak, Tomasz/0000-0002-1576-6741; Wilmotte, Annick/0000-0003-3546-3489; Zalewski, Maciej/0000-0002-4483-6200; Mankiewicz-Boczek, Joanna/0000-0001-7358-0673; Izydorczyk, Katarzyna/0000-0003-2056-2513; 													0948-3055					JUN 16	2008	51	3					223	236		10.3354/ame01194	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame01194													WOS:000257602400002

In this article we investigate primary aftershocks on the Calico-Blackwater and Harper fault zones, and triggered aftershocks in Indian Wells Valley (Little Lake fault zone) and the Coso Volcanic Field. These areas are directly northwest of the Landers rupture terminus and fall within the Southern Owens Valley Seismic Gap described by Hill et al. (1985). Focal mechanisms from selected events show dextral slip on northwest-trending faults similar to those that ruptured in the main Landers event. From the cumulative seismicity, we estimated the triggered seismicity rates from the Landers earthquake on the Little Lake fault zone (230 events in the first 10 days to 2.5 events/day during the following 5 months) and the Coso Volcanic Field (250 events in the first 10 days to 3.6 events/day during the following 5 months). Triggered seismicity in the Coso Volcanic Field may have been caused by advective gas overpressure. The continuity of aftershock data agree with a significant shear zone passing through the northern Mojave desert into the southern Owens Valley by way of the Harper fault, Little Lake fault zone, and Coso Volcanic Field. Geologic data (surface faults) also support structural continuity within the zone, with the exception of the Garlock fault.																			0037-1106					JUN	1994	84	3					854	862																WOS:A1994NQ99300031

As a result of effluent discharges by a chemical company manufacturing DDT on the Redstone Army Arsenal near Huntsville, Alabama, the water column, sediment, and biota of the Huntsville Spring Branch-Indian Creek stream system (HSB-IC) became heavily contaminated with DDT and its metabolites, DDE and DDD. Because DDT appeared to be the primary contaminant in the system, an investigation was begun to evaluate equilibrium partitioning theory (EqP) as a basis for predicting the free pore-water concentrations in and toxicity of DDT-contaminated sediments from the system. In 10-d laboratory, flow-through, water-only exposures with the amphipod Hyalella azteca, LC50 values of 0.07 (0.06-0.28), 1.66 (1.55-1.78), and 0. 19 (0.160. 41) mug/L were determined for p,p'-DDT, DDE, and DDD, respectively. Bulk sediment toxicity assays also were conducted with Hyalella azteca and pore waters analyzed for the p, p'- and o, p'-isomers of DDT, DDE, and DDD. Measured and EqP-predicted pore-water chemical concentrations generally agreed within one order of magnitude. Predicted or measured Hyalella azteca 10-d pore-water LC50 values for DDT and DDD also were similar to water-only LC50 values for Hyalella azteca. These data demonstrate an effect-based EqP prediction of the toxicity of field-collected sediments contaminated by a nonionic organic compound and the potential utility of the EqP approach for developing sediment quality criteria.					; Hoke, Robert/R-4155-2019	Hoke, Robert/0000-0002-3120-2882; 													0730-7268	1552-8618				JAN	1994	13	1					157	166		10.1002/etc.5620130121	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/etc.5620130121													WOS:A1994MP59500021

Acid Sensitivity of Lakes in Nova Scotia, Canada: Assessment of Lakes at Risk	ECOSYSTEMS												The sensitivity of surface waters to acidic deposition is governed by the interaction of catchment geology, soils, topography, land use, climate and atmospheric deposition. Accordingly at the landscape scale, catchment attributes may be used to predict lake chemistry (for example, acid neutralising capacity (ANC), pH, calcium (Ca2+) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC)). Empirical (multiple linear regression) models based on average measured chemistry (2000-2006) for 204 lakes in Nova Scotia (NS) Canada, and their catchment attributes, were used to predict chemistry for all lakes in NS (n = 6104). Damage to aquatic biota, such as loss of species and/or reduced biodiversity has been widely evaluated using critical chemical thresholds commonly based on pH, ANC and Ca2+. The proportion of sensitive lakes in NS (that is, the stock at risk) was estimated as lakes with ANC less than 20 mu eq l(-1), pH below 6, and Ca2+ less than 75 leq l(-1) (13, 73 and 74%, respectively). Many lakes in NS are characterized by high DOC (> 7 mg l(-1)); in these lakes organic acids contribute to total acidity, making anthropogenic influences difficult to discern. To account for the potential contribution of organic acidity, all lakes with pH below 6 (and DOC < 7 mg l(-1)) and lakes below a threshold for ANC adjusted for organic acids were quantified; 63% of the lakes fell below either of these thresholds. Despite substantial reductions in sulphur emissions in North America since the 1980s, many lakes in NS remain at risk to acidic deposition.																			1432-9840	1435-0629				DEC	2011	14	8					1249	1263		10.1007/s10021-011-9479-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-011-9479-x													WOS:000300144800003

Alpine lakes are supposed to be less affected by pollution than lowland lakes and are vulnerable to any changes and impacts in their catchment areas because of their remote position and ultra-oligotrophic character. Therefore, we used a model Alpine lake, Bohinj (in the Triglav National Park, Julian Alps, Slovenia), to evaluate the load of metals in the abiotic and biotic compartments of the ecosystem, in order to assess the spatial distribution of metals, and finally, to determine whether past and present human activities in the lake's catchment area may be causing pollution. To this aim, the contents of Cu, Pb, Cr, Cd, Co, Mn, Fe, Zn, Hg and Ni in the sediment, water, and macrophyte samples were determined. The results showed that the average content of some toxic elements, especially in the sediments (Cd 0.52 mg/kg; Hg 0.03 mg/kg) and plants (Co 0.71 mg/kg; Cr 5.88 mg/kg) was elevated compared to natural background values. High Hg contents could be connected with natural geological sources, while other elements were probably of anthropogenic origin. High levels of all elements in the eastern part of the lake indicated long-term pollution, which could be a consequence of past iron extraction and military activities in the vicinity. On the other hand, high contents of elements in the water suggests that intensive touristic activities in the area may cause temporal pollution in the summer. The study sheds light on complicated processes governing the distribution of trace metals in Alpine lakes.

This study concentrates on the hydrochemical characteristics and the mechanisms controlling the suitability of the lakes for domestic, irrigation, and industrial purposes. A total of 15 lake water samples were collected and analysed for physical parameters, major ions, nutrients, BOD, COD, and heavy metals. The results show that Lakes 6, 7, and 8 commonly exceeded the National Drinking Water Quality Standards (NDWQS) limits, particularly in physical parameters and major ions. The cation dominance was Na+ > Mg2+ > K+ > Ca2+, while the anion dominance was Cl- > HCO3- > SO42-. It is inferred that lake 8 was affected by the seawater intrusion through the inlet flow, resulting in an excess concentration of ions present in that lake. The concentrations of heavy metals in these lakes were considerably low, indicating that most of them were from the geogenic source. Most of the lakes were NaCl water type and the main controlling mechanism were weathering and ionic exchange processes, with anthropogenic impacts. Based on the calculated Water Quality Index (WQI) according to the National Water Quality Standards (NWQS), all lakes were suitable for irrigation use (class IV), while most of these lakes fell under the "polluted" index. Apart from that, based on the National Lake Water Quality Standards (NLWQS), all lakes were classified under category D, indicating that the lakes must be kept in good condition. According to the irrigation quality indices, lakes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were the most suitable for irrigation purposes. As for metal pollution indices (HPI and HEI), lakes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 15 were considered safe with low pollution status. From the multivariate statistical analysis, it is deduced that both anthropogenic and geogenic impacts mostly influenced the quality of these lake waters. The outcome of this study will help the policymakers under the national water department in sustainable management of water resources in this region.

For Salt Lake City (2002), the International Olympic Committee requested objective evidence to use beta(2)-agonists for asthma or exercise-induced asthma (EIA). Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the evidence submitted for approval to use a beta(2)-agonist. Methods: Objective evidence for asthma or EIA included (1) an increase of 12% or more of the predicted FEV1 in response to bronchodilator, (2) a reduction in FEV1 of 10% or greater from baseline in response to exercise or eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea, (3) a PD20 FEV1 to methacholine or histamine at a dose of less than 200 mug (2 mg/mL) or less than 1320 mug (13.2 mg/mL) for those taking inhaled corticosteroids for 3 months. Results: There were 165 applications. Of these, 147 (89%) included evidence of a challenge, bronchodilator response, or both, and 163 test results were submitted. One hundred thirty (5.2%) applications were approved. For those with positive responses, the median value (1) was 16.2% of predicted FEV1 for response to a bronchodilator (n = 13), (2) was a 15.9% decrease in FEV1 for response to a physical challenge (n = 36), and, (3) for PD20 FEV1 was 173 mug for response to a pharmacologic challenge (n = 45). Conclusion: The analysis demonstrated that it is feasible to request objective evidence to justify use of beta(2)-agonists on the medical grounds of asthma or EIA.

J	Irfanullah, HM; Moss, B				Irfanullah, Haseeb Md.; Moss, Brian			Low retention of nitrogen in a clear-water, shallow, temperate bake	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Little Budworth Pool in Cheshire, UK is a small (5 ha), shallow (maximum depth < I m) lake with very high total nitrogen (TN) concentration (96% as NO3-N), without any submerged macrophyte beds but with abundance of filamentous green algae. The pool has one inflow surrounded by a reed bed at its entry to the lake, and one outflow. A two-year study revealed high nitrogen loading (mean 15.8 +/- SEM 1.1 kg TN ha(-1) d(-1)), high annual loss of nitrogen through the outflow (mean 14.2 +/- 1.1 kg TN ha(-1) d(-1)), and low annual nitrogen retention (mean 1.6 +/- 0.3 kg TN ha(-1) d(-1)). The small surface area, shallowness, high water discharge (mean 4.3 +/- 0.3 x 10(3) m(3) d(-1)), short water residence time (mean 6.5 +/- 0.4 day), and a lack of submerged macrophytes for removing nutrients as well as promoting sedimentation by reducing water velocity could explain low nitrogen retention in Little Budworth Pool. The lake, however, acted as an efficient sink for NO3-N and TN in summer apparently due to denitrification and uptake of nitrogen by the filamentous green algae (mostly Spirogyra sp.). The reed bed, on the contrary, did not act as a significant source or sink of nutrients probably because of its small area compared with the catchment, and the catchment slope.					, Haseeb/AAL-1498-2021	Irfanullah, Haseeb/0000-0002-5532-8922													1863-9135						2008	171	3					241	248		10.1127/1863-9135/2008/0171-0241	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/1863-9135/2008/0171-0241													WOS:000257061500006
J	Seward, A; Reeves, R; Alcaraz, S				Seward, Anya; Reeves, Robert; Alcaraz, Samantha			Assessment of the surface heat loss from Waimangu Geothermal Valley: Comparison of terrestrial based assessment techniques with remote sensing	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												The Waimangu Geothermal Valley (WGV) is the youngest geothermal area in New Zealand. It was formed as a result of the 1886 Tarawera Rift eruption and contains the world's largest hot pool (Frying Pan Lake), numerous hot springs, fumaroles and areas of steam heated ground. Assessments of surface heat loss from geothermal systems can provide information and insight into the size and character of the underlying geothermal resource, and, provides a monitoring tool to help assess increases or decreases in activity in the geothermal system. Historically, many different methods have been used to measure heat loss that can result in a wide range of estimates. Surface heat loss of the WGV is estimated in this paper using aerial thermal infrared imagery (TIR), and, several terrestrial based surveys, including calorimetry, chloride-flux assessments, and shallow temperature -depth profiles. The terrestrial heat loss survey consisted of 22 calorimeter and temperature-depth profile measurements in varying groundcover. The measured heat fluxes of these sites are scaled-up using a new groundcover map to determine a total surface heat loss of the valley. This surface heat loss estimate is combined with a calculated evaporative heat flow from the surfaces of the two heated lakes, Frying Pan Lake and Inferno Crater. Similarly, ground-surface and water-surface temperatures were inferred from aerial TIR data. A heat flux per pixel is calculated using one of two methods, depending on whether the pixel of interest represents a water surface or a ground surface. A total heat loss for the valley is estimated by adding the heat flux per pixel for the total area. Total heat loss for the WGV is estimated to be 300 MWth using terrestrial methods, and 330 MWth using the aerial TIR data. These total surface heat loss estimates are in close agreement with each other, and with historic estimates for the area.																			0377-0273	1872-6097				OCT	2022	430								107630	10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2022.107630	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2022.107630													WOS:000911779300001

Characterization and Classification of Vernal Pool Vegetation, Soil, and Amphibians of Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Vernal pools are isolated ephemeral bodies of water that are often overlooked on the landscape. Despite their temporary nature, these pools are important to forest communities, providing critical breeding habitat for amphibians and an important food and water source for other taxonomic groups including birds, bats, and other terrestrial vertebrates. Sparse information about vernal pools in the upper Midwest, including Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore (PIRO), inhibits conservation. We sampled soil, vegetation, and amphibians in 21 vernal pools in PIRO during spring 2010 to provide quantitative and qualitative evaluation of vernal pool abiotic and biotic characteristics within PIRO to help managers determine which pools to prioritize for conservation. Average vernal pool size sampled was 0.124 ha. Soils had an average of 13.5% carbon and 0.7% nitrogen. Vegetation was diverse within the vernal pools, with 115 vascular plants identified. Five species of amphibians were encountered during our surveys. We created a vernal pool classification system based on: (1) pool depression characteristics (one depression versus many interconnected depressions and whether canopy was open or closed) and (2) vegetation community type. This resulted in five vernal pool types: three herbaceous communities with open canopies and defined circular/elliptical boundaries (classic pools) and two forested closed canopy communities with irregular perimeters and interconnected mini-basins (complex pools). The two forested communities had the highest vegetation species richness, due mostly to greater number of microsites (downed logs, hummocks, etc.) for vegetation. Hydroperiod index and soil carbon were found to correspond to the vegetation classes. Amphibian species richness was highest in the classic pools and the majority of the amphibians encountered were in the sedge community type. This classification system, potentially effective for vernal pools throughout glaciated northeastern North America, will help managers prioritize vernal pools for conservation.

JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												In Lake Superior, almost all embayment and coastal species depend on overwintering stages. Diapausing eggs from sediments provide a long-term record of species presence in addition to furnishing individuals for genetic characterization and experimental studies (resurrection ecology). Here we begin to clarify the historical development of present day species distributions in Lake Superior by examining species composition in time and space around the Keweenaw Peninsula. Keweenaw Bay sediments document the relatively recent increased abundance (perhaps arrival) of Daphnia mendotae and D. retrocurva in coastal assemblages, two species previously assumed to be characteristic of late summer assemblages. Ephippial eggs are confirmed to species by hatching experiments and genetic characterization. The timing of D. mendotae and D. retrocurva appearance coincides roughly with initial ship traffic through the St. Marys River, suggesting colonization from the lower Great Lakes at that time. An alternative hypothesis is that run-off from forest clearance altered coastal waters and encouraged Daphnia development. Eutrophication and increased abundance of planktivorous fishes, particularly perch and smelt, may also have contributed to Daphnia species succession in the Keweenaw Waterway, whereas recent interactions with Bythotrephes in Keweenaw Bay may be pushing assemblages towards dominance of D. mendotae and Holopedium. Contact between D. mendotac and resident D. dentifera in the Keweenaw Waterway led to hybridization. In the waterway, hybrids were more common in the past, yet hybridization continues in small ponds and embayments near regions of species contact.																			0380-1330						2004	30			1			285	299																WOS:000227991500020

The location and quantity of BMPs were obtained from the U.S. Department of Agriculture-Natural Resources Conservation Service National Conservation Planning (NCP) database. A Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was built and calibrated for this predominantly agricultural Eagle Creek watershed, incorporating NCP BMPs and monitoring data at the watershed outlet, an edge-of-field (EOF), and tile monitoring sites. Input air temperature modifications were required to induce simulated tile flow to match monitoring data. Calibration heavily incorporated tile monitoring data to correctly proportion surface and subsurface flow, but calibration statistics were unsatisfactory at the EOF and tile monitoring sites. At the watershed outlet, satisfactory to very good calibration statistics were achieved over a 2-year calibration period, and satisfactory statistics were found in the 2-year validation period. SWAT fixes parameters controlling nutrients primarily at the watershed level; a refinement of these parameters at a smaller-scale could improve field-level calibration. Field-scale modeling results indicate that filter strips (FS) are the most effective single BMPs at reducing dissolved reactive phosphorus, and FS typically decreased sediment and nutrient yields when added to any other BMP or BMP combination. Cover crops were the most effective single, in-field practice by reducing nutrient loads over winter months. Watershed-scale results indicate BMPs can reduce sediment and nutrients, but reductions due to NCP BMPs in the Eagle Creek watershed for all water-quality constituents were less than 10%. Hypothetical scenarios simulated with increased BMP acreages indicate larger investments of the appropriate BMP or BMP combination can decrease watershed level loads.

The objective of this study was to analyze the occurrence of cyanotoxic risk in the catchment area of the Obrzyca River, which is a source of drinking water for the inhabitants of Zielona Gora. At the points of Uscie and at its tributary at Wojnowo, the river was more exposed to the blooms of toxigenic algae, whose active microcystins synthesize more here than in other places (Sadowo, Chwalim, Ostrzyce, Lubiatow). Throughout the study, conducted in 2008-12, we observed several times that the amounts of cyanobacteria exceeded 500.10(3) individuals per litre (ind. .dm(-3)). The observed cyanobacterial blooms were dominated by the following species: Dolichospermum flos-aquae and Planktothrix agardhii in the Obrzyca River at Uscie, and D. spiroides, D. affinis, and Aphanizomenon flos-aquae at its tributary in Wojnowo. The maximum value of intracellular MC-LR, totalling 21.4 mu g.dm(-3), was found at Wojnowo in September 2011. The analysis of the physico-chemical water quality indicators showed that the places along the Obrzyca River where periodic cyanobacterial blooms took place were characterized by eutrophic conditions, and the total nitrogen to total phosphorus ratio (N/P) fell within the range of 10 to 16, and the water temperature exceeded 20 degrees C. In order to assess the toxic hazard caused by periodic cyanobacterial blooms in the catchment area of the Obrzyca River for drinking water for Zielona Gora residents, regular monitoring of the cyanobacteria and their toxins is required-especially at the points in Uscie and Wojnowo as well as at the water intake at the water treatment plant (WTP) in Zawada (in central-western Poland).

These extreme events are governed by weather systems of various scales as well as complex terrain effects. It is therefore difficult to analyze and forecast precipitation with traditional methods. In this study, an approach is designed by decomposing water vapor flux divergence (Q(v)(all)) under model's terrain following coordinates following the Helmholtz theorem. The traditionally used but important variable for depicting anomalous precipitation, Q(v)(all), is partitioned into three components, i.e., flow divergence (Q(v)(div)), moisture advections by large-scale motion (Q(v)(L)) and by sub-synoptic motion (Q(v)(s)). Applications to a blizzard event occurred over Ili Valley during 30 Nov to 1 Dec 2018 is performed as an example. The eastward water vapor flux brings moisture from Balkhash Lake to Ili Valley during the entire precipitation event, while Q(v)(all) fails to indicate the initiation and weakening of precipitation. Temporal and spatial evolutions of the three decomposed components are analyzed with comparison to precipitation on both windward slope and lee side. Q(v)(div) with dominant magnitude always converges no matter precipitation intensifies or weakens, and therefore leads to false moisture aggregation signals in Q(v)(all). The other two components, Q(v)(L) and Q(v)(S), converge prior to precipitation and diverge or weaken before the event ends. Besides, Q(v)(L) performs better than Q(v)(S) on windward slope and shows moisture transport from upper levels while Q(v)(S) achieves better on lee side. Future applications of this flow decomposition approach may thus extend to improving precipitation predictions with negligible computational costs over complex topography in other places around the world.					; haijun, Zhao/HHS-4577-2022; Cao, jie/JXR-6551-2024	Cao, JIE/0000-0002-6566-2270; 													0169-8095	1873-2895				JUN 1	2022	270								106079	10.1016/j.atmosres.2022.106079	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2022.106079		FEB 2022											WOS:000819848000004

Factors Affecting Dissolved Silica Concentrations, and DSi and DIN Stoichiometry in a Human Impacted Watershed (Po River, Italy)	SILICON												Data on dissolved (DSi) and particulate (PSi) silica concentrations, along with DSi and DIN (dissolved inorganic nitrogen) stoichiometry in surface waters were reviewed for the Po river watershed. DSi in the cascade river and lake ecosystems followed clear upstream-downstream gradients. The DSi (77-178 kt Si y (-aEuro parts per thousand 1)) and PSi (879-1,486 kt Si y (-aEuro parts per thousand 1)) loadings from the Po river to the Adriatic Sea display strong inter-annual variability, related with the river discharge. In the lowland river reaches, the DSi to DIN ratio highlighted frequent potential Si limitation, especially in summer during diatom blooms. Since the Po river watershed is heavily inhabited and exploited with agriculture (similar to 43 % of the total surface) and livestock husbandry (similar to 3.4 x 10(6) cattle heads), agriculture likely interferes with the natural silicon cycle. We present a preliminary assessment of the biogenic silica (BSi) which was fixed in and harvested with the main crop biomass. In the period 2000-2010, the total BSi in crops was 270-386 kt Si y (-aEuro parts per thousand 1). Three main cereals (maize, wheat, rice) accounted for 70 % BSi, of which 89 % was accumulated in straw. The quantity of BSi that was annually accumulated in the cereal biomass increased 2-4 folds from 1950 to 2010. We estimated that a great part of the BSi accumulated in straw and fodder was processed by the cattle stock and returned to soil as manure. A large part of the cropland is exposed to erosion and PSi can be exported to canals and rivers at particularly high rates during flash flood events. Recent transformations of either agricultural practices or crop typology probably perturb the Si cycling.

However, the combined responding pattern in the lake ecosystem to the above multiple environmental stressors is not well understood. Here, we present diatom assemblage and geochemical indicators (total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorous (TP)) in lake sediment to investigate the long-term trends in the aquatic ecosystem in response to multiple environmental stressors in Lake Chenghai, a deep brackish lake located on Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, SW China, during the past 80 years. We identified 8 genera and 15 species of diatom reaching a relative abundance of >= 2% in at least one sample, with the dominant taxa such as Cyclotella rhomboideo-elliptica and Aulacoseira alpigena through the sediment core. There was a clear shift in the diatom community from oligotrophic species of C. rhomboideo-elliptica to eutrophic species such as Cyclotella meneghiniana and Cyclostephanos dubius becoming dominant since ca. 1998 CE. In addition, the changes in the fish introduction, water level, temperature, and salinity also resulted in the variation in abundance of planktonic and benthic diatoms. The increase in the abundance of diatoms of C. rhomboideo-elliptica since ca. 1986 CE may be related to the decline in water level and increasing fish production. For one thing, the decline in water level reduces the concentrations of benthic diatoms but increases the relative biomass of planktonic diatoms. For another, the increasing fish production results in the decrease in the zooplankton biomass, thus reducing the predation pressure on planktonic algae. Besides, some specific species such as C. meneghiniana may respond to the increased nutrient release and increased salinity since ca. 1998 CE. Combined, our findings demonstrate that trophic level is the main driver of diatom assemblage changes, and other environmental variables including water level, fish introduction, and climate warming also contribute to diatom community variation in this brackish plateau lake during the last 80 years.																			0944-1344	1614-7499				MAY	2022	29	22					33117	33129		10.1007/s11356-021-17853-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-17853-0		JAN 2022						35022973					WOS:000741964200016

Lake Chapala, Mexico's largest, is located on the Rio Lerma, one of Mexico's principal rivers. It was made a reservoir in 1903 by the construction of a hydroelectric dam on the out-flowing Rio Santiago. For the first half of this century Lake Chapala was famous for its native white-fish (Chirostoma lucius) fishery. This fishery has collapsed. The present fishery consists of small Chirostoma species and the introduced Oreochromis. During the past 17 years the water level has fallen by over 3 meters. Now very shallow, clay resuspension creates low visibility (Secchi < 1 m). Nutrients are abundant with total phosphorus exceeding 1 mg l-1 and inorganic nitrogen exceeding 0.5 mg 1-1. Photosynthesis is limited by light and especially the unfavorable mixing depth to photic depth ratio. Models based on phytoplankton production or biomass underestimate the fishery by about one order of magnitude while a morphoedaphic model overestimates the fishery to the same extent. We sought to explain alternate pathways to support the realized fishery. Experiments suggest that bacterial prodution, with a bypass of the microbial loop, may offer a partial explanation. Management practices to increase the fishery based on an increased autotrophic base to food chain would fail without consideration of bacterial processes in this highly turbid ecosystem.																			0020-9309						1994	79	1					7	16		10.1002/iroh.19940790104	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19940790104													WOS:A1994NM81400002

Faunal (Chironomidae, Cladocera) responses to post-Little Ice Age climate warming in the high Austrian Alps	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Present climate warming strongly affects limnological and ecological properties of lakes and may cause regime shifts that alter structure and function in the water bodies. Such effects are especially pronounced in climatologically extreme areas, e.g. at high altitudes. We examined a sediment core from Lake Oberer Landschitzsee, Austrian Alps, which spans the period from the Little Ice Age (LIA) to present. We investigated whether post-LIA climate warming altered aquatic invertebrate communities and limnological status in this sensitive high Alpine lake. Fossil Cladocera (Crustacea) and Chironomidae (Diptera) and organic matter in the core were analyzed. Chironomids were used to assess the lake's benthic quality (i.e. oxygen availability). An instrumental Alpine temperature record was used to assess whether changes in the biotic assemblages correspond to post-LIA temperature trends. The planktonic and macro- and microbenthic invertebrate communities exhibit almost complete and simultaneous species turnover after the LIA, from about AD 1850 onward, when Sergentia coracina-type replaced oxyphilous Micropsectra contracta-type as the dominant macrobenthic taxon, and phytophilous Acroperus harpae outcompeted Alona affinis and Alona quadrangularis in the microbenthos. These directional community shifts corresponded with a period of reduced benthic quality, higher sediment organic content, and progressive climate warming, superimposed on Alpine land-use changes, until the early twentieth century. Detected changes suggest increased productivity and lower benthic oxygen availability. Faunal shifts were even more pronounced during the late twentieth century, simultaneous with enhanced warming. A new planktonic Cladocera species, Bosmina longirostris, typically absent from high Alpine lakes, colonized the lake and gradually became dominant toward the core top. Results show that post-LIA climate warming, coupled with increasing benthic and planktonic production, substantially altered the limnological and ecological status of this remote Alpine lake. Observed faunal turnovers provide evidence that temperature-driven ecological thresholds, whether associated directly or indirectly with greater human activity, have been crossed. Species abundances and distributions have changed in response to post-LIA and late twentieth century climate warming.

J	Burn, CR				Burn, CR			A field perspective on modelling 'single-ridge' ice-wedge polygons	PERMAFROST AND PERIGLACIAL PROCESSES												Plug and Werner (Nature 2002, vol. 417, pp. 929-933) have constructed a model for the growth of ice-wedge polygons. Contrary to field evidence, the model describes development of ice wedges in frozen ground beneath a centre line of ridges and assumes that effects associated with perturbations in the thermal stress field due to growth of individual wedges may dissipate in the long run. In the field, troughs, not ridges, overlie wedges, and development of the troughs as the ice wedges grow increases snow accumulation above the wedges, so that older wedges may crack less frequently than younger ice wedges. As a result, the 'single-ridge' model does not replicate the inexorable evolution of polygonal networks in the field, because the underlying assumptions are inconsistent with field conditions. Instead, the 'single-ridge' ice-wedge model attributes network development only to periods of high thermal stress, i.e. particularly cold winters. The model has been used to simulate development of such networks ab initio, by considering conditions in a recently drained thaw lake. However, the results do not reproduce field conditions because the model operates in frozen, not freezing ground, and therefore the initial modelled network is greatly exaggerated from known field observations. While the conclusions of the modelling are presented in general terms, the model only considers epigenctic polygons, which comprise a small fraction of the ice-wedge polygons in polar terrain. Other, more extensive, syngenetic and anti-syngenetic (hillslope) polygon networks are not mentioned.

Water quality and human health: A simple monitoring model of toxic cyanobacteria growth in highly variable Mediterranean hot dry environments	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Due to population growth, urbanization and economic development, demand for freshwater in urban areas is increasing throughout Europe. At the same time, climate change, eutrophication and pollution are affecting the availability of water supplies. Sicily, a big island in southern Italy, suffers from an increasing drought and consequently water shortage. In the last decades, in Sicilian freshwater reservoirs several Microcystis aeruginosa and more recently Planktothrix rubescens blooms were reported. The aims of the study were: (1) identify and quantify the occurring species of cyanobacteria (CB), (2) identify which parameters, among those investigated in the waters, could favor their growth, (3) set up a model to identify reservoirs that need continuous monitoring due to the presences, current or prospected, of cyanobacterial blooms and of microcystins, relevant for environmental and, consequentially, for human health. Fifteen artificial reservoirs among the large set of Sicilian artificial water bodies were selected and examined for physicochemical and microbiological characterization. Additional parameters were assessed, including the presence, identification and count of the cyanobacterial occurring species, the measurement of microcystins (MCs) levels and the search for the genes responsible for the toxins production. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to relate environmental condition to cyanobacterial growth. Water quality was poor for very few parameters, suggesting common anthropic pressures, and PCA highlighted clusters of reservoirs vulnerable to hydrological conditions, related to semi-arid Mediterranean climate and to the use of the reservoir. In summer, bloom was detected in only one reservoir and different species was highlighted among the Cyanobacteria community. The only toxins detected were microcystins, although always well below the WHO reference value for drinking waters (1.0 mu g/L). However, molecular analysis could not show the presence of potential cyanotoxins producers since a few numbers of cells among total could be sufficient to produce these low MCs levels but not enough high to be proved by the traditional molecular method applied. A simple environmental risk-based model, which accounts for the high variability of both cyanobacteria growth and cyanotoxins producing, is proposed as a cost-effective tool to evaluate the need for monitoring activities in reservoirs aimed to guarantee supplying waters safety.

Multiple stressor effects on stream health in the Lake Simcoe Watershed	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The Lake Simcoe Watershed (LSW) is an important natural resource, supporting varied agricultural, recreational, and tourism activities for millions of people. Historically, major alterations to land uses have occurred throughout the watershed, resulting in increases of nutrients and contaminants, and alteration of hydrological and thermal regimes. The combination of these stressors has the potential to elicit greater impacts on ecosystem health than any one stressor in isolation, yet no studies have examined their effects on stream health and aquatic biota in the LSW. In this study, we quantified the impacts of multiple stressors on indices of biotic integrity, as well as assessments of benthic invertebrate and fish community composition from 2004 to 2012. Using a suite of multivariate analyses, we examined stressors across three categories of environmental variables: water quality, temperature, and hydrology. Water quality explained the largest amount of variation in stream health and biological community composition, followed by water temperature and hydrological variables, respectively. Total phosphorus, dissolved oxygen, and iron concentrations, as well as the 7-day low flow and the mean summer temperature, were identified as predictors of both fish and benthic invertebrate variance. Multiple stressor interactions were detected for fish communities, although these interactions were of lower relative importance than for individual stressors. In contrast, no significant stressor interactions were found to influence benthic invertebrate communities. Overall, our results reinforce the importance of ecosystem monitoring, and the need to consider the influence of multiple aspects of ecosystem function, when examining the health of aquatic systems.

Relationships between the presence of odonate species and environmental characteristics in lowland ponds of central Italy	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY					2nd European Pond Workshp	FEB 23-25, 2006	Toulouse, FRANCE	Univ Paul Sabatier Toulouse III, CNRS, Pole Relais Mares & Mouilleres France, Univ Appl Sci Western Switzerland, Univ Geneva, Pond Conservat, Univ Leuven				A set of 21 ponds was sampled three times for odonate larvae during spring 2002. At the same time 17 environmental variables were recorded including area, wet phase duration, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, aquatic macrophytes and land use. A total of 16 odonate species belonging to Lestidae, Coenagrionidae, Aeshnidae and Libellulidae were recorded, and the total number of species per pond varied from zero to six. The relationships between species richness, assemblages and environmental variables were studied by simple and multiple correlation and by Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). The results showed that permanent ponds were larger, deeper, had more macrophyte species, had more extensive macrophytes cover and lower concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus than temporary ponds. Multiple regression analysis showed that the number of odonate species was positively affected firstly by the number of macrophyte species, and then by pond depth. However, pond depth appeared to be interchangeable with several others variables, such as pond area and water duration and negatively correlated with nitrogen concentration, variables which are all linked with the permanent or temporary status of the ponds. CCA analysis indicated that odonate species presence was linked with a few environmental variables, showing a tendency of Odonata to avoid ponds with higher nitrogen concentrations, with the exception of Lestes barbarus, a species typical of temporary water in central Italy. At the same time, the majority of species were linked with longer water phase duration and with greater macrophyte species richness. A comparison with previous studies, and in particular with those carried out in central Italy, confirmed the positive influence of macrophytes, water duration, and also the negative effect of nutrient load. However, several other variables, in particular land use, shade, presence of fish, which were influential in other studies, were not significant in this study.					; Solimini, Angelo/C-9290-2018	Solimini, Angelo/0000-0002-5281-7624; 													0003-4088						2007	43	2					81	87		10.1051/limn/2007020	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2007020													WOS:000247808000002
J	Zhou, QL; Liu, C; Fan, CX				Zhou, Qilin; Liu, Cheng; Fan, Chengxin			Application of plow-tillage as an innovative technique for eliminating overwintering cyanobacteria in eutrophic lake sediments	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Surface sediment in eutrophic lakes is both a destination and a habitat for overwintering cyanobacteria. The resuspension and recovery of viable, overwintering cyanobacteria from the surface sediment during warm spring weather is usually the primary stage of cyanobacterial blooms (CBs) in shallow eutrophic lakes. Therefore, the elimination of overwintering cyanobacteria in sediment is vital to control CBs. In the present study, sediment plow-tillage (PT) was introduced as an innovative technique for eliminating overwintering cyanobacteria in sediments from Lake Chaohu. Four depths of PT (2, 5,10, and 15 cm) were tested during the 42-day experiment. The results showed that rapid cell death during the first 0-7 d after PT was accompanied by high oxygen uptake rates. The viable cells in deeper sediment died more quickly and at a higher rate after PT. A PT depth of >10 cm effectively eliminated viable cyanobacteria (with a removal rate of 82.8%) from the sediment and prevented their resuspension. The activity of the viable cyanobacteria also decreased quickly as cyanobacteria were eliminated. It appears that the dark, anoxic environment of the deeper sediment after PT was responsible for the elimination of viable cells. Although high release rates of nitrogen and phosphorus were found to accompany the dying and decomposition of cyanobacteria during days 0-7 of the experiment, greater depth of PT was found to decrease nutrient concentrations in the overlying water. In conclusion, we recommend sediment PT as a new technique for eliminating overwintering algae in sediments. However, the release of nutrients from the sediment and the in situ control of CBs in lakes after PT should be further studied. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Assessment of water quality in Alamein Marina Recreational Lagoon	JOURNAL OF THE EGYPTIAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION												Background Alamein Marina Lagoon is one of six lagoons, lying on the Egyptian Mediterranean Coast. Between 1988 and 1995, a large-scale recreational compound called Alamein Marina Touristic Village was established to contain most of these lakes. The study aims to assess the quality of Alamein Marina Lagoon water in an attempt to evaluate the environmental impact of the touristic summer activities on the lake and to determine at what level this recreational lagoon stands as a healthy resort, among the other resorts around the Mediterranean Sea Basin. Materials and methods Fourteen sampling stations were chosen to present the four sub-basins of the lagoon and its outlets on the Mediterranean Sea. Physical, chemical, and bacteriological characteristics of the lagoon water were determined. Results Lagoon water pH was found to range between 6.8 and 7.9. Dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, nitrates and phosphates were 6.5 mg/L, 1 mg/L, 0.5 mg/L, and 3.8 mg/L respectively. Fecal coliform were not detected in all sampling stations. Conclusion Alamein Marina water characteristics were complying with the standards set by Egyptian legislations concerning recreational water all over the study period. They were also complying with the levels set by different international organizations such as the WHO and Blue Flag. Besides, by calculating the water quality index for Alamein Marina Lagoon and its four sub-basins, water was found to be of an 'excellent' quality.

J	SOUTHARD, SB; SOUTHARD, RJ				SOUTHARD, SB; SOUTHARD, RJ			MINERALOGY AND CLASSIFICATION OF ANDIC SOILS IN NORTHEASTERN CALIFORNIA	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												Recently proposed changes to Soil Taxonomy will have a significant impact on the classification of soils with andic properties, most of which formed from volcanic materials. The vast majority of soils with andic properties occur in humid environments. A few have been identified in regions with semiarid to subhumid climates. Soils with andic properties and a xeric soil moisture regime are extensive in the Medicine Lake Highland and near the town of Burney in the Cascade physiographic province of northeastern California. Selective dissolution and x-ray diffraction were employed to determine the mineralogy of six soils being mapped in the region. Four soils in the Medicine Lake Highland, formed mainly from air-fall tephra and basalt, are mantled by rhyolitic pumice up to 81 cm thick. Soil pH in the 5 to 7 range favored initial allophane and smectite formation over formation of humus-metal complexes. Subsequent desilication in upper horizons produced imogolite and kaolins there, but favored allophane stability in resilicated lower horizons. More intensive desilication of two soils formed from mixed basalt and tephra in the more humid Burney area favors the stability of a non-crystalline Al hydrous oxide (kliachite?), gibbsite, kaolins and crystalline Fe oxides. Three of the pedons in the Medicine Lake Highland meet the criteria for Xerands. The fourth, formed in the thickest pumice deposit, is a Vitrandic Xerorthent. Organic C contents, Al/Si ratios, and total annual precipitation suggest that the soil moisture regime in the Burney area may be udic, not xeric. The pedons in the Burney area are tentatively classified as Udands.																			0361-5995	1435-0661				NOV-DEC	1989	53	6					1784	1791		10.2136/sssaj1989.03615995005300060029x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1989.03615995005300060029x													WOS:A1989CE50600029
J	Herzschuh, U				Herzschuh, Ulrike			Reliability of pollen ratios for environmental reconstructions on the Tibetan Plateau	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim Pollen ratios are widely used to gain palaeovegetation and palaeoclimatic information from fossil pollen spectra, although their applicability has seldom been tested with modern pollen data. I used a data set of 113 lake-surface sediments from the eastern Tibetan Plateau to test the reliability of several pollen ratios. Location The lake-surface pollen spectra cover a wide range of vegetation types (temperate desert, temperate steppe, alpine desert, alpine steppe, high-alpine meadow, sub-alpine shrub, coniferous and mixed forest) and climatic conditions (mean July temperature, T-July: 4.0-17.4 degrees C; mean annual precipitation, P-ann: 104-670 mm). Methods Lake-surface sediments were analysed palynologically, and several pollen ratios were calculated. These ratios were interpreted with respect to vegetation and climatic conditions. Results The arboreal pollen sum (AP) was highest in samples from forested areas and was significantly correlated with P-ann (r(2) = 0.44). In non-forested areas, samples from large lakes and from lakes surrounded by sparse vegetation had increased AP values, suggesting that AP is a useful vegetation density indicator. Artemisia/Chenopodiaceae (A/C) ratios were lowest in desert areas and were positively correlated with P-ann (r(2) = 0.25). The aridity pollen index was inappropriate for inferring (palaeo-) climatic information from samples on the eastern Tibetan Plateau as it had no significant correlation with the environmental factors. Artemisia/Cyperaceae (A/Cy) ratios had a significant correlation with T-July (r(2) = 0.23), but only a weak correlation with P-ann, which indicates that the A/Cy ratio is applicable as a temperature indicator. Furthermore, it is a valuable tool for the differentiation of high-alpine meadow from steppe vegetation. Main conclusions AP sum, A/C ratio and A/Cy ratio are useful tools for qualitative and semi-quantitative palaeoenvironmental reconstruction on the Tibetan Plateau; however, the results obtained should not be interpreted quantitatively.

J	Tsai, BB; Perez-Blanco, H				Tsai, BB; Perez-Blanco, H			Limits of mass transfer enhancement in lithium bromide-water absorbers by active techniques	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER												A model to predict the theoretical limits of mass transfer enhancement in a falling film absorber using LiBr aqueous solution has been developed and it provides a means of comparative absorber performance evaluation. During vapor absorption, the vapor-liquid interface becomes saturated immediately after it is exposed to vapor. Further absorption can only be sustained by mass diffusion and heat conduction into the fluid bulk, assuming a stationary interface. Due to the relatively small heat and mass diffusivities of LiBr aqueous solution, the mass absorption rates sustained by pure diffusion and conduction processes are small. To increase the mass absorption rates, mixing of the solution is favored. Therefore, every mass transfer enhancement technique, passive or active, consists of basically disturbing the film and causing mixing of the solution near the interface. The higher the mixing rate, the higher the mass absorption rate. To assess the effect of a mixed interface, a mathematical model is formulated. This model solves one-dimensional heat and mass differential equations coupled at the interface. An asymptote of the mass transfer rate as the mixing rate increases is derived. The model, which lakes into account all relevant parameters such as temperatures, pressures, concentrations, mass flow rates, and geometry, is an ideal tool for rating absorber performance. Results show that, under typical operating conditions found in commercial chillers, the theoretically possible maximum mass absorption rate is 0.049 kg m(2) . s(-1) and that, at a mechanically feasible mixing frequency of 1000 Hz, a mass absorption rate of 0.0256 kg m(2) . s(-1) is possible. The latter rate is about an order of magnitude larger than that found in commercial chillers. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The King Air 200T cloud physics aircraft of the University of Wyoming and three other aircraft (a Piper Aztec, a Cessna 421-C, and a T-28) were involved in the tests. The King Air served as the monitoring aircraft when the other aircraft were tested and as both the test and monitoring aircraft when it was tested. The studies demonstrated that the King Air produces APIPs. The ice crystals, in concentrations up to several hundred per liter, are initially quite small and of almost uniform size, and they grow to larger nearly uniform sizes with time. APIPs production is most likely at low ambient temperatures and high power settings, and when the gear and flaps are extended. APIPs were not detected from the other aircraft. The Piper Aztec and Cessna 421 aircraft were tested on days on which an APIPs signature was produced by the King Air. The T-28 aircraft was tested when the fog-top temperature was greater than -6-degrees-C and neither the T-28 nor the King Air produced APIPs under these conditions. Homogeneous nucleation appears to be responsible for the observed APIPs signature, although the exact mechanism for nucleation is not known. In addition, there is the suggestion that a weaker APIPs signature may be generated by heterogeneous nucleation, when the cooling in the prop-tip vortex falls short of that thought necessary for homogeneous nucleation (i.e., approximately -39-degrees-C).																			0894-8763					NOV	1991	30	11					1469	1489		10.1175/1520-0450(1991)030<1469:APIPIS>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0450(1991)030<1469:APIPIS>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1991GP16000001
J	Richardson, CJ; Flanagan, NE; Wang, HJ; Ho, MC				Richardson, Curtis J.; Flanagan, Neal E.; Wang, Hongjun; Ho, Mengchi			Annual carbon sequestration and loss rates under altered hydrology and fire regimes in southeastern USA pocosin peatlands	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Peatlands drained for agriculture or forestry are susceptible to the rapid release of greenhouse gases (GHGs) through enhanced microbial decomposition and increased frequency of deep peat fires. We present evidence that rewetting drained subtropical wooded peatlands (STWPs) along the southeastern USA coast, primarily pocosin bogs, could prevent significant carbon (C) losses. To quantify GHG emissions and storage from drained and rewetted pocosin we used eddy covariance techniques, the first such estimates that have been applied to this major bog type, on a private drained (PD) site supplemented by static chamber measurements at PD and Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuge. Net ecosystem exchange measurements showed that the loss was 21.2 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) (1 Mg = 10(6) g) in the drained pocosin. Under a rewetted scenario, where the annual mean water table depth (WTD) decreased from 60 to 30 cm, the C loss was projected to fall to 2 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1), a 94% reduction. If the WTD was 20 cm, the peatlands became a net carbon sink (-3.3 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1)). Hence, net C reductions could reach 24.5 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1), and when scaled up to the 4000 ha PD site nearly 100,000 Mg CO2 year(-1) of creditable C could be amassed. We conservatively estimate among the 0.75 million ha of southeastern STWPs, between 450 and 770 km(2) could be rewet, reducing annual GHG emissions by 0.96-1.6 Tg (1 Tg = 10(12) g) of CO2, through suppressed microbial decomposition and 1.7-2.8 Tg via fire prevention, respectively. Despite covering <0.01% of US land area, rewetting drained pocosin can potentially provide 2.4% of the annual CO2 nationwide reduction target of 0.18 Pg (1 Pg = 10(15) g). Suggesting pocosin restoration can contribute disproportionately to the US goal of achieving net-zero emission by 2050.

DEGLACIATION OF THE LAURENTIDE ICE SHEET FROM THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM	CUADERNOS DE INVESTIGACION GEOGRAFICA												The last deglaciation of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) was associated with major reorganisations in the ocean-climate system and its retreat also represents a valuable analogue for understanding the rates and mechanisms of ice sheet collapse. This paper reviews the characteristics of the LIS at its Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and its subsequent deglaciation, with particular emphasis on the pattern and timing of ice margin recession and the driving mechanisms of retreat. The LIS initiated over the eastern Canadian Arctic similar to 116-110 ka (MIS 5d), but its growth towards the LGM was highly non-linear and punctuated by several episodes of expansion (similar to 65 ka: MIS 4) and retreat (similar to 50-40 ka: MIS 3). It attained its maximum position around 26-25 ka (MIS 2) and existed for several thousand years as an extensive ice sheet with major domes over Keewatin, Foxe Basin and northern Quebec/Labrador. It extended to the edge of the continental shelf at its marine margins and likely stored a sea-level equivalent of around 50 m and with a maximum ice surface similar to 3000 m above present sea-level. Retreat from its maximum was triggered by an increase in boreal summer insolation, but areal shrinkage was initially slow and the net surface mass balance was positive, indicating that ice streams likely played an important role in reducing the ice sheet volume, if not its extent, via calving at marine margins. Between similar to 16 and similar to 13 ka, the ice sheet margin retreated more rapidly, particularly in the south and west, whereas the north and east underwent only minimal recession. The overall rate of retreat decreased during the Younger Dryas (YD), when several localised readvances occurred. Following the YD, the ice sheet retreated two to five times faster than previously, and this was primarily driven by enhanced surface melting while ice streams reduced in effectiveness. Final deglaciation of the Keewatin and Foxe Domes, left a remnant Labrador Dome that disappeared similar to 6.7 ka.

In addition, irradiance and plankton biomass were determined. The concentrations of particulate organic carbon and phytoplankton biomass in the epilimnion were higher in Lake Tiefer than in Lake Dudinghausen, even though the apparent trophic status of Lake Tiefer was higher than Lake Dudinghausen. In Lake Dudinghausen, phototrophic sulfur bacteria accumulated in the hypolimnion between 8 and 10 m, whereas in Lake Tiefer low light penetration prevented the development of phototrophic bacteria in those horizons in which sulfide might be present. Because both lakes have anoxic hypolimnia, we assumed that in both cases phosphorus was released from the sediment into the hypolimnion. In Lake Tiefer, redox conditions and the presence of nitrate and nitrite limited the water depth range in which P-release occurred. In Lake Dudinghausen, part of the released soluble reactive phosphorus was incorporated into the phototrophic sulfur bacteria biomass and thus transformed to particulate phosphorus. As much as 70% of the particulate phosphorus in the hypolimnion was found in the phototrophic sulfur bacterial layer, with 15-20% of this particulate phosphorus consisting of polyphosphate storage compounds. The low ratio of soluble reactive phosphorus to particulate phosphorus in the hypolimnion was, therefore, attributed to phototrophic sulfur bacteria. The phototrophic sulfur bacteria appear to act as an internal nutrient filter and convert soluble reactive phosphorus into particulate phosphorus.																			1015-1621					AUG	2004	66	3					247	256		10.1007/s00027-004-0684-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-004-0684-y													WOS:000223353000001

The spatial distribution of the radionuclide content of the lake bottom was studied on 35 sediment cores in winters 1987/88 and 1988/89. The results were compared with simultaneous observations of the radionuclide content of the water and seston. The role of different transfer mechanisms in the elimination of radionuclides from the water column is discussed. The values recorded for the flux to the lake sediments were on average of the same order of magnitude as the initial deposition on the lake surface (Cs-137 65 kBqm-2). The radionuclide flux to the sediments was rapid during the first months after the accident. After that the elimination of dissolved nuclides from the water mass became significantly slower. The highest flux rate was that of Ce-144 and the lowest that of Rh-106 (Ru-106). Of the radiocesium, about half of the initial inventory was transferred to the sediments after the first observation year. The content of radionuclides showed considerable spatial variation on the lake bottom (Cs-137 7-280 kBqm-2). Direct adsorption of radiocesium explains unexpectedly high concentrations on shallow erosion bottoms. There was a clear tendency for the concentrations to increase with depth, as a result of the focusing effect. Sediment resuspension had a significant impact on the total flux of radionuclides to deepwater sediments. Estimates were made of the resuspended flux of radionuclides.																			0018-8158					SEP 20	1991	222	2					121	140		10.1007/BF00006100	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006100													WOS:A1991GQ28700005

Using paleolimnology to track Holocene climate fluctuations and aquatic ontogeny in poorly buffered High Arctic lakes	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Fossil diatom assemblages, and spectrally-inferred dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and sedimentary chlorophyll-a (SedChla) were analysed on lake sediment cores from two poorly buffered lakes on Pim Island (High Arctic Canada) to assess their responses to Holocene climate changes and to document lake ontogeny. Following deglaciation, diatom assemblages were dominated by small benthic Fragilaria sensu lato taxa. During the mid-Holocene, there was an abrupt shift to more circumneutral and slightly acidophilous taxa dominated by Achnanthes and Navicula taxa. In the most recent sediments, we recorded an increase in the planktonic taxon Cyclotella radiosa. This shift of the last century is the most ecologically unique in the Holocene record and is indicative of longer ice-free summers consistent with modem climate warming. Inferred DOC and SedChla track some of the main Holocene climatic trends documented in the region, including the Holocene Thermal Maximum and Neoglacial period: however. changes in lakewater DOC did not likely drive any of the recorded shifts in diatom assemblages. Compared to nearby well-buffered sites, our poorly buffered lakes recorded a more dynamic diatom response to Holocene environmental change. The decreasing trend in diatom-inferred pH is likely due to changes in the acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) driven by the release of alkalinizing base cations from the easily weathered glacial deposits in the early Holocene and later by climate-driven pH dynamics and within-lake dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) dynamics. The diatom community composition in our study lakes is different and undergoes greater changes than in nearby well-buffered lakes suggesting that softwater lakes in the high Arctic may respond most sensitively to climate and other environmental stressors.

The immediate catchment of the reservoir is approx. 95 km(2) in area, while the direct recharge area of the lake (immediate catchment) covers 1.31 km(2). The areas adjacent to the reservoir are arable lands composed of fluvial Quaternary (Pleistocene) deposits, while the analysis of layers covered by piezometers showed a predominance of medium sands deposited to a depth of approx. 3 m. The analysed reservoir was constructed in the valley of the Trojanki river (from 6+915 km to 8+371 km of its course) by the Wielkopolska Land Reclamation and Hydraulic Structure Authority in Poznan and it was commissioned in November 2014. The embankment dam of the reservoir is class IV, it is 334 m in length and 3.30 m in height. The reservoir of 1450 m in length and maximum width of 120 m, at the normal pool elevation of 72.50 m a.s.l. has a mean depth of 0.94 m and the pool area of 12.03 ha. The shoreline length of the reservoir is 2980 m, shoreline density is 248 m.ha(-1) and the elongation index is 12. In turn, the flood control capacity derived from the difference between normal and maximum pool level is around 67 000 m(3). The conducted analyses confirmed that apart from the weather conditions such as precipitation, air temperatures and evaporation from the reservoir a considerable role for the fluctuations in water levels in the reservoir was played by the anthropogenic factor. It was particularly related with the manner of reservoir operation frequently characteristic to dammed reservoirs and with the artificial control of water circulation. Analysis of the water balance for the Przebedowo reservoir showed that in the winter half-years of the analysed hydrological years of 2017 and 2018 the dominant factor in the case of increments was connected with inflow to the reservoir in the Trojanka watercourse, amounting to 12.9 hm(3) and 5.16 hm(3), respectively. To a much lesser extent the increments of water in those half-years were determined by the inflow to the reservoir from adjacent areas and by precipitation. In the case of losses the greatest share in the water balance was observed in the discussed half-years for outflow from the reservoir through the watercourse, which amounted to 10.0 hm(3) and 3.75 hm(3). To a lesser extent losses were determined by the uncontrolled underground outflow and subsurface inflow to the reservoir from adjacent areas. In turn, evaporation from the reservoir surface and water storage losses determined losses only slightly. Whereas in the summer half-years the increments in the water balance to the greatest extent were determined by inflows to the reservoir through the watercourse, which amounted to 10.7 hm(3) (2017) and 3.59 hm(3) (2018), while in the case of losses it was outflows from the reservoir amounting to 9.06 hm(3) and 2.7 hm(3). In turn, a lesser role was played in the case of losses by outflow from the reservoir to adjacent areas, which in the discussed half-years was comparable and amounted to a mean 0.66 hm(3). Throughout the entire period of the analysed hydrological years of 2017 and 2018 the greatest share in the water balance for the Przebedowo reservoir was recorded for the components related with the horizontal water exchange. Inflows to the reservoir through the Trojanka watercourse and outflows constituted mean 49% and 38%, respectively. In the dry hydrological year of 2018 a significant share, in comparison to the other components, in the water balance was also found for the subsurface outflows from the reservoir to adjacent areas, accounting for 9%. In contrast, no major share in the water balance was found for the factors related with the vertical water exchange, characteristic of reservoirs having no outlets, such as precipitation and evaporation from the reservoir surface.					; Stasik, Rafał/ABE-7350-2020; Liberacki, Daniel/AAQ-4806-2021; Fiedler, Michał/AAR-3859-2021	Liberacki, Daniel/0000-0002-4582-4535; Stasik, Rafal/0000-0002-2819-2644; Zydron, Adam/0000-0002-9667-2973; Fiedler, Michal/0000-0003-0639-9510													1506-218X						2020	22	1					324	346																WOS:000593301200022

A 2700 cal yr BP extreme flood event revealed by sediment accumulation in Amazon floodplains	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Climatic conditions are one of the most important factors affecting hydrological processes in fluvial systems. Higher discharges are responsible for higher erosion, greater transport, and also higher deposition. Consequently, sediment accumulation in Amazonia floodplain river-connected lakes can be directly related to hydrological patterns of the Amazon River mainstream. In this context, we analyzed five sediment cores taken in two floodplain systems situated in the lower Amazon River, to investigate sediment accumulation patterns during the Holocene. Our records show abrupt fluctuations in sedimentation rates in lakes that can reach more than 2 cm/yr during some periods. We find that in all cores, sediment stratigraphy is characterized by packages of sediments of uniform age, which are typically 10-80 cm thick and present a variegated color. The C-14 age of the upper package is about 2700 cal yr BP. During this abrupt event, sediment accumulation rates in floodplain lakes can be at least 200 times higher than those of "normal" periods. This sedimentation event is interpreted as being the consequence of one or several successive extreme floods. The 2700 cal yr BP event has been also observed in other sites in South America and other regions in the world, although different impacts can be observed in each system. This event probably corresponds to a conjunction of favorable conditions for extreme Amazon discharge associated with the Middle to Late Holocene increase of austral summer insolation and shifts of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) from northern to southern positions. In this context, a marked negative peak in solar irradiance at 2700 cal yrs BP seems to have provoked cooling on the continents and a southward shift of the ITCZ associated with a probable reduction in the Atlantic Meridian Overturning Circulation.

Michael			Using a Distribution and Conservation Status Weighted Hotspot Approach to Identify Areas in Need of Conservation Action to Benefit Idaho Bird Species	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												Identification of biodiversity hotspots (hereafter, hotspots) has become a common strategy to delineate important areas for wildlife conservation. However, the use of hotspots has not often incorporated important habitat types, ecosystem services, anthropogenic activity, or consistency in identifying important conservation areas. The purpose of this study was to identify hotspots to improve avian conservation efforts for Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) in the state of Idaho, United States. We evaluated multiple approaches to define hotspots and used a unique approach based on weighting species by their distribution size and conservation status to identify hotspot areas. All hotspot approaches identified bodies of water (Bear Lake, Grays Lake, and American Falls Reservoir) as important hotspots for Idaho avian SGCN, but we found that the weighted approach produced more congruent hotspot areas when compared to other hotspot approaches. To incorporate anthropogenic activity into hotspot analysis, we grouped species based on their sensitivity to specific human threats (i.e., urban development, agriculture, fire suppression, grazing, roads, and logging) and identified ecological sections within Idaho that may require specific conservation actions to address these human threats using the weighted approach. The Snake River Basalts and Overthrust Mountains ecological sections were important areas for potential implementation of conservation actions to conserve biodiversity. Our approach to identifying hotspots may be useful as part of a larger conservation strategy to aid land managers or local governments in applying conservation actions on the ground.

J	Basu, S; Sanyal, P; Pillai, AAS; Ambili, A				Basu, Sayak; Sanyal, Prasanta; Pillai, Anusree; Ambili, Anoop			Response of grassland ecosystem to monsoonal precipitation variability during the Mid-Late Holocene: Inferences based on molecular isotopic records from Banni grassland, western India	PLOS ONE												Banni, located in the arid western India, is one of the largest tropical grasslands of the Asian continent. The net primary production in this grassland ecosystem is currently mediated by precipitation during the Indian summer monsoon (ISM). However, timing of the grassland expansion and its link to the intensity of monsoonal precipitation remains enigmatic due to the paucity of datasets. The major objective of this study is to understand the changes in monsoonal precipitation and vegetation for the last 4600 cal yr BP using hydrogen and carbon isotopic composition of n-alkanes (delta Dn-alkane and delta C-13(n-alkane)) measured from two core sediments (Chachi and Luna) in Banni region. The delta C-13(C29) and delta C-13(C31) values for Chachi core sediments vary from -30.9 parts per thousand to -27.2 parts per thousand and -34.4 parts per thousand to -25 parts per thousand respectively. The delta C-13(n)-alkane values from the core sediments are converted into %C-4 plants based on a binary mixing model using the end-member delta C-13(n)-alkane values derived from the dominant modern vegetation in the Banni region. The prominent feature of the paleovegetation curve is the marked increase in the delta C-13(n-alkane) values after 2500 cal yr BP, which suggests proliferation of C-4 grasses in this region. Similar changes after 2500 cal yr BP have also been observed in the delta C-13(n-alkane) values. The delta D-C29 values are used to calculate delta D value of paleoprecipitation that varied from 10 parts per thousand to -60.2 parts per thousand. A significant increase in the delta D values of paleoprecipitation (ca. 25 parts per thousand) indicates a weakened ISM precipitation after ca. 2500 cal yr BP. The regional aridification and frequent fire events may have helped the expansion of C-4 plant dominated grassland ecosystem in Banni region. Correlation between paleoclimatic records suggests that the southward migration of intertropical convergence zone and more frequent warm phases of El-Nino Southern Oscillation have triggered the weakening of monsoonal precipitation in the tropical region.					; Ambili, Anoop/AAR-7122-2020	Ambili, Anoop/0000-0002-4279-7842; Ajitha, Anusree/0000-0002-6964-5961													1932-6203					APR 17	2019	14	4							e0212743	10.1371/journal.pone.0212743	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0212743								30995235					WOS:000465010000005
J	WILCOX, GR; DECOSTA, J				WILCOX, GR; DECOSTA, J			BAG EXPERIMENTS ON THE EFFECT OF PHOSPHORUS AND BASE ADDITIONS ON THE ALGAL BIOMASS AND SPECIES COMPOSITION OF AN ACID LAKE	INTERNATIONALE REVUE DER GESAMTEN HYDROBIOLOGIE												Two bag experiments were performed during the summer of 1976 to determine the effect of nutrient and base addition on the algal biomass and species composition of an acidic lake. In one experiment, P (100 .mu.g/l) was added alone and in combination with a base addition (NaOH) which raised the pH to 8.0-8.3. Other treatments included base addition alone and a control treatment in which neither nutrient nor base were added. In another experiment, the experimental design was as above except that on day 12, base was added to the P treatment, P was added to the base treatment and acid was added to the P plus base treatment. Uncorrected chlorophyll a concentrations were greatest in the P plus base treatments which were greater than the concentrations in either the lake (sampled at surface a 1 m depths), control or base treatments. Base addition alone did not increase algal biomass compared to the lake and control treatments. P plus base additions had notable growth lag times ranging from 6 to 10 days before greater chlorophyll concentrations were achieved. Base additions alone resulted in the reduction of the nannoplankton contribution to the total phytoplankton cell volume. P and P plus base additions resulted in nannoplankton dominance. The P plus base treatments became dominated by Chlorella sp., Scenedesmus quadricauda and Ankistrodesmus falcatus. The dominant phytoplankton species present in the lake during these experiments were noted.

An age model records the lake's history and is based on climate-stratigraphic correlations, tephrostratigraphy, paleomagnetics, and earlier 40Ar/39Ar analyses (Stockhecke et al., 2014b). Results from total fusion and stepwise heating 40Ar/39Ar analyses presented in this study allow for the comparison of radiometric constraints from texturally diversified feldspar and the multi-proxy lacustrine age model and vice versa. This study has investigated several grain-size fractions of feldspar from 13 volcaniclastic units. The feldspars show textural features that are visible in cathodoluminescence (CL) or back-scattered electron (BSE) images and can be subdivided into three dominant zoning-types: (1) compositional zoning, (2) round pseudo-oscillatory zoning and (3) resorbed and patchy zoning (Ginibre et al., 2004). Round pseudo-oscillatory zoning records a sensitive alternation of Fe and Ca that also reflects resorption processes. This is only visible in CL images. Compositional zoning reflects anticorrelated anorthite and orthoclase contents and is visible in BSE. Eleven inverse isochron ages from total fusion and three from stepwise heating analyses fit the age model. Four experiments resulted in older inverse isochron ages that do not concur with the model within 2 sigma uncertainties and that deviate from 1 ka to 17 ka minimum. C-and R-type zoning are interpreted as representing growth in magma chamber cupolas, as wall mushes, or in narrow conduits. Persistent compositions of PO-type crystals and abundant surfaces recording dissolution features correspond to formation within a magma chamber. C-type zoning and R-type zoning have revealed an irregular incorporation of melt and fluid inclusions. These two types of zoning in feldspar are interpreted as preferentially contributing either heterogeneously distributed excess 40Ar or inherited 40Ar to the deviating 40Ar/39Ar ages that are discussed in this study.

J	Möhring, M; Troitzsch, KG				Möhring, M; Troitzsch, KG			Lake Anderson revisited by agents	JASSS-THE JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL SOCIETIES AND SOCIAL SIMULATION												In our paper, we replicate simulation experiments carried out some 30 years by Jay M. Anderson who then tried to find out which measures should be taken avoid the eutrophication of a lake. In his DYNAMO model, he simulated the development of a lake under cultural eutrophication, i.e. mainly by the discharge of fertilisers from agriculture. He designed a number of policies applied them as an experimenter. In our model, some of the policies suggested by Anderson are taken by a government (or, alternatively, by a number of regional governments) who are in charge of the region(s) around the lake. We define rules which the authorities apply when they find that some of the variables which describe the state of the lake exceed (or fall below) certain thresholds. In a next step of refinement of the model, authorities will still define thresholds, but will not take all possible measures themselves, but charge the farmers with taxes when they exceed the fertiliser discharge limit. Farmers will then be endowed with rules which tell them whether it is better for them to pay the taxes or take appropriate measures against eutrophication themselves. The rationale of our paper is to show how stepwise refinement of a model can contribute to our understanding of the interactions between water resource decision makers of different levels and the natural environment. It part of our efforts to develop agent-based models for application to issues of water treatment - as is done in the FIRMA project(1).					; Troitzsch, Klaus/H-3712-2019	Troitzsch, Klaus/0000-0001-6266-4337; 													1460-7425					JUN	2001	4	3					U49	U65																WOS:000170034100004

Why New Zealand's Indigenous reconciliation process has failed to empower Ma over line ori fishers: Distributional, procedural, and recognition-based injustices	WORLD DEVELOPMENT												How is it that the New Zealand government's process for re-establishing Indigenous fishing rights has failed to deliver thriving Ma over bar ori fisheries? This paper examines why, at Te Waihora, a coastal lake, and site of one of the nation's longest running and best-funded state-Ma over bar ori co-governance agreements, Ma over bar ori fishers have been unable to use their rights to support their fishery. As of 2018, the lake's culturally and ecologically significant eel population was no longer commercially viable, a decline fishers have attributed to rampant dairy industry expansion upstream. Drawing on environmental justice literatures, we deploy a multi-dimensional framework to identify factors shaping possibilities for justice in the wake of rights reconciliation, as experienced by Ma over bar ori fishers, scientists, and leaders. We engage theories of political economic relations to interpret the implications of these experiences for environmental justice theory and politics. Ethnographic accounts demonstrate that the New Zealand government's process for re-establishing Ma over bar ori rights falls short of achieving distributional, procedural, and recognition-based dimensions of environmental justice, and that these effects are interlinked. In particular: (i) downstream fishers are placed to bear disproportionate costs of runoff from upstream land use change; (ii) Ma over bar ori fishers have little influence over governance decisions that affect land use; and (iii) government claims, including that Ma over bar ori should, "move beyond grievance mode," obscure logics for resistance. We suggest that the government's support for dairy industry expansion represents an attempt to mitigate crises of overaccumulation, characteristic of competitive markets. Unlike those who identify persistent injustice as a logic for turning away from the state, we argue that the recurring nature of these crises, and the role state organizations play in directing responses, indicates a rationale for continued engagement with state governing bodies to advance justice.

Manitoba. on the Hudson Bay coast. Chirdnomid populations in ponds have been examined because they are an important food source for ducks and shore birds, and are also widely used as ecological indicators of change. Seventy ponds were sampled during the summers of 1996 and 1997. They; wore located within a densely vegetated freshwater area, a relatively undamaged salt marsh and a degraded salt marsh where loss of vegetation had occurred as a result of goose foraging. Principal Components Analysis indicated that of 21 environmental descriptors, salinity was the primary gradient distinguishing ponds. Ponds in the degraded marsh that dried our early were the most saline (8 to 30 parts per thousand and those in the freshwater area the least saline (< 2<parts per thousand>). Densities of chironomids approached 22 000 m(-2) with the highest numbers recorded from salt-marsh ponds. Estimated chironomid biomass in all ponds ranged between 0.7 and 9.0 dry wt m(-2) which reflected differences in species composition of ponds. Freshwater ponds contained seven species fi sm six genera of which five did not occur in the other two habitats. Funds in the undamaged salt marsh contained five species h from five genera of which two were restricted to the area, while only the large-bodied Cricotopus (Isocladius) sp.. mast likely ornatus, was representative of ponds in the degraded salt marsh.																			1195-6860						2001	8	1					58	67		10.1080/11956860.2001.11682631	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11956860.2001.11682631													WOS:000168175800008
J	Seehausen, O				Seehausen, O			Patterns in fish radiation are compatible with Pleistocene desiccation of Lake Victoria and 14 600 year history for its cichlid species flock	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Geophysical data are currently being interpreted as evidence for a late Pleistocene desiccation of Lake Victoria and its refilling 14 600 years ago. This implies that between 500 and 1000 endemic cichlid fish species must have evolved in 14 600 years, the fastest large-scale species radiation known. A recent review concludes that biological evidence clearly rejects the postulated Pleistocene desiccation of the lake: a 14 600 year history would imply exceptionally high speciation rates across a range of unrelated fish taxa. To test this suggestion, I calculated speciation rates for all 41 phylogenetic lineages of fish in the lake. Except for one cichlid lineage, accepting a 14 600 year history does not require any speciation rates that fall outside the range observed in fishes in other young lakes around the world. The exceptional taxon is a lineage of haplochromine cichlids that is also known for its rapid speciation elsewhere. Moreover, since it is unknown how many founding species it has, it is not certain that its speciation rates are really outside the range observed in fishes in other young lakes. Fish speciation rates are generally faster in younger than in older lakes, and those in Lake Victoria, by far the largest of the young lakes of the world, are no exception. From the speciation rates and from biogeographical observations that Lake Victoria endemics, which lack close relatives within the lake basin, have such relatives in adjacent drainage systems that may have had Holocene connections to Lake Victoria, I conclude that the composition of the fish assemblage does not provide biological evidence against Pleistocene desiccation.

Hg, F-IO2 = 0.142), and lowered ambient pressure without hypoxia (normoxic hypobaria HYB; P-B = 434 mm Hg, F-IO2 = 0.296). Nine fit and healthy young men were exposed to these conditions for 10 h in a decompression chamber. Lake Louise AMS scores, urine collections, and blood samples were obtained every 3 h, with recovery measurements 2 h after exposure. AMS was significantly greater during ALT than HYX, as previously reported (J. Appl. Physiol. 81:1908-1910. 1996), because the combination of reduced P-B and P-O2 over the 10 h favored fluid retention by reducing urine volume, while plasma volume (PV) remained higher than during HYX At ALT the plasma Na+ fell significantly at 6 h, probably from dilution of extracellular fluid, and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) was highest (p = 0.006 versus HYB). The PV, urine flow, free water clearance, and plasma renin activity (PRA) rose significantly during recovery from ALT as AMS symptoms subsided, suggesting increased intravascular fluid and reduced adrenergic tone. During HYB, the plasma aldosterone (ALDO) and K+ levels were significantly elevated, and PRA was highest and ADH lowest, without fluid retention. During HYX, fluid balance was similar to HYB, but PV and ALDO were significantly lower, and ALDO increased significantly in recovery from HYX The fluid retention at ALT in AMS-susceptible subjects appears related to a synergistic interaction involving reduced P-B and ADH and ALDO.

The pattern and style of deglaciation at the Late Wisconsinan Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheet limits in northeastern British Columbia	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												This paper reports on the landform assemblages at the northern confluence of the Late Wisconsinan Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets with montane and piedmont glaciers in the northern Rockies and southern Mackenzie Mountains. Recent observations in northeastern British Columbia refine our knowledge of the pattern and style of ice sheet retreat, glacial lake formation, and meltwater drainage. At the onset of deglaciation, confluent Laurentide and Cordilleran terminal ice margins lay between 59 degrees N, 124 degrees 30'Wand 60 degrees N, 125 degrees 15'W. From this terminal limit, ice sheets retreated into north-central British Columbia and Yukon Territory, with remnant Cordilleran ice and montane glaciers confined to mountain valleys and the Liard Plateau. Distinctive end moraines are not associated with the retreat of Cordilleran ice in these areas. Laurentide ice retreated northeastward from uplands and the plateaus; then separated into lobes occupying the Fort Nelson and Petitot river valleys. Ice-retreat landforms include recessional end moraines (sometimes overridden and drumlinized), hill-hole pairs, crevasse-fill deposits, De Geer-like ribbed till ridges, hummocky moraines, kames, meltwater features, and glacial lake deposits that fall within the elevation range of glacial Lake Liard and glacial Lake Fort Nelson (ca. 840-380 m). Meltwater and sediment transport into glacial lakes Fort Nelson, Liard, Nahanni, and Mackenzie was sustained by remnant ice in the Liard River and Fort Nelson River drainage basins until the end of glaciation. Optical dating of sand from stabilized parabolic dunes on the Liard Plateau indicates that proglacial conditions, lake formation, and drainage began before 13.0 +/- 0.5 ka (calendar years). The Petitot, Fort Nelson, and Liard rivers all occupy spillways incised into glacial deposits and bedrock by meltwater overflow from glacial lakes Peace and Hay.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				JAN	2017	54	1					52	75		10.1139/cjes-2016-0066	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjes-2016-0066													WOS:000392104800004

ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Underwater light is a key factor that affects the growth of submerged macrophytes. However, the responses of different growth forms of submerged macrophytes to light quality remain unclear. The morphological, physiological, photosynthetic, and stoichiometric responses of erect Potamogeton crispus (P. P. crispus) ) and low- canopy Elodea nuttallii (E. E. nuttallii) ) to six different light qualities (white light, R/B = 1:8, 1: 4, 1:1, 4:1, 8:1) were studied by a control experiment. (1) No significant differences were observed in the germination number, leaf length, and leaf width of P. crispus under different light qualities (p p >0.05). Both P. crispus and E. nuttallii produced greater plant heights, more leaves and branches under more red light (4:1, 8:1), which was beneficial for the extension of leaves. Under white light, the germination number of P. crispus, , adventitious roots of E. nuttallii, , and branch number of P. crispus and E. nuttallii were the lowest. (2) Compared to red light, more blue light (1:4, 1:8) was more conducive to the synthesis of photosynthetic pigments. However, excessive blue and red light was not conducive to the accumulation of pigments. The result of malondialdehyde showed that the physiological stress induced by blue light in P. crispus and E. nuttallii was stronger. (3) The N:P, C:N, and C:P ratios of P. crispus and E. nuttallii were higher under more red light, which was beneficial for the synthesis of nutrients in two submerged macrophy; however, the contents of TN and TP in E. nuttallii were higher under more blue light. Two different growth forms of submerged macrophytes grew better under red light, and better adapted to the eutrophic water dominated by red light. However, for aquatic restoration, other submerged macrophytes need to be supplemented after the water quality is improved.

J	Alexandrov, AA				Alexandrov, A. A.			The Rudon, the Turunt and the Hesin Rivers in the Antique Tradition	STRATUM PLUS												The tradition to use ancient nomination for the Eastern European rivers in the Baltic basin had persisted within the period covering the classic antiquity, starting with the works of Hesiod, Aeschilus, Euripides and Herodotus, and till the latest interpolations in 16th-17th centuries. Most distinctly, this tradition is represented in Ptolemy's works in the 2nd century AD, and Marcianus's in the 4th century AD. From the west to the east, they mention: the Vistula, the Chron, the Rudon, the Turunt, the Hesin. They are the rivers: the Vistula, the Neman, the Western Dvina and the two water ways: the Turunt - starting from the Polota River to its falling into the Western Dvina, and further through the portage system to the upper reaches of the Velikaya River, then making a turn to the left and up along the Kudeb River, then through a portage system reaching the source of the Smolka River, further along the Bdyokha, and further through Chudskoe Lake reaching the Baltic area. The Hesin waterway starts from the source of the Lovat' River to its confluence with the Ilmen' Lake, then along the Volkhov River as far as its confluence with the Ladoga, and further along the Neva River as far as its confluence with the Baltic Sea. In this context, of some interest is Propertius's account of the 1st century BC of some Venetian Eridanos, which is logically assumed to be the Eridanos-Rudon-Western Dvina.																			1608-9057	1857-3533					2018		5					53	64																WOS:000457399200007

TRACE METAL DISTRIBUTION IN PHYTOPLANKTON- AND MACROPHYTE-DOMINATED ZONES OF A LARGE, EUTROPHIC FRESHWATER LAKE, TAIHU	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												Phytoplankton and macrophytes are major primary producers and play important roles in driving the biogeochemical cycling of trace metals in aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we examined the distribution of trace metals in lake water and sediments of different lake zones (phytoplankton- and macrophyte-dominated) in a large, shallow, eutrophic freshwater lake in summer. The labile metal concentrations in lake water were determined with diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) technique. Metal concentrations in bloom assemblages and macrophyte materials were measured. The results demonstrated that dissolved metal concentrations exhibited dramatically different distribution patterns in different lake zones, whereas metal concentrations in sediments were less influenced. Cadmium (Cd) was highly accumulated by Microcystis (cyanobacteria) bloom assemblages, suggesting that the decay and deposition of Microcystis-bloom detritus may contribute to the enriched Cd in the phytoplankton-dominated lake zone. The dissolved and labile copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) concentrations were quite low in macrophyte-dominated zone, which may be attributed to the bioaccumulation of metals by aquatic macrophytes. Concentrations of labile chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb) in lake water were less influenced by environmental factors, which could be attributed to the higher affinity of these two metals with the sediment particles. Overall, the results of this study implied that different ecological types might have different influences on the transportation and fate of trace metals in aquatic environments, and different metals were characterized with dissimilar cycling behaviors.

J	Statham, PJ; Skidmore, M; Tranter, M				Statham, Peter J.; Skidmore, Mark; Tranter, Martyn			Inputs of glacially derived dissolved and colloidal iron to the coastal ocean and implications for primary productivity	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Glacial meltwaters draining shield bedrock under the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) contain < 0.4 mu m "total dissolved'' Fe (TDFe) with an average flow weighted concentration of similar to 53 nM. The concentrations of < 0.03 and 0.03-0.4 mu m Fe vary over the ablation period, with weighted means for each of these fractions being respectively 22.4 nM and 30.8 nM. These concentrations are lower estimates as an adjacent larger glacier (a more representative source of glacial meltwater) had higher dissolved Fe concentrations, and reactions of meltwaters with proglacial sediments could also enhance dissolved Fe concentrations. This source of TDFe is additional to the reactive (oxyhydr) oxide phases identified by Raiswell et al. (2006) that are also introduced to adjacent polar seas from glaciers. The Fe concentrations in the shield bedrock underlying the GIS are lower than those of other crustal rocks (4.0% cf. 6.2%), but we argue that these Fe concentrations are not limiting on the total dissolved Fe concentrations we measure. The biogeochemical weathering processes operating on the subglacial debris and suspended sediment in our catchment are likely to be similar to those in other glaciated catchments. Therefore the meltwater Fe concentrations reported here can be used to give a first estimate of global fluxes of meltwater dissolved Fe to coastal polar waters. A lower estimate of the global flux of TDFe from glacial meltwaters is similar to 75 x 10 6 moles Fe/a. This glacial meltwater input of Fe to adjacent polar waters will be greatest around Greenland where there are highest annual meltwater discharges. However, the greatest impact of this source of glacial meltwater Fe is anticipated to be in Antarctic high nutrient low chlorophyll (HNLC) waters where phytoplankton productivity is typically limited by availability of Fe. For Antarctic waters the estimated meltwater Fe (TDFe) input is about 10% of that suggested to come from sea ice melting, but glacial inputs continue throughout the austral summer ablation period after sea ice melt is complete.

The ratio of low to high molecular-weight n-alkanes (L/H) and the concentration of n-alkanes indicated that organic matters in the sediments were derived from the mixture of both marine and terrestrial sources, but dominated by marine autochthonous input over the past 20 ka. Total n-alkanes were higher during the last glacial stage relative to the interglacial stage, implying the low sea level and the strengthened East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) during the glacial time. The delta C-13(alk) data indicated that the terrestrial plants on the adjacent continent of the present study area were dominated by C-3 plants during the Holocene and experienced the expansion of C-4 plants during the last glacial period. This similar result can be proved by the chain length parameter of n-alkanes (C-31/C-27, ACL) and the content of the herb pollen. In addition, n-alkanes distributions and C4 vegetation proportion calculated by delta C-13 of long-chain n-alkanes in the core STD235 recorded a short arid duration paralleled by the Heinrich event 1. Thereby we deduced that the occurrence of the dry event and the variation of regional vegetation community at the adjacent lands of the northern SCS were likely under the influence of the climate change emanated from the boreal high-latitudes.

We analysed the development of submerged macrophytes in Lake Fure, Denmark, experiencing a 30-fold increase of phosphorus input from year 1900 to 1970 and a subsequent decline to twice the 1900 level in 2005. Nutrient enrichment stimulated phytoplankton growth and restricted macrophyte distribution by reducing water transparency from a summer mean of 5-6 m in the early 1900s to a minimum of 1.6 m at the peak of eutrophication, followed by recovery to a recent maximum of 4.1 m. 2. Macrophyte occurrence and abundance changed in accordance with altered environmental conditions and species' life-history traits. Small angiosperms, mosses and characeans disappeared in the 1970s to 1980s, along with all vegetation in deeper waters (5-8 m), and have only partly recovered recently. Tall angiosperms became dominant while small species vanished. All 10 characeans originally present disappeared at the peak of eutrophication, but four reappeared. Mesotrophic macroalgae were replaced by hypertrophic species whose dominance has persisted. 3. Species richness decreased from 37 to 13 species at the peak of eutrophication, before returning to 25 species during the recent recovery. Species richness increased with transparency because deeper growth generates more niches. 4. Reduction of species distribution and richness has been reversible following nutrient reduction of the long eutrophied lake, whereas species composition and abundance have not. The historical legacy of community composition is strong, as reflected by closer correlations to time than to measures of nitrogen and phosphorus availability and water transparency. 5. Synthesis. Although phosphorus input may decline further, reassembly of the original macrophyte community will face difficulties. Oligotrophic freshwater species have become rare throughout Denmark, reducing the probability of recolonization. Species reaching Lake Fure may fail to establish because sediments have become richer in nutrients and organic matter and less consolidated, while shading and competition have increased from emergent reeds, tall submerged angiosperms and fast-growing macroalgae.

In ascending stratigraphic order, these lowstands occurred at about 11200 BP, associated with the Kirkfield outlet from early Lake Algonquin; 10 200 - 9900 BP, associated with the post-Algonquin lake level fall; 9800-9050 BP, the most extreme lowstand, associated with the main Stanley - Hough drawdown; and 7800-7450 BP. The concomitant highstands are Lake Algonquin, from about 11 200 - 10 200 BP; early Lake Mattawa, between 9600 and 9350 BP; the main Mattawa phase, 9050-7800 BP; and the Nipissing highstand, at about 4700 BP. Isotopic and paleoecological data show that all of the lowstands are characterized by cold, dilute, and isotopically very light(< -20%0) waters from the melting Laurentian ice cap. Highstands, on the other hand, are characterized by higher dissolved solid concentrations and a much smaller meltwater component. Oxygen isotope values of the waters in these lakes were -15 to -17%0 in Lake Algonquin, -13 to -14%0 for the early and middle Mattawa stages, -9 to -8%0 for the main Mattawa stage, and -7%0 for modern waters. This association of lowstands and not highstands with isotopically light waters is a new contribution to early Holocene hydrology of the Great Lakes. The Younger Dryas cool episode is coeval with the Lake Algonquin highstand and a younger cool episode is generally coeval with the Mattawa highstand. This supports the hypothesis of C.F.M. Lewis and T.W. Anderson that these large cold lakes were responsible for regional cooling during the early Holocene.

The effects of solar irradiation changes on the migration of the Congo Air Boundary and water levels of paleo-Lake Suguta, Northern Kenya Rift, during the African Humid Period (15-5 ka BP)	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The water-level record from the 300 m deep paleo-lake Suguta (Northern Kenya Rift) during the African Humid Period (AHP, 15-5 ka BP) helps to explain decadal to centennial intensity variations in the West African Monsoon (WAM) and the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM). This water-level record was derived from three different sources: (1) grain size variations in radiocarbon dated and reservoir corrected lacustrine sediments, (2) the altitudes and ages of paleo-shorelines within the basin, and (3) the results of hydro-balance modeling, providing important insights into the character of water level variations (abrupt or gradual) in the amplifier paleo-Lake Suguta. The results of these comprehensive analyses suggest that the AHP highstand in the Suguta Valley was the direct consequence of a northeastwards shift in the Congo Air Boundary (CAB), which was in turn caused by an enhanced atmospheric pressure gradient between East Africa and India during a northern hemisphere insolation maximum. Rapidly decreasing water levels of up to 90 m over less than a hundred years are best explained by changes in solar irradiation either reducing the East African-Indian atmospheric pressure gradient and preventing the CAB from reaching the study area, or reducing the overall humidity in the atmosphere, or a combination of both these effects. In contrast, although not well documented in our record we hypothesize a gradual end of the AHP despite an abrupt change in the source of precipitation when a decreasing pressure gradient between Asia and Africa prevented the CAB from reaching the Suguta Valley. The abruptness was probably buffered by a contemporaneous change in precession producing an insolation maximum at the equator during October. Whether or not this is the case, the water-level record from the Suguta Valley demonstrates the importance of both orbitally-controlled insolation variations and short-term changes in solar irradiation as factors affecting the significant water level variations in East African rift lakes.

Evaluating the role of groundwater in circulation and thermal structure within a deep inland lake	ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES												Groundwater levels in many aquifers are declining due to anthropogenic activities such as increased highcapacity pumping for agriculture or climate-related decreases in natural recharge rates or a combination of factors. At the same time, lake surface temperatures are on the rise in response to a warming climate. As a first step toward evaluating the impacts of declining groundwater levels and warming lake surface temperatures on coupled biophysical processes in lakes, we evaluate the role played by groundwater in circulation and thermal structure within Gull Lake, a deep, dimictic, inland lake in Michigan, USA. A three-dimensional, unstructured grid hydrodynamic model was developed to investigate physical processes in the lake during the summer stratified period. We used high-resolution Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler observations of currents and lake levels as well as temperature data from thermistor chains to test the numerical models. The quality of meteorological forcing fields reconstructed using data from a network of weather stations surrounding the lake were assessed using outputs from a mesoscale numerical weather forecasting model, Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) and vice versa. Model descriptions of internal heating due to the penetration of shortwave radiation as well as turbulent mixing within the water column were improved using in situ observations. Our results indicate that meteorological forcing fields, carefully reconstructed using WRF model outputs, can provide results comparable to those obtained from a network of weather station data, an important conclusion for modeling lakes in remote parts of the world. The observed low hypolimnetic temperatures could only be explained by taking the groundwater contribution into account and water column temperatures will increase by 8 degrees C or more on average if the groundwater contribution is absent. These results have implications for a number of key biophysical processes that control the structure and function of lake ecosystems including the growth rates of algae, dissolved inorganic nitrogen levels in the lake as well as the depletion of oxygen in deeper layers.

J	Zorn, TG				Zorn, Troy G.			Contribution of Hatchery-Reared Walleyes to Populations in Northern Green Bay, Lake Michigan	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUACULTURE												The effectiveness of stocking hatchery-reared Walleyes Sander vitreus to supplement native populations in large, open systems like the Great Lakes has not been thoroughly evaluated. I quantified recent contributions of stocked Walleye fingerlings to populations in Little Bay de Noc (LBDN) and Big Bay de Noc (BBDN) in northern Green Bay, Lake Michigan. Oxytetracycline-marked Walleye fingerlings were stocked in June, and late summer gill-net and night-time boat electrofishing surveys were used to index Walleye year-class abundance and collect juvenile Walleyes for hatchery mark evaluation. For the 2004-2009 year-classes, 76% of the age-0 to age-3 Walleyes examined from LBDN were of wild origin and 62% in BBDN were naturally reproduced fish. Survey catch rates of juvenile Walleyes were similar for stocked and nonstocked year-classes. Assessment catch rates of age-1 and age-2 Walleyes differed significantly by location, with average catch rates in LBDN often being ten times higher than those in BBDN. Age-0 Walleyes persisted to older ages and were well-represented at numerous sampling locations in LBDN, but few age-1 and older Walleyes were caught in BBDN. The differences in growth between hatchery-reared and wild Walleyes were minor compared with the differences between bays. Based on stocking records and creel estimates available since 1985, the harvest rate of Walleyes was not significantly correlated to the numbers of Walleyes stocked 4-6 years earlier in LBDN or BBDN. Despite low stocking rates, stocked fish likely provided some contribution (though not a statistically significant one) to Walleye year-classes and the sport fishery in LBDN, but their contribution in BBDN was less apparent. Managers should weigh the trade-offs of supplemental stocking in Great Lakes waters when considering requests for hatchery Walleyes in smaller lakes and rivers, especially when stocking resources are limited.																			1522-2055	1548-8454					2015	77	3					409	422		10.1080/15222055.2015.1044056	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15222055.2015.1044056													WOS:000359951100017

The analysis of 195 lava hows reveals six instances of near-zero inclination and two instances of fully negative inclination (reverse polarity) within an otherwise normal-polarity core. In particular, flow unit 23 (similar to 178 m depth) records a horizontal inclination and may be associated with the Laschamp event; flow units 40 and 42 (similar to 260 m depth) record negative inclinations and are close in age to the Flake event; and flow unit 55 (similar to 320 m depth) records a negative inclination with a relative declination change of similar to 75 degrees with respect to the overlying flow and is probably the Jamaica/Biwa I/Pringle Falls event. The five instances of shallow inclination found below 400 m depth appear to have resulted from long-term secular variation as they art: part of inclination swings between similar to 0 degrees and similar to 60 degrees with a periodicity of similar to 10-50 kyr. In contrast, the inclination shifts at similar to 178 m and similar to 320 m depths significantly deviate from long-term trends, suggesting the existence of at least two independent processes producing time variations of the geomagnetic field. The secular variation has a mean of 30.9 degrees (alpha(95) = 2.27 degrees), which is significantly shallower than the expected dipole mean of 36 degrees. The dispersion (sigma = 12.5 degrees) agrees with global paleosecular variation data for 0-5 Ma and secular variation models.

R.; Prieto, Jerome; Bruesch, Dennis			Middle-late Miocene palaeoenvironments, palynological data and a fossil fish Lagerstatte from the Central Kenya Rift (East Africa)	GEOLOGICAL MAGAZINE												The Miocene epoch was a time of major change in the East African Rift System (EARS) as forest habitats were transformed into grasslands and hominids appeared in the landscape. Here we provide new sedimentological and palynological data on the middle-upper Miocene Ngorora Formation (Tugen Hills, Central Kenya Rift, EARS), together with clay mineral characterizations, mammal finds and a description of the Ngorora fish Lagerstatte. Furthermore, we introduce a revised age of c. 13.3 Ma for the onset of the Ngorora Formation. The older part of the Ngorora Formation (c. 13.3-12 Ma) records low-energy settings of lakes, floodplains and palaeosols, and evidence of analcime indicates that lakes were alkaline. The palynomorph spectrum consists of tree pollen (Juniperus, Podocarpus), Euphorbiaceae pollen (Acalypha, Croton) and herbaceous pollen of Poaceae and Asteraceae, suggestive of wooded grasslands or grassy woodlands. Alkaline lakes, floodplains and palaeosols continue upsection (c. 12-9 Ma), but environmental fluctuations become more dynamic. Paucity of palynomorphs and the presence of an equid may point to progressively drier conditions. A total of about 500 articulated fish fossils were recovered from distinctive layers of almost all sections studied and represent different lineages of the Haplotilapiines (Pseudocrenilabrinae, Cichlidae). Some of the fish kills may be attributable to rapid water acidification and/or asphyxiation by episodic ash falls. Repeated instances of abrupt change in water depth in many sections are more likely to be due to synsedimentary tectonic activity of the Central Kenya Rift than to climatic variation. Overall, the preservation of the Ngorora fish Lagerstatte resulted from the interplay of tectonics, formation of alkaline lakes and explosive volcanism. As records of grasslands that pre-date late Miocene time are rare, our finding of middle Miocene (12-13 Ma) grassy savannah in the Central Kenya Rift is also relevant to models of human evolution in East Africa.

A paleoseismic transect across the northwestern Basin and Range Province, northwestern Nevada and northeastern California, USA	GEOSPHERE												We use new and existing data to compile a record of similar to 18 latest Quaternary large-magnitude surface-rupturing earthquakes on 7 fault zones in the northwestern Basin and Range Province of northwestern Nevada and northeastern California. The most recent earthquake on all faults postdates the ca. 18-15 ka last glacial highstand of pluvial Lake Lahontan and other pluvial lakes in the region. These lacustrine data provide a window in which we calculate latest Quaternary vertical slip rates and compare them with rates of modern deformation in a global positioning system (GPS) transect spanning the region. Average vertical slip rates on these fault zones range from 0.1 to 0.8 mm/yr and total similar to 2 mm/yr across a 265-km-wide transect from near Paradise Valley, Nevada, to the Warner Mountains in California. We converted vertical slip rates to horizontal extension rates using fault dips of 30 degrees-60 degrees, and then compared the extension rates to GPS-derived rates of modern (last 7-9 yr) deformation. Our preferred fault dip values (45 degrees-55 degrees) yield estimated longterm extension rates (1.3-1.9 mm/yr) that underestimate our modern rate (2.4 mm/yr) by similar to 21%-46%. The most likely sources of this underestimate are geologically unrecognizable deformation from moderate-sized earthquakes and unaccounted-for coseismic off-fault deformation from large surface-rupturing earthquakes. However, fault dip values of <= 40 degrees yield long-term rates comparable to or greater than modern rates, so an alternative explanation is that fault dips are closer to 40 degrees than our preferred values. We speculate that the large component of right-lateral shear apparent in the GPS signal is partitioned on faults with primary strike-slip displacement, such as the Long Valley fault zone, and as not easily detected oblique slip on favorably oriented normal faults in the region.					; Briggs, Richard/A-1348-2013	Mahan, Shannon/0000-0001-5214-7774; Briggs, Richard/0000-0001-8108-0046; Angster, Stephen/0000-0001-9250-8415													1553-040X					JUN	2017	13	3					782	810		10.1130/GES01380.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/GES01380.1													WOS:000404585600009

Little is known about freshwater unicellular cyanobacteria Synechococcus spp. at the genomic level, despite being recognised of considerable ecological importance in aquatic ecosystems. So far, it has not been shown whether these unicellular picocyanobacteria have the potential for nitrogen fixation. Here, we present the draft-genome of the new pink-pigmented Synechococcus-like strain Vulcanococcus limneticus. sp. nov., isolated from the volcanic Lake Albano (Central Italy). Results: The novel species Vulcanococcus limneticus sp. nov. falls inside the sub-cluster 5.2, close to the estuarine/marine strains in a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree generated with 259 marker genes with representatives from marine, brackish, euryhaline and freshwater habitats. V. limneticus sp. nov. possesses a complete nitrogenase and nif operon. In an experimental setup under nitrogen limiting and non-limiting conditions, growth was observed in both cases. However, the nitrogenase genes (nifHDK) were not transcribed, i.e., V. limneticus sp. nov. did not fix nitrogen, but instead degraded the phycobilisomes to produce sufficient amounts of ammonia. Moreover, the strain encoded many other pathways to incorporate ammonia, nitrate and sulphate, which are energetically less expensive for the cell than fixing nitrogen. The association of the nif operon to a genomic island, the relatively high amount of mobile genetic elements (52 transposases) and the lower observed GC content of V. limneticus sp. nov. nif operon (60.54%) compared to the average of the strain (68.35%) support the theory that this planktonic strain may have obtained, at some point of its evolution, the nif operon by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from a filamentous or heterocystous cyanobacterium. Conclusions: In this study, we describe the novel species Vulcanococcus limneticus sp. nov., which possesses a complete nif operon for nitrogen fixation. The finding that in our experimental conditions V. limneticus sp. nov. did not express the nifHDK genes led us to reconsider the actual ecological meaning of these accessory genes located in genomic island that have possibly been acquired via HGT.

J	MATTESON, MR				MATTESON, MR			LIFE HISTORY OF ELLIPTIO COMPLANATUS (DILLWYN, 1817)	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Very little movement was observed during the winter. Little erosion of shell was noted in several years. Sperm are present at all times of the year in the testicular acini but they increase in numbers as the breeding season approaches. The sperm ducts are ciliated. They are normally free from sperm other than just previous to the breeding season. Sperm enter the water from late April to mid June, with max. liberation in mid May. Primary oocytes were found filling the ovarian ducts in mid May on their way to the suprabranchial chambers where fertilization occurs. Very soon after the secondary oOcytes have left, the ovarian acini begin development of new secondary oOcytes which arise on stalks from oOgonia located in the germinative epithelium which lines each ovarian acinus. By midsummer, production of the following breeding season''s quota is completed. Development of the secondary oOcytes remains arrested until fertilization. Although fertilization chiefly occurs in the suprabranchian chambers, sperm were found in the ovarian ducts. The entire outer gill acts as a marsupium. The volume of the embryo changes little, or none, during its stay in the marsupium. Development from zygote to glochidium requires about 2 weeks. The fertilization membrane disintegrates at the time of spawning. Normally, the glochidia are shed individually. The spawning season is June 15 to July 15. The best fish infections were obtained by administering glochidia artifically. Temp. is an important factor at this period. All available spp. of fish were parasitized. Only Perca flavescens allowed development of immature mussels. This occurred at the end of 18 days of en-cystment in the gill. There is no gain in size during encystment. The immature mussel possesses a bilobate and ciliated foot which is adhesive. This condition is lost within a few days. The immature mussel grows most during its 2d and 3d years, almost none, after 12 years. E. complanatus exhibits no sexual dimorphism and is dioecious. It is most abundant on a substratum composed of clay, which contains marl and fine sand. It is found at a greater depth than the other mussels of that locality. Its geogr. distr. extends along the Atlantic seaboard from n. Florida to Cape Breton I., St. Lawrence R., to the Great Lakes. Field work on the study was done on the Ocqueoc R. system, the only place where E. complanatus occurs in the lower peninsula of Michigan.																			0003-0031	1938-4238					1948	40	3					690	723		10.2307/2421491	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2421491													WOS:A1948YA69800003
J	Çelik, M; Sari, A				Çelik, M; Sari, A			Geochemistry of formation waters from upper Cretaceous calcareous rocks of southeast Turkey	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA												Hydrochemical and isotopic study of groundwaters of Adiyaman region in Turkey is undertaken to classify groundwaters on the basis of their chemical characteristics, and examine their origin. The compositions of groundwaters in the calcareous rocks of the Adiyaman region reflect different combinations of fresh and saline groundwaters. The chemistry of the shallow groundwaters of Komur Municipality Spring (KS) and well of General Directorate of Adiyaman District (FG), and, especially of the major cations, is controlled by local rock compositions. While these are immature groundwaters geochemically, formation waters are generally mature groundwaters. Based on TDS classification, FG, KS and, Ataturk Dam Lake (ADL) samples are of fresh water (0-1000 ppm), Adiyaman (A44) and Cemberlitas (C14) formation water samples are of brackish water (1000-10000 ppm), and other formation waters are of connate water (10000-30000 ppm). Adiyaman formation waters (A32 and A44) have a sequence of rCl>rHCO(3)>rSO(4) and are undersaturated with respect to CaSO4. Formation waters of other oil fields have a sequence of rCl>rSO(4)>rHCO(3) and are oversaturated with respect to CaSO4. Conservative ions in formation waters, such as Cl and Br, were used together with total dissolved solids in determining the evolution of waters and in the evaluation of mixing. In this respect, there is a transition between fresh and connate waters. It is concluded that Adiyaman and Cemberlitas formation waters show greater mixing with fresh groundwaters than other formation waters of the Adiyaman region.																			0016-7622					MAY	2002	59	5					419	430																WOS:000175408100004

The first four drain predominantly catchments with Phanerozoic siliciclastic rocks, while the latter two dewater Cretaceous carbonate basins. Together, the rivers account for similar to 11 percent of the Rhine water, and they reflect various stages of pollution, from a moderately polluted Sieg and Ruhr to the heavily damaged Emscher. The delta(18)O(H2O) of -8.5 +/- 1.5 permil SMOW suggests that summer recharge into local aquifers is the main source of water in these rivers. Down-stream, the water becomes enriched in O-18, by similar to 2 permil, due to low altitude precipitation and because of evaporation, particularly in artificial lakes. However thermal fractionation, when water is utilized for cooling in power stations and smelters, also contributes to this trend. State-wide, and down-stream within rivers, the increasing pollution levels are characterized by rising salt concentrations (from normal riverine values up to a third of seawater), by up to two orders of magnitude CO2 overpressures, oxygen depletion, and enhanced nutrient concentrations. The delta(13)C(DIC) demonstrate that microbial respiration of C-org in soil/groundwater systems accounts for about 50 to 100 percent of the entire DIG, with the higher values typical of more polluted ecosystems. Evasion of gaseous CO2 into the atmosphere and microbial nitrification are the most important processes for the riverine aquatic cycles of carbon and nitrogen, resulting in more advanced dissipation of CO2 and NH4+ in the less polluted ecosystems. Denitrification may fuel generation of some ''excess'' CO2 only in the highly polluted ecosystems, such as the Emscher.

D.; Sotin, Christophe			Tidal Currents Detected in Kraken Mare Straits from Cassini VIMS Sun Glitter Observations	PLANETARY SCIENCE JOURNAL												We present Cassini Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) observations of sun glitter-wave-induced reflections from a liquid surface offset from a specular point-on Kraken Mare. Sun glitter reveals rough sea surfaces around Kraken Mare, namely the coasts and narrow straits. The sun glitter observations indicate wave activity driven by the winds and tidal currents in Kraken Mare during northern summer. T104 Cassini VIMS observations show three sun glitter features in Bayta Fretum indicative of variegated wave fields. We cannot uniquely determine one source for the coastal Bayta waves, but we lean toward the interpretation of surface winds, because tidal currents should be too weak to generate capillary-gravity waves in Bayta Fretum. T105 and T110 observations reveal wave fields in the straits of Seldon Fretum, Lulworth Sinus, and Tunu Sinus that likely originate from the constriction of tidal currents. Coastlines of Bermoothes and Hufaidh Insulae adjoin rough sea surfaces, suggesting a complex interplay of wind-roughened seas and localized tidal currents. Bermoothes and Hufaidh Insulae may share characteristics of either the Torres Strait off Australia or the angstrom land region of Finland, summarized as an island-dense strait with shallow bathymetry that hosts complex surface circulation patterns. Hufaidh Insulae could host seafloor bedforms formed by tidal currents with an abundant sediment supply, similar to the Torres Strait. The coastlines of Hufaidh and Bermoothes Insulae likely host ria or flooded coastal inlets, suggesting that the Insulae may be local peaks of primordial crust isolated by an episode of sea-level rise or tectonic uplift.

This knowledge gap is significant given that currently forest ecosystems are expanding in Europe as a consequence of global change. Annually laminated sediments were extracted from two small lowland lakes (Moossee 521 m a.s.l.; Burgaschisee 465 m a.s.l.) on the Swiss Plateau. We combine high-resolution palaeoecological and quantitative analyses to assess changes in vegetation during the Neolithic. We test for regionally synchronous land-use phases and plant successional patterns that may originate from complex interactions between human and climatic impacts. Mixed Fagus sylvatica forests dominated the Swiss Plateau vegetation over millennia. During the period 6,500-4,200 cal year bp, pronounced forest disruptions accompanied by increased fire and agricultural activities occurred at c. 6,400-6,000 cal year bp, 5,750-5,550 cal year bp, around 5,400 cal year bp and at 5,100-4,600 cal year bp. Biodiversity increased during these land-use phases, likely in response to the creation of new open habitats. After decades to centuries of land-use, arboreal vegetation re-expanded. In a first succession stage, heliophilous Corylus avellana shrubs were replaced by pioneer Betula trees. These open arboreal communities were out-competed within 150-200 years by late-successional F. sylvatica and Abies alba forests. Most strikingly, cross-correlations show that these successions occurred synchronously (+/- 11 years) and repeatedly over large areas (>1,000 km(2)) and millennia. Synthesis. First notable human impact shaped the primeval mixed Fagus sylvatica forests in Central Europe from c. 6,800-6,500 cal year bp on. Agrarian societies were susceptible to climate changes and we hypothesize that climate-induced, simultaneous agricultural expansion and contraction phases resulted in synchronous regional forest successions. Currently, forests are expanding in Central Europe as a result of land abandonment in marginal areas. Our results imply that mixed Fagus sylvatica forests with Abies alba and Quercus may re-expand rapidly in these areas, if climate conditions will remain within the range of the mid-Holocene climatic variability (with summers c. +1-2 degrees C warmer than today).

The model is driven by daily climate data, derived by cubic-spline interpolation from monthly mean data, and was run for periods of 8 years (Kirjaku) up to 30 years (Viljandi). Simulated surface water temperature is in good agreement with observations: mean differences between simulated and observed temperatures are from -0.8-degrees-C to + 0.1-degrees-C. The simulated duration of snow and ice cover is comparable with observed. However, the model generally underpredicts ice thickness and overpredicts snow depth. Sensitivity analyses suggest that the model results are robust across a wide range (0.1-2.0 m-1) of lake extinction coefficient: surface temperature differs by less than 0.5-degrees-C between extreme values of the extinction coefficient. The model results are more sensitive to snow and ice albedos. However, changing the snow (0.2-0.9) and ice (0.15-0.55) albedos within realistic ranges does not improve the simulations of snow depth and ice thickness. The underestimation of ice thickness is correlated with the overestimation of snow cover, since a thick snow layer insulates the ice and limits ice formation. The overestimation of snow cover results from the assumption that all the simulated winter precipitation occurs as snow, a direct consequence of using daily climate data derived by interpolation from mean monthly data.					; Vassiljev, Juri/J-2597-2018; Bartlein, Patrick/E-4643-2011; Harrison, Sandy/ADX-4692-2022; Vassiljev, Jüri/J-2597-2018	Harrison, Sandy/0000-0001-5687-1903; Vassiljev, Juri/0000-0002-1518-2041; Bartlein, Patrick/0000-0001-7657-5685; 													0022-1694					DEC 1	1994	163	1-2					107	123		10.1016/0022-1694(94)90025-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-1694(94)90025-6													WOS:A1994QA08700007

Round up the unusual suspects: Near-Earth Asteroid 17274 (2000 LC16) a plausible D-type parent body of the Tagish Lake meteorite	ICARUS												Asteroids are the origin point for most meteorites impacting Earth. Terrestrial meteorite samples provide evidence of what actually occurred in the early solar system at the formation location of the meteorite, and when it occurred. The ability to connect a meteorite sample to an asteroid parent body provides its starting location as a meteoroid. To date, only a handful of chondritic meteorite types have been credibly connected to an asteroid parent. For the past two decades, D-type asteroids, a dark, spectrally reddish, and featureless taxonomic type have been speculated to be the parent body of the tiny family of ungrouped chondrites. These include the Tagish Lake Meteorite (TLM), a similar to 4 m meteorite "fall" in Canada's Yukon territory recovered in 2000. The quest to identify the TLM parent has been a baffling one as D-type asteroids are dominant among the Jovian Trojans, rare in main asteroid belt, and extremely rare in the inner asteroid belt as well as Near-Earth space. This study employed Near Infrared (NIR) spectra (0.7-2.45 mu m) of 86 D-types and a variety of analysis techniques including visual analysis, slope analysis, curve fitting, Fr echet analysis, dynamical analysis and Shkuratov radiative transfer theory to search for the TLM parent body. Sixteen TLM samples from the NASA Reflectance Experiment Laboratory (RELAB) plus five additional mineralogically well-constrained samples measured using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Rietveld refinement were compared to D-type asteroid spectra. Our results indicate, out of several promising candidates, Near-Earth asteroid 17274 (2006 LC16), a similar to 3 km diameter Amor asteroid is a plausible parent body for TLM.

This cyanobacterium was able to perform sulfide-dependent anoxygenic photosynthesis and its oxygenic photosynthesis was relatively insensitive to sulfide. The other strains studied were AP1 and AO21, identified respectively as Pseudanabaena sp, and Oscillatoria cf. tenuis, populations of which were present only in epilimnetic waters at low population densities. Pseudanabaena sp. also carried out anoxygenic photosynthesis, but oxygenic photosynthesis was totally inhibited by 0.5 mM sulfide. Oscillatoria cf, tenuis lost most of its oxygenic photosynthetic capacity when submitted to 0.1 mM sulfide and anoxygenic photosynthesis accounted for less than 20% of sulfide-free controls. In addition to different photosynthetic capabilities, the three cyanobacteria exhibited differences in light-harvesting photosynthetic accessory pigments. Pigment analysis of cultures grown under different light conditions showed the capacity of Oscillatoria cf. ornata AO11 to produce phycoerythrin under low light intensity or under predominantly green light, while neither Pseudanabaena sp. AP1 nor Oscillatoria cf. tenuis AO21 produced this pigment. The complementary chromatic adaptation of Oscillatoria cf. ornata correlates well with its summertime distribution under the dim light field of the hypolimnion. The distribution and abundance of specific cyanobacterial populations in Lake Areas can thus be explained by the interplay of light regime and presence of sulfide as some of the most determinant ecological parameters.					; Camacho, Antonio/I-3417-2015	Vicente-Pedros, Eduardo/0000-0002-8814-9912; Camacho, Antonio/0000-0003-0841-2010													0168-6496	1574-6941				DEC	1996	21	4					293	301																WOS:A1996VZ12400006
J	Kaeding, LR; Boltz, GD				Kaeding, LR; Boltz, GD			Spatial and temporal relations between fluvial and allacustrine yellowstone cutthroat trout, Oncorhynchus clarki bouvieri, spawning in the Yellowstone River, outlet stream of Yellowstone Lake	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Yellowstone cutthroat trout (YCT), Oncorhynchus clarki bouvieri, that spawn in the outlet of Yellowstone Lake show two potamodromous migration patterns, fluvial and allacustrine. The main purpose of this study was to determine whether those fluvial and allacustrine YCT represent reproductively isolated stocks. Redd surveys indicated spawning occurred during about 5 consecutive weeks between late May and mid-July 1993-1995. Lake fish (N=6), defined as radiotagged YCT that entered Yellowstone Lake after the spawning period (i.e. allacustrine pattern), were found in the river between the lake outlet (river kilometer [Rkm] 0) and Rkm 20.0 during spawning. Probable lake fish (N=28; tagged YCT that were last detected near the lake outlet) were found between Rkm 0 and Rkm 22.5 during spawning. River fish (N=4; tagged YCT that remained in the river when annual tracking concluded in fall, i.e. fluvial pattern) were found between Rkm 1.1 and Rkm 18.0 during spawning. Fidelity to spawning areas used between consecutive years was suggested by one of five lake fish and the single river fish for which data were available. Spatial overlap in spawning and a lack of temporal separation between the life-history types during spawning suggested that fluvial and allacustrine YCT were not reproductively isolated. Radiotagging, as well as visual observations made annually from boats during April and May, indicated fluvial YCT overwintered downstream from Rkm 14 and were few, probably on the order of 10% of all YCT that spawned in the Yellowstone River.

The delta D-wax a rainfall reconstruction reveals a stable hydroclimate between 500-700 CE, while ACL and delta C-13 together with previous pollen data suggest savanna vegetation was characterized by a relatively dense woody cover. Highly variable hydroclimate conditions are inferred by delta D-wax between 800-1350 CE, with repeated centennial scale intervals of extreme dry and wet conditions overlapping the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA; 950-1250 CE). Savanna tree cover stayed relatively intact over this phase. After ca 1250 CE, a progressive change towards drier conditions was initiated, leading up to maximum aridity during the AD 1700s, a period associated with the Little Ice age (LIA; 1500-1850 CE). Tree cover was now replaced by a more grass-dominated savanna. The clear antiphase rainfall patterns between Nhaucati and equatorial East African proxy records gives support to the notion that Indian Ocean sea surface temperature (SST) gradients act as modulator of southern African climate on a multi-decadal time scale, possibly forced by long-term El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability. We suggest that strong ENSO variability and greater occurrence of La Nina events triggered the generally wet and unstable MCA in southern Africa. From around 1250 CE, a shift towards a predominance of El Nino induced drier conditions in south-east Africa during the LIA. Our study of vegetation and hydroclimate proxies in parallel suggests that savanna tree and shrub cover was relatively resilient to the abrupt shifts in hydroclimate over the MCA, but more sensitive to the long-term progressive drying over the LIA.					; Smittenberg, Rienk/A-3296-2008; Ekblom, Anneli/Q-7941-2019	Ekblom, Anneli/0000-0001-9248-5516; Smittenberg, Rienk/0000-0001-5578-9916; 													0921-8181	1872-6364				NOV	2018	170						221	233		10.1016/j.gloplacha.2018.09.004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2018.09.004													WOS:000447477100017
J	Lunkka, JP; Putkinen, N; Miettinen, A				Lunkka, Juha-Pekka; Putkinen, Niko; Miettinen, Arto			Shoreline displacement in the Belomorsk area, NW Russia during the Younger Dryas Stadial	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												A total of six small basins were cored to determine the shoreline displacement of the Belomorsk area, NW Russia during the last deglaciation. Conventional shoreline displacement methods were applied where the isolation contacts of the sediment cores from lakes at different altitudes were determined using lithological and diatom taxa changes. The isolation contacts were subsequently dated using the C-14 AMS-method. The results show that the area around the cored basins formed part of an extensive ice lake that existed in the White Sea Basin prior to 12,000 cal. yr BP Dating, together with lithostratigraphical and diatom results, indicate that the isolation of the lakes between 72 and 134 m above the present sea level occurred at 12,000 cal. yr BP and the relative water level in the White Sea Basin dropped at least 62 m within a maximum of 300 years. It is estimated that at least 50-55 m of the relative water-level fall was caused by a sudden drainage of the ice-lake waters into the Barents Sea via the Gorlo Strait and 7 -12 m of the water-level decline was caused by glacioisostatic uplift. Preliminary calculations suggest that the total volume of water that burst into the Barents Sea was c. 3000 km(3). This, together with that of c. 7000 km(3) of water which drained into the North Atlantic as the result of the Baltic Ice Lake drop around 11,600 cal. yr BP, must have affected the behaviour of the eastern flank of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet and had a cooling effect on local climate.

Two types of fans occurred in the middle-late Paleogene Kumugeliemu and Suweiyi formations: one alluvial, and the other fan delta deposited in a lacustrine setting. Within the early Neogene Jidike Formation, coastal subaqueous fans developed, probably in a deeper water lacustrine setting. The three types of fans are stacked vertically in outcrop with the sequence in ascending order: bottom alluvial, middle fan-delta, and top subaqueous. The subaqueous is a typical coarse-fan deposit occurring in the glutinite member of the Jidike Formation in some wells. Laterally, from the foreland to the lacustrine settings, the distribution pattern of sedimentary facies represents the same three fan types sequentially. The spatial distribution of these fans was controlled by the Paleogene-Neogene Basin transformation, and evolution with different types of fans developed in the Kuqa Depression in response. In the Paleogene, the Kuqa Depression was a rift basin where an alluvial fan was deposited in the foreland setting, which, by early Neogene, became a foreland basin when the lake level changed. With any rise in lake level, fan-deltas migrated from lacustrine to foreland settings, whereas when the lake level fell, fan migration was reversed. In the early Neogene, with increasing slope and rising lake level, fans progressed and covered the previous fan-delta and lacustrine mudstone. Eventually, subaqueous fans developed, forming the present spatial configuration of these three fan types.																			1000-9515	1755-6724					2009	83	2					411	424		10.1111/j.1755-6724.2009.00021.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1755-6724.2009.00021.x													WOS:000265250900020

JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The closed Tangra Yumco Basin underwent the strongest Quaternary lake-level changes so far recorded on the Tibetan Plateau. It was hitherto unknown what effect this had on local Holocene vegetation development. A 3.6-m sediment core from a recessional lake terrace at 4,700 m a.s.l., 160 m above the present lake level of Tangra Yumco, was studied to reconstruct Holocene flooding phases (sedimentology and ostracod analyses), vegetation dynamics and human influence (palynology, charcoal and coprophilous fungi analyses). Peat at the base of the profile proves lake level was below 4,700 m a.s.l. during the Pleistocene/Holocene transition. A deep-lake phase started after 11 cal ka BP, but the ostracod record indicates the level was not higher than similar to 4,720 m a.s.l. (180 m above present) and decreased gradually after the early Holocene maximum. Additional sediment ages from the basin suggest recession of Tangra Yumco from the coring site after 2.6 cal ka BP, with a shallow local lake persisting at the site until similar to 1 cal ka BP. The final peat formation indicates drier conditions thereafter. Persistence of Artemisia steppe during the Holocene lake high-stand resembles palynological records from west Tibet that indicate early Holocene aridity, in spite of high lake levels that may have resulted from meltwater input. Yet pollen assemblages indicate humidity closer to that of present potential forest areas near Lhasa, with 500-600 mm annual precipitation. Thus, the early mid-Holocene humidity was sufficient to sustain at least juniper forest, but Artemisia dominance persisted as a consequence of a combination of environmental disturbances such as (1) strong early Holocene climate fluctuations, (2) inundation of habitats suitable for forest, (3) extensive water surfaces that served as barriers to terrestrial diaspore transport from refuge areas, (4) strong erosion that denuded the non-flooded upper slopes and (5) increasing human influence since the late glacial.

New interglacial deposits from Copenhagen, Denmark: marine Isotope Stage 7	BOREAS												During a pre-site survey and construction of a new metro route and station in Copenhagen, fossiliferous organic-rich sediments were encountered. This paper reports on multidisciplinary investigations of these organic sediments, which occurred beneath a sediment succession with a lower till, glacifluvial sand and gravel, an upper till and glacifluvial sand. The organic sediments were underlain by glacifluvial sand and gravel. The organic-rich sediments, which were up to 0.5 m thick, accumulated in a low-energy environment, possibly an oxbow lake. They were rich in plant fossils, which included warmth-demanding trees and other species, such as Najas minor, indicating slightly higher summer temperatures than at present. Freshwater shells were also frequent. Bithynia opercula allowed the sediments to be put into an aminostratigraphical framework. The amino acid racemization (AAR) ratios indicate that the organic sediments formed during Marine Isotope Stage 7 (MIS 7), which is consistent with optically stimulated luminescence dating that gave ages of 206 and 248 ka from the underlying minerogenic deposit. The assemblages from Trianglen are similar to interglacial deposits from the former Free Port (1.4 km away) in Copenhagen, except that Corbicula and Pisidium clessini were not found at Trianglen. The presence of these bivalves at the Free Port and the ostracod Scottia tumida at Trianglen indicates a pre-Eemian age. AAR data from archived Bithynia opercula from the Free Port were almost identical to those from Trianglen, indicating that the two sites are contemporary. We suggest the Trianglen interglacial be used as a local name for the MIS 7 interglacial deposits in Copenhagen. MIS 7 deposits have rarely been documented from the region, but MIS 7 deposits may have been mistaken for other ages. The use of AAR ratios in Bithynia opercula has a great potential for correlation of interglacial non-marine deposits in mainland northern Europe.

J	Mikhailovna, SN; Pavlovich, SV				Mikhailovna, Shesterkina Nina; Pavlovich, Shesterkin Vladimir			Trace elements in the river waters of the coast of the Tatar Strait (eastern macroslope of the northern Sikhote-Alin)	VESTNIK OF SAINT PETERSBURG UNIVERSITY EARTH SCIENCES												The river basins of the northern Sikhote-Alin are unique, since most of the rivers are spawning for Pacific salmon, and the eastern slope of the Sikhote-Alin is a promising area for the construction of fish hatcheries. At the same time, in recent years, the anthropogenic impact on the territory has been increasing, mainly in the mouth areas of many small rivers flowing into the Tatar Strait. In 2010-2017 - 2017 hydrochemical studies of the surface waters of the coast of the Tatar Strait were carried out. On the basis of the obtained results, a characteristic of the microelement composition of river and lake waters in the zone of mixing with sea water is given. Analysis of the data obtained by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry on an ICP-MS Agilent 7500cx instrument made it possible to estimate the content of trace elements in the water of coastal rivers. The regional factors of the formation of the microelement composition of river waters, determined by the geological features of the catchment structure, are revealed. The elevated geochemical background determines the high concentrations of Cu, Zn, in some cases Cd, Co, Ni, As, Mn in river water. The influence of geochemical features and landscape structure of river catchments on the spatial variation and temporal variability of concentrations is shown. The influence of thermal springs and outflows of formation and fissure groundwater on the increase in the concentrations of individual elements V, Mo, Ba in the rivers of the Botchi and Koppi interfluve was noted. The thermal waters of the Tumninskoe geothermal field with a high content of As, Fe, Mn, Mo, and Cr caused a local increase in the As content in water bodies in the lower reaches of the Tumnin River. Interannual seasonal differences in the runoff of microelements depending on the degree of moisture in the catchment area were noted. Taking into account that the chemical composition of the rivers along the coast of the Tatar Strait is formed mainly in a remote and underdeveloped territory and is determined by natural processes, the obtained concentration values can be considered background.																			2541-9668	2587-585X					2024	69	3							307	10.21638/spbu07.2024.307	http://dx.doi.org/10.21638/spbu07.2024.307													WOS:001321106100002
J	Korolev, A; Isaac, GA; Hallett, J				Korolev, A; Isaac, GA; Hallett, J			Ice particle habits in stratiform clouds	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												Ice crystals in clouds in the atmosphere have shapes that relate to their density, terminal fall velocity growth rate and radiative properties. In calculations for climate-change predictions, forecasting of precipitation, and remote-sensing retrievals, idealized crystal shapes such as columns, needles, plates and dendrites are often assumed. The objective of this work is to study the frequency of occurrence of different habits of ice particles in natural clouds from aircraft observations. Images of cloud particles were measured by a PMS Optical Array Probe-2DC at 25 mum resolution installed on the National Research Council Convair-580. The processing of particle images was conducted with a newly developed algorithm for pattern recognition. Data were collected during four field projects in the Canadian and US Arctic over the North Atlantic near Newfoundland, and over the Great Lakes. Approximately 5 x 10(6) images of cloud particles having a size larger than 125 mum were analysed. The cloud particles were classified into four categories: spheres, irregulars, needles/columns and dendrites. The habit classification of particles was done for three different size ranges: >125 mum, >250 mum, and >500 mum. The frequency of occurrence of different habits was found for each 5 degC temperature interval in the range -45 degreesC < T < 0 degreesC. It was concluded that the majority of ice particles in natural clouds were of irregular shape. The frequency of occurrence of irregular ice decreases with increasing particle size. On average, the concentration of particles larger than 125 mum was approximately constant down to -35 degreesC, whereas the concentration of particles larger than 500 mum decreased at temperatures below -15 OC. Since the data were collected in different climatic zones within many cloud types, and covered a significant cloud path length (3.6 x 10(4) km), the conclusions are applicable to most stratiform clouds containing ice.																			0035-9009					OCT	2000	126	569	A				2873	2902		10.1256/smsqj.56912	http://dx.doi.org/10.1256/smsqj.56912													WOS:000165170600012

The terminal lakes, Baijian Hu (Tengger Desert) and Gaxun Nur/Sogu Nur (Badain Jaran Desert), at the outer edges of the endorheic drainage systems have been investigated using lake sediments, microfossils and lake hydrology. In both areas, lake-level changes are documented by a series of paleoshorelines, which reflect highest lake levels during isotope stage 3 between 39 and 21 ka, reflecting an increased water supply from the surrounding mountain ranges and higher local rainfall induced by the westerlies. The area contains more than 50,000 km(2) of freshwater lakes and swamps with no phases of desiccation. During isotope stage 2 (c. 18 to 13 ka), the lakes dried up and eolian activity increased rapidly. Induced by an enhanced summer monsoon, the recurrence of wet conditions after 13,000 yr BP is documented by rising lake levels, the deposition of limnic sediments and the appearance of bio-indicators. A brief return to dry and cold conditions during the Younger Dryas event has not yet been detectable. In both areas, warm and semihumid conditions during the Holocene climatic optimum are inferred from stratified, mollusc-bearing lake deposits and peat layers alternating with fluvial and eolian deposits which indicate a long-term oscillating trend toward arid conditions. Dry intervals between 6500 and 5500 and after 3000 C-14 yr BP are documented by the sedimentary structures, geochemical composition of the lake sediments, and the decrease of ostracods. The youngest lake phase occurred about 2000 C-14 yr BP, followed by complete desiccation and dune formation.

Geochemical characteristics of glacial Lake Agassiz sediments and new ages for the Moorhead Phase at Fargo, North Dakota, USA	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												The cause and age of the Moorhead low-water Phase of glacial Lake Agassiz remains uncertain. New geochemical (X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and elemental analysis) and chronological (optically stimulated luminescence (OSL)) data are used to test for evaporative enrichment within lacustrine sediment from Rabbit Lake, a small basin just above the highest Lake Agassiz strandline, and from two Lake Agassiz sediment cores at Fargo, North Dakota. Increases in quartz and gypsum interpreted to be of aeolian origin suggest increased aridity at Rabbit Lake sometime after 13 540-13 750 cal years BP. From the Fargo cores, lacustrine sediment of the Brenna and Sherack formations did not show convincing evidence for evaporative enrichment. However, this result is complicated by an erosional contact at the top of the Brenna Formation. A thin middle sand unit between the Brenna and Sherack formation clays is stratigraphically equivalent to the Poplar River Formation, West Fargo Member, but its properties differ from the fluvial sand of the West Fargo Member. Four OSL ages from the organic-poor, middle sand unit at Fargo range between 12.8 +/- 0.2 and 13.5 +/- 0.2 ka (with +/- 1.6 ka uncertainty) and suggest lake level fell at Fargo at, or before, 13.1 +/- 0.2 ka, the average of the OSL ages. With different sedimentological properties, and a difference of similar to 1750 years between the new OSL ages and previously published ages on the West Fargo Member sand, additional work is required to determine whether the middle sand unit is a new member of the Poplar River Formation, recording an earlier and different depositional environment than the West Fargo Member. From a plot of available ages for the Moorhead Phase, the regression remains poorly constrained in time.

Myxobolus cerebralis in native cutthroat trout of the yellowstone lake ecosystem	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC ANIMAL HEALTH												The exotic parasite Myxobolus cerebralis was first detected in native adult Yellowstone cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvierii from Yellowstone Lake in 1998, seriously threatening the ecological integrity of this pristine, naturally functioning ecosystem. We immediately began to assess the prevalence and spatial extent of M. cerebralis infection in Yellowstone cutthroat trout within Yellowstone Lake and to determine the infection risk of age-0 Yellowstone cutthroat trout, the relative abundance and actinospore production of tubificid worms, and the basic environmental characteristics of tributaries. During 1999-2001, juvenile and adult Yellowstone cutthroat trout were infected throughout Yellowstone Lake; the highest prevalence (15.3-16.4%) occurred in the northern and central regions. Exposure studies in 13 streams indicated that Pelican and Clear creeks and the Yellowstone River were positive for M. cerebralis; the highest prevalence (100%) and severity was found in Pelican Creek during mid-July. Sexually mature individuals of the oligochaete Tubifex tubifex were most abundant in early summer, were genetically homogenous, and were members of a lineage known to produce moderate to high levels of M. cerebralis triactinomyxons. Only 20 of the 3,037 sampled tubificids produced actinospores after 7 d in culture, and none of the actinospores were M. cerebralis. However, one non-actinospore-producing T. tubifex from Pelican Creek tested positive for M. cerebralis by polymerase chain reaction. Stream temperatures at Pelican Creek, a fourth-order, low-gradient stream, were over 20 degrees C during the first exposure period, suggesting that T. tubifex were capable of producing triactinomyxons at elevated temperatures in the wild. Although the infection of otherwise healthy adult Yellowstone cutthroat trout within Yellowstone Lake suggests some resistance, our sentinel cage exposures indicated that this subspecies may be more susceptible to whirling disease than previous laboratory challenges have indicated, and M. cerebralis may be contributing to a significant recent decline in this population.																			0899-7659	1548-8667				SEP	2006	18	3					157	175		10.1577/H05-031.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/H05-031.1													WOS:000241686200001
J	Stollenwerk, N; Drepper, FR; Siegel, H				Stollenwerk, N; Drepper, FR; Siegel, H			Testing nonlinear stochastic models on phytoplankton biomass time series	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Time series of algae mass in German water reservoir lakes being collected for several years in irregular sampling, half weekly on average, are tested in their stationary distribution against several univariate stochastic processes with linear and nonlinear dynamics, with pure additive and with state dependent noise. In each case the parameters of the corresponding Fokker-Planck equations in the stationary state are estimated by maximisation of the log-likelihood. For statistical evaluation the Kolmogorov-Smirnov-test is applied with additional graphical tools, being especially suited for short data sets typical for ecological systems. To obtain the optimally adapted stochastic process, an additional parameter has to be estimated describing the autocorrelation. We use two methods: first, we use a novel method based on the estimation of conditional probabilities directly from the data. The resulting stochastic model with state dependent noise is simulated. Second, we use the Lomb normalised Fourier spectrum for unevenly sampled data, e.g. no measurements during winter time to minimise the overall deviation between the empirical spectrum and spectra obtained from stochastic simulations, the sampling of which follows in detail the one of the empirical data. The parameter value of the first method is used as a starting point for the adaptation of the cumulative spectrum. In this way a stochastic process is obtained which describes the stationary distribution as well as the spectrum of the empirical data both indistinguishable at high statistical confidence.

The relative changes in the stable carbon isotope composition of plant remains preserved in the core reflect major temperature fluctuations in the Western Cordillera of the southern Peruvian Andes. These temperature variations can be additionally linked with the changes in precipitation patterns by analysing C% and C/N ratio in the core. Relatively warm and moist conditions prevailed from 4280 to 3040 cal. yrs BP (BC 2330-1090) with a short colder dry episode around 3850 cal. yrs BP (BC 1900). The most prominent climate changes recorded in the peat occurred between 3040 and 2750 cal. yrs BP (BC 1090-800) when the initial warming turned to a rapid cooling to temperatures at least 2 degrees C lower than the mean for the Late Holocene. Initially drier conditions within this event turned to a short wet phase after 2780 cal. yrs BP (BC 830) when the temperature increased again. This event coincides with significant changes in peat and ice core records in the Central Andes matching the timing of the global climate event around 2.8 cal. ka BP. Climatic conditions in the study area became relatively dry and stable after the event for about 800 years. Highly variable temperatures and humidity prevailed during the last 2000 years when an extended warm and relatively humid period occurred between 640 and 155 cal. yrs BP (AD 1310-1795) followed by predominantly colder and drier conditions. The established delta C-13 peat record represents the first continuous proxy for the temperature in the southern Peruvian Andes dated by the AMS C-14. Distichia peat is wide spread in the Andes and the proposed approach can be applied elsewhere in high altitudes, where no other traditional climate proxies are available. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Ielpi, A				Ielpi, Alessandro			Anatomy of major coal successions: Fades analysis and sequence architecture of a brown coal-bearing valley fill to lacustrine tract (Upper Valdarno Basin, Northern Apennines, Italy)	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												A late Pliocene incised valley fill to lacustrine succession, which contains an interbedded brown coal seam (< 20 m thick), is examined in terms of facies analysis, physical stratigraphy and sequence architecture. The succession (< 50 m thick) constitutes the first depositional event of the Castelnuovo Synthem, which is the oldest unconformity bounded stratigraphic unit of the nonmarine Upper Valdamo Basin, Northern Apennines (Italy). The integration of field surveys and borehole logs identified the following event sequence: first valley filling stages by coarse alluvial fan and channelised streams; the progressive setting of low gradient floodbasins with shallow floodplain lakes; subsequent major waterlogging and extensive peat mire development; and system drowning and establishment of permanent lacustrine conditions. The deposits are grouped in a set of nested valley fills and are arranged as high-frequency depositional sequences. The sequences are bounded by minor erosive truncations and have distinctive upward trends: lowstand system tract thinning; transgressive system tract thickening; highstand system tract thinning and eventual non-deposition; and the smoothing of along-sequence boundary sub-aerial incisions. Such features fit in with the notion of an idealised model where second-order (high-frequency) fluctuations, modulated by first-order (low-frequency) base-level rising, have short-lived standing + falling phases and prolonged transgressions, respectively. Furthermore, the general sequence architecture reveals how a mixed palustrinesiliciclastic system differs substantially from a purely siliciclastic one. In the transgressive phases, terrigenous starvation induces prevailing peat accumulation, generating abnormally thick transgressive system tracts that eventually come to occupy much of the same transgression-generated accommodation space. In the highstand phases, the development of thick highstand system tracts is then prevented by sediment upstream trapping due to retrogressive fluvial aggradations, probably coupled with low-accommodation settings inherited from the transgressive phases.

Here, we present a cored palynological record covering the Holocene Epoch from a depressional wetland on Heixiazi Island (China). With the aid of principal component analysis and duster analysis of the palynological data, the historical vegetation regime has been well reconstructed for wetlands on the island. With further assistance from the published data on local hydrology and regional East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) variations, the interactions of vegetation, hydrology, and climate in the island's wetlands have been thoroughly analyzed with correlation analysis of the three factors. The results indicate that a strong EASM generally led to a high water level in the wetlands from increased monsoonal precipitation, causing an increase in arboreal vegetation and a decrease in herbs. Alternatively, a weak EASM generally led to low water levels due to decreased monsoonal precipitation, causing a decrease in arboreal vegetation and an increase in herbs. The local vegetation regime during the early Holocene was marked by an increase in tree/herb ratio due to rising water levels under the influence of an increasingly strengthened EASM. Subsequently, a general decline of the tree/herb ratio occurred from a gradual decrease in water level during the mid and late Holocene when the EASM gradually retreated. The wettest stage marked by the highest water level and tree/herb ratio occurred 8.0-4.6 ka BP with the strongest EASM. The driest stage occurred during the last 0.4 ka BP, which was attributed to both the weakest EASM influence and anthropogenic disturbance. Our study provides an integrated view of the wetlands ecological dynamics incorporating multi-factor interactions, which further sheds light on the EASM driving mechanisms on wetlands evolution during the Holocene Epoch.

Net growth rates were calculated from actual changes in biomass assuming exponential growth. Values ranged between- 0.072 and 0.037 pr day (d-1) for Chromatium, and between -0.043 and 0.022 d-1 for Amoebobacter. Exponential loss rates through sedimentation, decomposition and washout were determined independently. Values ranged between 0 and 0.025 d-1 in the case of Chromatium and between 0 and 0.015 d-1 in the case of Amoebobacter, Finally, gross growth ratges were calculateed by adding net growth to losses. Maximal values were 0.063 d-1 for Chromatium and 0.037 d-1 for Amoebobacter. In the case of Chromatium, population growth rates were found to be correlated with the amount of light available per unit of growing in biomass. It was concluded that growth of phototrophic bacteria in Lake Ciso was limited by light availability. Althogether, purple sulfur bacteria seemed to maintain a very large biomass with very slow growth thanks to very slow losses during stratification. During holomixis the situation was more dynamic. Washout of cells and disappearance of algal cells allowed were more light to reach the bacteria. Therefore, high growth rates were found towards the end of the winter. A similar pattern repeated itself from year to year. These are the first estimates of in situ growth rates for populations of phototrophic bacteria.

J	Kilroy, C; Biggs, BJF; Vyverman, W; Broady, PA				Kilroy, C; Biggs, BJF; Vyverman, W; Broady, PA			Benthic diatom communities in subalpine pools in New Zealand: Relationships to environmental variables	HYDROBIOLOGIA												In spite of their potential use as indicators of both present and past environmental conditions, little is known about the diatom communities in the many small water bodies at high altitudes in New Zealand. We sampled benthic diatoms at 20 sites in a typical subalpine mire pool/tarn complex near Arthur's Pass in South Island, New Zealand in the austral spring 2001. The aims were to characterise the diatom communities, including identification of a possible endemic component, and to investigate relationships with environmental variables. The community at genus level was consistent with the peat-bog diatom flora reported from elsewhere except for the common occurrence of the Tasmania/New Zealand endemic genus Eunophora. At the species level, 27 of the 52 most common taxa appear to correspond to known species from the Northern Hemisphere and are therefore presumed to be cosmopolitan in their distribution. Just two taxa are known from the Southern Hemisphere only, however identification of the remaining common species proved problematic. Analysis using the BIO-ENV procedure of the PRIMER computer program confirmed an expected strong association between diatom community composition and pH, with water conductivity and gilvin also important. Weighted averaging regression and cross-validation using C-2 software enabled selection of four diatom species as potentially sensitive indicators of certain pH levels. Neither species of Eunophora showed a strong preference for pH or for any of the other environmental variables measured, indicating that other factors are determining their distributions. The strength of the species-environment relationships found in this small survey suggests good potential for monitoring current conditions and for palaeoecological applications. Extension of the dataset with information from other alpine/subalpine areas is desirable, as is the compilation of a regional diatom identification guide for these habitats.						Biggs, Barry J.

J	Derlet, RW				Derlet, Robert W.			Backpacking in Yosemite and Kings Canyon National Parks and neighboring wilderness areas: How safe is the water to drink?	JOURNAL OF TRAVEL MEDICINE												Objective. The objective of this study was to determine the risk of acquiring disease from popular Sierra Nevada wilderness area lakes and streams. This study examines the relative risk factors for harmful waterborne microorganisms using coliforms as an indicator. Methods. Water was collected in the backcountry Yosemite and Kings Canyon National Parks and neighboring wilderness areas. A total of 72 sites from lakes or streams were selected to statistically differentiate the risk categories: (1) natural areas rarely visited by humans or domestic animals; (2) human day use-only areas; (3) high use by backpackers; (4) high use by pack animals; and (5) cattle- and sheep-grazing tracts. Water was collected in sterile test tubes and Millipore coliform samplers during the summer of 2006. Water was analyzed at the university microbiology lab, where bacteria were harvested and then subjected to analysis using standardized techniques. Statistical analysis to compare site categories was performed using Fisher's exact test. Results. Coliforms were found in none of the 13 wild sites, none of the 12 day hike sites, and only 3 of 18 backpacker sites (17%). In contrast, 14 of 20 sites (70%) with pack animal traffic yielded coliforms, and all 9 sites (100%) below the cattle-grazing areas grew coliforms. Differences between backpacker versus cattle or pack areas were significant, p <= 0.05. All samples grew normal aquatic bacteria. Sites below cattle grazing and pack animal use tended to have more total heterotrophic bacteria. Conclusions. Alpine wilderness water below cattle areas used by pack animals is at risk for containing coliform organisms. Water from wild, day hike, or backpack areas showed far less risk for coliforms.																			1195-1982	1708-8305				JUL-AUG	2008	15	4					209	215		10.1111/j.1708-8305.2008.00201.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1708-8305.2008.00201.x								18666919					WOS:000257798000001
J	Malassé, AD; Gaillard, C				Malasse, Anne Dambricourt; Gaillard, Claire			Relations between climatic changes and prehistoric human migrations during Holocene between Gissar Range, Pamir, Hindu Kush and Kashmir: The archaeological and ecological data	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					3rd LIMPACS	MAR 05-08, 2009	Chandigarh, INDIA					In the beginning of the Holocene, hunter-gatherer populations settled in the Pamir plateau, especially in the tectonic depression of Markansu near the Kara Kul Lake (Osh Kona site, 4100 m, 9580 BP and 7145 BP). These populations were well adapted to high altitude life conditions in summer. They were using stone tools related to a cobble tool tradition that Ranov considered as the local continuation of an Asian Middle Palaeolithic (Ferghana, Darwaz or Punjab). However, they disappeared during the second half of the Holocene. As well, hunters-gatherers characterised by a tradition close to Markansu Culture, namely Hissar Culture, appeared during the Holocene in the northern mountains of the Tajik-Afghan depression (Amu Darya upper basin) occupying the middle altitude valleys (Gissar Range) when Neolithic populations began to develop at lower altitudes. For Ranov, origin and destiny of both Markansu and Hissar cultures were the most important questions to solve in this region. The Department of Prehistory, National Museum of Natural History (Paris) conducted field work in collaboration with the University of Peshawar between 1996 and 1998 in the northernmost valley of the Indus basin giving access to the Wakhan corridor. The upper Yarkhun valley (Chitral district, Pakistan), accessible only by foot, was surveyed from 2500 to 4000 m altitude. This allowed the discovery of 6 sites yielding lithic artefacts, among which half are cobble tools. They attest to human activity later than 5500 BP, suggesting population movements between the Amu Darya and Indus basins. The consequences of the Quaternary climate oscillations between South Asian monsoon and Northern hemisphere influences on the one hand, and the impact on biotopes of the increasing pastoral activity on the other hand, are discussed as probable causes for the disappearance of the mountainous nomadic hunters of Central Asia.

In the dataset of fishery statistics, mainly 11 taxa were recognised according to their commercial importance. Therefore, we used the dataset consisting of 64 sample units (i.e., year) with 11 taxa for patterning the fish community by the SOM. Our results suggest that the fish community of Lake Peipsi was mostly gradually changed in long-term scale, but some abrupt changes were also noticeable. Despite the same species composition, the total annual catch has declined indicating changes of fish community. The fish community of Lake Peipsi has shifted in longterm scale from clean- and cold-water species like vendace Coregonus albula (L.), whitefish C. lauaretus L. and burbot Lota Iota (L.) to more pikeperch Sander lucioperca (L.) preferring productive warm and turbid waters. Both, the deterioration of aquatic environment and predatory effect of pikeperch prevent recovery of vendace population. Gradual reduction of the stock of smelt Osmerus eperlanus L. is also a sign of ongoing eutrophication, while its disappearance from catches for 3 years (1973-1975) was the result of summer fish-kill. The effect of fishing is the most important human impact on the fish community in Lake Peipsi. Extensive use of fine-meshed towed fishing gear (e.g., trawls replaced later by bottom seines) affected mostly recruitment of pelagic predator, pikeperch, killing young specimens of this fish in large quantities. Even though the fishery methods have changed, the fish stocks of the lake have repeatedly suffered from the over-fishing. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Laing, JR; Jaffe, DA; Hee, JR				Laing, James R.; Jaffe, Daniel A.; Hee, Jonathan R.			Physical and optical properties of aged biomass burning aerosol from wildfires in Siberia and the Western USA at the Mt. Bachelor Observatory	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												The summer of 2015 was an extreme forest fire year in the Pacific Northwest. Our sample site at the Mt. Bachelor Observatory (MBO, 2.7 km a. s. l.) in central Oregon observed biomass burning (BB) events more than 50% of the time during August. In this paper we characterize the aerosol physical and optical properties of 19 aged BB events during August 2015. Six of the 19 events were influenced by Siberian fires originating near Lake Baikal that were transported to MBO over 4-10 days. The remainder of the events resulted from wildfires in Northern California and Southwestern Oregon with transport times to MBO ranging from 3 to 35 h. Fine particulate matter (PM1), carbon monoxide (CO), aerosol light scattering coefficients (sigma(scat)), aerosol light absorption coefficients (sigma(abs)), and aerosol number size distributions were measured throughout the campaign. We found that the Siberian events had a significantly higher Delta sigma(abs) / Delta CO enhancement ratio, higher mass absorption efficiency (MAE; Delta sigma(abs) = Delta PM1), lower single scattering albedo (omega), and lower absorption Angrom exponent (AAE) when compared with the regional events. We suggest that the observed Siberian events represent that portion of the plume that has hotter flaming fire conditions and thus enabled strong pyroconvective lofting and long-range transport to MBO. The Siberian events observed at MBO therefore represent a selected portion of the original plume that would then have preferentially higher black carbon emissions and thus an enhancement in absorption. The lower AAE values in the Siberian events compared to regional events indicate a lack of brown carbon (BrC) production by the Siberian fires or a loss of BrC during transport. We found that mass scattering efficiencies (MSE) for the BB events ranged from 2.50 to 4.76 m(2) g(-1). We measured aerosol size distributions with a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS). Number size distributions ranged from unimodal to bimodal and had geometric mean diameters (D-pm) ranging from 138 to 229 nm and geometric standard deviations (sigma g) ranging from 1.53 to 1.89. We found MSEs for BB events to be positively correlated with the geometric mean of the aerosol size distributions (R-2 = 0.73), which agrees with Mie theory. We did not find any dependence on event size distribution to transport time or fire source location.																			1680-7316	1680-7324				DEC 8	2016	16	23					15185	15197		10.5194/acp-16-15185-2016	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-15185-2016													WOS:000390649300002

Confronting the vicinity of the surface water and sea shore in a shallow glaciogenic aquifer in southern Finland	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The groundwater in a shallow, unconfined, low-lying coastal aquifer in Santala, southern Finland, was chemically characterised by integrating multivariate statistical approaches, principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), based on the stable isotopes delta H-2 and delta O-18, hydrogeochemistry and field monitoring data. PCA and HCA yielded similar results and classified groundwater samples into six distinct groups that revealed the factors controlling temporal and spatial variations in the groundwater geochemistry, such as the geology, anthropogenic sources from human activities, climate and surface water. High temporal variation in groundwater chemistry directly corresponded to precipitation. With an increase in precipitation, KMnO4 consumption, EC, alkalinity and Ca concentrations also increased in most wells, while Fe, Al, Mn and SO4 were occasionally increased during spring after the snowmelt under specific geological conditions. The continued increase in NO3 and metal concentrations in groundwater indicates the potential contamination risk to the aquifer. Stable isotopes of delta O-18 and delta H-2 indicate groundwater recharge directly from meteoric water, with an insignificant contribution from lake water, and no seawater intrusion into the aquifer. Groundwater geochemistry suggests that local seawater intrusion is temporarily able to take place in the sulfate reduction zone along the freshwater and seawater mixed zone in the low-lying coastal area, but the contribution of seawater was found to be very low. The influence of lake water could be observed from higher levels of KMnO4 consumption in wells near the lake. The integration of PCA and HCA with conventional classification of groundwater types, as well as with the hydrogeochemical data, provided useful tools to identify the vulnerable groundwater areas representing the impacts of both natural and human activities on water quality and the understanding of complex groundwater flow system for the aquifer vulnerability assessment and groundwater management in the future.					; Korkka-Niemi, Kirsti/AGW-9225-2022; Luoma, Samrit/ABA-6085-2021	Luoma, Samrit/0000-0002-2309-1916; 													1027-5606	1607-7938					2015	19	3					1353	1370		10.5194/hess-19-1353-2015	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-19-1353-2015													WOS:000352160600016

The characteristics of shallow, subarctic Lake Myvatn and its volcanic environment, are outlined, as well as recent conflicts between development and conservation. Mining of the bottom sediment of Lake Myvatn has been a major agent causing habitat destruction and damage to the food web. Population limitation of waterbirds at Myvatn is discussed, as three research questions and emerging answers: (1) How is reproductive output determined? All species studied showed positive correlations of production of young with levels of aquatic insects, catastrophic weather was rarely important; (2) How is the dispersion of breeding ducks determined? Densities of migratory species are determined mainly by resource levels on the breeding ground in the year before they return to the breeding area; a year-round resident species, Bucephala islandica, adjusts its density to the current availability of insect food in each of two main habitats used; (3) How are flyway populations of ducks determined? For most species, there is not enough information on total numbers and the state of the habitat on a flyway scale. In B. islandica, there are indications that the total population is limited by resources in winter. The Myvatn study area is dominated by a single, shallow and eutrophic lake and for many waterbird species the area seems to form a single functional unit. This leads to significant correlations when comparing demography with environmental conditions, such as food resources.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2006	567						89	100		10.1007/s10750-006-0063-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0063-x													WOS:000239147500009
J	LAHERMO, P; MANNIO, J; TARVAINEN, T				LAHERMO, P; MANNIO, J; TARVAINEN, T			THE HYDROGEOCHEMICAL COMPARISON OF STREAMS AND LAKES IN FINLAND	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												A total number of 1165 stream water and 1172 lake water samples were collected in two different projects in the autumns of 1990 and 1987, respectively. The sampling points in streams were determined to include a drainage area of ca 30 km(2). The lakes were selected to represent the lakes in the size range of 0.01-10 km(2). The anions have different distributions in the stream and lake water data sets. Stream waters are dominated by HCO3 (median value 200 mu eq/l), which comprises over half of the anion sum. Organic anions and sulphates are of the same order of magnitude (ca 70 mu eq/l), respectively, followed by chloride (40 mu eq/l) and nitrate (ca 30 mu eq/l). In lakes, sulphate (85 mu eq/l) and organic anion (76 mu eq/l) concentrations are higher than those of bicarbonate (64 mu eq/l). Chloride concentrations in lakes are comparable to those of the streams (28 mu eq/l), but nitrate (1 mu eq/l) and fluoride contents (<1 mu eq/l) are very minor. The median concentrations of the main cations appear in the same successive order of magnitude in both stream and lake water data sets: Ca > Mg > Na > K > Al > H. The total amounts of cations (medians) in lake waters and streams are 260 and 450 mu eq/l, respectively. The hydrogeochemical maps compiled for this study show elevated concentrations in coastal areas for most of the elements particularly in stream waters, which have a more uniform sampling network grid all over the country. In many cases, the same areal pattern is discernible in lake waters, although there are only a few lakes along the coast as the selection was targeted mainly on the upland areas with a higher lake density. These circumstances result in pronounced differences in the distribution of the concentrations. Small lakes show high individuality even in adjacent hydrological systems reflecting the different hydrographical conditions and soil and bedrock types of their catchments. The larger lakes with extensive catchment areas and higher amounts of dissolved solids have higher buffer capacity than small lakes. Therefore, the chemistry of larger lakes is more compatible with that of streams.

J	Carss, DN; Godfrey, JD				Carss, DN; Godfrey, JD			Accuracy of estimating the species and sizes of osprey prey: A test of methods	JOURNAL OF RAPTOR RESEARCH												The accuracies of examining uneaten prey remains collected at feeding sites and of directly observing fish captured while birds forage, common methods of determining the species composition and size structure of prey, in the diets of ospreys (Pandion haliaetus), were tested during the summer of 1992 at two shallow lakes in northeastern Scotland. Prey remains were collected below feeding perches and the number of heads and paired jaws was used to estimate the minimal number of each species in the diet. Key cranial bones were used for species identification and length estimation. Direct field observations were also made to identify the species and sizes of fish taken by foraging ospreys. Fish species were identified by body shape and lengths were estimated by comparison with the size of the ospreys. The accuracy of field observations was tested experimentally using a life-sized model osprey and a selection of northern pike (Esox lucius) and perch (Perca fluviatilis) of various sizes. Results showed that the analysis of prey remains gave an accurate estimation of the size range of osprey pre): although small fish (<25 cm) were underrepresented. Tests of field observations showed that most fish could be correctly identified on the basis of their body shape but there were consistent inter-observer differences in fish length estimations. These differences should be considered in studies using field estimates of prey size, particularly those involving energetic calculations where small errors in length estimations can lead to large errors in estimations of mass and, hence, energy.

From 44 to 36 cal ka BP, forest vegetation in the coastal regions of Ulleung Basin was composed predominantly of subalpine conifer forest, open grassland covered the exposed continental shelves, indicating a cool and dry climate. During the period of 36-28.3 cal ka BP, a warmer and wetter climate caused the contraction of subalpine conifer forest in the coastal regions of Ulleung Basin, and the expansion of marsh in the exposed continental shelves. From 28.3 to 17.6 cal ka BP, the sea-level decline restricted the herbs pollen originates in the exposed shelf of East China Sea and Yellow Sea inflow into the East Sea (Japan Sea), and caused the reduction of herbs pollen in the site location. During the time interval of 17.6-15.1 cal ka BP, a great expansion of subalpine conifer forest can be regarded as the consequence of enhanced East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM). The obvious increase in temperate deciduous broadleaved trees, spores and algae can be attributable to the rising of sea level and the warming of climate from 15.1 to 12.1 cal ka BP. During the period of 12.1 to 5.3 cal ka BP, broadleaved taxa increased, especially during the time period of 9.5-5.3 cal ka BP, evergreen broadleaved trees pollen reach the highest values throughout the core, as a result of the Holocene climate optimum condition. Vegetation changes controlled by humid impacts occurred at the late Holocene, as indicated by an increase in Pinus pollen. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

J	Albrecht, C; Wolff, C; Glöer, P; Wilke, T				Albrecht, Christian; Wolff, Christian; Gloeer, Peter; Wilke, Thomas			Concurrent evolution of ancient sister lakes and sister species: the freshwater gastropod genus Radix in lakes Ohrid and Prespa	HYDROBIOLOGIA					4th Symposium on Speciation in Ancient Lakes	SEP 04-08, 2006	Freie Univ Berlin, Berlin, GERMANY		Freie Univ Berlin			Ancient sister lakes are considered to be ancient lakes lying in close geographic proximity, sharing a related origin and significant time of co-existence, usually having hydrological connection as well as a balanced degree of faunal overlap and distinctness. A paradigm for studying sister lake relationships are the ancient lakes Ohrid and Prespa in the Balkans, which are characterized by high degrees of endemicity. Three general patterns of endemic species can be distinguished for these lakes: (1) taxa that are endemic to either lake, with no close relatives in the respective sister lake, (2) closely related but distinct endemic taxa in both lakes (sister species) and (3) shared endemic taxa occurring in both lakes. In the present paper, two endemic freshwater pulmonate gastropod species, Radix relicta (Lake Ohrid) and R. pinteri (Lake Prespa), are used to study the evolution of presumed sister species based on biogeographical and comparative DNA data from world-wide Radix taxa. Phylogenetic, phylogeographical and parametric bootstrap analyses all suggest a sister group relationship of R. relicta and R. pinteri (pattern 2 of endemic diversity). Sister to these two taxa is the widespread R. ampla, which does not occur in the vicinity of lakes Ohrid and Prespa. The southern feeder spring complexes of Lake Ohrid are inhabited by another lineage (Radix sp. 1), which resembles Radix relicta in morphology/anatomy. For Lake Prespa, the widespread R. auricularia was reported in addition to the endemic R. pinteri. Comparative phylogenetic data favour a western Adriatic zoogeographical affinity of lakes Ohrid and Prespa over an Aegean-Anatolian faunal connection. The status of lakes Ohrid and Prespa as sister lakes is evaluated in the light of current knowledge on gastropod speciation and endemism in these hotspots of biodiversity.

The cartographic delimitation of these areas provides for better decision-making, helping to resolve existing conflicts by detecting priority areas for the implementation of projects designed to rehabilitate degraded areas. As such, the aim of this paper is to evaluate a Permanent Preservation Areas map within the Environmental Protection Area of Petropolis Moutain Region (APA Petropolis). Thus, users will be able to analyze the current state of Permanent Preservation Areas and the relationship they have with the conflicting uses of those spaces. Boundaries for the Permanent Preservation Areas was delimited using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) as a tool to operationalize and use Digital Elevation Models (DEM) to refine the methodology for delimiting boundaries for these areas. The areas with long water courses, springs, hillsides with slopes greater than 45 degrees, and lakes and reservoirs are some examples of preservation areas that have already been mapped according to Brazilian environmental legislation. Overlaying a land cover map, is possible to observe a high level of spatial occupation as shown in the overlapping of areas already mapped and in the orthophotos of the Brazilian Geographic and Statistical Institute.

J	Hancock, MH; Robson, HJ; Smith, TD; Douse, A				Hancock, Mark H.; Robson, Hannah J.; Smith, Trevor D.; Douse, Andy			Correlates of lake use by breeding common scoters in Scotland	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												1. Many populations of sea-ducks, which typically winter at sea but breed on fresh water, are declining. Numbers of common scoters Melanitta nigra (L.) breeding in Scotland halved between 1995 and 2007, despite most breeding sites having special conservation status. To identify potential conservation measures, a 3-year study was conducted, investigating correlates of lake use by scoters. 2. At 26 scoter breeding lakes, food abundance (macroinvertebrates) and foraging habitats (substrates, water depth) were measured, and their associations with scoter lake use explored using multi-model inference. Correlates of macroinvertebrate abundance (water quality, fish abundance) were also investigated. 3. Averaged over 3 years (2009 - 2011), these lakes held 26.7 (SE 6.3) females, around half the Scottish breeding population. Scoters occurred more often at lakes having abundant large-bodied invertebrates and extensive shallow water. Lakes where the average weight of the largest invertebrate in each sample exceeded 4 mg had 9.2 times (females) or 27 times (broods) more scoter records than other lakes. Lakes where water depths (10 m from the shore) averaged less than 1.3 m had 2.5 times (females) or 12 times (broods) more scoter records than other lakes. 4. The abundance of large-bodied invertebrates was greater where small fish species (mostly three-spined sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus) were more common and brown trout Salmo trutta were scarcer. 5. Results suggest two approaches to scoter conservation. At lakes used for hydro-electricity generation, water level regimes that provide extensive shallow water should be tested to see if these benefit scoters. At lakes used for trout fishing, trout reduction by increased angling should be trialled, to see if this increases large-invertebrate abundance and scoter use.

J	Pihu, E				Pihu, E			Fishes, their biology and fisheries management in Lake Peipsi	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Lake Peipsi is a large (3558 km(2)) and relatively shallow (up to 15.3 m) productive smelt-bream-pikeperch lake on the territories of Estonia and Russia. 34 fish and lamprey species inhabit this lake permanently, the main commercial fishes being smelt, perch, ruffe, roach, bream, pike, up to the 1990s also vendace and lately pikeperch. The second-rate commercial fishes are burbot, whitefish, white bream and bleak. In general, the spawning and feeding conditions of fishes are more or less favourable in the lake. Bream and pike grow fast, the majority of the other investigated fish species passably. The total catch of fish has usually been 9000-12 000 t (25-34 kg ha(-1)) a year. As a result of the intensive use of trawls and fine-meshed Danish seines, the stock of pikeperch was strongly suppressed for a long time. After trawls were prohibited and the number of Danish seines considerably restricted, the stock and catches of pikeperch began to grow rapidly; pikeperch has become one of the main commercial fishes in the lake. During the last years the abundance of vendace has sharply decreased, and it has lost (we hope, temporarily) its economic importance. This is probably caused, first of all, by the high mortality of its eggs on the spawning grounds during successive mild winters of the last years. An increasing pressure from pikeperch (a big predator) has also contributed to strong decline of the stock of vendace. It would be reasonable to begin a regular introduction of elvers into the lake.																			0018-8158					NOV 8	1996	338	1-3					163	172		10.1007/BF00031720	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00031720													WOS:A1996WC58000016

Three of the study sites were adjacent to streams that drained sub-watersheds where extensive agricultural best management practices (BMPs) designed to reduce nutrient runoff were implemented beginning in 2003. Three other study sites were downstream from sub-watersheds where only a few or no BMPs were implemented by landowners. For the sites that received extensive management, comparisons of the Pre-BMP baseline period (2-3 yrs) to the Post-BMP period (4 yrs) revealed that algal cover was statistically lower than baseline in eight of eleven years (72.7%). For the three sites where limited or no management was implemented, the percent cover of filamentous algae was lower than Pre-BMP baseline levels in only three of twelve years (25%). Where major reductions in cover of filamentous algae occurred, positive relationships existed with summer stream loading of nitrate and soluble reactive phosphorus to the nearshore. In some cases only nitrate loading was significantly correlated with percent cover, indicating that the relative importance of nitrogen and phosphorus to algal growth near streams may be determined by the characteristics and land use within each sub-watershed. Agricultural BMPs targeting nutrient and suspended solid runoff can effectively reduce filamentous algal growth locally along the lake littoral zone on a time scale of months to a few years and with moderate commitment of resources. This work offers a new perspective for management of the growing problem of littoral algal growth in the embayments and drowned river Mouths of the Great Lakes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

J	Li, C; Sessions, AL; Valentine, DL; Thiagarajan, N				Li, Chao; Sessions, Alex L.; Valentine, David L.; Thiagarajan, Nivedita			D/H variation in terrestrial lipids from Santa Barbara Basin over the past 1400 years: A preliminary assessment of paleoclimatic relevance	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												We analyzed D/H ratios of common terrestrial leaf wax lipids in a 1400 year sediment core from the Santa Barbara Basin (SBB) to test whether they accurately record terrestrial climate in Southern California. The D/H ratios of long chain n-alkanes vary substantially with depth, but are poorly correlated with other terrestrial climate proxies. Interference from fossil hydrocarbons may be at least partly responsible. Long chain n-alkanoic acids exhibit nearly constant downcore D/H ratio values. This constancy in the face of known climatic shifts presumably reflects a substantial residence time for leaf wax compounds in terrestrial soil and/or on the basin flanks. Alternatively, the isotopic composition of meteoric waters in Southern California may not covary with climate, particularly aridity. However, the delta D values of n-C(22) and n-C(24) fatty acids, commonly attributed to terrestrial aquatic sources, are partially correlated with Southern California winter Palmer Drought Severity Index, a tree ring-based climatic proxy (R(2) 0.25; p < 0.01) on multi-centennial scales with an inferred ca. 215 year time lag. The improved correlation of these bio-markers can be explained by the fact that they are not stored in terrestrial soil nor are subject to interference from fossil hydrocarbons. Our study indicates that the SBB is unlikely to preserve high resolution leaf wax D/H records that can serve as quantitative paleoclimate proxies, though some qualitative information may be retained. More generally, the sources of lipids in marginal marine basins need to be carefully evaluated prior to attempting paleoclimate reconstruction based on the leaf wax D/H proxy. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Quaternary subglacial and explosive volcanism in the Canadian Cascade arc (Sea-to-Sky Corridor), British Columbia	TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS OF LIFE ON AN ACTIVE SUBDUCTION ZONE: FIELD TRIPS IN AND AROUND VANCOUVER, CANADA	Geological Society of America Field Guide											This field guide examines Quaternary volcanism in the Canadian Cascade arc informally known as the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt. During the first day, the trip proceeds along the Sea-to-Sky Highway corridor from Vancouver to Pemberton and focuses on Quaternary glaciovolcanic deposits and lavas. Interactions between volcanoes and ice in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt have been common during the past two million years, which has resulted in a diverse array of landforms, including subglacial domes, tuyas, impounded lava masses, and sinuous lavas that exploited within-ice drainage systems. On Days 2 and 3, the trip heads northwest of Pemberton, British Columbia, along logging roads to see deposits from the 2360 yr B.P. eruption of the Mount Meager volcanic complex. The eruption began Plinian-style, generating pyroclastic fall and density current deposits (Day 2) and ended with the production of welded and nonwelded block and ash flows by explosive (Vulcanian) collapse of a lava (Day 3). The guide will examine the deposits of the temporary lake impounded by a block and ash flow deposit dam, and the evidence of the catastrophic failure of the dam and the generation of a huge outburst flood and lahar. Many of the traits of the deposits seen on this three-day trip are a reflection of both the style of eruption and the nature of the surrounding landscape. In this regard, the trip provides a spectacular window into the nature and hazards of effusive and explosive volcanism occurring in mountainous terrains and the role of water and ice.

Salt may be extracted from sea water, mineral deposits, surface encrustations, saline lakes and brine springs. In many inland areas, wood was used as a fuel source for evaporation of brine and this practice led to major deafforestation in central Europe. Salt played a central role in the economies of many regions, and is often reflected in place names. Salt was also used as a basis for population censuses and taxation, and salt monopolies were practised in many states. Salt was sometimes implicated in the outbreak of conflict, e.g. the French Revolution and the Indian War of Independence. Salt has also been invested with many cultural and religious meanings, from the ancient Egyptians to the Middle Ages. Man's innate appetite for salt may be related to his evolution from predominantly vegetarian anthropoids, and it is noteworthy that those people who live mainly on protein and milk or who drink salty water do not generally salt their food, whereas those who live mainly on vegetables, rice and cereals use much more salt. Medicinal use tended to emphasize the positive aspects of salt, e.g. prevention of putrefaction, reduction of tissue swelling, treatment of diarrhea. Evidence was also available to ancient peoples of its relationship to fertility, particularly in domestic animals. The history of salt thus represents a unique example for studying the impact of a widely used dietary substance on different important aspects of man's life, including medical philosophy.

J	Radigan, WJ; Engel, C; Chvala, P; Longhenry, C; Pegg, M				Radigan, William J.; Engel, Cali; Chvala, Phil; Longhenry, Christopher; Pegg, Mark			Factors affecting detection probabilities of acoustic transmitters using passive receivers	ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY												BackgroundPassive acoustic telemetry is a common tool used to study fish movements. Range tests, or determining the distance at which transmitters can be recognized by a receiver, are needed to accurately determine fish position in the environment. However, range tests are not often conducted or are only completed during a single season prior to an acoustic telemetry study commencing though seasonality may affect detection probabilities over a multi-year study's duration. Therefore, we conducted a series of tests to assess the effect of seasonality on range detection over a 3-year period on Lewis and Clark Lake, a Missouri River reservoir. Specifically, we measured the effects that seasonal environmental (e.g., wind, depth, temperature) factors had on detection probability at a range of distances using Innovasea V13 acoustic transmitters at 14 VR2tx 69-kHz passive receivers. These data were used to inform array design for a concurrent acoustic telemetry research project. We accounted for spatiotemporal variation in detection probability by evaluating monthly detection probabilities across years from March-September during 2022-2024.ResultsMean detection probability for Lewis and Clark Lake receivers from range tests was 0. 60 for 50 m, 0.50 for 100 m, 0.37 for 200 m, 0.23 for 400 m, 0.15 for 600 m, and 0.11 for 800 m. We found detection probabilities in the spring were greater than those in the other seasons. We found negative relationships between detection probabilities and distance between the tag and receiver, wind speed, inflow through Fort Randall Dam, and tag depth. Further, we found detection probabilities varied with river kilometer, presumably due to habitat differences.ConclusionsImplications of our findings include consideration of lower realized detection probabilities (i.e., resulting from environmental factors) compared to equipment capabilities during study design, and the consideration of both anthropogenic influences (i.e., inflow) and natural environmental factors (i.e., wind) that affect detection probabilities. The receiver array in Lewis and Clark Lake, South Dakota was modified due to the findings presented herein, in that receivers were stationed in nearshore locations presumably sheltered from the wind. In general, our data support placing receiver stations nearer to shore and protected from wind fetch to the best extent possible to optimize detection distance.

These lakes have the potential to emit methane (CH4) because of the exposure of cryopreserved organic carbon, leading to their significance in regional carbon turnover and cycling. However, previous studies have focused more on human-impacted lakes (e.g., eutrophic lakes), resulting in limited research on the mechanisms of CH4 cycling in the proglacial lakes. In this study, we demonstrated that three typical emerging high-latitude proglacial lakes (similar to 5500 m a.s.l.) on the TP exhibited a diffusive emission flux of 32.39 +/- 11.66 mu mol/m(2)/d during the summer. The delta C-13-CH4 values (-50.10 +/- 0.56 parts per thousand) suggested a biogenic origin of CH4 through the acetoclastic pathway in the lakes. Metagenome sequencing further showed that microbes involved in methanogenesis were dominated by Methanosarcina (36.74 +/- 0.07 % of total methanogens). Significant CH4 consumption was observed in the proglacial lakes. The microbes involved in the CH4 consumption were dominated by Methylobacter (48.50 +/- 0.17 % of total methanotrophs). A Mantel test demonstrated that dissolved iron (Fe) was a key factor controlling the structure of the CH4 cycling microbial communities. Functional gene and co-occurrence network analyses indicated that members of Pseudomonadota, Bacteroidota, and Actinomycetota may be involved in CH4 cycling by providing methanogenic substrates (i.e., acetyl coenzyme A) and consuming CH4 oxidative intermediates (i.e., methanol, formaldehyde, and formic acid). This study emphasized the ecological significance of emerging proglacial lakes in CH4 releases. It broadened the current understanding of cryophilic CH4 cycling microbes and their mechanisms, that enhances our knowledge of the carbon cycle on the TP.																			0043-1354	1879-2448				JUL 15	2025	280								123533	10.1016/j.watres.2025.123533	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2025.123533		MAR 2025						40153957					WOS:001460014600001

A new method is proposed for extraction and preconcentration of linear alkylbenzene sulfonates from filtered and ethyl alcohol-preserved water samples, which includes (i) solid-phase extraction on reversed-phase C18 cartridges at a flow rate of 30-50 cm(3)/min (recovery 100%) with subsequent elution of the analytes with methanol, (ii) re-dissolution of the analytes in distilled water and their re-extraction with chloroform in the form of an ion pair with methylene blue (recovery 98%), (iii) methylation of the extract with a new trimethyl orthoformate reagent in the environmental monitoring with a 98% yield of methyl esters of alkylbenzene sulfonic acids, and (iv) additional precleaning and preconcentration of the analytes by 20 000 times as compared with the initial sample on cartridge tubes with silica gel (100% recovery). The structure of methylated derivatives is confirmed by H-1 NMR spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with electron impact ionization (70 eV) in the total ion current (TIC) mode (m/z 50-500). The new approaches are tested by analyzing sodium alkylbenzene sulfonate homologues C10-C13 in the water of the Krestovka River, a tributary of Lake Baikal, during spring season when the floods associated with snow and ice melting have already complited by the sampling. The average (n = 3) total concentration of the analytes in river water is estimated as 2.1 +/- 0.4 mu g/L using the external standard calibration method.

Holocene vegetation and hydroclimate changes in the Kansk forest steppe, Yenisei River Basin, East Siberia	BOREAS												Our study focuses on the Holocene hydroclimate long-term trends in southern East Siberia and places them in the context of the adjacent areas of the Siberian taiga in the north and the arid central Asia in the south. We present a new record from the eutrophic mire, in the forest-steppe region, covering the last 9000 years. Our multi-proxy approach includes physiochemical (ash content, grain size, micro-charcoal, peat decomposition) and biological indicators (pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs, plant macrofossils, testate amoebae, molluscs). The record indicates increased humidity during the Holocene Thermal Maximum at 8150-7400 cal. a BP, and drier conditions with evidence for fires at 7400-5100 cal. a BP. Next, wetter conditions occurred at the coring site at 5100-1400 cal. a BP based on evidence of fluvial influence, which is consistent with other records in the wider region. A short-term dry episode occurred at 1400-1300 cal. a BP, followed by a wet Medieval Warm Period (1300-650 cal. a BP) and Little Ice Age (450-300 cal. a BP) and a moderately wet environment from 300 cal. a BP to the present day. These results are consistent with the previously published palaeoenvironmental reconstructions from the steppe and forest-steppe regions in the south of East and West Siberia and taken together reveal a common trend towards wetter conditions with a maximum wetness between 4500 and 3000 cal. a BP. This differs from the taiga region further north and from the Altai-Sayan Mountains and Kazakhstan Hills further south, which show the trend from dry to wet and then to drier conditions in the Holocene, and from the Trans-Baikal region where the Holocene trend is to drier conditions. This study supports the predominant influence of the North Atlantic on the regional palaeoclimate changes in the forest-steppe region of East Siberia during the Holocene.

We conducted a geochemical and stable isotope study of the shells ofRadixfrom the exposed fluvio-lacustrine sediments near Lake Yamdrok Yumtso in the southern Tibetan Plateau. Our aims were to determine the sedimentary environment, palaeo-lake hydrochemistry and hydrological status. AMS(14)C and OSL dating indicates that a lake-level stage of Yamdrok Yumtso higher than that of today occurred during similar to 4.7-1.2 cal. kyr BP. Results of Sr/Ca, delta C-13 and delta O-18 analysis of the fossil shells ofRadix auriculariaindicate that the lake-level fluctuations were mainly controlled by changes of the Indian Summer Monsoon; decreasing evaporation during the mid- to late-Holocene was also responsible. In addition, based on the geochemical relationship betweenRadixsp. shells and the ambient water in lakes, the values of delta O-18(Palaeo-water) and Sr/CaPalaeo-water reconstructed using the fossil shells ofRadix auriculariaare -8.2 parts per thousand to -5.1 parts per thousand and 0.0012 to 0.0057, respectively. Further, based on the values of delta O-18(shell), together with geomorphological evidence, we infer that Yamdrok Yumtso was a closed lake system, and we estimate its possible extent during the interval of high lake-level. In addition, we speculate that the water level of Yamdrok Yumtso at this time exceeded 4448.9 m a.s.l., but was less than 4451 m a.s.l., and that the major separation of various components of the Yamdrok Yumtso system occurred after 1.2 kyr BP.					; chen, feng/P-7135-2019	Chen, Feng/0000-0001-6210-8146; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				DEC	2020	30	12					1741	1751	0959683620950426	10.1177/0959683620950426	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683620950426		AUG 2020											WOS:000561104600001
J	Radke, RJ; Kahl, U; Benndorf, J				Radke, RJ; Kahl, U; Benndorf, J			Food-web manipulation of drinking water reservoirs with salmonids: vertical distribution of prey and predator	LIMNOLOGICA												In a novel biomanipulation experiment salmonids were used as a too] to improve water quality. The manipulation was initiated in spring 2000 as a response to non-point sources of phosphorus in a drinking water reservoir in Saxony, Germany. Salmonids (brown trout, Salmo trutta forma lacustris) were chosen as predators as the reservoir has a large hypolimnic water body and surface temperatures rarely exceed 20 degreesC. The vertical distributions of prey fish and brown trout were analysed with a fleet of vertical gill nets set in the pelagic zone of the reservoir. Consumption of brown trout was estimated by means of a bioenergetic model and the diet analyses of the trout. While the dominant planktivore (roach, Rutilus rutilus) was caught almost exclusively in the epilimnion during the stratification period trout were caught mainly below a depth of 10 m. Diet analysis revealed that the trout performed vertical migrations to consume food in the epilimnic layer, as an important food component were adult terrestrial and aquatic insects. The amount of fish in the food increased strongly with the size of the brown trout. The consumption estimate suggested that the trout had consumed 2-3% of the total roach stock during the study period (May-November 2000) of the first year of biomampulation. We conclude that in general salmonids are suitable for food-web manipulation in deep reservoirs, but the stocked fish should be as large as possible (> 300 mm) and the proportion of large trout (> 500 mm) should be as high as possible.																			0075-9511					JUL	2003	33	2					92	98		10.1016/S0075-9511(03)80038-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0075-9511(03)80038-5													WOS:000184495500002

J.; Charron, Christian; Boyer, Claudine; Daigle, Anik			Regional thermal analysis approach: A management tool for predicting water temperature metrics relevant for thermal fish habitat	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												The field of water resource management, including fisheries, is facing new challenges associated with climate change. This study sheds light on the modeling of water temperature indices (metrics) that describe critical thermal maxima of the Atlantic salmon (salmo salar). These thermal metrics include MaxWaterTmax (interannual mean of maximum summer temperature), MaxNumDay (interannual mean of the number of consecutive days with maximum water temperature > 25 degrees C and minimum water temperature > 20 degrees C). The latter is an important indicator to evaluate thermal variability. Three other parameters of a Gaussian function fitted to the interannual daily mean temperatures characterizing the thermal regime of 146 stations located in Eastern Canada were estimated. These three parameters are Gaussian_a (maximum of interannual daily mean temperature), Gaussian_b (mean duration of the warm period), and Gaussian_c (date of occurrence of the interannual maximum temperature). The classical Multiple linear regression model (MLR) and the non-linear Generalized additive model (GAM) were tested and compared to estimate the five thermal metrics. The regression-based approaches involve the identification of thermally homogeneous regions based on three approaches: hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), regions of influence (ROI) as well as canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Then, the regional MLR and GAM models were applied within the delineated homogenous regions. Also, the regional models were compared to models encompassing all stations (i.e., one region). For each regional estimation model and each thermal metric, a set of optimal explanatory variables were selected using a forward stepwise procedure. The database consisted of 22 environmental predictors related to physiography, topography, climate, land cover and surface deposits. To assess performance of the models, the following statistical metrics were used: coefficient of determination R2, root mean square error (RMSE), bias, relative root mean square error (RRMSE) and percent bias (PBias). The results demonstrate that the non-linear GAM model was consistently better than the simpler MLR model for estimating the five thermal metrics. Results also show that the best practice consists in delineating homogeneous regions before applying the regional GAM model. According to all performance criteria, delineation of regions with the HCA approach is considered to be more flexible and to lead to better performances than neighborhood-based approaches (CCA and ROI).					; St-Hilaire, André/W-7120-2019	St-Hilaire, Andre/0000-0001-9161-4742; 													1574-9541	1878-0512				SEP	2022	70								101692	10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101692	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101692		JUN 2022											WOS:000818633000004

Relationships of surface water, pore water, and sediment chemistry in wetlands adjacent to Great Salt Lake, Utah, and potential impacts on plant community health	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												We collected surface water, pore water, and sediment samples at five impounded wetlands adjacent to Great Salt Lake, Utah, during 2010 and 2011 in order to characterize pond chemistry and to compare chemistry with plant community health metrics. We also collected pore water and sediment samples along multiple transects at two sheet flow wetlands during 2011 to investigate a potential link between wetland chemistry and encroachment of invasive emergent plant species. Samples were analyzed for a suite of trace and major elements, nutrients, and relevant field parameters. The extensive sampling campaign provides a broad assessment of Great Salt Lake wetlands, including a range of conditions from reference to highly degraded. We used nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) to characterize the wetland sites based on the multiple parameters measured in surface water, pore water, and sediment. NMS results showed that the impounded wetlands fall along a gradient of high salinity/low trace element concentrations to low salinity/high trace element concentrations, whereas the sheet flow wetlands have both elevated salinity and high trace element concentrations, reflecting either different sources of element loading or different biogeochemical/hydrological processes operating within the wetlands. Other geochemical distinctions were found among the wetlands, including Fe-reducing conditions at two sites and sulfate-reducing conditions at the remaining sites. Plant community health metrics in the impounded wetlands showed negative correlations with specific metal concentrations in sediment (THg, Cu, Zn, Cd, Sb, Pb, Ag, Tl), and negative correlations with nutrient concentrations in surface water (nitrite, phosphate, nitrate). In the sheet flow wetlands, invasive plant species were inversely correlated with pore water salinity. These results indicate that sediment and pore water chemistry play an important role in wetland plant community health, and that monitoring and remediation efforts should consider pore water and sediment chemistry in addition to surface water chemistry.

The pollen indicate a general trend through the last 740 kyr from wetter conditions to generally drier environments. Grassland dominated with less common Podocarpus and Cyperaceae in a sparse flora between 1000 and 740 ka. Poaceae, woodland and herbaceous plants are common through the remaining core and abundant between 740 and 528 ka and after 200 ka. Pollen diversity increased after 200 ka. Podocarpus and Cyperaceae reached a peak abundance at similar to 575 ka with a subsequent decline that suggests a progressive increase in aridity, interrupted by wetter intervals. Podocarpus-dominated forests expanded and contracted many times during the Quaternary and document an anti-phased relationship with data from Lake Malawi. Similar anti-phased correlations are noted for herbaceous plants, suggesting that the two basins responded differently to the same climate or were influenced by contrasting climate regimes. Increases in macrocharcoal correlate with increasing pollen abundance and suggest wetter conditions. Data from the Magadi, Koora and Olorgesailie basins indicate similar trends and a dominant climate control on vegetation and habitats. Large lakes characterised all three basins at 740-528 ka with climate subsequently becoming drier, but with many wetter intervals. At various times the lakes expanded, contracted and dried out, except at Lake Magadi where spring inflows maintained lacustrine conditions through the late Quaternary. Faulting also contributed to fragmentation of the landscape and formation of a mosaic of habitats. An especially intense period of aridity at similar to 528-392 ka coincided with extinction of many large-bodied mammals and may have helped to drive a change from the use of Acheulean hand axes to the production of Middle Stone Age tools by 320 ka. After 200 ka pollen diversity increased substantially with a mix of montane, riparian and dry forest associations that were present in varying amounts through to similar to 4.2 ka at the core top.

J	Peng, YM; Rioual, P; Jin, ZD				Peng, Yumei; Rioual, Patrick; Jin, Zhangdong			A record of Holocene climate changes in central Asia derived from diatom-inferred water-level variations in Lake Kalakuli (Eastern Pamirs, western China)	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												The unique geographical and climatic settings of the eastern Pamirs make this region sensitive to the Westerlies and global climate change. Holocene fluctuations in water-level of Lake Kalakuli, a proglacial lake located to the northwest of the Muztag Ata glacier, were reconstructed based on diatoms from a -15 m long sediment core spanning the last similar to 9,900 years. To establish how diatom species distribute in relation to water depth in Lake Kalakuli, a dataset of 45 surface sediment samples was retrieved from different water depth. Statistical analyses such as cluster analysis (TWINSPAN) and redundancy analysis (RDA) were used to demonstrate that the water depth gradient is the main environmental gradient driving the distribution of these diatom assemblages. A diatom-water depth transfer function, was then developed using a weighted averaging partial least squares component 2 model (R-2 = 0.89, RMSEP = 1.85 m) and applied to the Holocene diatom sequence from Lake Kalakuli. Due to the large residual errors in the model only the general trends in water level are proposed. Effective moisture increased rapidly during the early Holocene, as the water depth reached a high level from the lowest level within about two thousand years. Only small amplitude fluctuations were recorded during the mid- and late Holocene until the last few hundred years when a marked increase occurred. Changes in summer insolation over the northern hemisphere drove the advances and retreats of the Muztag Ata glacier, which in turn controlled the fluctuations of water level in this lake. The diatom-derived paleoclimatic trend from Lake Kalakuli is consistent with the Holocene climate evolution in the Westerlies-dominated area of Central Asia.

Recent ice core studies reconstruct fire history over the past few decades but do not extend through the Holocene. La-custrine sedimentary cores, however, can provide continuous records of local environmental change on millennial scales during the Holocene through the accumulation and preservation of specific organic molecular biomarkers. To reconstruct Holocene fire events and vegetation changes occurring on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau and the surrounding areas, we used a multi-proxy approach, investigating multiple biomarkers preserved in core sediment samples retrieved from Paru Co, a small lake located in the Nyainqentanglha Mountains (29 degrees 47'45.6 '' N, 9 degrees 21'07.2 '' E; 4845 ma.s.l.). Biomarkers include n-alkanes as indicators of vegetation, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as combustion proxies, fecal sterols and stanols (FeSts) as indicators of the presence of humans or grazing animals, and finally monosaccharide anhydrides (MAs) as specific markers of vegetation burning processes. Insolation changes and the associated influence on the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) affect the vegetation distribution and fire types recorded in Paru Co throughout the Holocene. The early Holocene (10.7-7.5 cal kyr BP) n-alkane ratios demonstrate oscillations between grass and conifer communities, resulting in respective smouldering fires represented by levoglucosan peaks, and high-temperature fires represented by high-molecular-weight PAHs. Forest cover increases with a strengthened ISM, where coincident high levoglucosan to mannosan (L/M) ratios are consistent with conifer burning. The decrease in the ISM at 4.2 cal kyr BP corresponds with the expansion of regional civilizations, although the lack of human FeSts above the method detection limits excludes local anthropogenic influence on fire and vegetation changes. The late Holocene is characterized by a relatively shallow lake surrounded by grassland, where all biomarkers other than PAHs display only minor variations. The sum of PAHs steadily increases throughout the late Holocene, suggesting a net increase in local to regional combustion that is separate from vegetation and climate change.

However, accurate interpretations rely on known isotopic fractionation during ice growth. A one-dimensional diffusion model of the liquid boundary layer adjacent to an advancing solid interface, originally developed to simulate solute rejection by growing crystals, has been used without verification to describe non-equilibrium fractionation during congelation ice growth. Results are not in agreement, suggesting the presence of important uncertainties. In this paper we seek validation of the diffusion model for this application using large-scale laboratory experiments with controlled freezing rates and frequent sampling. We obtained consistent, almost constant, isotopic boundary layer thicknesses over a representative range of ice growth rates on both quiescent and well-mixed water. With the O-18 boundary layer thickness from the laboratory, the model successfully quantified reduced river-ice growth rates relative to those of a nearby fake. These results were more representative and easier to obtain than those of a conventional thermal ice-growth model. This diffusion model validation and boundary layer thickness determination provide a powerful tool for interpreting the stable isotope stratigraphy of floating ice. The laboratory experiment also replicated successive fractionation events in response to a freeze-thaw-refreeze cycle, providing a mechanism for apparent ice fractionation that exceeds equilibrium. Analysis of the composition of snow ice and frazil ice in river and lake cores indicated surprising similarities between these ice forms.

J	TRIPPEL, EA; ECKMANN, R; HARTMANN, J				TRIPPEL, EA; ECKMANN, R; HARTMANN, J			POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF GLOBAL WARMING ON WHITEFISH IN LAKE CONSTANCE, GERMANY	AMBIO												A doubling of the present global atmospheric CO2 concentration is expected to occur sometime during the middle of the 21 st century and climatologists have predicted that this will result in an increase in the global mean air temperature ranging from 1.5-degrees-4.5-degrees-C. Fisheries resources are highly responsive to water temperature varirations and will likely undergo marked change as well. We present several predictions for the whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) population of prealpine Lake Constance and, for the early stages of each warming scenario, an increase in whitefish abundance is predicted. Negative effects limiting population growth will probably set in during the latter stages of the 3.0-degrees and 4.5-degrees-C CO2 doubling scenarios. Of chief importance to population restructuring is the timing of temperature increases during specific periods of the year and whether these temperature increases co-occur with fragile, temperature-sensitive early life stages. Our predictions are based on April and May lake-surface temperatures, since during these months whitefish larvae inhabit the lake's surface waters and exhibit substantially faster growth and higher survival when the surface is warm as opposed to cold. In the historical record there exists no evidence that temperature fluctuations during the other ten months of the year influence whitefish recruitment. In a warmer climate, however, mild winters may prevent oxygen enrichment of deep water causing high egg mortalities. Whitefish in shallow lakes (< 20 m deep) may not respond as favorably to global warming.																			0044-7447	1654-7209				SEP	1991	20	6					226	231																WOS:A1991GJ85000005

However, there is a lack of data on identifying the role of salt mineral types in aeolian erosion. In this study, seven types of single salt including NaCl, KCl, MgCl2, Na2SO4, K2SO4, MgSO4, and Na2CO3 were examined to preliminarily explore the influencing mechanism of efflorescence and subflorescence by these salts on aeolian erosion. Soil samples treated by these salts were prepared under an environmental condition of summer in the semiarid region and wind tunnel tests were conducted subsequently under a strong wind of 18 m s(- 1). The results show that Na2SO4, MgSO4, and Na2CO3 generated highly emissive surfaces. Crystals of Na2SO4 and Na2CO3 occurring in an acicular form and arranging loosely induced crusts with weak strength. For MgSO4, the fluffy aggregates on the crust surface as a result of dehydration were the main dust source. MgSO4 crystals within the crust occurred in a prismatic form and were covered with fissures or cracks, inducing a salt crust with great strength, but having the tendency to dehydrate. The crystals of NaCl, KCl, and MgCl2 occurred in cubic or tabular form and in compact arrangement, forming crusts with great strength and inhibiting dust emission. K2SO(4) formed a thin crust peeling off from the soil which is susceptible to aeolian erosion. Under the influence of subflorescence, Na2SO4, MgSO4, and Na2CO3 attenuated the strength of the soil through salt heaving, which increased the potential of aeolian erosion. In contrast, NaCl, KCl, MgCl2, and K2SO4 played a role as bonding agent and reduced the potential of aeolian erosion. These results suggest that salts that could crystalize into hydrous and anhydrous minerals, such as Na2SO4, MgSO4 and Na2CO3, can remarkably enhance the potential of dust emission at the soil surface and subsurface.					; Zhang, Guoming/P-8897-2019	Hu, Xinjia/0000-0003-2030-0185; 													0341-8162	1872-6887				AUG	2022	215								106323	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106323	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106323		APR 2022											WOS:000798081500002

Microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA markers show no evidence of population structure in walleye (Sander vitreus) in Lake Winnipeg	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Walleye (Sander vitreus) are the main contributor to Manitoba's multi-million dollar commercial fishery, with Lake Winnipeg providing the largest and most profitable catch. In some systems, walleye show evidence of returning to the same spawning site each spring (i.e., philopatry), which can lead to the existence of multiple genetically-discrete spawning groups (i.e., stocks) within a lake. This study used nine microsatellite loci (N=932) and one mitochondrial restriction fragment length polymorphism assay (N=123) to investigate possible genetic divergence among walleye from 13 spawning sites in Lake Winnipeg, and compared these with those collected from two hatchery locations and other locations outside of Lake Winnipeg. Microsatellite loci resolved little population structure within Lake Winnipeg, with the exception of two sites (Grand Rapids and the Icelandic River), which showed low but significant levels of genetic divergence with most other sites (F-st=0.0066-0.0457). Slight to moderate genetic divergence was found between Lake Winnipeg walleye and sampling locations outside of Lake Winnipeg (F-st=0.0037-0.1054, P=0.0002). Mitochondrial DNA analysis indicated colonization of Lake Winnipeg by walleye from two glacial refugia (Missourian and Mississippian), but no population structure was detected among sites. The lack of stock structure found in Lake Winnipeg possibly indicates a low degree of natal philopatry, an amount of straying sufficient to obscure genetic structure, or obscured structure as a result of historical and current stocking. Overall genetic variation, using both mitochondrial and microsatellite markers, appeared comparable to that found in other walleye populations.

J	Chetel, LM; Carroll, AR				Chetel, Lauren M.; Carroll, Alan R.			TERMINAL INFILL OF EOCENE LAKE GOSIUTE, WYOMING, USA	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH												Deposition of lacustrine sediments in the greater Green River Basin was progressively terminated in the middle Eocene as volcaniclastic detritus prograded across the basin; the lacustrine sediment of the Laney Member was replaced by deposition of the deltaic and fluvial sediments of the volcaniclastic Bridger and Washakie formations and the Sand Butte Bed of the Laney Member. The transition from the deposition of lacustrine to alluvial sediment also records a reversal in the direction of drainage across the basin that occurred between 49.5 Ma and 48.9 Ma. Prior to this transition, drainage entered the basin from the east and the arkosic detritus of the Cathedral Bluffs Member of the Wasatch Formation was deposited in the Washakie and Great Divide subbasins. At the same time evaporitic sediments of the Wilkins Peak Member of the Green River Formation accumulated simultaneously in the Bridger Basin, indicating that the clastic sediment was baffled east of the Rock Springs Arch, an intrabasinal structural high. The subsequent transition to deposition of the Laney Member is traditionally interpreted as an isochronous expansion of Lake Gosiute across the greater Green River Basin. Alternatively, the transition may have been diachronous with continued accumulation of the Wilkins Peak Member in the Bridger Basin coinciding with the earliest deposition of the Laney Member in the Washakie Basin. By 48.9 Ma the dominant drainage was clearly from the west, which reflects the capture of an external drainage network through the northwest corner of the basin that delivered extrabasinal volcaniclastic detritus to the greater Green River Basin. More broadly, these results illustrate that the geomorphic evolution of the landscape influenced the character of sedimentary fill in the nonmarine greater Green River Basin.

In addition to effects of direct predation by planktivorous fish, nutrient recycling by fish may also contribute to structuring foodwebs in lakes. There is little evidence, however, about whether underyearling fish undergoing several ontogenetic diet shifts may have a comparable bottom-up impact. 2. This study examined seasonal patterns of phosphorus (P) concentration and external load, phytoplankton, zooplankton and benthos, and diet shifts in three underyearling fish [perch (Perca fluviatilis), roach (Rutilus rutilus) and ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus)] in the shallow, hypertrophic biomanipulated Bautzen reservoir, Germany. Phosphorus metabolism of fish was calculated by a balanced bioenergetics model on the basis of fish diet, growth and water temperature. 3. The fish showed several shifts from planktivory to other food sources during the sampling period from May to September. These shifts were probably caused by the seasonal succession of the zooplankton community, mainly the midsummer decline of Daphnia galeata. 4. The diet shifts in fish also had consequences for the amount of P consumed and released. During periods of dominant zooplanktivory, the excretion of P did not exceed the removal of P stored in pelagic prey. By contrast, if benthivory dominated, fish subsidized the pelagic P pool by excreting more P from benthic prey than had been removed from the pelagic area. This occurred predominantly in perch and ruffe during periods of low zooplankton biomass, whereas the roach ate more algae and therefore excreted less P of benthic origin. 5. Phosphorus release by underyearling fish was estimated at a maximum of 0.1 mg m(-3) day-l. This value was negligible! compared with both the external load of P to Bautzen reservoir and the concentration of P in the pelagic area during summer. It is therefore concluded that both the predominance of underyearling zooplanktivorous fish and the high Daphnia biomass during certain periods of the year in the Bautzen reservoir may be the reason that nutrient release by the fish structured the foodweb only marginally. 6. This study suggests that biomanipulation has altered both top-down and bottom-up impacts of fish in Bautzen reservoir. The highest efficiency of foodweb manipulations may be obtained after reduction of the external P loading below a certain threshold. In turn, if external restoration of eutrophied lakes is not accompanied by changes in fish community, then the combined forces of strong zooplanktivory and high P recycling of dense stocks of zooplanktivorous and benthivorous fish may hold the water in a eutrophic-like stage, even if external load has been significantly reduced.

Moisture is the predominant variable controlling environmental change in the arid zone. Landscapes in this region respond more noticeably to changes in precipitation than to temperature. Depending on their location, arid zone records broadly respond to tropical monsoon-influenced climate regimes, the temperate latitude westerly systems, or a combination of both. The timing and extent of relatively arid and humid phases vary across the continent, in particular between the westerly wind-controlled temperate latitudes, and the interior and north which are influenced by tropically sourced precipitation. Relatively humid phases in the Murray-Darling Basin on the semi-arid margins, which were characterised by large rivers most likely fed by snow melt, prevailed from 40 ka to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), and from the deglacial to the mid Holocene. By contrast, the Lake Eyre basin in central Australia remained relatively dry throughout the last 40 ka, with lake high stands at lake Frome around 35-30 ka, and parts of the deglacial period and the mid-Holocene. The LGM was characterised by widespread relative aridity and colder conditions, as evidenced by extensive desert dune activity and dust transport, lake level fall, and reduced but episodic fluvial activity. The climate of the deglacial period was spatially divergent. The southern part of the continent experienced a brief humid phase around similar to 17-15 ka, followed by increased dune activity around similar to 14-10 ka. This contrasts with the post-LGM persistence of arid conditions in the north, associated with a lapsed monsoon and reflected in lake level lows and reduced fluvial activity, followed by intensification of the monsoon and increasingly effective precipitation from similar to 14 ka. Palaeoenvironmental change during the Holocene was also spatially variable. The early to mid-Holocene was, however, generally characterised by moderately humid conditions, demonstrated by lake level rise, source-bordering dune activity, and speleothem growth, persisting at different times across the continent. Increasingly arid conditions developed into the late Holocene, particularly in the central arid zone. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A Microbial Arsenic Cycle in Sediments of an Acidic Mine Impoundment: Herman Pit, Clear Lake, California	GEOMICROBIOLOGY JOURNAL												The involvement of prokaryotes in the redox reactions of arsenic occurring between its +5 [arsenate; As (V)] and +3 [arsenite; As(III)] oxidation states has been well established. Most research to date has focused upon circum-neutral pH environments (e.g., freshwater or estuarine sediments) or arsenic-rich "extreme" environments like hot springs and soda lakes. In contrast, relatively little work has been conducted in acidic environments. With this in mind we conducted experiments with sediments taken from the Herman Pit, an acid mine drainage impoundment of a former mercury (cinnabar) mine. Due to the large adsorptive capacity of the abundant Fe(III)-rich minerals, we were unable to initially detect in solution either As(V) or As(III) added to the aqueous phase of live sediment slurries or autoclaved controls, although the former consumed added electron donors (i.e., lactate, acetate, hydrogen), while the latter did not. This prompted us to conduct further experiments with diluted slurries using the live materials from the first incubation as inoculum. In these experiments we observed reduction of As(V) to As(III) under anoxic conditions and reduction rates were enhanced by addition of electron donors. We also observed oxidation of As(III) to As (V) in oxic slurries as well as in anoxic slurries amended with nitrate. We noted an acid-tolerant trend for sediment slurries in the cases of As(III) oxidation (aerobic and anaerobic) as well as for anaerobic As(V) reduction. These observations indicate the presence of a viable microbial arsenic redox cycle in the sediments of this extreme environment, a result reinforced by the successful amplification of arsenic functional genes (aioA, and arrA) from these materials.

J	George, C; Rowland, C; Gerard, F; Balzter, H				George, Charles; Rowland, Clare; Gerard, France; Balzter, Heiko			Retrospective mapping of burnt areas in Central Siberia using a modification of the normalised difference water index	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The boreal forest contains almost half the total carbon pool of world forest ecosystems, and so has a very significant role in global biogeochemical cycles. The flux of greenhouse gases in and out of these forests is influenced strongly by disturbances such as diseases, logging and predominantly fire. It is important to quantify these disturbances to enable the modelling of major greenhouse gases. However, because of the remoteness and vastness of the boreal forest, little data is available on the type, extent, frequency and severity of these disturbances in Siberia. For burnt areas, two of the more responsive wavelengths are the short wave infra-red (SWIR) and the near infra-red (NIR). These produce a vegetation index, the normalised difference SWIR (NDSWIR) capable of detecting retrospective disturbances. Here we combine the NDSWIR from MODIS imagery acquired in the summer of 2003 with thermal anomaly data from 1992 to 2003 to detect and date areas which burnt at some point between 1992 and 2003. The semi-automated method is called SWIR and Thermal ANomalies for Detecting Disturbances (STANDD) and is complemented by an Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) differencing method using MODIS 2002 and 2003 imagery to ensure reliable detection of area burnt in the year of image acquisition (i.e. 2003). The area of this study covers approximately 3 million km(2) stretching from Lake Baikal in the south to the Laptev Sea in the north, above the Arctic Circle. Landsat ETM+ images were used to validate the shape and areal extent of the burnt areas resulting in an 81% overall accuracy with a kappa coefficient of agreement of 0.63. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

J	LYONS, J; MAGNUSON, JJ				LYONS, J; MAGNUSON, JJ			EFFECTS OF WALLEYE PREDATION ON THE POPULATION-DYNAMICS OF SMALL LITTORAL-ZONE FISHES IN A NORTHERN WISCONSIN LAKE	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We used a bioenergetics model to assess the effects of predation by juvenile walleyes Stizostedion vitreum vitreum on the populations of darters (Percidae) and minnows (Cyprinidae) in Sparkling Lake, Wisconsin. In 1982, when young-of-the-year yellow perch Perca flavescens were scarce, darters and minnows were important in walleye diets throughout the summer. Walleye predation accounted for approximately 100% of adult darter mortality and 75% of adult minnow mortality. Walleyes appeared to be important in determining abundance of young-of-the-year darters in October, but had little direct effect on abundance of young-of-the-year minnows. In 1983, when young-of-the-year yellow perch were abundant, darters and minnows were only important in walleye diets in June. Walleye predation accounted for 80% of adult darter mortality but only 35% of adult minnow mortality. The decrease in walleye consumption of adult darters and minnows in 1983 compared with 1982 is consistent with the hypothesis that abundant yellow perch year classes buffer littoral-zone fish assemblages from walleye predation. The decrease in walleye predation on darters that occurred with increased abundance of young-of-the-year yellow perch appeared to allow an increase in abundance of young-of-the-year darters. However, for minnows, the decrease in walleye predation did not decrease adult total mortality nor did it lead to an increased young-of-the-year abundance. This implies that walleye predation has a much greater direct impact on the darter population than on the minnow population.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				JAN	1987	116	1					29	39		10.1577/1548-8659(1987)116<29:EOWPOT>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1987)116<29:EOWPOT>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1987M621300004

The sediment record is dominated by long-distance transported pollen that originates from lowland vegetation but the plant macrofossils give evidence of the local vegetation development. Comparison with palaeobotanical results from three sites along an altitudinal transect permits the reconstruction of the regional timber-line history. Throughout the entire Holocene the catchment of Bachalpsee consisted of a mosaic of open meadows and dwarf shrubs (Salix, Vaccinium, Rhododendron). Chironomid and cladoceran assemblages suggest that the early to mid-Holocene was the warmest interval at Bachalpsee. Comparison of the palaeobotanical results with those from the mire "Feld" (2130 m a.s.l.) in the vicinity of Bachalpsee showed that during the mid-Holocene the timber-line was formed by Pinus cembra and Picea abies with some scattered Abies alba trees and was situated close to Bachalpsee but never reached its catchment. The maximum timber-line in the Northern Alps was reached between 6000 and 3000 cal B.P. which is several millennia later than in the Central Alps. The species composition of the tree-line (Abies alba, Pinus cembra and the absence of Larix decidua) points to less continental and moister climatic conditions compared with the central Alps during the early to mid-Holocene. From 3000 cal B.P. onwards the timber-line was lowered by human deforestation with the most intense pulses of human impact occurring since the Middle Ages. The catchment of Bachalpsee has been used as alpine pasture since the Bronze Age.

Here we present the stratigraphic framework of drill core DRO1 with length of 2503.18 m, and the results of magnetostratigraphic and ESR dating and multi proxy analyses of drill core WEDP05 with length of 274.60 m, from the Hetao Basin. The magnetostratigraphic and ESR results indicate that core WEDP05 spans the last similar to 1.68 Ma. Stratigraphic sequence of core DRO1 indicates that the Hetao area was uplifted and eroded during the early Cenozoic, before subsiding to form a sedimentary basin. Subsequently, the basin was a fluvio-lacustrine environment during the Pliocene and then experienced alternating desert and fluvio-lacustrine conditions during the Quaternary. Sedimentary facies and multi environmental-proxy analyses of core WEDP05 indicate that the basin was occupied by a fluvio-lacustrine system during the following intervals; similar to 1.47 - similar to 1.30 Ma, similar to 1.17 - similar to 1.07 Ma, similar to 0.68 - similar to 0.60 Ma and from similar to 0.47 Ma to the last interglacial; and that a desert environment developed during the lake regression phases of similar to 1.30 - similar to 1.17 Ma, similar to 1.07 - similar to 0.68 Ma and similar to 0.60 - similar to 0.47 Ma. The presence of aeolian sand at the base of core WEDP05 suggests that the origin of the Hobq Desert can be traced back to the early Pleistocene, and resulted from the erosion and transportation of exposed fluvio-lacustrine sediments by near-surface winds associated with the Asian winter monsoon. A large river channel in the Hetao Basin may have existed as early as the Pliocene, which was occupied by the Yellow River when its upper reaches formed by at least similar to 1.6 Ma. Subsequently, at least since similar to 1.2 Ma, the Yellow River formed its drainage system around the Hetao Basin and controlled the paleoenvironment evolution of the basin. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Taking the Manwan Reservoir in the Lancang River Basin as a case, we compared soil heavy metals concentrations of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn in the WLFZ and the infralittoral reference zone (IRZ) to study the effects of different land-use types on their accumulations. Meanwhile, principal component analysis (PCA), enrichment factor (EF), and potential ecological risk index (RI) were used for source identification, enrichment assessment, and ecological risk assessment of heavy metals, respectively. Results show that heavy metals including As, Cd, Pb, and Zn are higher in the WLFZ than the IRZ. As in forestland and scrubland as well as Cd under all land-use types become the major concern contaminations in the WLFZ, though no or low enrichment was found in the IRZ. The major pollutants in the IRZ originate from agricultural activities, while the main contaminations in the WLFZ are primarily from industrial and agricultural activities. RIs indicate that the majority of soil samples from the IRZ of the Manwan Reservoir exhibits low ecological risk; however, 54.6% of soil samples in the WLFZ under different land-use types fall in the moderate to high ecological risk. Our results suggest that more efforts should be focused on reducing the discharge of industrial and agricultural inputs to control the heavy metal contamination of the WLFZ in the Manwan Reservoir.

The data reveal a distinctive lake level drop, documented by the change from a carbonate-rich lake marl to a carbonate-free organic mud with increased carbon content and decreasing C/N, Si/Al, Si/K and Fe/Al ratios, indicating a higher pedogenic supply of organic matter and drier conditions at the site. Compared with older, similar transitional phases of lake level changes occurring within the Reinsdorf sequence, it is important that these youngest sediments are undisturbed, indicating continuous development. Ostracod and diatom analyses indicate a lowering water level with higher salinities and rich aquatic vegetation. Mesorheophilic ostracod species along with tychoplanktic diatom taxa point to flowing waters and turbulence at the lakeshore, presumably related to spring-fed streams originating from nearby highlands. Palynological results reveal a very diverse zonal vegetation pattern around the palaeolakeshore considering an area of investigation of approximately 50 x 75 m and a tessellated type of regional vegetation during the formation of the archaeological horizons. On topographically lower elevated areas, birch groves and taxa favouring wet, marshy conditions such as Cyperaceae, indicative of terrestrialization, were predominating, while other stands of this transitional phase reveal a very dry, grass-dominated steppe woodland favouring a rich wildlife with a striking number of megaherbivores. Our results suggest that the lithological differences of the 'Spear Horizon' layers containing the archaeological finds were due to their respective topographical situation and that the layers were deposited almost simultaneously during the beginning of the lake level drop. Human activities seem to have concentrated in sparsely vegetated areas along the palaeolakeshore, rather than in areas of adjacent denser birch swamp forest stands.					; Garcia, Alejandro/I-7829-2012	Krahn, Kim/0000-0002-1646-7612; Garcia-Moreno, Alejandro/0000-0003-4861-7774; Villaluenga, Aritza/0000-0001-9790-1347													0300-9483	1502-3885				JUL	2023	52	3					440	458		10.1111/bor.12619	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bor.12619		JUN 2023											WOS:001002679500001
J	ROBERTS, AP; VEROSUB, KL; NEGRINI, RM				ROBERTS, AP; VEROSUB, KL; NEGRINI, RM			MIDDLE LATE PLEISTOCENE RELATIVE PALEOINTENSITY OF THE GEOMAGNETIC-FIELD FROM LACUSTRINE SEDIMENTS, LAKE CHEWAUCAN, WESTERN UNITED-STATES	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL												Detailed palaeomagnetic and rock magnetic studies of a 15 m succession of Middle/Late Pleistocene lacustrine sediments from ancient Lake Chewaucan, southern Oregon, western United States, indicate that the remanence-bearing grains are sufficiently uniform to be applicable to relative palaeointensity studies. We have used ARM, SIRM and chi for normalization of the NRM. All three parameters give essentially identical results in their relative stratigraphic variations, which indicates that the normalizations efficiently remove the effects of variation in magnetic mineral concentration. Patterns in grain-size variation, as indicated by small-scale quasi-cyclic fluctuations in hysteresis parameters, may be due to environmental changes such as lake-level variation. However, these fluctuations are within the acceptable range of grain sizes for palaeointensity studies and cannot be correlated with any of the features of the normalized remanence record. We therefore conclude that the large-scale variations in the normalized remanence record are due to geomagnetic palaeointensity fluctuations. Parts of the normalized remanence record, where firm chronological constraints exist, may correlate with features of relative palaeointensity records from deep-sea sediments. Our results also confirm the observation that low geomagnetic field intensities dominate during geomagnetic excursions. Further studies of relative palaeointensity of the geomagnetic field may enable the development of an independent time-scale which would make possible the direct correlation of palaeoclimate records from deep-sea and continental environments.					; Roberts, Andrew/E-6422-2010	Roberts, Andrew P./0000-0003-0566-8117; 													0956-540X					JUL	1994	118	1					101	110		10.1111/j.1365-246X.1994.tb04678.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.1994.tb04678.x													WOS:A1994NW13800008

BODY SIZE INCREASE OF LANDLOCKED AYU PLECOGLOSSUS-ALTIVELIS-ALTIVELIS IN LAKE IKEDA THROUGH PAST 30 YEARS	NIPPON SUISAN GAKKAISHI												Observations on the life history of the landlocked ayu Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis were made in Lake Ikeda, Kagoshima Prefecture from 1981 to 1986. The body size of ayu in this lake was similar to that of Lake Biwa, but smaller than that of the amphidromous population in streams. The ayu grew during the early spring and midsummer. The body sizes of mature fish were mainly 80-90 mm in the present research. On the other hand, the mature specimens of ayu collected in 1953 and 1965 measured 56-60 mm and 63-73 mm in standard length, respectively. It is suggested that the size of mature ayu in the lake has been becoming larger over the past 30 years. The larvae of ayu, living offshore of the lake, fed on zooplankton, such as Protozoa, Trochelminthes and Arthropoda, but when they reached about 55 mm in standard length, they moved to shore water and changed their food to algae, such as Cyanophyta and Bacillariophyta which adhered to stones and rocks on the bottom. The amounts of these adherent algae in the lake have been increasing since 1929 according to the progress of eutrophication of the water. Thus, it is suggested that the increase in the size of mature ayu depends mainly on the good condition of food resulting from eutrophication.																			0021-5392					MAR	1992	58	3					461	467																WOS:A1992HX95400008
J	Steidl, RJ; Kozie, KD; Anthony, RG				Steidl, RJ; Kozie, KD; Anthony, RG			Reproductive success of bald eagles in interior Alaska	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												We compared productivity and nesting success of 2 adjacent populations of bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) near the northern limits of their range in interior Alaska during 1989-94. Productivity ((x) over bar x +/- SE young fledged/occupied territory) and nesting success differed between populations; pairs in the Gulkana River basin had higher productivity (0.86 +/- 0.05, n = 274) and nesting success (59%) than those in the Copper River basin (0.71 +/- 0.04, 48%, n = 471; P < 0.02). Productivity varied both annually and spatially within each basin (P < 0.001). However, brood sizes of successful nests were identical for both basins (1.48 +/- 0.03), suggesting that variability in productivity resulted largely from differences in nesting success. Patterns of variability in reproductive success within a territory also were similar for both populations. Pairs that were successful one year hedged more offspring, were more Likely to be successful, were more likely to reoccupy the same territory and were less likely to change nest locations the following year compared to pairs that were unsuccessful the precious year (P < 0.025 for all comparisons). Most nesting failure (92%) occurred during incubation when weather conditions tend to be most severe. However, reproductive success was not negatively correlated with severity of spring weather (temp or rainfall) or strongly correlated with prey abundance during brood rearing. We hypothesize that annual and spatial variability in reproductive success of these northern bald eagle populations may be associated with variation in prey availability, especially before and during incubation.																			0022-541X	1937-2817				OCT	1997	61	4					1313	1321		10.2307/3802131	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3802131													WOS:000071737200036

CHEMOSPHERE												The accumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and responses of antioxidant enzymes were studied in an aquatic moss, Fontinalis antipyretica (Hedw.) transplanted around a city harbor. Glass fiber bags containing Fontinalis antipyretica ('moss bags') were transplanted at five sites on Lake Kallavesi of Finland in summer. Three sites were located south (downstream) and near (0.2-4 km) to the Kuopio city harbor area, and two sites which were located north (upstream) and far (7-10.5 km) from the harbor served as reference sites. PAH accumulation and the responses of the activities of antioxidant enzymes were determined in the transplanted moss following 35 days of exposure to PAHs contained in the lake water. Significantly higher levels of total PAHs in water (mean +/- S.D.; 41.6 +/- 4.7 ng L(-1)) and moss tissue (48.2 +/- 2.2 ng g(-1) dry weight) were observed at the sites close to the harbor compared to the corresponding values (water, total PAHs = 6.7 +/- 1.6 ng L(-1); moss, total PAHs = 5.4 +/- 0.9 ng g(-1) dry weight) obtained from the reference sites. Compared to that observed at reference sites, higher activities of antioxidant enzymes (peroxidase, -2-fold higher; ascorbate peroxidase, -3 fold higher; and superoxide dismutase, similar to 70% higher) that detoxify partially reduced and activated forms of oxygen were observed in moss transplanted near the harbor. This study introduces a novel approach to investigate the cause-effect relationship between bioaccumulation of aquatic pollutants and the biochemical responses in organisms following exposure to such pollutants in a field setting.

J	Van Kirk, RW; Benjamin, L				Van Kirk, RW; Benjamin, L			Status and conservation of salmonids in relation to hydrologic integrity in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												Native salmonid status was evaluated with an index quantifying distribution and abundance of cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus, clarki) and grayling (Thymallus arcticus) in 41 watersheds comprising the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. We assessed hydrologic integrity with a percentile-based index measuring cumulative effects of reservoirs, surface water withdrawals, and consumptive water use. Status of native salmonids was poor in 70% of the watersheds exceptions occurred in a north-south core extending front the Upper Yellowstone southward through the national parks to Bear Lake. Hydrologic integrity was highest in headwater areas and lowest in lower-elevation watersheds. Status of native and nonnative salmonid populations currently existing in the ecosystem was positively correlated with hydrologic integrity (r = 0.58), indicating that the hydrologic index performed well on a watershed scale in quantifying suitability of stream environments for salmonids. However, native trout status and hydrologic integrity were similark correlated (r = 0.63) only when watersheds receiving the lowest possible native salmonid index score were removed front analysis because these watersheds were uniformly distributed across hydrologic integrity. We infer that nonphysical factors such as interactions with introduced fish species have played an important role in the disappearance of native salmonids. The highest priority for conservation is preservation of core watersheds, where both hydrologic integrity and native trout status are high. Restoration opportunities exist in the Teton, Idaho Falls, Willow Creek, Central Bear, and Bear Lake watersheds, where viable cutthroat trout populations remain hot are threatened by habitat degradation.

Although all these lakes and their catchments received fallout from the Chernobyl accident, they differ markedly in hydrological regime, biological production and catchment characteristics, thus providing insight into the factors determining radionuclide transport in a range of lake types. Total daily inflows and outflows of Sr-90 and Cs-137 during the period of high discharge in spring are estimated and compared. Sr-90 is almost entirely present as low molecular weight forms in all three lakes, while Cs-137 is generally present as both high and low molecular weight forms. In theta vre Heimdalsvatn and Saarisjarvi 42-53% of the inflowing Cs-137 is retained, while more Cs-137 flows out Of Hillesjon than flows in, due to remobilization and resuspension. The difference between Hillesjon and the two other lakes also holds for Sr-90, although the retention in the two other lakes is lower (13-31%). The increase in Sr-90 in the outflow of Hillesjon, probably due to remobilization from the sediments, is accounted for by low molecular weight species. The low molecular weight fraction of Sr-90 is also the dominating transport phase in Saarisjarvi and theta vre Heimdalsvatn. There is also a remobilization of low molecular weight Cs-137 in all three lakes. The potential bioavailability of the ultrafiltration fractions is also discussed.																			0166-1116		0-444-82533-9				1997	68						87	95																WOS:000074021900004
J	Güney, BS; Karaer, F				Guney, Bihter Sezer; Karaer, Feza			Estimation of Solöz River Water Balance Components and Rainfall Runoff Pattern with WEAP Model 1	WATER												In this study, in order to draw a road map for lake water budget modeling, model calibration was performed with statistical results by modeling in a stream that feeds the lake basin and has flow observation results. The aim was to make a preliminary estimation and evaluation for calibration of the model result to be obtained in streams without flow observation results in the lake basin. The WEAP ("Water Evaluation and Planning" System) model was used for this purpose. With WEAP, Soloz Stream was selected to determine the amount of flow in streams with no flow. Soloz Stream was selected to determine the amount of flow in streams that do not flow with WEAP. Climate data, flow values obtained from Princeton University climate data, and flow observation results from the data obtained by including the spring flows of DSI (General Directorate of State Hydraulic Works) were modeled comparatively. Studies on the hydrology part of the model are limited in the literature, and this study contributes to the literature with a hydrological evaluation. In this context, the total annual water budget was extracted together with the water budget components, and an estimation was made with the model result for the main flow in the stream from the flow continuity curve. As a result of this study, the findings obtained from the modeling research with WEAP indicate that the model results and the observed results are compatible based on statistical calibration parameters. However, the consistent results observed include the source measurements, so the flow results obtained from precipitation alone are not consistent enough, and it is observed that the model gives reasonable results when climate and source flows are modeled together.

We collected two size classes of Lake Michigan net plankton (63 to 243 mu m, 243+ mu m) plus macroinvertebrates during a cruise off Grand Haven, Michigan in the fall of 1995. Mean concentrations (+/- 2 SE) of total PCBs were 117.77 (27.03), 1106.88 (553.69), and 353.67 (66.99) ng/g dry weight for copepods and cladacerans, Diporeia spp., and Mysis relicta, respectively. Diporeia is significantly more contaminated than Mysis when PCB concentrations are expressed on a dry weight (0.02 < p < 0.05) and lipid (0.02 < p < 0.05) normalized basis, but not on afresh weight basis (0.2 < p < 0.5). Mysis and Diporeia are significantly more contaminated than copepods and cladacerans regardless of the normalization metric. The relative degree of contamination is similar to the early 1980s. The largest component of the total PCBs shifts from tetra- and pentachlorobiphenyls for the 243+ mu m and 63 to 243 mu m fractions, respectively, to hexachlorobiphenyls for Mysis and Diporeia. Even though total PCBs have been declining in Great Lakes biota during the last two decades, the enrichment with trophic level of hexachlorobiphenyls, which are associated with elevated biological acitivity, may lead to a greater impact of PCBs in top predators than would be expected by considering only the decreasing pattern of total PCBs.					; Stow, Craig/AAG-8109-2020; Carpenter, Stephen/AAQ-6404-2020	Stow, Craig/0000-0001-6171-7855; 													0380-1330						1998	24	4					808	821		10.1016/S0380-1330(98)70863-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(98)70863-9													WOS:000078691900004

This study presents a detailed analysis of the different depositional stages of the area currently occupied by Lake Yamanaka (floodplain wetland, river and lake). From ca. 5500 cal yr BP to ca. 5050 cal yr BP, the Yamanaka basin was occupied by floodplain wetlands. During that period, the landscape was very stable and erosion on northeastern flank of Mt. Fuji was relatively limited. From ca. 5050 cal yr BP to ca. 3050 cal yr BP, the water level increased and the floodplain wetlands became a lake. From ca. 3050 cal yr BP to ca. 2050 cal yr BP, the water level progressively decreased, leading to a reduction in lake extent. During this lowering of the lake's water level, a 1 km(2) mass-transport deposit modified the physiography of the lake floor. From ca. 2050 cal yr BP to ca. 1050 cal yr BP, the lake disappeared and a river flowing towards the northwest occupied the depression. Ponds occupied morphological lows formed by mass transport deposits. From ca. 1050 cal yr BP to the present day, the lake water level rose again, connecting the ponds with the main lake. Since then, the lake water level has continued to rise to the current level. Lake water level fluctuations are the results of several factors that could be interconnected: (i) changes in precipitation rates; (ii) margin destabilization (the Yamanaka mass-transport deposit), (iii) changes in river inlets and therefore variation in water supplies, (iv) volcanic eruptions (scoria fall-out and lava flows) and (v) changes in vegetation cover. This study highlights the importance of coupling sediment cores and high-resolution seismic reflection profiling to identify lateral variation and modification of sedimentary inputs through time.

Samples were taken from 9 sites in Lake Huron, 2 in the North Channel, 5 in Georgian Bay and 17 in Lake Superior. In the water samples all compounds analyzed were below quantification limits and traces of lindane were found in each sample. In seston samples, PCB''s were above quantification limits at nearly every station and some traces of dieldrin and DDE were measured. Sediments contained PCB compounds at all stations. Dieldrin was occasionally observed, and DDT and/or its derivatives DDE and DDD were found in 1/3 of all samples. No clear correlation was found between quantities of these compounds in sediments and the percentage of clay or organic matter in the samples. Nor were any definite geographic trends present in terms of distributions observed, although concentrations were higher in areas of higher sedimentary deposition such as deeper basins. No organophosphorus compounds were detected in any sample. The highest level of DDT residues detected, 20 ppb, was lower than levels found in other studies in the lower Great Lakes and some tributary river sediments of Georgian Bay. Generally DDT residues were higher in Lake Huron and Georgian Bay sediments than in Lake Superior although PCB''s were higher in some Lake Superior sediments.																			0031-6156						1976	10	2					61	67											826875					WOS:A1976CG73300005

Shadegan is one of the most important wetland that posses various fauna and flora but suffers inputs from agricultural and industrial activities. So, sediment samples and fish species including Barbus grypus, Barbus sharpeyi, and Cyprinus carpio were collected during winter 2009. Results showed that mean concentrations of trace elements (except Ni and Co) were high in liver and gills of B. grypus. Also trace elements had the most accumulation in liver of B. sharpeyi except for Cd (0.26 mg kg (-aEuro parts per thousand 1) d.w.) and Mn (13.45 mg kg (-aEuro parts per thousand 1) d.w.) that were high in gills. Beside, kidney is determined as target tissue for Ni and V in B. grypus and for Pb in C. carpio, due to their high concentration. Zn levels in all tissues of C. carpio showed the highest concentrations in comparison to other fish species. Generally, accumulations of most of the studied elements in B. grypus and B. sharpeyi were higher in females than in males, while in fillet and gonads of C. carpio, this trend was inverted. Bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) were determined for different tissues of fish species with respect to elemental concentrations in sediment. BAFs results indicated that Zn, Pb, and Cu have higher BAF than other elements. Also this investigation demonstrated that trace elements have different affinities with condition factor of studied fish species. Gonadosomatic index (GSI) and Pb showed positive correlation together in both B. sharpeyi and B. grypus, respectively, in females and males. Moreover, females of C. carpio showed significantly positive relation of GSI and all studied elements.					; Sekhavatjou, Mohammad/ABB-1415-2021; Karbassi, Abdolreza/H-6332-2016; Karbassi, AR/ACE-6492-2022	Sekhavatjou, Mohammad Sadegh/0000-0001-7939-3318; Karbassi, Abdolreza/0000-0002-9408-908X; monavari, masood/0000-0001-9142-9790; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				APR	2012	184	4					1865	1878		10.1007/s10661-011-2085-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-011-2085-8								21553249					WOS:000300848100007
J	Neumann, K; Lyons, WB; Priscu, JC; Donahoe, RJ				Neumann, K; Lyons, WB; Priscu, JC; Donahoe, RJ			CO2 concentrations in perennially ice-covered lakes of Taylor Valley, Antarctica	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Lakes in Taylor Valley, southern Victoria Land, Antarctica, are unusual in that they are perennially covered by a 3-5 m thick ice layer. Previous work on gas concentrations in these lakes has shown that the surface waters are supersaturated with respect to O-2, N2O, as well as the noble gases. Our data show that the dissolved CO2 (CO2(aq)) concentrations, calculated from pH and Sigma CO2, can be highly undersaturated at shallow depths of the lakes. CO2 partial pressure values (pCO(2)) are as low as 10(-4.3) atm and 10(-4.2) atm in the east and west lobes of Lake Bonney, respectively, and 10(-3.8) atm in Lake Hoare. CO2(aq) depletion occurred only in the uppermost part of the water column, in association with elevated primary productivity (PPR). The upward diffusion of CO2(aq) from the aphotic zone, and the annual input of CO2 via glacial meltwater can not replenish the amount of CO2(aq) annually lost to primary productivity in the uppermost meters of the water column. Calcification is a limited source of CO2(aq), since the lakes are undersaturated with respect to calcite through portions of the austral summer. Preliminary respiration rates have been used to obtain an annual inorganic carbon balance. Further down in the water column, at the sites of the deep-water maximum in primary production (PPRmax), which in Lakes Bonney and Fryxell is associated with nutrient gradients, CO2(aq) is not undersaturated. A large upward flux from CO2-supersaturated aphotic waters provides a surplus of CO2(aq) at the PPRmax. Lake Fryxell, unlike the other lakes, is supersaturated with CO2(aq) throughout the entire water column.																			0168-2563	1573-515X				OCT	2001	56	1					27	50		10.1023/A:1011992719694	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1011992719694													WOS:000171289900002

Use of environmental DNA to detect Eastern Sand Darter (Ammocrypta pellucida Putnam, 1863) in large Laurentian Great Lakes embayments	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												A single-species environmental DNA (eDNA) method was developed to sample for a small, benthic rare species, Eastern Sand Darter (Ammocrypta pellucida Putnam, 1863) in two large Lake Ontario embayments. Summer water sampling allowed for: (a) surveys of habitats (Wellers Bay) where traditional fish sampling gear could not be used; and, (b) a comparison between eDNA and seining-based detection probabilities at known occupied habitats (West Lake). In 2018, replicate (n = 3) 1 L water samples were collected from 90 Wellers Bay sites and 71 West Lake sites. A site-occupancy model, a hierarchical logistic regression model, was fitted to determine site occupancy, sample occupancy (presence of Eastern Sand Darter DNA in a water sample) and probability of detection (p) based on replicate quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) results for each water sample. Eastern Sand Darter was detected at 10 West Lake sites, but not from Wellers Bay. Mean site occupancy was 0.31 (0.12-0.70; 95% CLs), mean sample occupancy was 0.28 (0.09-0.58; 95% CLs), and mean detection probability in a subsample (i.e., successful qPCR amplification) given it was present was 0.40 (0.25-0.55; 95% CLs). While the eDNA method successfully detected Eastern Sand Darter from known occupied areas in West Lake, it was not more effective for assessing local site occupancy than traditional sampling methods, such as the seine.

J	Pongruktham, O; Ochs, C; Hoover, JJ				Pongruktham, Orathai; Ochs, Clifford; Hoover, Jan Jeffrey			Observations of Silver Carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) Planktivory in a Floodplain Lake of the Lower Mississippi River Basin	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												The invasive silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) has become pervasive in much of the Mississippi River, its tributaries, and in connected lakes and wetlands. As an increasingly abundant planktivore, it competes directly for food with native fishes. Its greatest impact may be in connected backwater lakes and wetlands, which due to their high primary production serve as critical sites for feeding and growth of many fishes. To assess the impact that silver carp may have on one such system, we examined the composition of plankton samples and of alimentary tract (gut) contents of carp collected from an oxbow lake in Mississippi, Forest Home Chute. Through an occasional connection to the Mississippi River, Forest Home Chute was invaded by silver carp in winter 2005, after which the river and lake became disconnected for about two years. In the water-column, the most common types of phytoplankton were euglenoid algae, cyanobacteria, and diatoms. The vast majority of zooplankton was rotifers with densities sometimes exceeding 7,000 organisms per liter. Very high concentrations of phytoplankton in the carp gut, relative to in the water-column, indicate substantial consumption of phytoplankton production. In October 2006, euglenoid phytoplankters were a much greater, and cyanobacteria a much lesser, proportion of prey in the fish gut compared to their proportions in the water-column. In December, however, there was no evidence of selective consumption by the silver carp population. Some of the phytoplankters observed in the lowest portion of the gut, including pinnate diatoms and euglenoid algae, were motile, indicating they had survived transit through the 5 to 7-m long gut tract. There was no evidence of rotifer survival of gut passage. By its high consumption of plankton, possible selective planktivory, and differential digestion of consumed phytoplankton and zooplankton, the silver carp may be altering the food web structure of these important connected lakes.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				MAR	2010	25	1					85	93		10.1080/02705060.2010.9664361	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2010.9664361													WOS:000275293500011
J	Li, WJ; Guo, Y; Sun, SC				Li, Wen-Jie; Guo, Yan; Sun, Shi-Chun			Population genetics of Artemia urmiana species complex (Crustacea, Anostraca): A group with asymmetrical dispersal and gene flow mediated by migratory waterfowl	GENE												Bird-mediated dispersal of resting eggs is the main mechanism for Artemia dispersal among catchments. The bisexual populations of Artemia urmiana species complex, which is here considered to be a collection of Artemia genetically close to the so-called "Western Asian Lineage", are mostly distributed in central and western Asia (i. e., in regions falling into the Central Asian Flyway of migratory birds) and live in diversified habitats. Little is known about the genetic relationships among these populations. Aiming to understand the population genetic characteristics and the roles of migratory birds on the dispersal and gene flow of this Artemia group, we evaluated the genetic diversity, genetic differentiation, and gene flow among 14 populations, with their altitudes ranging from 540 to 4870 m above sea level, using 13 microsatellite markers. Almost all populations exhibited high genetic diversity and heterozygote excess, which may be a consequence of combined effects of dispersal and hybridization. The global genetic differentiation (FST) value was 0.092, the pairwise FST values were 0.003-0.246. Discriminant analysis of principal components identified three genetic clusters, consisting of Urmia Lake (Iran), Zhundong (Xinjiang, China), and 12 Qinghai-Tibet Plateau populations, respectively. The among-population genetic differentiation seems to be a consequence of isolation by distance and adaptation to diver-sified habitats induced by altitudinal gradient. Historical gene flows are asymmetrical, and show an evolutionary source-sink dynamics, with Jingyu Lake (Xinjiang, China) population being the major source. These results support our hypothesis that in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and surrounding areas the bird-mediated dispersal of Artemia may be biased towards from north to south and/or from higher altitude to lower altitude.					; Li, Wenjie/F-9954-2010	Li, Wenjie/0000-0002-9841-3836; 													0378-1119	1879-0038				FEB 5	2024	894								147957	10.1016/j.gene.2023.147957	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2023.147957		NOV 2023						37923096					WOS:001114640500001

The small size fraction (<10 <mu>m) in Lake Lucerne, Mondsee and Traunsee and in an additional incubator experiment contributed 55-67% to the total integral of chlorophyll-a and photosynthesis per m(2). The photosynthetic depression induced by UV-A in Lake Lucerne, measured during the 7(th) GAP-workshop, markedly increased to 65% with PAR up to 500 pmol m(-2) s(-1). At super-saturating light intensities near the surface, UV-A inhibition further increased marginally to 69%. Effects of light acclimation and pigment adaptation on photosynthetic rates and efficiencies of phytoplankton indicated size related strategies that were more important than the taxonomic composition of the assemblage measured in Traunsee and Mondsee. Algal communities and small size fractions (<10 <mu>m), that had a high maximum light utilisation coefficient (alpha*) were adapted to low light by high ratios of chlorophyll-alpha to photo-protective beta -carotene. Algae at high solar radiation and of large size (>10 mum) were photosynthetically less efficient but high light adapted having low ratios of chlorophyll-alpha to beta -carotene. In contrast to low light adapted small cells the high light adapted large-cells increased their relative proportion of photo-protective carotenoids above saturating light levels. At light limitation in deeper water layers lipophilic accessory photo-synthetic versus photo-protective pigments increased for all fractions.

The average content of total phosphorus (TP) in May-October increased from 73 mu g P l(-1) in 1980 to 163 mu g P l(-1) in 2000. A significant increase in average chlorophyll a content from 16.6 mu g l(-1) in 1980 to 84.7 mu g l(-1) in 2000 and a shift in phytoplankton composition to the dominance of cyanobacteria over diatoms indicated a change in the trophic status of the reservoir from meso-eutrophic to hypertrophic. In 2016 and 2018, average TP was 96 and 101 mu g P l(-1), respectively. The average content of chlorophyll a was 43.6 mu g l(-1) in 2016 and 66.6 mu g l(-1) in warmer 2018, indicating persistent eutrophic conditions. Diatoms dominated both in 2016 and 2018, especially in 2016 characterized by unfavorable weather conditions. Cyanobacteria were more abundant in 2018 with higher summer temperatures. The decline of the total area covered by aquatic vegetation from 157 ha in 1980 to 76 ha in 2016 likely resulted from an increase in phytoplankton biomass and water turbidity. Based on the results of our observations, in addition to further reduction in nutrient loading, biomanipulation by introducing predatory fish as a restoration measure was proposed to improve the ecological status of the reservoir.					; Rusanov, Alexander/K-7298-2019; Ignatyeva, Natalia/M-9956-2014	Rusanov, Alexander/0000-0003-1597-0731; 													1730-413X	1897-3191				JUN	2020	49	2					168	183		10.1515/ohs-2020-0016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/ohs-2020-0016													WOS:000541120400007

Survival, Harvest, and Lincoln Estimates of Wood Ducks Banded in Ohio	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Wildlife agencies have carefully managed wood duck Aix sponsa populations in part through harvest regulations since the early 1900s. However, unlike many other waterfowl species in North America, waterfowl managers largely do not know breeding population size. Lincoln-Petersen methods based on harvest and band recovery data are an attractive alternative to air or ground count-based surveys for estimating populations of wood ducks by state and federal agencies that are tasked with sustainably managing harvest opportunities for this species. We used banding and recovery data to estimate annual survival rates, harvest rates, and population size in late summer (August-September) using Lincoln-Petersen methods for wood ducks banded within Ohio from 1990 to 2017. Sex, age, and daily bag limits best explained survival rates of wood ducks banded in Ohio, with lower survival rates in years with more liberal bag limits. Lincoln-Petersen estimates of population size ranged from 116,992 to 632,462 annually, and we detected a significant declining trend in population size through time. Mean harvest rates of wood ducks banded in Ohio ranged from 0.069 (adult females) to 0.121 (hatch-year males), and we detected a significant increasing trend in harvest rate through time for adult male, hatch-year male, and hatch-year female wood duck cohorts. Aerial surveys in other Great Lakes states provide comparable population estimates with our Lincoln-Petersen estimates for Ohio and also show a declining trend in population size. We recommend continued investigation into the use of Lincoln-Petersen techniques for estimating wood duck population size throughout the Great Lakes region. If declining population trends are not unique to Ohio, waterfowl managers may need to further assess the potential impact of increased harvest rates on population size to ensure sustainable harvest into the future.

J	Lee, YI; Lim, HS; Yoon, HI; Tatur, A				Lee, Yong Il; Lim, Hyoun Soo; Yoon, Ho Il; Tatur, Andrzej			Characteristics of tephra in Holocene lake sediments on King George Island, West Antarctica: implications for deglaciation and paleoenvironment	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Several reworked tephra layers in gravity-flow deposits are present in lacustrine core sediments collected from Hotel and Rudy Lakes on King George Island, South Shetland Islands, maritime sub-Antarctica. This study tests the values of tephra for establishing regional tephrochronologies for lakes in ice-covered landscapes in the vicinity of volcanoes. The tephra record is more abundant in a long Hotel Lake core (515 cm long). This study uses volcanic glass samples from five tephra layers of Hotel Lake and from one tephra layer of Rudy Lake. Morphologically, tephras are mixtures of basaltic and pumice shards, both having various degrees of vesicularity. Major element analyses of glass shards reveal that the majority of the glass fragments belong to basic glass (< 60 wt% SiO2), compositionally ranging from basalt to low-silica andesite and subalkaline series medium-K tholeiites, probably sourced from Deception Island located 130 kin southwest of King George Island. Less than 20% of tephra belongs to silicic glass and occurs in three tephra horizons E of Hotel Lake. However, source volcano(es) for about 10% of basic tephra and silicic tephra are not readily identified from nearby volcanic centers. Except for the studied tephra in Rudy Lake, all tephra samples in Hotel Lake are not ashfall deposits but reworked and redeposited pyroclasts derived from retreating ice sheet, resulting in the occurrence of geochemically equivalent tephra samples in different tephra horizons. The dating of the studied tephra horizons represents the timing of deglaciation rather than that of volcanic eruptions. The result of this study implies that combined with sedimentological information more chemical criterion is necessary to study tephrochronology and regional correlation and to understand paleoenvironmental changes using tephra.

Effects of geothermal effluents on macrobenthic communities in a pristine sub-arctic lake	INLAND WATERS												We studied the effects of warm effluents from the Nesjavellir geothermal power plant on benthic invertebrate communities along a depth gradient of 4 m in lake pingvallavatn, Iceland. Four study sites were selected: 2 heat-affected sites and 2 cold reference sites. Thermal pollution was detected down to 0.4 m at both heat-affected sites, which were 7-12 degrees C higher than at the same depth at the reference sites. Sustained temperatures >= 27 degrees C, which is 10-17 degrees C above ambient water temperatures, seems to be detrimental to the gastropod Radix peregra and several of the littoral chironomid species. Such effects were, however, confined to a small area inside a sheltered rift pool at one of the heat-affected sites. Moderate warming up to similar to 10 degrees C above ambient lake temperature in summer, seems to benefit R. peregra, potentially through both a higher survival rate and a shorter life cycle. At the heat-affected sites, sustained high temperatures transformed a relatively diverse chironomid community to a species-poor community, dominated by Paratanytarsus sp. and Cricotopus sylvestris. In contrast, the chironomid Eukiefferiella minor was much more prominent at one of the reference sites. To separate thermal from biological effects, more studies are needed on species-specific attributes, including time-series data on growth, survival, and reproduction of the main littoral zoobenthic species. Although our research examined short-term responses of aquatic invertebrates to local thermal stress, our results may also be relevant to long-term responses of freshwater ecosystems at high latitudes to climate change and warming.																			2044-2041	2044-205X					2011	1	3					146	157		10.5268/IW-1.3.363	http://dx.doi.org/10.5268/IW-1.3.363													WOS:000307721300001

A tale of two lakes: the Newberry Volcano twin crater lakes, Oregon, USA	GEOCHEMISTRY AND GEOPHYSICS OF ACTIVE VOLCANIC LAKES	Geological Society Special Publication											Newberry Volcano in Oregon, USA, has two small crater lakes inside its caldera: East Lake and Paulina Lake. The 50-80 m deep lakes differ in morphology, water chemistry and sediment composition, although separated only by a narrow volcanic ridge. East Lake is a terminal lake with gaseous geothermal inputs, whereas Paulina Lake has an outlet (Paulina Creek) and subaqueous, high-alkalinity hot springs. The sediment in both lakes is organic-rich and mainly consists of diatom frustules (SiO2) with some volcanic ash, accumulating at sedimentation rates of 1.5-2 mm a(-1) (Pb-210 dated). In Paulina Lake the sediment has up to 14% Fe2O3 of hydrothermal origin and 250 ppm As. Sediment in East Lake is Fe-poor but has up to 4 ppm Hg, and fish are also Hg-rich. Both lakes host productive ecosystems, with primary producers using geothermal CO2, P and Si, and nitrogen fixed by cyanobacteria (Nostoc sp.). Water budgets and water residence times were calculated from stable isotope budgets. East Lake has a steep vertical delta C-13 (dissolved inorganic carbon, DIC) gradient, with surface delta C-13 values of up to 5.5%, largely due to diffusional CO2 losses and photosynthetic carbon withdrawal. Paulina Lake is better mixed, has a lower organic productivity and limited surface CO2 evasion; its delta C-13 (DIC) gradient is small. We theorize that the lakes are fed by different geothermal components as a result of phase separation below East Lake. The gas component (CO2, H2S, Hg) enters East Lake, as indicated by the rising bubble trains in the lake. A residual fluid, depleted in Hg but rich in Si, Fe, carbonate, P and As, enters Paulina Lake. The presence of highly toxic components and the gas-charging of East Lake present natural hazards, which may change when new volcanic activity is initiated, and thus should be monitored.

In summer 1992 32-56 % of bacterial production but only ca. 17 % of biomass was found in the euphotic zone (0-5 m), which consists of 20 % of the: total lake volume. In the deep central area of the lake, the production of bacteria varied between 63 and 121 mg C m(-2) d(-1) and that of phytoplankton 57-158 mg C m(-2) d(-1). High bacterial production to primary production ratio (>0.5) indicates that the phytoplankton production alone was insufficient to sustain the total bacterial production, and that bacterioplankton utilised other carbon sources, such as allochthonous organic compounds. Factors controlling growth of bacteria in the aphotic zone (allochthonous and autochthonous dissolved organic matter (DOM), PO4-P, temperature and grazing) were studied in a laboratory experiment. The most pronounced increase in bacterial growth was achieved when allochthonous humic water originating from the catchment was added or when it was added together with PO4-P. Furthermore, PO4-P addition together with autochthonous organic carbon, resulted in higher bacterial growth rates than the addition of autochthonous DOC alone. The results suggest that despite the high concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC >10 mg C/L) in the lake, the quality of DOM and availability of PO4-P are the principal factors controlling the growth of bacterioplankton.

However, no comprehensive diet evaluation has been completed in southern reservoirs. Our objectives were to assess variability in saugeye diet compositions, explore factors influencing crappie presence in saugeye diets, and investigate trends in prey size to inform management strategies regarding predatory control of crappie populations.MethodsWe collected 2638 saugeye diets from six Oklahoma reservoirs. We used permutational multivariate analysis of variance to test differences in diet compositions among saugeye lengths, study reservoirs, and seasons, and we used logistic regression models to correlate the presence of crappie in diets with saugeye size, season, crappie abundance, productivity, and turbidity. Finally, we used bivariate plots of diet indices and quantile regression to explore trends in prey importance and prey size relative to saugeye size.ResultSaugeye diet compositions were best explained by saugeye size, followed by study reservoir and season. Saugeye exhibited an ontogenetic shift from Inland Silverside Menidia beryllina to shad Dorosoma spp., and crappie were eaten infrequently in comparison. The presence of crappie prey in diets was most correlated with saugeye size (primarily large saugeye), followed by higher crappie abundance, lower reservoir productivity, and season (highest in fall). Saugeye consumed larger prey than most piscivores relative to predator size.ConclusionOur results indicated that dominant prey of saugeye transitioned from smaller-bodied fishes to larger shad as they grew when both prey types were available, which may have implications for growth and recruitment. Ultimately, the low and variable use of crappie prey may lead to inconsistent predatory effects on crappie populations, and large saugeye may exert greater top-down pressure on crappie in lakes with lower productivity or higher crappie abundance. Impact statement Dominant prey type of saugeye in Oklahoma reservoirs transitioned from Inland Silverside to Gizzard Shad as they grew, and crappie were eaten infrequently in comparison. Large saugeye may exert greater top-down pressure on crappie populations in lakes with lower productivity or higher crappie abundance.

Out of 15 samples from five streams, 12 were positive for Cyyptosporidium (80%) with an average concentration of 0.04-1.9 oocysts/l and 8 were positive for Giardia (53.3%) with 0.05-0.78 cysts/l. Two springs were also tested and found positive for Cryptosporidium and (0.54 oocysts/l) only. The main drinking water reservoir of Israel, Lake Kineret, was also sampled 6 times at two sites. Cryptosporidium was isolated in 4/6 samples (66.6%) at an average concentration of 0.3-1.09 oocysts/l while Giardia was present in 5/6 samples (83.3%), 0.135-16.2 cysts/l. Drinking water entering a filtration pilot plant was also tested and found positive for Cryptosporidium in 23/35 samples (0-317 oocysts/l) and 8/35 for Giardia (0-16.7 cysts/l). In order to I:valuate some potential inputs of contamination of the drinking water sources, two possible contributors were tested: domestic sewage and cowshed effluents. In sewage effluents, 3/3 samples were positive fur both Cryptosporidium and Giardia. The oocysts and cysts were present at 8.3-8.05/l and 5-27.3/l respectively. In cowshed effluents, 1/6 samples was positive for Cryptosporidium at a high concentration (3,630 oocysts/l) but no Giardia cysts were found. The levels of Cryptosporidium and Giardia oocysts and cysts isolated from these environmental samples may present a public health hazard although no major outbreaks have so far been reported in Israel.

J	NANSON, GC; EAST, TJ; ROBERTS, RG				NANSON, GC; EAST, TJ; ROBERTS, RG			QUATERNARY STRATIGRAPHY, GEOCHRONOLOGY AND EVOLUTION OF THE MAGELA CREEK CATCHMENT IN THE MONSOON TROPICS OF NORTHERN AUSTRALIA	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Magela Creek, a major tributary of the East Alligator River in northern Australia, has left a detailed sedimentary record of a fluvial landscape dominated by climatic and eustatic changes associated with Quaternary glacial-interglacial cycles. Uranium-series dates from young pisoliths in floodplain deposits indicate that ferruginisation is probably ongoing under present conditions while ferricretes in degraded terraces that flank the lower valley reveal a fluvial history extending back to early Pleistocene or Tertiary time. Inset within this older alluvium is a valley fill which, from thermoluminescence dates, was initiated about 300 kyr ago. With each glacial climate change and associated fall in sea level, distinct palaeochannels have been eroded into these floodplains, infilling later with alluvium when climate and base-level conditions were conducive to fluvial deposition. Radiocarbon dates show that the most recent palaeochannel beneath the modern Magela Creek last started to fill by downstream progradation and vertical accretion of bedload sand about 8 kyr. The palaeochannel filled at an accelerating rate, probably as a result of declining stream competence associated with drier conditions in the late Holocene augmented by the backwater effects of sea-level rise. Continued aggradation blocked the mouths of tributary valleys along Magela Creek, forming alluvial-dammed tributary lakes and deferred-junction tributary streams. From about 300 kyr, cyclic episodes of channel incision and sediment evacuation in this tropical-monsoon river valley have become less effective, possibly because increasing aridity in the late Quatemary has reduced the erosional effectiveness of Australia's northern rivets.

Spatial and temporal shifts in fluvial sedimentary organic matter composition from a High Arctic watershed impacted by localized slope disturbances	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Arctic warming may induce slope failure in upland permafrost soils. These landslide-like events, referred to as active layer detachments (ALDs), redistribute soil material into hydrological networks during spring melt and heavy rainfall. In 2011, 2013 and 2014, fluvial sediments from the West River at the Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory were sampled where ALDs occurred in 2007-2008. Two ALD-impacted subcatchments were examined exhibiting either continuing disturbance or short-term stabilization. Solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and targeted biomarker analysis via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were used to investigate shifts in organic matter (OM) composition. Additionally, radiocarbon ages were determined using accelerator mass spectrometry. Biomarker concentrations and O-alkyl carbon assessed via NMR were both lower in sediments nearest the active disturbance and increased in sediments downstream where other aquatic inputs became more dominant. This suggests immobilization of recalcitrant OM near the ALD and the sustained transport of labile ALD-derived OM further downstream. Shifts toward older radiocarbon dates along the river between 2011 and 2014 suggest the continued transport of permafrost-derived OM downstream. The stabilizing subcatchment revealed high O-alkyl carbon via NMR and increased concentrations of unaltered terrestrial-derived biomarkers indicative of enhanced OM accumulation following ALD activity. The relatively young radiocarbon ages from these sediments suggest accumulation from contemporary sources and potential burial of the previously dispersed ALD inputs. Within the broader context of Arctic climate change, these results portray a complex environmental trajectory for thaw-released permafrost-derived OM and highlight uncertainty in the relationship between lability and persistence upon release by permafrost disturbance.

The region provides ample opportunity to understand the dynamic relationship of the Indian and Eurasian plates, role in governing the global climate and controlling the earth surface temperature by carbon sequestration through weathering of rocks. The differential uplift along several thrust planes and associated climatic conditions are primarily governing the geomorphic evolution of the Ladakh, and amongst several agents of material movement, glaciers are the most effective agent. Overall ten glacial stages (similar to 430-0.4 ka) are recognized from Ladakh. Additionally, the major sources of moisture to the Ladakh region are the Indian Summer monsoon (ISM) and the Central Asian westerlies contributing in subequal amounts. Several morphometric parameters suggest that tectonics is governing the topography. It was most pronounced at 27 ka, 23 ka, 17-19 ka, 11-10 ka and 6 ka along the Karakorum Fault and Indus Suture Zone. The climate studies suggest that during around 35-25 ka, the climate was cold and humid followed by the relatively dry at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). A rise in lakes during similar to 17-5 ka was observed. However, major fluctuations in limiting the lake levels during the Older Dryas, Younger Dryas and 8.2 ka were also noticeable. The variation in different chronological technique, however, poses a serious challenge in determining the geomorphic evolution of the landscape in the region.																					978-3-030-29684-1; 978-3-030-29683-4				2020							159	183		10.1007/978-3-030-29684-1_10	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-29684-1_10	10.1007/978-3-030-29684-1												WOS:000566845700011
J	Maharjan, KK				Maharjan, Kishor Kumar			Microplastics research in Nepal: Present scenario and current gaps in knowledge	HELIYON												The topic of microplastics has drawn considerable scholarly interest in recent times. The objective of this study is to provide an overview of the current state of microplastic pollution research in Nepal and to make future research recommendations. To achieve the objective, three popular databases (Web of Science, SCOPUS and Google Scholar) were used. The results showed that the current scenario for microplastic research in Nepal is in its early stage, which commenced in 2020. A total of six papers were recorded over the period from 2020 to 2023. The research conducted in the fields were rivers, lakes, snow, and sediments. Studies have provided evidence of the occurrence of microplastics in diverse aquatic ecosystems. Lakeshore sediments show concentrations of 100.5 +/- 58.6 items/kg dry weight, while shoreline sediments of Phewa lake exhibit variability between 55 and 122.5 items/kg. The lake water in winter records 2.96 +/- 1.83 Microplastics per Liter (MPs/L), river water indicates 202 +/- 100 items/m3, and snow demonstrates 30 MP/L. In freshwater ecosystems, microplastics, specifically fibers, were found to be the prevailing type, while fragments were recorded in road dust. The study conducted in Nepal provided evidence of the presence of a wide range of polymers. The polymers encompassed polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyamide, polystyrene (PS), and polyester. Microplastic research in Nepal, initiated in 2020, covered rivers, lakes, snow, and sediments. Diverse aquatic ecosystems reveal microplastic presence, emphasizing the need for continued study and awareness. Although extensive research has been carried out on the subject of microplastic contamination and its effects on various creatures on a global scale, an examination of the implications of microplastics on animals, plants, and humans in Nepal has not been found in any scholarly publications. There exists a noticeable deficit of research investigating the consumption of microplastics by human.

Recent subfossil wood collections from the Great Lakes region provide an opportunity to measure C-14 activity in decadal series of rings in North America prior to the White Mountains bristlecone record. We developed decadal C-14 series from wood at the classic Two Creeks site (similar to 11,850 BP) in east-central Wisconsin, the Liverpool East site (similar to 10,250 BP) in northwestern Indiana, and the Gribben Basin site (similar to 10,000 BP) in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Initial AMS dates on holocellulose produced younger-than-expected ages for most Two Creeks subsamples and for a few samples from the other sites, prompting a systematic comparison of chemical pretreatment using 2 samples from each site, and employing holocellulose, AAA-treated holocellulose, alpha-cellulose, and AAA-treated whole wood. The testing could not definitively reveal the source of error in the original analyses, but the "best" original ages together with new AAA-treated holocellulose and alpha-cellulose ages were visually fitted to the IntCal04 calibration curve at ages of 13,760-13,530 cal BP for the Two Creeks wood, 12,100-12,020 cal BP for Liverpool East, and 11,300-11,170 cal BP for Gribben Basin. The Liverpool East age falls squarely within the Younger Dryas (YD) period, whereas the Gribben Basin age appears to postdate the YD by similar to 300 yr, although high scatter in the decadal Gribben Basin results could accommodate an older age nearer the end of the YD.

The SBR pipes have boards installed to impound water during the winter. Pipes [46-56 cm diameter (18-22")] are instrumented to facilitate automated collection of field runoff on a flow proportional basis. Instrumentation is relatively simple and compact, and involves an area-velocity flow logger and a small automated composite runoff sampler. The configuration is significantly less costly and less labor intensive than the traditional instrumentation involving a flume, larger instrument shelter (typically 1.2 m x 1.8 m or larger), flow-measuring device (typically a stage recorder), and full-size sampler. Runoff is being analyzed for pesticides, nutrients, and sediment concentrations. Discharge from pipes with and without upslope stiff grass hedges [switch grass (Panicum virgatum, Alamo variety)] are being compared from fields planted with no-tillage to Roundup-Ready(R) Bt cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). As this research is only recently underway, the purpose of the paper is to describe in detail the instrumentation, site setup, and treatments, as well as to present some early findings. The results of this research are expected to help the development of new tools, which may offer alternatives for runoff remediation and improve TMDL development accuracy.																					1-892769-24-7				2002							454	465																WOS:000182805800080

These target lake TP concentrations are then commonly employed to determine target external loading through reverse use of Vollenweider-OECD-type steady-state empirical models. Such models are also adopted in their direct form to estimate lake TP concentrations following hypothetical external load reductions. However, such approaches suffer from extreme parameterisation and often give inaccurate results. Process-based coupled ecological-hydrodynamic models offer a much wider flexibility and produce an extensive set of information, solving many of the issues of Vollenweider-OECD-type models. However, their application has been up to now restricted to single lakes due to calibration effort and data availability burdens. To overcome these obstacles, in this study we developed a simplified application of the process-based coupled model QWET over 9 lakes in Northern Italy, making use of the ParSAC automatic calibration tool and feeding the models only with general data available from public monitoring. QWET models were calibrated over past observations, simulating nutrient reduction scenarios for the near-future decades. The advantages over traditionally employed models for lake water protection planning at the regional scale were hence identified through a practical application, determining the strengths and limits of the herein-adopted simplified process-based approach over lakes with different features. Obtained results were also analysed considering the specific case study.

This study was performed to propose a solution to increase the water quality of the Esteghlal Dam reservoir in Minab, Hormozgan. Methods: The water quality of Esteghlal Dam was evaluated from 2016 to 2018. During this period, 18 samples were collected from three different points of the dam. The parameters of water temperature, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, total suspended solids, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, nitrate, phosphate, turbidity, biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, total hardness, anions and cations, total phosphorus, physicochemical, and microbial parameters were measured according to the method recommended in the standard method book. The obtained data were used as the input for the model of reservoir water quality (CE-QUAL-W2) to simulate reservoir water quality and predict the thermocline cycle. Finally, by plotting hypolimnion oxygen content against time and finding the slope of regression line using the data, the hypolimnetic oxygen demand (HOD) was obtained. Results: The findings showed that the anaerobic condition occurred in the hypolimnion layer during summer. Furthermore, it was revealed that the HOD of Esteghlal Dam is about 6 g of oxygen per square meter per day in the current situation. Conclusion: Considering the dam's conditions and its anaerobic problems, a hypolimnetic oxygenation system is proposed as a structural solution for this reservoir. Then, conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) profiles and monitoring data were used for the oxygen supply model of plume. The reservoir was predicted after calculating the amount of oxygen required using the equations governing linear oxygen supply systems and the plume model.					; Pazira, Abdolrahim/AAT-7773-2021; Amiri, Fazel/AAN-6903-2021; jaafarzadeh, neamat/JPY-2844-2023; Kouhgardi, Esmaeil/AAO-2816-2021	Jaafarzadeh, Nematallah/0000-0003-1172-4277; Amiri, Fazel/0000-0003-0941-9679; Kouhgardi, Esmaeil/0000-0002-3948-6613; 													2423-3765	2423-4311					2020	7	4					277	285		10.34172/EHEM.2020.33	http://dx.doi.org/10.34172/EHEM.2020.33													WOS:000608544700008

Floodplain land use gradients have a stronger effect on soil microbial enzyme activity than spatiotemporal variability	ECOSPHERE												Climate change is leading to flood events with higher frequency and longer duration. Changes in seasonal flooding that affect water saturation of soils can impact soil microbial extracellular enzyme activity (EEA) that mediates nutrient and carbon cycling. Understanding controls on soil functional potential in floodplain ecosystems helps identify optimal land use practices in these biodiverse ecosystems often under threat from land use intensification. Here, we assess some of the abiotic controls on soil microbial EEA within a floodplain and determine how sensitive the relationship between EEA and land use is across spatial scales and time. We collected soils across land use gradients within the Lake Saint Pierre floodplain, a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve in Qu & eacute;bec, and the largest freshwater floodplain in eastern Canada. Land uses included conventional and conservation agriculture, new and established managed perennial grasslands, and natural grasslands and forests. Within each land use, soils were sampled at three time periods, at three elevations representing different exposures to flood, and at four regions around the lake's shoreline to capture temporal and spatial variability. We found that EEAs declined with increasing land use intensity as expected, primarily associated with soil moisture and soil organic carbon. Notably, perennial agriculture practices had EEAs and nutrient and carbon concentrations falling between those under the annual agricultural and natural sites and could be an appropriate compromise to converting conventional agricultural practices back to natural areas. We also found that the gradient of decreasing EEA with increasing land use intensity was largely conserved across spatial scales and time. The exception for this conserved enzyme-land use relationship was in lower elevation soils, located close to the lakeshore that experience the highest flood frequency. In these locations, the land use characteristics that otherwise supported higher EEA seem to be overridden, as we did not observe any relationship between EEA and land use. Our results suggest that the influence of land use on supporting microbial nutrient and carbon cycling is largely stronger than the inherent spatial and temporal variation within a heterogeneous and biodiverse ecosystem like floodplains, highlighting the importance of land use management across scales.

Eleven correlative depositional recharge-to-evaporation cycles are com-posed of suites of organic-prone shale followed by primary halite and carnallite beds, sometimes punctuated by a bischofite-tachyhydrite end-member. A sedimentological and petrographical analysis performed on cores and thin sections allowed an interpretation of nine facies associations, named as FA1 to FA9, relying upon the occurrence of bands of fluid inclusions, grain-size, dissolution features, detrital sediments, minute inclusions and sedimentary structures. A depositional model rec-onciles the spatial distribution of primary textures, hydrology, brine saturation and palaeo-depth during a stan-dard regressive evaporation cycle. Shallow burial eo-diagenesis led to compaction-driven dissolution and recrystallization into fine-grained halite and carnallite laminites but poorly affected the overall preservation of primary deposits. Measurements and profile analysis of bromine trace element concentrations reveal a palaeo-salinity increase of the parent brine for cycle II to base IX caused by a relative brine level fall and a gradual confinement of the salt basin, likely associated with an excess of saline elements inflow from hydrothermal vents. Similar depositional textures and bromine concentration variations are observed in the lower cycles of the Aptian evaporites from the counter-part Sergipe Basin in the northern part of the Brazilian margin, testifying of a progressive brine salin -ity rise due to a palaeogeographic confinement along the northern segment of the South Atlantic Ocean. In Congo, the sylvite displays horizontal "pseudo-stratifications" that unconformably overlay the crests of anti-clines and propagate along flanks as a sharp-based caprock. The flushing and transformation of depositional car-nallite - halite into secondary sylvite - halite is interpreted as having been caused by down-stepping incremental dissolutions sourced by younger pervasive connate to phreatic waters. In Sergipe, the sylvite is interpreted as sec-ondary but further results from syndepositional dissolution of carnallite and tachyhydrite due to a regional North Atlantic Ocean ingression.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

A MULTITAXONOMIC APPROACH TO UNDERSTANDING LOCAL- VERSUS WATERSHED-SCALE INFLUENCES ON STREAM BIOTA IN THE LAKE CHAMPLAIN BASIN, VERMONT, USA	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Twenty-one stream reaches in northwestern Vermont were surveyed to assess the relative influence of local- and watershed-scale variables on stream biotic assemblages including fish, aquatic macroinvertebrates and birds. Data were collected during the summers of 2003 and 2004 and included quantitative and qualitative geomorphic and habitat assessments (local-scale) and land-use characterization and modelled annual flow and sediment loading (watershed-scale). Biotic assemblages were surveyed to capture characteristics related to abundance, diversity and composition. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to generate sets of factors representing unique scenarios of geophysical data derived from various spatial extents within the watershed. These factors were then used as the independent variables in multiple regression models using the biotic data as the dependent variables. Forty significant models were built from the combination of the eight scenarios and 11 dependent variables. Fish assemblage diversity and composition were influenced by a combination of local-scale and watershed-scale variables; however, the qualitative local data were more predictive than the quantitative data. Local-scale data and sediment (model-derived) were important factors in building significant macroinvertebrate models. Bird abundance and species richness were best predicted using local geomorphic characteristics and the qualitative local data. Our results reinforce the concept that whereas both local- and watershed-scale variables affect stream biota, their relative influence depends upon the individual ecology of each taxon. In order to address these issues, comprehensive watershed management, restoration and conservation plans would benefit from assessments at multiple scales and from geomorphological, watershed and multitaxonomic perspectives.

Preliminary Assessment of Hydrological Heritage in North Macedonia: A Novel Contribution to Geodiversity Protection	GEOHERITAGE												This study inventories, classifies, and evaluates the hydrological heritage of North Macedonia, categorizing key features into four main groups: (1) river basins, including rivers and waterfalls; (2) springs, classified as karst and thermal; (3) natural lakes, subdivided into tectonic, glacial, landslide, denudation, and karst types; and (4) marshes. Recent measurements have shown a significant decline in the water levels of glacial lakes in North Macedonia. For example, Bogovinsko Ezero, which was once the deepest, has now been overtaken in depth by Crno Ezero. Employing geospatial analysis and the Geosite Assessment Model (GAM), this research assesses 10 selected glacial lakes based on their size and hydrological significance, focusing on their vulnerability to climate change and risk of disappearance. Recent measurements have shown a significant decline in the water levels of glacial lakes in North Macedonia. For example, Bogovinsko Ezero, which was the deepest lake a decade ago, is now less deep than Crno Ezero, which is currently the deepest lake. The GAM evaluation examines each lake's Main Values (MV)-scientific, educational, aesthetic, and tourism attributes-and Additional Values (AV), including accessibility, infrastructure, and educational resources. The findings reveal significant diversity in the hydrological heritage of North Macedonia's glacial lakes. Notably, Bogovinsko Ezero achieved the highest Main Value score of 11.5, reflecting its exceptional scientific importance and aesthetic appeal, accompanied by an Additional Value of 13.0. Given the increasing risks to these hydrological objects, this work underscores the urgent need for protection measures. Overall, the research enhances the understanding of hydrological heritage in North Macedonia and provides data-driven recommendations for sustainable management and conservation strategies, integrating these water sites into broader geodiversity protection efforts.

Although the lack of terrestrial organic macrofossils and the presence of a significant C-14 reservoir effect make radiocarbon dating of lake sediments very difficult, we propose the following palaeoenvironmental history. An initial shallow freshwater lake (ca. 22,000 C-14 years BP) disappeared during the extremely dry conditions of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 18,000 C-14 years BP). That section is devoid of pollen. The late-glacial lake transgression started around 12,000 C-14 years BP, peaked in two phases between ca. 11,000 and < 9000 C-14 years BP, and terminated around 8000 C-14 years BP. Effective moisture increased more than three times compared to modern conditions (<similar to> 200 mm precipitation), and a relatively dense terrestrial vegetation was established. Very shallow hypersaline lacustrine conditions prevailed during the mid-Holocene until ca. 3600 C-14 years BP, However, numerous drying and wetting cycles suggest frequent changes in moisture, maybe even individual storms during the mid-Holocene. After several humid spells, modern conditions were reached at ca. 3000 C-14 years BP, Comparison between limnogeological data and pollen of terrestrial plants suggest century-scale response lags. Relatively constant concentrations of long-disance transported pollen from lowlands east of the Andes suggest similar atmospheric circulation patterns (mainly tropical summer rainfall) throughout the entire period of time. These findings compare favorably with other regional paleoenvironmental data. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

On CMAS projections their compositions always fall on or near low-pressure cotectics. In addition, the basalts of Masaya have unusually high Sr-87/Sr-86 and Be-10. Masaya has exhibited medium-term compositional cycles, best exhibited by the sawtoothed changes in TiO2 and FeO*/MgO. There are also a number of longer-term compositional changes which are abrupt and generally coincide with caldera formation. Many of the geochemical characteristics of Masaya, coupled with a number of volcanological observations, indicate Masaya is underlain by a large, shallow, open-system magma chamber, perhaps on the order of 10 km3 in size. Although fractional crystallization is a significant magmatic process in Masaya's open-system chamber, magma mixing/contamination is equally important. Magma mixing is necessary to explain the discontinuous stratigraphic changes in magma composition observed at Masaya, and crustal contamination is necessary to explain their generally elevated Sr-87/Sr-86 and LIL-element concentrations. Two components, therefore, have been admixed into the magma chamber of Masaya: a LIL-poor basaltic component such has been erupted from the nearby Nejapa and Granada cinder cones; and a LIL-rich acidic component such has been erupted from the nearby calderas of Apoyo and Apoyeque. Admixtures of the former have dominated. Admixtures of the latter ended with caldera formation. Ironically, open-system behavior has exerted fundamental control on the maintenance of relative compositional homogeneity.																			0377-0273					AUG	1993	56	4					379	400		10.1016/0377-0273(93)90004-B	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0377-0273(93)90004-B													WOS:A1993LV40200004

However, when and how anthropogenic impacts have affected lacustrine OM accumulation in southwest China during the late Holocene have not yet been well defined. Here, a 16.3-kyr n-alkane record derived from Erhai Lake was used to trace OM sources and explore their connections to climate and human activity. The n-alkane distributions indicated that the dominant sediment sources shifted from terrestrial and aquatic plants to algae in the late Holocene. OM accumulation was closely related to catchment soil erosion, sediment transport, and deposition processes regulated by climate conditions before 5.0 cal. kyr B.P., following the patterns that stronger monsoon precipitation favoured more terrestrial and less aquatic OM input, and vice versa. From 5.0 to 2.0 cal. kyr B.P., the synchronous downwards trends in terrestrial OM input and precipitation intensity indicated that climate remained a major driving force for OM accumulation. However, sediment sources experienced large-magnitude and centennial-scale oscillations between allochthonous and autochthonous inputs, reflecting early human impacts appeared and lake ecosystems retained the self-regulated ability to recover from the basin-wide early moderate human disturbances. Afterwards, the increased (decreased) OM contributions from terrestrial (aquatic) plants contradicted the weakening monsoon precipitation since 2.0 cal. kyr B.P., indicating a dominant effect of human activities on OM accumulation. This change was accompanied by highly improved algae productivity and gradually elevated lacustrine trophic status, and the lake ecosystem eventually shifted into another state largely deviating from its climate-driven background due to intensified deforestation and agricultural cultivation. Regional comparison indicated that anthropogenic disturbances have temporal differences in southwest China. This study will further improve our understanding of past climate-humanenvironment interactions in southwest China.					sun, weiwei/GQG-8925-2022														0048-9697	1879-1026				OCT 10	2024	946								174182	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.174182	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.174182		JUN 2024						38925392					WOS:001283987700001

Among the most vulnerable are microbial-dominated epishelf lakes, in which surface ice-damming of an embayment causes a freshwater layer to overlie the sea, creating an interface between distinct habitats. We characterized the physicochemical and biotic environment of Milne Fiord epishelf lake (82' N, Canada) in three successive summers (2010-2012), and on one date of profiling (5 July 2011) we collected samples for high through-put amplicon sequencing of variable regions of small subunit rRNA to characterize the microbial community (Eukarya, Bacteria and Archaea). Potentially active water column communities were investigated using reverse-transcribed rRNA, and phytoplankton were further characterized by accessory pigment analysis. Cluster analysis of pigment data showed a demarcation between freshwater and marine communities, which was also evident in the sequence data. The halocline community of Eukarya was more similar to the deeper marine sample than to the freshwater surface community, while the Archaea and Bacteria communities at this interface clustered more with surface communities. In 2012, conductivity-depth profiles indicated shallowing of the freshwater layer and mixing across the halocline, accompanied by lower picocyanobacteria and higher picoeukaryote concentrations. Picocyanobacteria cells were more evenly distributed throughout the water column in 2012, implying partial deep mixing. Several mixotrophic taxa of Eukarya were more abundant in the freshwater layer, where low nutrient concentrations may favor this lifestyle. Unusual features of Milne Fiord microbial communities included benthic taxa not previously reported in marine water columns (notably, the archaeon Halobacteriales), and dominance by taxa that are typically present in sparse concentrations elsewhere: for example, the Chlorophyte group Radicarteria and the betaproteobacterium Rhodoferax. Milne Fiord epishelf lake is the last known lake of this kind remaining in the Arctic, and the fate of this distinct microbial ecosystem may ultimately depend on the stability of the Milne Fiord ice shelf, which has experienced a negative mass balance over the past half century.

This non-uniformity was observed in the summer months, under uniform solar radiation. Our findings are based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data (2002-2016) on board the Terra and Aqua satellites. MODIS data showed that, on average for the 15-year study period, daytime SST over the eastern part of the lake (Te) exceeded by 5 degrees C that over the western part (Tw). This SST non-uniformity (observed in the absence of surface heat flow from land to sea at the eastern side) was accompanied by spatial non-uniform distribution of land surface temperature (LST) over areas adjacent to the Dead Sea. Specifically, LST over areas adjacent to the eastern side exceeded by 10 degrees C that over areas adjacent to the western side. Our findings of spatial non-uniformity of SST/LST based on MODIS data were supported by Meteosat Second Generation LST records. Regional atmospheric warming led to a decrease in spatial non-uniformity of SST during the study period. Temperature difference between Te and Tw steadily decreased at the rate of 0.32 degrees C decade(-1), based on MODIS/Terra data, and 0.54 degrees C decade(-1), based on MODIS/Aqua data. Our simulations of monthly skin temperature distribution over the Dead Sea by the Weather Forecast and Research (WRF) model contradict satellite observations. The application to modeling of the observed SST/LST spatial non-uniformity will advance our knowledge of atmospheric dynamics over hypersaline lakes.

The late Quaternary geology of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore was examined with high-resolution seismic reflection profiles, ground-penetrating radar (GPR), and boreholes. Based on sequencestratigraphic principles, this study recognizes ten stratigraphic units and three major unconformities that were formed by late Pleistocene glaciation and postglacial lake-level changes. Locally high sediment supply, and reworking by two regressions and a transgression have produced a complex stratigraphy that is prone to episodic failure. In 1995, a large landslide deposited approximately 1 million m(3) of sediment on the lake floor. The highly deformed landslide deposits, up to 18 m thick, extend 3-4 km offshore and unconformably overlie well-stratified glacial and lacustrine sediment. The landslide-prone bluff is underlain by channel-fill deposits that are oriented nearly perpendicular to the shoreline. The paleochannels are at least 10 m deep and 400 m wide and probably represent stream incision during a lake-level lowstand about 10.3 ka B.P. The channels filled with sediment during the subsequent transgression and lake-level highstand, which climaxed about 4.5 ka B.P. As lake level fell from the highstand, the formation of beach ridges and sand dunes sealed off the channel and isolated a small inland lake (Glen Lake), which lies 5 m above the level of Lake Michigan and may be a source of piped groundwater. Our hypothesis is that the paleochannels act as conduits for pore water flow, and thereby locally reduce soil strength and promote slope failure.					; Kayen, Robert/JTV-4444-2023; Jaffe, Bruce/A-9979-2012	Kayen, Robert/0000-0002-0356-072X; Jaffe, Bruce/0000-0002-8816-5920													0749-0208					SPR	2004	20	2					510	522		10.2112/1551-5036(2004)020[0510:IONSOC]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.2112/1551-5036(2004)020[0510:IONSOC]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000222956700012
J	Ross, GM				Ross, GM			Evolution of Precambrian continental lithosphere in Western Canada: results from Lithoprobe studies in Alberta and beyond	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												The Precambrian lithosphere of western Canada was assembled into the present crustal configuration between ca. 2.0-1.78 Ga by plate collisions, sometimes accompanied by arc magmatism, with subsequent cooling of the lithosphere since ca. 1.7 Ga. Collisional processes inferred along preserved plate sutures include (1) subduction of oceanic lithosphere and accretion of Proterozoic arc crust to the western Rae Province; (2) marginal basin consumption and tectonic entrapment of the Hearne Province between coeval subduction-collision zones; and (3) amagmatic marginal basin closure, perhaps analogous to the roots of small collisional orogens, such as the Pyrenees. Seismic reflection profiles acquired during the Lithoprobe Alberta Basement Transect have captured images of syn- to post-collisional structures along these sutures and evidence for crustal-scale thrust imbrication and rigid body accretion of Archean crust with preservation of precollisional tectonic fabric. The degree to which lithospheric mantle beneath Archean crustal blocks was preserved during these collisions is unknown, although tectonic geometries imply significant thermal and (or) mechanical interaction. Post-collisional, intrusive mafic magmatism is imaged widely in both seismic reflection and refraction surveys. These magmatic events are demonstrably Proterozoic, based on crosscutting relationships seen on seismic reflection profiles and geochronology of lower crustal xenoliths, and are comparable in scale to Phanerozoic igneous provinces (e.g., large igneous provinces) but have little preserved surface manifestation. Reactivation of Precambrian basement structures is limited or very subtle, reflecting strength control by the mantle on stress transmission and crustal failure. Long-wavelength elastic deformation of the crust during the Phanerozoic occurred in regions associated with, or adjacent to, Proterozoic mafic magmatism, suggesting local rheologic control of anomalous Phanerozoic paleotopography.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				MAR	2002	39	3					413	437		10.1139/E02-012	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/E02-012													WOS:000175370800008

During the day A. kokuboi, the closest dweller to the shoreline, showed remarkable tidal migrations that differed among the developmental stages and sexes. During the daytime, intraspecific zonation of A. kokuboi relative to the shoreline was maintained during the habitat shift with tide. However at night A, kokuboi emerged from the sand and swam in the water column. The swimming activities became progressively less with growth through juveniles, immatures, mature males, non-brooding females to brooding females. A. japonica, which occurred just below the intertidal zone, showed no tidal migration, but also emerged into the water column at night. Its swimming activities differed among developmental stages, i.e. adults were inactive, while immatures and juveniles swam into the water column to expand their horizontal distribution offshore. Likewise, I. ohshimai, mostly juveniles or immatures < 3.0 mm standard length, showed no tidal migration, but emerged into the water column at night. The spatiotemporal distribution patterns of the 3 mysid species of various developmental stages showed very little overlap. The daytime behaviors of sand-burrowing mysids, such as tidal migration or burrowing, are unique among mysidaceans, and may be adaptations to avoid visual predators. On the other hand distribution patterns of the different species and stages at night seem well adapted to ensuring feeding or reproduction.

J	Meer, MS; Mishra, AK; Rafiq, M				Meer, Mohammad Suhail; Mishra, Anoop Kumar; Rafiq, Mohammd			Spatio-temporal Patterns of Land Use Land Cover Changes over a District in Northern India and their Impact on Environment and Society	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA												This study focuses on exploring spatio-temporal changes in land use and land cover over Bandipora district of Jammu and Kashmir, India. There is significant decreases in agriculture, dense forest, and water body over the region with positive changes in the built-up area, aquatic vegetation, horticulture, marshy land, pasture, plantation, and sparse forest. It is interesting to note that Asia's largest fresh water lake "Wular" which has witnessed a large scale change in its ecosystem falls in the study area. Land use and land cover maps were explored using on screen digitisation generated from series of Landsat data (1979, 2001 and 2018). Environmental parameters like precipitation (both rain and snowfall), temperature and black carbon were analysed in order to relate with land-use and land-cover changes in the study area. Results report decreases of about 23%, 25%, 12%, 60% in agriculture, dense forest, scrub, water body, respectively from 1979 to 2018 in the study area Furthermore, increases of about 59%, 58%, 254%, 17% are reported in horticulture, sparse forest, built up and aquatic vegetation, respectively. Decrease in agriculture is attributed to decreased precipitation over study area. A decadal decrease of about 0.5% in precipitation is reported in the study area. Increased horticulture and dependency of population over forest significantly resulted in increased black carbon. This study reports a decadal increase of about 2.2% nm in black carbon in the study area. Reduction in precipitation affected Wular lake by shrinking its fresh water coverage. The fresh water area of the lake is decreased by 75% during 1979 to 2018. As one of the source of water for lake is precipitation in the form of (rain and snow), significant reduction in fresh water of Wular lake poses significant socio-economic impact on the population of study area. Present study highlights the importance of effective government policies for mitigating the impact of significant land use and land cover changes over Bandipora district.					; Mishra, Anoop/F-3394-2017; Meer, Mohmmad/ACX-3702-2022	Meer, Mohammad Suhail/0000-0003-2497-358X; 													0016-7622	0974-6889				JUN	2021	97	6					656	660		10.1007/s12594-021-1741-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12594-021-1741-z													WOS:000661512000012

Sediment dispersal within the Black Warrior Basin has been a long-debated topic because of a complex tectonic history and the potential interaction between the Appalachian and Ouachita orogenic belts, as well as far field sediment sources. Three dispersal patterns have been proposed, including dispersal routes from the craton, dispersal via the Appalachian foreland, and dispersal from the arc side of the Ouachita suture, but sediment dispersal in the Black Warrior Basin remains inconclusive. In this study, sandstone modal analysis and U-Pb detrital zircon geochronology are used to document the provenance and potential dispersal patterns for selected Mississippian sandstone units in the Black Warrior Basin, Missouri, USA. Results show that the majority of the Lewis, Evans, Sanders, and Carter sandstones are sublitharenite to mature quartzarenite and fall within the Cratonic Interior field on Q-F-L diagrams. U-Pb detrital zircon analyses of the Lewis, Sanders, and Carter sandstones show that there are four distinctive age clusters, including a prominent Paleozoic age cluster (similar to 350-500 Ma), a broad Grenville age cluster (similar to 900-1350 Ma), and two minor age clusters of the Granite-Rhyolite (similar to 1360-1600 Ma) and the Yavapai-Mazatzal (similar to 1600-1800 Ma) provinces. All Mississippian sandstones have similar age distributions except for the Lewis sandstone, which lacks zircon grains from the Superior province'(>similar to 2500 Ma). Based on the compositional maturity, similarity of age distributions, and changes of relative abundance among different age groups, we conclude that the Late Mississippian sandstone units analyzed' during this study were derived from the Laurussian craton and the northern part of the Appalachian foreland through a major axial drainage that occupied the Mississippi Valley Graben.

A case study of sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) control and ecology in a microcosm of the Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The Cheboygan River, Michigan, is the only tributary to the upper Great Lakes where sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) are known to complete their entire life cycle. The Upper and Lower reaches are separated by the Cheboygan Lock and Dam located about 2 km from Lake Huron. In the Upper River, the Pigeon, Sturgeon, and Maple Rivers provide nursery habitat for larval sea lamprey. Burt and Mullett Lakes provide feeding grounds for juvenile sea lamprey. Low levels of immigration from Lake Huron occur when adult sea lamprey bypass the lock and dam. Lampricide treatment in the Pigeon, Sturgeon, and Maple Rivers began in 1966 and 15 treatments have been conducted to date at a combined cost of $435,000 USD per treatment. Treatments may become more difficult due to recent dam removals in the Pigeon (2016) and Maple Rivers (2018) that expanded habitat available to valued fishes and sea lamprey. At present, the landlocked population is less than 200 spawning adults, and those adults are generally smaller and may spawn earlier in the spring than adult sea lamprey from Lake Huron. Frequency of sea lamprey-induced wounding on steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and northern pike (Esox lucius) in Mullett Lake is less than 5%. Given increasing challenges of lampricide treatment, efforts to test other means of control such as sterile male release technique is on-going. The Cheboygan River represents a microcosm of the Great Lakes and is useful for learning about sea lamprey ecology and testing controls that supplement lampricides and barriers.

The origin of the acid in local acid ponds and rivers and the evolution of the water chemistry are discussed on the basis of sulfur stable isotope ratios and chemical equilibria. One of the sources of the acid is sulfuric acid, which is derived from the oxidation of hydrogen sulfide in volcanic gas gushing out from fumaroles around the area and from acid deposition supplied from Taipei City. It is also derived from the oxidation of pyrite: the sulfur stable isotope ratios of delta(34)S of +1parts per thousand to +4parts per thousand (relative to CDT) of sulfate in acid pond waters (pH 3-4) could be related to those of hydrogen sulfide in volcanic gas, pyrite in local pond sediments and soils, and sulfate in rain water. One acid source is sulfuric and hydrochloric acids arising in springs from geothermal activity: the delta(34)S values were characterised by +13parts per thousand to +17parts per thousand sulfate-S, which was provided by a disproportionation reaction of sulfur dioxide in the depths. Another acid source could be the oxidation of iron(II). Under acidic conditions, the water-rock reaction gives rise to high concentrations of aluminium and iron. While flowing down surface streams, iron( II) is oxidised to iron( III) and then hydrolysed to cause further acidification under oxic conditions. The concentrations of iron and aluminium are controlled by redox and dissolution equilibria.

The location at present is in the contact zone of Valdivian Evergreen Forest and Lowland Deciduous Beech Forest. Early and late in the pollen record, as indicated by assemblages of southern beech (Nothofagus dombeyi type) and grass (Gramineae), the site was located in Subantarctic Parkland. Intervening assemblages represent expansion of Valdivian-North Patagonian Evergreen Forest (> 49 355 to about 40 000 C-14 yr BP) and North Patagonian Evergreen Forest-Subantarctic Parkland (approximately 40 000 to 30 000 C-14 yr BP). Climate over the time span was under the storm regime of the Southern Westerlies and apparently uninterruptedly wet. When Subantarctic Parkland expanded, cold conditions with summer temperatures estimated at 8-9 degrees C (7 degrees C lower than present) resulted in episodes of glacier maxima. Climate moderated during the period of forest expansion, at which time glaciers were in a state of recession. Contrasting with the continuously wet climate of the Lake District for the period of record, climate in semi-arid-arid, subtropical Chile underwent extended intervals of precipitation. Data from both the terrestrial and marine realm implicate the Southern Westerlies as the cause of intensified storm activity at lower latitudes. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We studied the nest success and survival of Snowy Plovers nesting on the Missouri River between Nebraska and South Dakota from 2008-2011 by monitoring nests every 2-3 days and banding adults and chicks. We used the logistic exposure method to estimate nest success and capture-recapture models in Program MARK to estimate adult and chick survival. Snowy Plover nests had a daily survival rate of 0.978 +/- 0.008, and annual adult apparent survival rate was 0.588 +/- 0.119. In addition, we estimated that 0.63 +/- 0.12 of Snowy Plover chicks survived to fledging (30 days) during our study. The results for Snowy Plovers were similar to results for Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) breeding in the same area, and the demographic rates in this study were similar to those reported from established portions of the species' range. Recent breeding range expansion may be due to spring flooding on established breeding grounds coupled with the drying of lakes and reservoirs in the northern Great Plains Continued monitoring of breeding populations in this region should determine if expansion of the breeding area described in this study will persist, offering a rare opportunity to learn about population dynamics at the forefront of a species' range expansion.

The ice sheet measured approximately 2,5m thickness and the water body has a depth of about 10m. The lake is situated near a moraine which partly ablates from snow and provides meltwater from the slopes to the lake during austral summer. These running waters which are kept liquid by the heating up of the dark soil are penetrating the lower ice cover and thus softening up the lakeside part if the ice core. It is inoculated by nutrients, active microbes and diatoms of terrestrial origin. A distinct gradient concerning bacterial numbers, biomass and production which is 10 fold at the ice-water interface compared to the exposed part is observable. Temperature sensitivity of the embedded microbes reflect the gradient as well: Bacteria isolated from the upper part showed growth optima at 10degreesC, the lower part at 25degreesC, phylogenetic properties done by 16s rDNA reveal distinct communities depending on their vertical position, some clones are similar to those retrieved in Lake Vostok ice cores. These results offer the conclusion that even in this harsh environment like the Antarctic continent a dynamic system like microbial ice aggregates can be sustained as long as the supply of liquid water which is essential for an active bacterial metabolism is provided at least for a small time frame.																			0277-786X	1996-756X	0-8194-5493-1				2004	5555						170	179		10.1117/12.564554	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.564554													WOS:000225670200016

The 40-28 kaBP and 9.0-5.0 kaBP lake-expanding events, corresponding to the global warming periods, were mainly determined by the abundant summer monsoon rainfall brought by strong Indian monsoon, aroused by enhanced solar radiation at earth orbital precessional cycle. The 40-28 kaBP lake-expanding event, also called the great lake period or the pan-lake period, for several great lake groups had come into being by the interconnection of the presently isolated and closed lake catchments. The total lake area over the Tibetan Plateau was estimated at least up to 150000 km(2), 3.8 times of the present, and the lake supply coefficients were about 3-10. The 9.0-5.0 kaBP lake-expanding, with a total lake area of 68000 km(2), less than the above mentioned reflected the Indian monsoon rainfall less than that of 40-28 kaBP. The expanded lakes at 19-15 kaBP and 13-11 kaBP, distributed in these basins with more or less existing glacial, indicated plenty of glacial meltwater discharged to balance evaporation on expansive lake surface. At the same time, the enhanced precipitation by the westerlies at 19-15 kaBP and by Indian monsoon at 13-11 kaBP plays an important role in maintaining the high lake level. Heinrich events greatly affected the evolution of climate system over the Tibetan Plateau, and thus gave a clear boundary of the high lake level change in the late Quaternary.

J	RUSSELL, AJ				RUSSELL, AJ			OBSTACLE MARKS PRODUCED BY FLOW AROUND STRANDED ICE BLOCKS DURING A GLACIER OUTBURST FLOOD (JOKULHLAUP) IN WEST GREENLAND	SEDIMENTOLOGY												The effects of glacier ice block grounding on the morphology and sedimentology of proglacial fluvial outwash were examined during a glacier outburst flood or jokulhlaup, near Sondre Stromfjord, west Greenland. Observations made during and after the 1987 jokulhlaup both on the surface of an ice contact delta and within a confined valley sandur plain provided information about the formation of ice block obstacle marks and the significance of these bedforms for sandur morphology and sedimentology. Flow directions determined from obstacle mark morphology have been used successfully to char-t flow direction changes on the falling limb of the jokulhlaup. Maximum flow depths for scour around stranded ice blocks may be given by 0.5-0.9 times the diameter of the ice block, as estimated from the depth of scour, the height of the obstacle shadow or the extent of ice block meltout sediments. Minimum flow depths can be represented by the height of the obstacle shadow above the mean bed level. The internal composition of the shadow indicates the ability of the flow to transport various sizes of material into the lee of obstacles. Ice block obstacle marks within the distal portion of the sandur initiated waning stage channel change. Proximal and lateral erosion around stranded ice blocks extended downstream from the ice block, forming chute channels which then captured waning stage flows, resulting in significant bar incision with associated deposition of lobate or deltaic deposits. It is suggested that ice block obstacle marks are important in terms of channel morphology, channel morphological change and their usefulness as palaeohydrological indicators.

J	Chen, LM; Jin, ZD; Wan, DJ; Zhang, F				Chen, Liu-Mei; Jin, Zhangdong; Wan, Dejun; Zhang, Fei			Spatial uniformity in the mineralogical and geochemical compositions of surface sediments in Lake Qinghai and their controlling factors	LIMNOLOGY												To advance the understanding of the spatial variability of sediment composition and its controlling factors in a large hydrologically closed lake, the spatial distributions in the mineralogy and geochemistry of 18 surface sediment samples along three transects across the deepest part of Lake Qinghai on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau were investigated. The data show (1) that the surface lake sediments are almost the same in the XRD patterns, (2) that the sediments do not have considerable changes in geochemical compositions along three transects and (3) that the standard deviations of the lake sediments are low in grain size, elemental abundances, delta C-13 and delta O-18 values of carbonates, and total organic carbon and nitrogen, with the exception of one sample (QH-11) from the westernmost part of the northern sub-basin. These characteristics indicate that the spatial variability of the surface sediment across Lake Qinghai is very low in geochemical and silicate mineralogical compositions, with limited differences in the chemical composition of carbonates associated with river water dilution. Sample QH-11 has anomalously high levels of MgO, a high carbonate content, and positive delta C-13 and delta O-18 values in bulk and fine-grained carbonates, probably because of the effect of calcareous tufa. Spatial uniformity in the mineralogical and geochemical compositions of surface sediments in Lake Qinghai can be attributed to the flat topography of the lakebed and stable sediment provenances, the latter dominated by dust deposition and authigenic carbonates. The spatial uniformity and dominance of dust and authigenic aragonite of surface sediments across Lake Qinghai provide a potential record of the hydroclimate in the past, which is associated with changes in the Westerlies and the summer monsoons.

In Zakelikiai and Skiruiai sections of Dubysa River oxbow sediments were investigated by various methods (dendrochronological, carbonate, granulometric, pollen and mollusc fauna analysis). In addition, these sections were dated using the radiocarbon method. Samples were collected from deposits of Dubysa River outcrops. The studied oxbow lakes have existed for more than 5 thousand years (from ca. 4300 BC to 1000 AD). During this period organic rich deposits with trees and branches were formed in the oxbow lake. This indicates that at the end of Atlantic, during Subboreal and in the early Subatlantic periods there was a forest growing that contained mainly oaks which were falling down into an oxbow lake and later were covered by sandy and silty deposits. The granulometry of alluvial deposits, as well as the mixture of medium-grained sand and silt show different stages of Dubysa River palaeochannel formation: riverbed and oxbow lakes. Three climate warming cycles were revealed according to carbonate analysis data in all investigated sections. The rheophile thermophilous Holocene age molluscs species Bithynia tentaculata L., Unio cf. crassus Philipsson, Pisidium amnicum (Muller), Theodoxus fluviatilis (Linnaeus) have been found. The pollen composition and sequences have been divided into five local pollen assemblage zones (LPAZ) and described according to pollen spectra in each zone. In this way it is possible restore palaeoclimatic coherent evolution, trends and cyclical change.					; Pawlyta, Jacek/C-1644-2013; Michczynski, Adam/F-4834-2013	Pazdur, Anna/0000-0002-6078-798X; Pawlyta, Jacek/0000-0001-8725-4326; Michczynski, Adam/0000-0003-2795-6830													1897-1695					MAR	2013	40	1					22	32		10.2478/s13386-012-0025-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s13386-012-0025-1													WOS:000312711500002
C	Roberts, SM; Spencer, RJ		Alsharhan, AS; Glennie, KW; Whittle, GL; Kendskk, CGS		Roberts, SM; Spencer, RJ			A desert responds to Pleistocene climate change: Saline lacustrine sediments, Death Valley, California, USA	QUATERNARY DESERTS AND CLIMATIC CHANGE					International Conference on Quaternary Deserts and Climatic Change	DEC 09-11, 1995	AL AIN, U ARAB EMIRATES	United Arab Emerites Univ, Uni Aberdeen, Abu Dhabi Co Onshore Oil Operat, IGCP-UNESCO, 3th World Acad Sci				A core taken in 1993 from the modern saltpan at Badwater Basin in Death Valley, California, USA recovered about 185 m of saline lacustrine sediments. The sediments reflect climate fluctuations during the last 200 ka, encompassing two major glacial-interglacial cycles. This paper describes sediments in the lower half of the core, dated from about 200 to 100 ka. Perennial saline lake black muds and associated evaporite sediments, deposited between about 186 and 120 ka, encompass over half of the lower core. They are bracketed by saline mudflat and saltpan/ephemeral saline lake facies. Halite dominates evaporite mineralogy in the lower core; primary growth textures and syndepositional alteration fabrics provide qualitative indicators of brine depth and stratification and subaerial exposure events. Paleotemperatures from fluid inclusions in halite and pseudomorphs of hydrohalite suggest a climate 10 to 15 degrees C cooler than present, with winter lows below 0 degrees C. The Amargosa River may have begun to drain into Death Valley sometime during the early phase of the perennial lake. Sierra Nevada runoff via a series of over flowing basins probably reached Death Valley briefly just before the end of the perennial lake phase. The perennial lake interval, which reflects increased precipitation regionally, began at the beginning of global glacial stage 6 and persisted through it into the early stage 5 interglacial. The appearance or growth of perennial lakes during glacial periods has been noted in other interior-drained valleys in the US Great Basin, opposite to the response of many global desert-latitude areas, which become drier during glacial periods.																					90-5410-597-6				1998							357	370																WOS:000073252100033

Plant tussocks were tagged in March, 2002 and were totally dead by September, 2002. Decomposition rates were determined over 360 days using litter bag technique and mass loss, nutrient dynamics fungal biomass, meiofauna and macroorganisms were determined. Decomposition rate of detached S. maritimus litter was 0.00196 (k, day(-1)) with a 54% of mass lost observed in 1 year. The pattern of mass loss was characterized by an initial phase of fast loss of organic matter with high density of meiofauna and a decrease of oxygen content, followed by two slower phases, with no significant losses from 50 to 180 days and with 21% of mass lost from 180 to 360 days. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) content of plant litter increased during decomposition process whereas atomic C:N and C: P ratios decreased suggesting a nutrient immobilization on plant detritus. Fungal biomass measured as ergosterol content decreased after submersion of leaves, indicating that their importance in litter decomoposition decreases in submerged leaves during the first days of decomposition. An inverse relationship (r=-0.79, P < 0.005) was observed between ergosterol content and nematodes density on S. maritimus litter. Our results suggest that in Mediterranean brackish marshes, where large amounts of dead organic matter is accumulated over the sediment surface, decomposition process is greatly affected by extremely high temperatures in summer that, if water is available, accelerates microbial activity decreasing oxygen content thus slowing decomposition.

J	Clark, JF; Hudson, GB				Clark, JF; Hudson, GB			Quantifying the flux of hydrothermal fluids into Mono Lake by use of helium isotopes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												In Mono Lake, concentrations of (3)He and (4)He are greater than atmospheric equilibrium values, indicating a subsurface helium source. This assertion is supported by vertical concentration profiles that show maximum delta (3)He values (+68%) occurring within the pycnocline. The slope of the regression between (3)He and (4)He concentrations is near 2.8 R(a) (R(a) is the atmospheric helium isotope ratio), indicating that the subsurface source has a component of mantle helium. Hydrothermal springs and gas vents from Paoha Island have similar ratios, which suggests that discharge from this thermal system is the most important source. A 3He mass balance indicated that below the deep pycnocline at 17 m, similar to 25 cc STP of (3)He accumulates each year (similar to 90% from the influx of hydrothermal water and similar to 10% from the in situ decay of tritium). Although it is not retained because of gas transfer across the air-water interface, similar to 70 cc STP of (3)He is injected each year into the upper 17 m. When (3)He is used as a tracer, the influx of hydrothermal water below the deep pycnocline was estimated to be 0.045 +/- 0.025 m(3) s(-1). Because the hydrothermal water is fresher than Mono Lake, this influx causes the salinity of the monimolimnion to decrease by similar to0.1 salinity units per year and may play a small but important role in the salinity budget of this layer, which is presently denser than and isolated from the surface water.																			0024-3590					JAN	2001	46	1					189	196		10.4319/lo.2001.46.1.0189	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2001.46.1.0189													WOS:000166605800016
J	Timoney, K; Zoltai, SC; Goldsborough, LG				Timoney, K; Zoltai, SC; Goldsborough, LG			Boreal diatom ponds: A rare wetland associated with nesting whooping cranes	WETLANDS												This paper documents and characterizes a rare form of boreal wetland associated with the nests of whooping cranes, an endangered species. Diatom ponds are found in wetlands in association with bulrush marshes. They are shallow (<50 cm deep) and vary in size from 10 to >1000 m in diameter, may evaporate down to diatom muck by late summer, are strongly influenced by dissolution of gypsum, and are circumneutral to alkaline and high in sulphates. Aquatic macrophytes are few. Pond waters are clear, and the predominant primary producers are a benthic diatom community that gives the ponds a characteristic yellow color (viewed from the air). As the diatom ponds dry, they change color from yellow to pink (when water table is at the surface) to cream (due to a dried diatom and sulphate crust). Diatomaceous earth or sedimentary peat underlies the ponds, which exist in a dynamic relationship with bulrush marshes, wet meadows, fens, and bogs. In the U.S. wetland classification system, diatom ponds fit most nearly within the palustrine, unconsolidated bottom, aquatic bed type. In the Canadian wetland classification system, the diatom ponds might fit in the marsh/shallow open water complex, with a new distinction at the type level. The association between nesting cranes and diatom ponds may be due to a combination of factors such as long sight lines for detection of predators, the proximity of bulrush (their favored nesting material), and use of the ponds for feeding.																			0277-5212					DEC	1997	17	4					539	551		10.1007/BF03161520	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF03161520													WOS:000071128000012
J	Alberts, D; Gehrels, GE; Nelson, J				Alberts, Daniel; Gehrels, George E.; Nelson, Joanne			U-Pb and Hf Analyses of Detrital Zircons from Paleozoic an Cretaceous Strata on Vancouver Island, British Columbia: Constraints on the Paleozoic Tectonic Evolution of Southern Wrangellia	LITHOSPHERE												Wrangellia is a late Paleozoic arc terrane that occupies two distinct coastal regions of western Canada and Alaska. The Skolai arc of northern Wrangellia in south-central Alaska and Yukon has been linked to the older, adjacent Alexander terrane by shared Late Devonian rift-related gabbros and also by Late Pennsylvanian postcollisional plutons. Late Devonian to Early Permian Sicker arc rocks of southern Wrangellia are exposed in uplifts on Vancouver Island, southwestern British Columbia, surrounded by younger strata and lacking physical connections to other terranes. Utilizing the detrital zircon record of Paleozoic and Cretaceous sedimentary rocks, we provide insight into the magmatic and depositional evolution of southern Wrangellia and its relationships to both northern Wrangellia and the Alexander terrane. 1422 U-Pb LA-ICPMS analyses from the Fourth Lake Formation (Mississippian-Permian) reveal syndepositional Carboniferous age peaks (344, 339, 336, 331, and 317 Ma), sourced from the Sicker arc of southern Wrangellia. These populations overlap in part known ages of volcanism, but the Middle Mississippian cumulative peak (337 Ma) documents a previously unrecognized magmatic episode. Paleozoic detrital zircons exhibit intermediate to juvenile epsilon Hf-(t) values between +15 and +5, indicating that southern Wrangellia was not strictly built on primitive oceanic crust, but instead on transitional crust with a small evolved component. The Fourth Lake samples yielded 49 grains (3.4% of the total grains analyzed) with ages between 2802 Ma and 442 Ma, and with corresponding epsilon Hf-(t) values ranging from +13 to -20. In age-epsilon Hf-(t) space, these grains fall within the Alexander terrane array. They were probably derived from sedimentary rocks in the basement of the Sicker arc. By analogy with northern Wrangellia, this basement incorporated rifted fragments of the Alexander terrane margin as the combined Sicker-Skolai arc system advanced ocean-ward due to slab rollback in Late Devonian to Early Mississippian time. Ultimately, data from detrital zircons preserved in the Fourth Lake Formation provides significant information allowing for an updated tectonic model of Paleozoic Wrangellia.

The delta O-18(diatom) record is supported by diatom assemblage analysis, modern isotope hydrology and atmospheric circulation patterns. The data reveal a relatively cold oligotrophic freshwater lake system persisting for the last similar to 13.2 cal ka BP. Most recent delta O-18(diatom) (+21.5 parts per thousand) combined with present-day average delta O-18(lake) (-16.5 parts per thousand) allows calculating T-lake (similar to 21 degrees C), reflecting summer conditions. Nonetheless, the delta O-18(diatom) variability is associated with changes in delta O-18(lake) rather than with T-lake. An obvious shift of similar to 2 parts per thousand in the delta O-18(diatom) record at 11.7-11.5 cal ka BP accompanied by significant changes in diatom assemblages reflects the onset of the Holocene. Relatively high delta O-18(diatom) during the Early Holocene suggests relatively warm and/or dry climate with associated evaporation effects. The absolute maximum in delta O-18(diatom) of +27.7 parts per thousand consistent with high values of diatom indices at similar to 7.9-7.0 cal ka BP suggests a Mid Holocene Thermal Maximum. A continuous depletion in delta O-18(diatom) since similar to 5.0 cal ka BP is interpreted as Middle to Late Holocene cooling reaching the absolute minimum at 0.4 cal ka BP (i.e. the Little Ice Age). An overall cooling trend (similar to 0.3 parts per thousand 1000 yr(-1)) throughout the Holocene follows decreasing solar insolation. The pattern of the Lake Emanda delta O-18(diatom) record is similar to that obtained from Lake El'gygytgyn suggesting a common "eastern" regional signal in both records, despite their hydrological differences. Presently, atmospheric moisture reaches the study region from the west and east with similar to 40% each, as well as similar to 20% from the north. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

Vegetation heterogeneity on a Late Pennsylvanian braided-river plain draining the Variscan Mountains, La Magdalena Coalfield, northwestern Spain	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The spatial heterogeneity and community ecology is reconstructed for Late Pennsylvanian (Stephanian B sensu law) vegetation preserved in La Magdalena Coalfield, northwestern Spain. The approximate to 1500 m thick basin-fill accumulated rapidly along the margin of the Variscan Mountains, and the principal sedimentary facies comprise the deposits of large braided streams that dissected extensive wetlands containing large lakes. Quadrat analysis of 93 mostly (par)autochthonous megafloral assemblages indicates that pteridosperms and ferns dominated communities, with three taxa (Pecopteris spp., Callipteridium pteridium, and Neuropteris ovata) accounting for approximate to 58% of all plant remains. Sphenopsids and lycopsids were less common but widespread, and cordaitaleans were rare. At the local scale, laterally exposed bedding planes reveal that communities comprised a complex and heterogeneous mosaic of species. At the landscape scale, ecological gradients are evident from multivariate analyses of quadrats in a facies context. Pteridosperms dominated marginal wetlands adjacent to steep basin margins. A greater proportion of ferns occurred in or adjacent to braided channel belts, consistent with their opportunistic growth and prolific reproductive capacity, characteristics advantageous in frequently disturbed habitats. In interfluve wetlands distant from channel influence, communities consisted of low-diversity or monospecific patches of slow-growing pteridosperms enclosed in a fern-dominated matrix. Pteridosperms in interfluve wetlands were arranged along an environmental gradient: Alethopteris and Pseudomariopteris preferred more disturbed sites, Neuropteris, Linopteris, and Odontopteris occupied more stable settings, and Callipteridium was cosmopolitan. Ephemeral wetland swamps were dominated by tree ferns with lesser Sigillaria, and Omphalophloios was a major constituent in long-lived rheotrophic mires that resulted in thick coal seams.

V.; Liu, Ming; He, Wenping; Murphy, Brian R.; Xie, Songguang			Otolith retrieval from faeces and reconstruction of prey-fish size for Great Cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) wintering at the East Dongting Lake National Nature Reserve, China	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES					4th International Otolith Symposium	AUG 24-28, 2009	Monterey, CA					The food composition of Great Cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) was studied by analyzing 360 faecal samples collected from their roosting sites at the East Dongting Lake National Nature Reserve in south-central China during November 2008 and January 2009. A total of 223 fish otoliths were retrieved. Only sagittal otoliths (N=74) with intact margins, good medial relief, and well-defined sulcus were used to identify the prey-fish species and to reconstruct prey-fish size. Through shape indices and elliptical Fourier analyses, these otoliths were identified as belonging to two cyprinid fish species, crucian carp Carassius auratus (72%) and white amur bream Parabramis pekinensis (28%). The otolith size (maximum length, Lo)-prey-fish size (standard length, Ls) relationships determined for the two fish species were Ls=-19. 5+37.1 Lo (N=74; R-2=0.95; P<0.05) for crucian carp and Ls=-31.9+ 36.9 Lo (N=70; R-2=0.97; P<0.05) for white amur bream. The back-calculated Ls from the otoliths retrieved from the faeces were 96.2 +/- 10.2 mm (range 72.7-110.4 mm) for crucian carp and 86.3 +/- 10.4 mm (range 74.1-104.6 mm) for white amur bream. Based on setnet sampling of the fish community near roosting sites, crucian carp and white amur bream were found as the first and second most abundant species. Great Cormorants were very selective for the size range of prey. These results demonstrate that analysis of otoliths retrieved from faeces can be an effective, inexpensive, and non-invasive method to identify prey-fish species and to estimate prey-fish size in studies of diet composition for piscivorous birds.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				DEC	2010	89	3-4					505	512		10.1007/s10641-010-9685-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-010-9685-y													WOS:000284976500026
J	VINCENT, WF				VINCENT, WF			MECHANISMS OF RAPID PHOTOSYNTHETIC ADAPTATION IN NATURAL PHYTOPLANKTON COMMUNITIES .2. CHANGES IN PHOTOCHEMICAL CAPACITY AS MEASURED BY DCMU-INDUCED CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE	JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												Photochemical responses to changing light or nutrient conditions were examined in 3 phytoplankton communities by in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence before (Fa) and after (Fb) the addition of the electron flow inhibitor 3(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethyl urea. These values were used to calculate an index called cellular fluorescence capacity (CFC), defined as (Fb-Fa)/Fb. CFC varied markedly throughout the day and night in the spring community of diatoms and green algae in Lake Taupo, New Zealand. Morning and afternoon maxima were separated by a pronounced depression during the midday peak irradiance. Under continuous low light Taupo plankton demonstrated a circadian rhythm in CFC, but the amplitude of variation was much lower than that recorded under natural or controlled light/dark regimes. In an oligotrophic water body (Wastwater) in the English Lake District a bimodal relationship between CFC and depth was observed when surface features indicated Langmuir circulation. Photochemical capacity measured as CFC could be raised or lowered in samples from this lake by exposure to bright or dim light for 4-8 h. Phytoplankton from a eutrophic lake with a history of N limitation (Lake Rotorua, New Zealand) responded to N enrichment after a lag of 4-6 h by an increase in CFC. This was correlated with enhanced rates of C fixation and, at longer time intervals, increased growth rates. These CFC data are consistent with the hypothesis that the capacity for non-cyclic electron transport, in natural phytoplankton communities, is highly responsive to short-term changes in light or the availability of nutrients.

J	Jewell, ME; Brown, HW				Jewell, ME; Brown, HW			Studies on northern Michigan Bog Lakes	ECOLOGY												The 12 lakes studied ranged in pH from 4.2 to 9.0 and in dissolved O content from 2.56 to 6.49 cc. per liter, at the surface. Pools in the Thuja swamp bordering such a lake were weakly acid to neutral, deficient in O, and characterized by Pisidium and Aplexa hypnorum, and by the scarcity of beetles. Pools in the sphagnum mat were strongly acid ([rho]H 3.25-4.0), deficient in O, and characterized by the abundance of beetles, mosquito larvae, and nymphs of Odonata. The open water of the bog lakes showed no correlation between pH and dis-solved O, O consuming capacity, depth, marginal vege-tation, or relative age of the lakes. In the acid bog lakes the acidity is attributed to organic acids carried into the lake by water entering by seepage through the acid producing part of the margin. The alkalinity of other bog lakes is due to the entrance of water without traversing an acid producing part of the margin. Seasonal changes in lakes from strongly acid to less acid or neutral are attributed to changes in water level which remove the open water from contact with the more acid producing zone of the margin. More permanent changes may be brought about by prolonged drying of the margin, which allows air penetration and probably leads to destruction of the acid producing properties of the margin through oxidation. Fish were found in waters as acid as [rho]H 4.4 and as basic as [rho]H 9.8-10.0. The most acid waters in which molluscs were found were, for Pisidium [rho]H 5.7, and for Planorbis [rho]H 6.1. The poverty of animal life in most bog lakes is attributed, not to acidity, but to the O depletion which takes place under ice during the winter. Three types of senescence are recognized among the bogs studied (1) those in which the open water is being closed by encroachment of the floating bog margins; (2) those in which the filling in is from the bottom, due to gradual elevation of the false bottom, without any corresponding decrease in area; and (3) a combination of 1 and 2. The processes of extinction progress with great rapidity during a succession of dry yrs. and are not followed by an equal retrogression during a period of moisture.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1929	10						427	475		10.2307/1931153	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1931153													WOS:000200148300057

Although the stable isotopic compositions of nitrate eluted from a catchment can be a useful tracer to quantify the land use influences on the sources and behaviour of the nitrate, it is best to determine these for the remineralised portion of the nitrate separately from the unprocessed atmospheric nitrate to obtain a more accurate and precise quantification of the land use influences. In this study, we determined the spatial distribution and seasonal variation of stable isotopic compositions of nitrate for more than 30 streams within the same watershed, the Lake Biwa watershed in Japan, in order to use 17O excess (Delta O-17) of nitrate as an additional tracer to quantify the mole fraction of atmospheric nitrate accurately and precisely. The stable isotopic compositions, including Delta O-17 of nitrate, in precipitation (wet deposition; n = 196) sampled at the Sadoseki monitoring station were also determined for 3 years. The deposited nitrate showed large O-17 excesses similar to those already reported for midlatitudes: Delta O-17 values ranged from +18.6 to +32.4% with a 3-year average of +26.3 %. However, nitrate in each inflow stream showed small annual average Delta O-17 values ranging from +0.5 to +3.1 %, which cor-responds to mole fractions of unprocessed atmospheric nitrate to total nitrate from (1.8 +/- 0.3) to (11.8 +/- 1.8)% respectively, with an average for all inflow streams of (5.1 +/- 0.5) %. Although the annual average Delta O-17 values tended to be smaller in accordance with the increase in annual average stream nitrate concentration from 12.7 to 106.2 mu mol L-1, the absolute concentrations of unprocessed atmospheric nitrate were almost stable at (2.3 +/- 1.1) mu mol L-1 irrespective of the changes in population density and land use in each catchment area. We conclude that changes in population density and land use between each catchment area had little impact on the concentration of atmospheric nitrate and that the total nitrate concentration originated primarily from additional contributions of remineralised nitrate. By using the average stable isotopic compositions of atmospheric nitrate, we excluded the contribution of atmospheric nitrate from the determined delta N-15 and delta O-18 values of total nitrate and estimated the delta N-15 and delta O-18 values of the remineralised portion of nitrate in each stream to clarify the sources. We found that the remineralised portion of the nitrate in the streams could be explained by mixing between a natural source with values of (+4.4 +/- 1.8) and (-2.3 +/- 0.9)% for delta N-15 and delta O-18 respectively and an anthropogenic source with values of (+9.2 +/- 1.3) and (-2.2 +/- 1.1)% for delta N-15 and delta O-18 respectively. In addition, both the uniform absolute concentration of atmospheric nitrate and the low and uniform delta O-18 values of the remineralised portion of nitrate in the streams imply that in-stream removal of nitrate through assimilation or denitrification had little impact on the concentrations and stable isotopic compositions of nitrate in the streams, except for a few streams in summer with catchments of urban/suburban land uses.

Palaeohydrological changes and human-impact history over the last millennium recorded at Lake Joux in the Jura Mountains, Switzerland	HOLOCENE												On the basis of sediment and pollen analyses of a radiocarbon-dated sediment sequence from Lake Joux in the Swiss Jura Mountains (west-central Europe), this paper presents a high-resolution record of lake-level and vegetation changes for the last millennium. The lake-level record makes it possible to determine that low-stands of the water-table dominated at c. AD 1200-1400, and from 1720 onward, with interruptions by short-lived rise events at c. AD 1340 and 1840. Highstands prevailed at c. AD 1100, and around AD 1450, 1550 and 1700. The comparison of the Joux lake-level record with a solar irradiance record based on cosmogenic nucleides supports the hypothesis of a major solar forcing of climate variations in west-central Europe over the last millennium. In agreement with other palaeohydrological records established in Western Europe and in the central North Atlantic Ocean, the Joux lake-level record suggests that, on a multicentennial scale, the period of the 'Little Ice Age' coincided in the European mid-latitudes with wetter climatic conditions, and probably with an increase in summer precipitation. Variations in the hydrological cycle appear to have been associated with changes in the general atmospheric circulation pattern, probably coupled with variations in oceanic circulation and solar activity. The Joux record also points to changes in water resources expected to result from ongoing global warming. Finally, despite the severe climatic conditions which prevail in the Joux Valley, the human impact history at Lake Joux over the last millennium seems to reflect political choices and economic context more than climatic changes.

In order to study the temporal and spatial patterns of eelgrass seed dispersal in Moon Lake, Shandong, China, a continuous eelgrass meadow without outlying patches in a subtidal area was selected and assumed as the source of seed dispersal in the experiment. A square plot of 8 m by 8 m was set up inside the meadow and another two plots of the same size were also set up outside the meadow. Seed traps made of artificial turf were used to collect seeds transported by currents during the study period. Results showed that the potential seed production of the selected bed was 10,028 +/- 4874 seeds m(-2) and seed dispersal lasted from July to September. In all experimental plots, the highest densities of seed rain during a half-month period were observed in July. After two months, the average density of seed rain across all transects inside the meadow was 154 +/- 27 seeds m(-2), while outside the meadow, the density decreased nearly to zero. Over the entire study period, the average seed rain density across all transects inside the meadow was 1634 +/- 94 seeds m(-2), while at a distance of 8 m away from the meadow either downstream or perpendicular to the main tidal current direction, the average accumulated density of seed rain was 515 +/- 80 and 203 +/- 42seeds m(-2), respectively. Our results indicate that though most of the seed rain falls within the parent bed in Moon Lake, tidal currents can disperse the seeds at a distance of 8 m, and besides tidal currents, seeds might also be dispersed in other ways, such as seed predators, wind-driven waves and other processes.					; Li, Wentao Li/ITT-4895-2023; Zhang, Peidong/AAA-7564-2022	Li, Changjun/0000-0002-5539-062X; 													0304-3770	1879-1522				DEC	2018	151						9	18		10.1016/j.aquabot.2018.07.008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2018.07.008													WOS:000448091000002

Loons are at risk to elevated Hg exposure in Wisconsin because they often nest on acidified, low alkalinity lakes. Fish from these lakes bioaccumulate MeHg to a greater extent than biota from neutral pH lakes. Using nightlighting techniques, 35 adult loons were captured on 20 northern Wisconsin lakes pH=5.0-8.7) in 1991. Blood and feather samples were collected for Hg analysis. The mean Hg content of blood cells collected from adult loons on low pH lakes pH < 6.3 was significantly greater than the Hg content of adult loons collected on neutral/alkaline pH lakes (pH > 7.0) (F=19.87, P <0.001). There was a highly significant negative linear relationship between adult loon blood cell Hg concentrations and lake pH (r(2)=0.38, F=15.27, P <0.001); indicating loons nesting on low pH lakes receive greater Hg exposure than loons nesting on neutral pH lakes. The relationship was greater amongst adult males (r(2)=0.56) than amongst adult females (r(2)=0.36). Because of this documented exposure, an additional 330 loons were captured 1992-94 on 73 lakes in northern Wisconsin. The Hg exposure of adult and juvenile common loons is being quantified. Individual loons were fined with unique color-coded leg bands, and me 1992-96 reproductive performance, annual return rates, and nesting behavior of adult loons with the known Hg exposure is currently being assessed.																			0049-6979					FEB	1995	80	1-4					871	880		10.1007/BF01189737	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01189737													WOS:A1995RM44200092

This has led to great adverse impacts on local ecosystems and water resource utilization. It is therefore important to understand stream flow changes and their driving factors. In this paper, the dynamics of stream flow and precipitation in the Poyang Lake Basin between 1961 and 2012 were evaluated with the Mann-Kendall test, Theil-Sen approaches, Pettitt test, and Pearson's correlation. Stream flow was measured at the outlets of five major tributaries of Poyang Lake, while precipitation was recorded by fourteen meteorological stations located within the Poyang Lake Basin. Results showed that annual stream flow of all tributaries and the precipitation over the study area had insignificant (P > 0.1) temporal trends and change points, while significant trends and shifts were found in monthly scale. Stream flow concentration indices (SCI) at Waizhou, Meigang, and Wanjiabu stations showed significant (P < 0.05) decreasing trends with change points emerging in 1984 at Waizhou and 1978 at Wanjiabu, while there was no significant temporal trend and change point detected for the precipitation concentration indices (PCI). Correlation analysis indicated that area-average stream flow was closely related to area-average precipitation, but area-average SCI was insignificantly correlated with area-average PCI after change point (1984). El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) had greater impacts on stream flow than other climate indices, and La Nina events played a more important role in stream flow changes than EI Nino. Human activities, particularly in terms of reservoir constructions, largely altered the intra-annual distribution of stream flow but its effects on the amount of stream flow were relatively low. Results of this study provided a useful reference to regional water resource management and the prevention of flood and drought disasters.					; Gao, Peng/K-7487-2014; Yu, Qiang/D-3702-2009	Zhao, Guangju/0000-0001-7756-4494; Zhao, Guangju/0000-0002-4233-9403; Gao, Peng/0000-0002-4723-4256; Yu, Qiang/0000-0001-6950-1821														2073-4441				DEC	2016	8	12							564	10.3390/w8120564	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w8120564													WOS:000392480200017

The Carboniferous sequences (lower section of the Paganzo Group) outcroping in the central part of the Sierra de Narvaez (Las Angosturas area, northwestern Argentina) are described in this paper. From the regional point of view, two major Carboniferous sequences have been identified. Firstly, diamictites, conglomerates, sandstones, carbonaceous mudstones and thin coal beds that were included in the Agua Colorada Formation. A second group comprises monotonous sequences of shales and interstratified mudstones and sandstones which were excluded from the Agua Colorada Formation and identified with the informal name of 'Marine Late Paleozoic rocks'. Sedimentological characteristics of the Agua Colorada Formation allow recognizing seven facies associations in the Angosturas area: 1. monomictic diamictites; 2. polymictic diamictites and conglomerates; 3. shale-sandstone cycles; 4. dark shales; 5. greenish monomictic conglomerates, 6. channelised polymictic conglomerates and 7. coarse-grained sandstones, shales and thin coal beds. Facies associations I and 2, including both massive and resedimented diamictites, are interpreted as related to the well known Namurian gondwanic glacial event ill western basins of Argentina. Facies associations 3. 4 and 5 record the evolution of a Fjord environment formed as a consequence of the postglacial transgression (the so-called Namurian postglacial transgression) that flooded glacial valleys in the major part of the Paganzo Basin. A regional relative sea level fall marked by a regional incision surface occurred at the base of facies association 6, and the fjord environment was sharply replaced by fluvial sedimentation (facies associations 6 and 7). A regional correlation model, based on the postglacial transgression key level, among the Sistema del Famatina, Precordillera and Sierras Pampeanas is proposed.

Bhandari. A Retrospective Analysis of Altitude Illness at the Himalayan Rescue Association Aid Post Manang (2018-2023). High Alt Med Biol. 00:00-00, 2025.<br /> Introduction: The Himalayan Rescue Association (HRA) in Nepal has been operating high-altitude aid posts in the Himalayas to alleviate illnesses in hikers and locals with a focus on acute mountain sickness (AMS), high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), and high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE), as well as other common medical problems. This study examines the altitude-related illnesses occurring between 2018 and 2023 at the HRA Manang aid post.<br /> Materials and Methods: A retrospective study analyzing the medical records of HRA Manang from 2018 to 2023 was conducted. Demographics and diagnoses were documented, and the Lake Louise Score (LLS) was calculated for AMS cases. The frequency of altitude-related illness was compared among trekkers with/without a good ascent profile.<br /> Results: During the study period, a total of 2,904 people visited the aid post, with 337 (11.6%) suffering from altitude-related illnesses, including 274 AMS, 40 HAPE, 11 HACE, and 12 concurrent HAPE with HACE, with 58.8% of cases seen in the fall season. Most were adults, non-Nepali (70.3%), of which only 4.5% comprised the pediatric population. The majority of AMS cases were mild (70.6%) (LLS <= 5), while 17.2% had moderate to severe AMS. Almost one-third (28.2%) of cases had rapid ascent (elevation >500/day above 2,500 m), with a majority of 67.4% being Nepali compared to non-Nepali (p < 0.05). The proportion of HACE and concurrent HAPE with HACE was significantly higher among those with rapid ascent profiles. About 36.20% of cases with altitude-related illness had taken prophylactic acetazolamide, which was considerably lower among Nepali patients (p < 0.001). Motor vehicle evacuation (86.7%), followed by helicopter evacuation (13.3%), was used for those requiring immediate descent.<br /> Conclusion: Altitude illness is a common problem among trekkers in the Annapurna region of Nepal. More effort should be focused on educating high-altitude travelers to reduce the risk of these problems.

J	Xu, L; Wu, YH; Zhou, P; Cheng, H; Liu, Q; Xu, XW				Xu, Lin; Wu, Yue-Hong; Zhou, Peng; Cheng, Hong; Liu, Qian; Xu, Xue-Wei			Investigation of the thermophilic mechanism in the genus Porphyrobacter by comparative genomic analysis	BMC GENOMICS												Background: Type strains of the genus Porphyrobacter belonging to the family Erythrobacteraceae and the class Alphaproteobacteria have been isolated from various environments, such as swimming pools, lake water and hot springs. P. cryptus DSM 12079(T) and P. tepidarius DSM 10594(T) out of all Erythrobacteraceae type strains, are two type strains that have been isolated from geothermal environments. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology offers a convenient approach for detecting situational types based on protein sequence differences between thermophiles and mesophiles; amino acid substitutions can lead to protein structural changes, improving the thermal stabilities of proteins. Comparative genomic studies have revealed that different thermal types exist in different taxa, and few studies have been focused on the class Alphaproteobacteria, especially the family Erythrobacteraceae. In this study, eight genomes of Porphyrobacter strains were compared to elucidate how Porphyrobacter thermophiles developed mechanisms to adapt to thermal environments. Results: P. cryptus DSM 12079(T) grew optimally at 50 degrees C, which was higher than the optimal growth temperature of other Porphyrobacter type strains. Phylogenomic analysis of the genus Porphyrobacter revealed that P. cryptus DSM 12079(T) formed a distinct and independent clade. Comparative genomic studies uncovered that 1405 single-copy genes were shared by Porphyrobacter type strains. Alignments of single-copy proteins showed that various types of amino acid substitutions existed between P. cryptus DSM 12079(T) and the other Porphyrobacter strains. The primary substitution types were changes from glycine/serine to alanine. Conclusions: P. cryptus DSM 12079(T) was the sole thermophile within the genus Porphyrobacter. Phylogenomic analysis and amino acid frequencies indicated that amino acid substitutions might play an important role in the thermophily of P. cryptus DSM 12079(T). Bioinformatic analysis revealed that major amino acid substitutional types, such as changes from glycine/serine to alanine, increase the frequency of alpha-helices in proteins, promoting protein thermostability in P. cryptus DSM 12079(T). Hence, comparative genomic analysis broadens our understanding of thermophilic mechanisms in the genus Porphyrobacter and may provide a useful insight in the design of thermophilic enzymes for agricultural, industrial and medical applications.

Evaluation of geographic, geomorphic and human influences on Great Lakes wetland indicators: A multi-assemblage approach	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Developing effective indicators of ecological condition requires calibration to determine the geographic range and ecosystem type appropriate for each indicator. Here, we demonstrate an approach for evaluating the relative influence of geography, geomorphology and human disturbance on patterns of variation in biotic indicators derived from multiple assemblages for ecosystems that span broad spatial scales. To accomplish this, we collected abundance information on six biotic assemblages (birds, fish, amphibians, aquatic macroinvertebrates, wetland vegetation., and diatoms) from over 450 locations along U.S. shorelines throughout each of the Great Lakes during 2002-2004. Sixty-six candidate taxon- and function-based indicators analyzed using hierarchical variance partitioning revealed that geographic (lake) rather than geomorphic factors (wetland type) had the greatest influence on the proportion of variance explained across all indicators, and that a significant portion of the variance was also related to response to human disturbance. Wetland vegetation, fish and bird indicators were the most, and macroinvertebrates the least, responsive to human disturbance. Proportion of rock bass, Carex lasiocarpa, and stephanodiscoid diatoms, as well as the presence of spring peepers and the number of insectivorous birds were among the indicators that responded most strongly to a human disturbance index, suggesting they have good potential as indicators of Great Lakes coastal wetland condition. Ecoprovince, wetland type, and indicator type (taxa vs function based) explained relatively little variance. Variance patterns for macroinvertebrates and birds were least concordant with those of other assemblages, while diatoms and amphibians, and fish and wetland vegetation were the most concordant assemblage pairs. Our results strongly suggest it will not be possible to develop effective indicators of Great Lakes coastal wetland condition without accounting for differences among lakes and their important interactions. This is one of the first attempts to show how ecological indicators of human disturbance vary over a broad spatial scale in wetlands. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Kuefner, W; Hofmann, AM; Geist, J; Raeder, U				Kuefner, Wolfgang; Hofmann, Andrea M.; Geist, Juergen; Raeder, Uta			Evaluating climate change impacts on mountain lakes by applying the new silicification value to paleolimnological samples	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The evaluation of climate change impact on lakes typically relies on statistical methods like the reorganisation of organism communities (beta diversity) or transfer functions. A new method uses the silicification of diatoms that correlates with temperature and nutrients. The so-called silicification value (SiVa) overcomes problems of descriptive statistics or absent indicator species. Averaged over diatom communities, it related inversely to lake surface temperatures in mountain lakes. Hence, its change over time (delta SiVa) in a lake was hypothesised to reflect global change-driven lake warming quantitatively, which supposedly climaxes in shallow lakes. Sixteen different delta SiVa calculation approaches were tested. They (1) included or excluded planktic diatoms, (2) integrated fixed or variable time series referring to climate data or changes in diatom assemblages, (3) employed a top-bottom or regression approach and (4) expressed the delta SiVa as relative or absolute values. Subfossil diatom assemblages from 24 sediment cores from Bavarian and north Tyrolian mountain lakes served as sample set. All possible approaches were evaluated for their explanatory power for lake characteristics using GLMs. The top-bottom benthic approach with fixed climate data-based time series appeared to be the best model based on AIC and the extent of variable integration. In line with the hypothesis, the strongest decrease of delta SiVa was evident in most shallow lakes. Segmented regression further highlighted a positive correlation with depth if shallower than 10 m. By referring to the negative SiVa-summer temperature relation, delta SiVa also enabled the quantification of lake warming within the last decades, which ranged mainly between 0.1 degrees C and 1.1 degrees C per decade, consistent with existing literature. Additionally, a 100 year temperature reconstruction from a varved sediment core successfully validated the approach. Further studies may focus and extend its application to deeper lakes, but it can already serve as a powerful tool in palaeolimnological studies of shallow lakes like hard-water mountain lakes.

A paired catchment experiment was conducted in a boreal forest in southern Norway, to test effects of forest harvest operations on (i) concentrations and fluxes of methylmercury (MeHg), total mercury (HgT), nutrients and dissolved organic matter (TOC), and on (ii) MeHg bioaccumulation in stream foodwebs. Thirty percent of a catchment was harvested in winter time with snow cover but no soil frost, resulting in wheel tracks and soil compaction. Pre-harvest differences included higher streamwater MeHg, HgT and TOC, and lower pH in the treated catchment compared to the reference. No significant treatment effects on concentrations of MeHg, HgT and TOC were detected, whereas concentrations of nutrients (ammonium, nitrate, phosphorus (P)) increased significantly. Estimated catchment export of nitrate and ammonium increased fourfold, as a combined effect of changed discharge and concentrations. Export of MeHg and HgT increased weakly, primarily because of an increase in discharge. Levels of MeHg in stream invertebrates mirrored differences in aquatic MeHg between the two streams, resulting in higher MeHg in biota in the harvest catchment in pre-harvest conditions. After harvest, MeHg levels in primary consumers (herbivorous stoneflies) were no longer different between the two streams, despite continued exposure to higher aqueous MeHg in the harvested catchment. Simultaneously, dietary biomarkers (delta N-15 signature, lipid- and algal fatty acid content) in the stoneflies had changed significantly, consistent with higher nutrient loadings and associated higher diet availability in the harvested stream. The results of our experiment do not support that forest management has a strong impact on catchment MeHg production. Catchment disturbance through forest harvesting may decrease MeHg in aquatic biota, because of higher stream productivity and associated higher quality of dietary sources, at least in the short-term. Other studies on catchment MeHg production to disturbance have shown a range in responses, from strong to none. So far, no factor has emerged to explain such range in responses. Predictions of forest management effects on MeHg in streamwater and aquatic food webs are hampered by limited understanding of catchment controls on MeHg production. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Halogen Production from Playa Dust Emitted from the Great Salt Lake: Implications of the Shrinking Great Salt Lake on Regional Air Quality	ACS EARTH AND SPACE CHEMISTRY												Halogen radicals, such as atomic chlorine (Cl<middle dot>), can contribute to secondary wintertime fine particulate matter in the Salt Lake Valley. One source of Cl<middle dot> is the photolysis of nitryl chloride (ClNO2), formed from the reaction of dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5) with chloride-containing aerosol. However, sources of chloride-containing aerosols in the Salt Lake Valley, and their subsequent reaction kinetics, remain poorly constrained. We analyzed playa (i.e., dried saline lakebed) samples collected from dust-emitting regions along the northern and southern areas of the shrinking Great Salt Lake to investigate their mineralogy, reactivity, and ClNO2 forming potential. The reactive uptake coefficients (gamma N2O5) for all samples ranged from 0.005 to 0.064, with the average gamma N2O5 of the northern area samples approximately double the average gamma N2O5 of the southern area samples. We attribute the increased gamma N2O5 of northern playas to increased particulate chloride and silicate, while the reduced gamma N2O5 in southern playas is due to particulate organics and high quantities of gypsum, a nonreactive mineral. The yield of ClNO2 is > 50% for all playas tested, with one exception. Using our kinetic data during an ambient wintertime case study, we estimate playa dust contributes up to 5% of observed ClNO2, a lower estimate which likely increases during the spring when dust emissions are higher. Our work highlights the importance of including playa dust in current air quality models, especially as reductions of anthropogenic halogen sources are implemented in the United States, and ephemeral lakes continue to shrink globally.

J	JORGENSEN, NOG				JORGENSEN, NOG			INCORPORATION OF [H-3] LEUCINE AND [H-3] VALINE INTO PROTEIN OF FRESH-WATER BACTERIA - UPTAKE KINETICS AND INTRACELLULAR ISOTOPE-DILUTION	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Incorporation of [H-3]leucine and [H-3]valine into proteins of freshwater bacteria was studied in two eutrophic lakes. Incorporation of both amino acids had a saturation level of about 50 nM external concentration. Only a fraction of the two amino acids taken up was used in protein synthesis. At 100 nM, the bacteria respired 91 and 78% of leucine and valine taken up, respectively. Respiration of H-3 and C-14 isotopes of leucine gave similar results. Most of the nonrespired leucine was recovered in bacterial proteins, while only up to one-half of the nonrespired valine occurred in proteins. In intracellular pools of the bacteria, [H-3]leucine reached an isotope saturation of 88 to 100% at concentrations of >40 nM. For [H-3]valine, an isotope equilibrium of about 90% was obtained at concentrations of >80 nM. Within an incubation period of typically 1 h, tritiated leucine and valine incorporated into proteins of the bacteria reached an isotope saturation of 2 to 6%. In a 99-h batch experiment, bacterial protein synthesis calculated from incorporation of leucine and valine corresponded to 31 and 51% (10 nM) and 89 and 97% (100 nM), respectively, of the chemically determined protein production. Measured conversion factors of 100 nM leucine and valine were 6.4 x 10(16) and 6.6 x 10(16) cells per mol, respectively, and fell within the expected theoretical values. The present study demonstrates that incorporation of both valine and leucine produces realistic measurements of protein synthesis in freshwater bacteria and that the incorporation can be used as a measure of bacterial production.

Therefore, identification sediment P sources is critical for the management of P and restoration of eutrophic aquatic ecosystem. Sediment P fractions have been widely reported, whereas little is known regarding the source and pathway of different P fractions in eutrophic lake sediments. In this study, we applied chemical sequential extraction with oxygen isotopic compositions of phosphate (delta 18OP) to identify the inorganic P (Pi) source in the sediments of Lake Dianchi, China. Results show that contents of organic P (Po), HCl-Pi, NaOH-Pi, and NaHCO3-Pi of sediment were the main P fractions compared with that of sediment H2O-Pi, which was attributed to the bioavailable difference of these P fractions. Significant difference on the equilibrium values of delta 18OP (delta 18OP-eq), delta 18OP of sediment P fractions, and delta 18OP of external P was observed, which reflected the complex transformation processes of these P fractions in sediments. Further, the values of sediment delta 18ONaHCO3-Pi at some sites (17.2-22.5%o) deviated from delta 18OP-eq (14.7-19.0%o), and these values fell into the values of delta 18OP for external P (7.7-23.8%o), suggesting that sediment NaHCO3-Pi at these sites derived from external P. Comparison the values of sediment delta 18ONaOH-Pi (14.5-24.9%o) with delta 18OP-eq and delta 18O of external P sources suggested that sediment NaOH-Pi was not only from external P, but also from sedimentary Po remineralization. Pi released from sediment NaOH-Pi may be responsible for the higher values of sediment delta 18OHCl-Pi (15.2-20.8%o) than that of soils (13.1-15.3%o) and phosphate rock (8.9-12.6%o). Results gained from this study provided critical insights for the source and biogeochemical cycling of P across the sediment-water interface in the eutrophic lake.					; Wang, Jingfu/ABG-1486-2021	Wang, Jingfu/0000-0003-0666-6041; 													0883-2927	1872-9134				APR	2023	151								105627	10.1016/j.apgeochem.2023.105627	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2023.105627		MAR 2023											WOS:000955163200001

Application to data for rocks, sediments, and soils - art. no. 2057	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												[1] New theoretical curves relating the hysteresis parameters M-rs/M-s and H-cr/H-c for single-domain (SD), superparamagnetic (SP), pseudo-single-domain (PSD), and multidomain (MD) grains and their mixtures are applied to published data for natural materials. The Day plot of M-rs/M-s versus H-cr/H-c has been used to crudely classify samples into box-like SD, PSD, and MD (or sometimes incorrectly, MD + SP) regions with arbitrary boundaries. New type curves for MD, PSD/SD + MD, and SD + SP grains and mixtures permit more subtle and precise modeling. The predicted MD trend and its junction with the PSD trend are observed in two data sets: for magnetite spherules from carbonate rocks and for temperature-varying hysteresis results spanning the Verwey transition. The latter data are the basis of a suggested new method for pinpointing the PSD-MD threshold size. Selected data for pottery clays, soils, and paleosols generally follow SD + MD type curves and indicate intermediate-size PSD magnetite with narrow to broad size distributions. A lake sediment section with known grain-size progression tracks in the predicted sense along the SD + MD trend. Selected data for glaciomarine and pelagic sediments are also generally compatible with SD + MD trends. Examples of remagnetized carbonate rocks, submarine basaltic glasses, and glassy rims of pillow basalts all follow predicted SP + SD or SP + PSD mixing curves, with a large range in volume fraction of SP grains (0-75%) but a narrow range of SP particle sizes: 10 +/- 2 nm. Larger SP grains spanning the range to SD size (25-30 nm) are absent for unknown reasons. Oceanic dolerites, gabbros, and serpentinized peridotites in some cases fall in a novel region of the Day plot, parallel to but below magnetite SD + MD mixing curves.																			2169-9313	2169-9356				MAR 10	2002	107	B3							2057	10.1029/2001JB000487	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2001JB000487													WOS:000178909900001
J	Cao, HH; Dong, GH				Cao, Huihui; Dong, Guanghui			Social development and living environment changes in the Northeast Tibetan Plateau and contiguous regions during the late prehistoric period	REGIONAL SUSTAINABILITY												The relationship between the evolution of human societies and their living environments has been discussed intensively in recent decades. It is important to understand the patterns and mechanisms of human-environment interaction and evolution in order to cope with rapidly changing environments in the modern world. We reviewed the results of dating, archaeobotanical, and zooarchaeological studies from 139 prehistoric sites in the Northeast Tibetan Plateau (NETP) and contiguous regions (NETP-CR: i.e., the Hexi Corridor and western margin of the Chinese Loess Plateau) and compared them with paleoenvironmental records to study variations in spatiotemporal patterns of social development in the area and their relationships with climate and vegetation changes. Our results show that hunter-gatherer groups occupied vast areas of the NETP at low intensities during -15,000-5500 BP (years before present). This was directly related to forest cover and climate change. An increase in temperature and precipitation turnover of vegetation from desert steppe to alpine meadow/subalpine shrub, and recovery of animal population on the Tibetan Plateau created more food resources and space for hunter-gatherers. Millet farmers settled extensively below 2500 m a.s.l. (meters above sea level) in the NETP-CR between -5500 and 3600 BP, and might have coexisted with hunting groups above 2500 m a.s.l. via subsistence exchange. The distribution of human settlements during that period was affected by climate change, with the relatively warm and wet climate promoting the expansion of millet agriculture to the NETP-CR during 5500-4500 BP, while climate deterioration caused humans to retreat to lower altitudes. During 3600-2200 BP, a range of livelihoods emerged in different regions of the NETPCR. This was promoted by early trans-Eurasian exchange and the development of an agro-pastoral economy that utilized cold-tolerant crops and livestock. This eventually promoted the expansion of permanent human settlements to high-altitude areas in the NETP. This study found that human societies adopted various strategies to adapt to the changing living environment throughout late prehistoric times in the NETP-CR. The results provide a long-term perspective on the trajectory of regional socio-environmental co-evolution.

J	Sell, AF				Sell, AF			Adaptation to oxygen deficiency:: Contrasting patterns of haemoglobin synthesis in two coexisting Daphnia species	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-MOLECULAR AND INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY												Low oxygen concentrations (< 3 mg O-2 l(-1)) in the surrounding water body usually cause a marked decline of respiration and filtering rates in Daphnia (Crustacea, Cladocera). Typically during summer, when low-oxygen conditions develop in the metalimnion, the abundance of Daphnia in thermally stratified eutrophic lakes is restricted to the high-oxygen environment of the epilimnion. At the same time, food resources are depleted in the epilimnion and accumulate in the metalinmion due to sedimentation of phytoplankton and detritus. This study investigated the spatial distribution and possible physiological adaptation of Daphnia spp. in a eutrophic lake at Grafenhain (Germany). The described conditions resulted in an almost complete vertical separation of the two coexisting Daphnia species (D. pulex and D. rosea). D. pulex amounted to < 10% of all daphnids in the epilimnion and to > 96% in the low-oxygen layer around the metalimnion. This pattern was consistent, independent of time of day. Both Daphnia spp. were able to produce haemoglobin (Hb). D. pulex intensely enhanced the Hb concentration during individual growth up to 125 mg Hb g(-1) dry weight, which is 5-fold the concentration found in the neonates. In contrast, D. rosea did not enhance Hb concentration during ontogenesis. Birth rates in the metalimnetic D. pulex were high in comparison to those of the epilimnetic D. rosea. The ability to produce Hb appears to allow D. pulex to colonize low-oxygen layers and to exploit food resources therein. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

Freshwater macrophyte type (macroalgae versus phanerogams) mainly determines detritus-derived greenhouse gases production: A microcosm experiment	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												Freshwater ecosystems are crucial in the global emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as CH4. Macrophytes are the main organic matter (i.e., detritus) supplier to the sediment of these systems, thus controlling CH4 production. However, species-specific differences (structure and composition) may determine contrasting patterns of detritus transformation into CH4. Furthermore, eutrophication can affect the degradation and, consequently, CH4 production. We performed a 64-day microcosm experiment with anoxic incubations of detritus from seven phylogenetically different macrophytes (two charophytes, filamentous algae -Spirogyra, Cladophora-, three submerged plants and an amphibious one), under two trophic conditions (oligo- versus eutrophic) and with/without sediment. We assessed the CH4 and CO2 production and the changes in the detritus quality at the end of the experiment. The ranking in the mean cumulative CH4 production was: Chara hispida > Nitella hyalina > Najas marina approximate to Teucrium scordium > Stuckenia pectinata approximate to Myriophyllum spicatum > filamentous algae, and it was related to the detritus quality. GHGs maximum production rates were 1.6 (N. marina)-1.2 (C. hispida) mmol CH4/(g OC<middle dot>day) and 1.7 (N. marina)-1.5 (C. hispida) mmol CO2/(g OC<middle dot>day). The CO2:CH4 ratio was biased towards CO2 during the first 10 days (average ratio of 200) and fell afterwards to about 1 for all macrophyte species and treatments. The sediment favored detritus decomposition (probably due to the "positive priming effect"), increasing GHGs production. The influence of nutrient enrichment was not evident. Delving into the macrophyte detritus quality-GHGs production relationship is needed to forecast the GHGs emissions in macrophyte-dominated systems.

Yet, most of the previous work has been carried out on sequences of lacustrine sediments exposed at the margins of the present-day Dead Sea, which were deposited only when the lake surface level rose above these terraces (e.g. during the Last Glacial period) and typically are discontinuous due to major lake level variations in the past. Continuous sedimentation can only be expected in the deepest part of the basin and, therefore, a deep drilling has been accomplished in the northern basin of the Dead Sea during winter of 2010-2011 within the Dead Sea Deep Drilling Project (DSDDP) in the framework of the ICDP program. Approximately 720 m of sediment cores have been retrieved from two deep and several short boreholes. The longest profile (5017-1), revealed at a water depth of similar to 300 m, reaches 455 m below the lake floor (bIf, i.e. to similar to 1175 m below global mean sea level) and comprises approximately the last 220-240 ka. The record covers the upper part of the Amora (penultimate glacial), the Last Interglacial Samra, the Last Glacial Lisan and the Holocene Ze'elim Formations and, therewith, two entire glacial interglacial cycles. Thereby, for the first time, consecutive sediments deposited during the MIS 6/5, 5/4 and 2/1 transitions were recovered from the Dead Sea basin, which are not represented in sediments outcropping on the present-day lake shores. In this paper, we present essential lithological data including continuous magnetic susceptibility and geochemical scanning data and the basic stratigraphy including first chronological data of the long profile (5017-1) from the deep basin. The results presented here (a) focus on the correlation of the deep basin deposits with main on-shore stratigraphic units, thus providing a unique comprehensive stratigraphic framework for regional paleoenvironmental reconstruction, and (b) highlight the outstanding potential of the Dead Sea deep sedimentary archive to record hydrological changes during interglacial, glacial and transitional intervals.

Nageswara			Late Quaternary environmental and sea level changes from Kolleru Lake, SE India: Inferences from mineral magnetic, geochemical and textural analyses	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The present study employs mineral magnetic, geochemical, and textural parameters to elucidate the climate and sea level change signatures from Kolleru lake sediments representing the inter-deltaic part of the Krishna-Godavari sedimentary basin (KG basin). For this purpose, four cores were obtained which included significant peat. The conventional radiocarbon dating suggested that the peat formation took place during 9 ka-6 ka with an average sedimentation rate of 0.31 cm/y. Thermomagnetic analysis identifies titanomagnetite, magnetite and hematite as the dominant magnetic mineralogy of the KG basin sediments. The variation in magnetic mineralogy is related to paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental processes; the transitions between (titano) magnetite and hematite coincide with peat layers of the cores as indicated by SIRM/chi (Saturation Isothermal Remanent Magnetization/Magnetic Susceptibility) and S-ratio defined by IRM-0.3T/SIRM values. The various mineral magnetic parameters, chi and S-ratio along with major elemental concentrations of Ti, Al, Fe and Zr show signatures of an arid event before 10 ka, between 9 ka-8 ka periods and during the last 5.5 ka. The overall climate of warm and humid type was inferred from 10 ka to 9 ka, which correlates with Early Holocene Optima and 6 ka to 5.5 ka of Middle Holocene. The presence of evaporite crystals in the lowermost part of the cores corroborated by mineral magnetic and geochemical proxies indicates sub-aerially weathered facies of the arid Late Pleistocene. Similarly, the peat layers rich in mangrove pollen indicate sea level changes between 10 ka and 6 ka. The sub-surface position of the Pleistocene weathered layer and the Holocene peat layer suggests tectonic subsidence of the area, which is situated over the basement graben, known as Gudiwada sub-basin.

J	Grochowska, J; Tandyrak, R				Grochowska, Jolanta; Tandyrak, Renata			WATER CHEMISTRY OF LAKE GILWA	JOURNAL OF ELEMENTOLOGY												The study was carried on Lake Gilwa (100.8 ha, 9.4 m), in the drainage basin of the Gilwa and Pasleka rivers. The data obtained in the study allowed the authors to classify Lake Gilwa as a water body belonging to the third stability degree according to PATALAS (1960). As evidenced in the study, Lake Gilwa is a highly eutrophic reservoir. The lake waters were characterized by a high content of nutrients, up to 1.40 mg P center dot dm(-3) and 12.47 mg N center dot dm(-3). The high fertility of the lake was also exhibited by the values of BOD5 reaching 7 mg O-2 center dot dm(-3), chlorophyll a content (73 mg.m(-3)) and low transparency - 0.7 m. In the peak of the summer, the stagnation oxygen profile is represented by a clinograde curve typical for eutrophic lakes, while carbon dioxide distribution in the water column is shown by a "reverse" clinograde curve, also typical for fertile reservoirs. The study has revealed that the water in Lake Gilwa is well buffered, as shown by the alkalinity values, 2.5-5.0 mval dm(-3). Total hardness of the reservoir water varied from 157.1 to 278.8 mg CaCO3 center dot dm(-3), which is typical of hard water. The hardness was conditioned mainly by the calcium content. With the River Gilwa, the lake receives wastewater from the wastewater treatment plant in Gietrzwald, which is manifested, for example, by the high values of electrolytic conductivity (321-476 mu S center dot cm(-1)), indicating the degree of mineral pollution of the lake. Despite the wastewater input, the amount of chlorides is rather low, 20 mg Cl center dot dm(-3) at the most.

Trends in muskellunge population and fishery characteristics in Buffalo Harbor (Lake Erie) and the Niagara River	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We review the history of muskellunge management and describe population and fishery responses to management actions. Stocking of muskellunge in the Niagara River occurred sporadically from 1941 to 1974 when angler harvest was common. Since the late 1970s, managers have enacted increasingly restrictive minimum length limits and anglers adopted a catch-and-release ethic. Despite these efforts, angler catches declined sharply after 1991 in Buffalo Harbor and 1984 in the upper Niagara River; catch rates rebounded after 2006 in the Niagara River, but remain near all-time lows in Buffalo Harbor. In addition, mean catch rates of young-of-the-year (YOY) in fall electrofishing surveys declined from 33/h in 1992-1993 to 1.7/h in 2006-2009 in Buffalo Harbor and 11.0/h in 1992-1994 to 5.4/h in 2006-2009 in the Niagara River. Several ecosystem changes occurred that likely contributed to reductions in muskellunge populations, but comprehensive monitoring programs were not in place to quantify these effects. Recent seining surveys show YOY muskellunge production during 2007-2011 was highly variable among index sites (within years) and years, but catch per unit effort was 5.3 times higher at Niagara River sites than Buffalo Harbor sites; catch per unit effort of all fishes was 9.5 times higher in the upper Niagara River than Buffalo Harbor. Both areas are in need of habitat restoration, but habitats in Buffalo Harbor appear especially poor for nearshore fishes. Uncertainty about which factors led to declines in angler catches of muskellunge and YOY production demonstrates the need for a comprehensive monitoring program and formal muskellunge management plan.

E., Jr.			Predation on Chinook Salmon Parr by Hatchery Salmonids and Fallfish in the Salmon River, New York	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Naturally reproduced Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha contribute substantially to the fishery in Lake Ontario. The Salmon River, a Lake Ontario tributary in New York, produces the largest numbers of naturally spawned Chinook Salmon, with parr abundance in the river often exceeding 10 million. In the spring of each year, large numbers of hatchery salmonid yearlings-potential predators of Chinook Salmon parr-are released into the Salmon River by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. We sought to examine predation on Chinook Salmon parr in the Salmon River during May and June prior to out-migration. Over the 4 years examined (2009-2012), annual consumption of Chinook Salmon parr by hatchery-released yearling steelhead O. mykiss and Coho Salmon O. kisutch ranged from 1.5 to 3.3 million and from 0.4 to 2.1 million, respectively. In 2009, Fallfish Semotilus corporalis were estimated to consume 2.9 million Chinook Salmon parr. Predation was higher in May, when the average TL of Chinook Salmon parr was 44.5 mm, than in June. Fallfish were also important predators of naturally reproduced steelhead subyearlings, consuming an estimated 800,000 steelhead in 2009. Hatchery-released yearling salmonids consumed 13.8-15.3% of the Chinook Salmon parr that were estimated to be present in the Salmon River during 2010-2012. Earlier releases of hatchery salmonid yearlings could reduce the riverine consumption of Chinook Salmon parr by facilitating the out-migration of yearlings prior to Chinook Salmon emergence.

The factorial design experiment included daily additions of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) at two mass ratios, 1N:1P and 7N:1P, respectively, additions of iron (Fe) and a synthetic chelator, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The floating enclosures (400 1) were sampled for analyses of phytoplankton biomass and community structure, phytoplankton primary production, chlorophyll a, nutrients, and hepatotoxins. Chlorophyll a concentration, phytoplankton biomass and primary production increased most in the 7N:1P treatment. The increase was mainly due to an abundant growth of chlorophytes (Dictyosphaerium subsolitarium, Kirchneriella spp., Monoraphidium contortum, and Oocystis spp.), pennate diatoms (especially Nitzschia spp.), dinophytes and the chroococcalean cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. The nutrient enrichments had no effect on the total biomass of N-2-fixing cyanobacteria. Nevertheless, the biomass of Anabaena spp. was highest in the enrichments with a low N/P ratio. Chlorophyll a concentration and total phytoplankton biomass were not affected by Fe or EDTA, but Fe alone had a positive effect on the chlorophyte Kirchneriella sp. The N-2-fixing cyanobacteria Aphanizomenon sp. responded positively to Fe alone and to both Fe and EDTA added together. The hepatotoxin concentration increased during the experiment, but no clear responses to nutrient enrichments were found. Our study showed species-specific responses to nutrient enrichments among the N-2-fixing cyanobacteria. Although the total phytoplankton production was not Fe-limited; the availability of Fe clearly affected the phytoplankton community structure. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

We analysed the sediment record of Golzerensee (1411 m a.s.l.), a mountain lake in the transitional zone between the montane and subalpine vegetation belt in Uri, Central Switzerland. We reconstructed past vegetation responses to anthropogenic impact, fire activity and climatic changes dating back to c. 14 550 cal. a BP using pollen, stomata, macrofossil and microcharcoal analyses. The tree line, composed of Betula and Pinus sylvestris, reached Golzerensee during the Aller & oslash;d c. 13 200 years ago, but tundra vegetation re-expanded during the Younger Dryas cooling (12 800-11 700 cal. a BP). With the rapid temperature increase at the onset of the Holocene, a closed forest established within a few decades around the study site. Concurrently, temperate taxa (Ulmus, Tilia, Acer, Corylus avellana) increased in the lowlands, likely reaching the elevation of the lake. Abies alba established locally during the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) at 9600 cal. a BP and dominated closed, montane forests, delaying the westward expansion of Picea abies that established only from c. 7700 cal. a BP onwards. The concomitant occurrence of cultural indicator taxa, as well as an increase in charcoal influx and fungal dung spore concentrations suggest that human impact has facilitated the expansion of Picea abies by negatively affecting important competitors such as Abies alba through fire and browsing disturbance. With rising temperatures due to current climate change, Abies alba and other temperate species may regain their former relevance, leading to diverse mixed forests that were abundant during the HTM c. 10 000-5000 cal. a BP. However, future forest composition and landscape diversity will also be influenced by browsing disturbance and land use management.					; Zahajská, Petra/S-3983-2017; Tinner, Willy/F-6727-2013; Zahajska, Petra/S-3983-2017; Schworer, Christoph/P-3488-2016; Schwörer, Christoph/P-3488-2016	Huonder, Ursula/0009-0002-2155-489X; Tinner, Willy/0000-0001-7352-0144; Zahajska, Petra/0000-0001-5858-0616; Schworer, Christoph/0000-0002-8884-8852; Senn, Carolina Daniela/0000-0002-8775-7190; Dziomber, Ilya/0000-0001-6985-0618													0300-9483	1502-3885				APR	2025	54	2					202	219		10.1111/bor.12691	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bor.12691		DEC 2024											WOS:001383607500001

Long-Term Mark-Recapture Data to Assess Muskellunge Population Characteristics: Application to Two Illinois Reservoirs	MUSKELLUNGE MANAGEMENT: FIFTY YEARS OF COOPERATION AMONG ANGLERS, SCIENTISTS, AND FISHERIES BIOLOGISTS	American Fisheries Society Symposium				Hugh C Becker Memorial Muskie Symposium: 50 Years of Cooperation - Anglers, Science and Management	MAR 13-15, 2016	Minnetonka, MN	Hugh C Becker Fdn, Muskies Inc, Amer Fisheries Soc, N Central Div, Esocid Tech Comm				Accurate estimates of growth and mortality are important for management of recreational fisheries. Accurate age estimates often require the sacrifice of fish; thus, assessments of growth and mortality rates of trophy fishes such as Muskellunge Esox masquinongy often lack sufficient data. Mark recapture history can be used as a nonlethal alternative to estimate growth and mortality in fishes. To determine the utility of this approach, we used data from a 17-year Muskellunge mark recapture program conducted on two Illinois reservoirs (Kinkaid Lake and North Spring Lake). Von Bertalanffy parameter estimates by sex, lake, and tag type (passive integrated transponder and T-bar anchor tags) were obtained using a novel modification of the Fabens growth model and compared to von Bertalanffy growth estimates using known- or scale-aged fish. Mortality was calculated using both age- and length-based methods. Fabens growth model estimates of asymptotic length (L-infinity) and growth coefficient (K) were within 6% (<= 62 mm) and 23% (<= 0.11) of corresponding von Bertalanffy growth model parameter estimates from known- or scale-aged fish by lake and sex. Provided that all sizes of fish are sampled, 4 years of mark recapture data with more than 100 recaptures were found to be sufficient to produce reliable parameter estimates. Growth parameters differed between male fish tagged with passive integrated transponder or T-bar anchor tags but did not differ by tag type for females. Differences in Muskellunge growth and mortality rates between the two study lakes suggest that changing from a regionally applied minimum length limit to lake-specific minimum length limits may be warranted. Our results highlight the feasibility of mark recapture data as a nonlethal technique to estimate population-specific growth and mortality rates for Muskellunge and the potential value of this approach in facilitating lake-specific Muskellunge management.

Rapid and unexpected effects of piscivore introduction on trophic position and diet of perch (Perca flavescens) in lakes recovering from acidification and metal contamination	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												P>1. Yellow perch (Perca flavescens) are often the only surviving fish species in acidified lakes. We studied four lakes along a gradient of recovery from acidification and that had different food web complexities. All had abundant yellow perch, two had low piscivore abundance, one had a well-established piscivore population and one was manipulated by introducing piscivorous smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu). We hypothesised that there would be strong effects on perch abundance, behaviour and diet induced by the presence of piscivores. 2. In the manipulated lake, the bass reduced yellow perch abundance by 75% over a 2-year period. Concomitantly, perch use of the pelagic habitat fell from 48 to 40%. 3. In contrast to findings from less disturbed systems, yellow perch in the littoral zone of the manipulated lake did not strongly shift from zooplankton to benthic food sources after the arrival of piscivores. Diet analysis using stable carbon isotopes revealed a strong continued reliance on zooplankton in all lakes, independent of the degree of piscivory. The failure to switch to benthos in the refuge area of the littoral zone is most likely related to the depauperate benthos communities in these formerly acidified lakes. 4. Yellow perch in lakes recovering from acidification face a considerable ecological challenge as the necessary switch to benthic diet is hindered by a low abundance of benthos. The arrival of piscivores in these recovering lakes imposes further restrictions on perch access to food items. We infer that future recovery of perch populations (and higher trophic levels) will have to be preceded by the re-establishment of diverse benthic macroinvertebrate communities in these lakes.

In the spring of 1991, 65 eggs were collected from nine heronries (seven along the St Lawrence River and two reference sites). A method was specifically developed for the extraction and analysis of beta-carotene and the retinoids in heron egg yolks by reversed-phase HPLC. When results were expressed either as the molar ratio of retinol: retinyl palmitate or as retinyl palmitate concentration, significant differences were found between colonies; however, retinyl palmitate concentration was deemed the better biomarker because it was not significantly influenced by embryonic stage of development. Retinyl palmitate concentrations in freshwater colonies were negatively related to PCB congeners Nos 105 and 118 as well as their TCDD-EQ values (p < 0.02, r(2) = 0.78). Egg tetrachloro-mono-ortho biphenyl concentrations were also negatively related to retinyl palmitate (p < 0.005, r(2) = 0.90). With the exception of the two mono-ortho co-planar congeners detected in the present study, the contamination levels found in heron eggs were well below those found for other bird species in the Great Lakes area and, so far, no detrimental effects have been reported in Great Blue Heron populations in Quebec. These results suggest that retinyl palmitate may be useful as a sensitive and non-invasive biomarker for monitoring organochlorine contaminant effects in the Great Blue Heron in freshwater sites.

J	Shi, W; Jiang, HC; Mao, X; Xu, HY				Shi, Wei; Jiang, Hanchao; Mao, Xue; Xu, Hongyan			Pollen record of climate change during the last deglaciation from the eastern Tibetan Plateau	PLOS ONE												The eastern Tibetan Plateau (TP) is a climatically sensitive area affected by the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM). A new pollen record from a lacustrine sediment in Mao County shows that the study area was covered mainly by shrubs and herbs during the last deglaciation, indicating open and sparse forest grasslands. Hydrophilous herbs were mainly dominated by Cyperaceae, Poaceae, Myriophyllum, Polygonum and Typha, and they gradually increased from 18.7 to 16.8 ka, suggesting a transition to a more humid climate. This corresponds to climate cooling over the same period. From 16.8 to 14.6 ka, hydrophilous herbs continued to increase, coincident with a general ameliorating trend indicated by delta O-18 records from East Asia. Between 14.6 and 14.0 ka, the mean content of hydrophilous herbs reached peak in the sequence, corresponding to relatively high delta O-18 values during this period. From similar to 14.0 to 12.9 ka, the abundance of hydrophilous herbs decreased significantly. Over the same period, the Greenland ice core shows a decrease in delta O-18 and low-latitude cave stalagmites in China record an increase in delta O-18. This implies that longitudinal temperature gradients increased and drove the southward retreat of the ISM, which in turn drove a continuous decrease in the abundance of hydrophilous herbs in the study area. From 12.9 to 11.6 ka, the mean content of hydrophilous herbs decreased to the lowest (8.3%) in the whole sequence, indicating a cold and dry climate in the study area. A positive shift in delta O-18 records during 11.6-10.6 ka was matched by a significant increase in the abundance of hydrophilous herbs in the study area, indicating a warm and humid climate trending. Hence, the ISM has had a significant impact on the climate of the eastern TP since the onset of deglaciation around similar to 16.8 ka.					; Jiang, Hanchao/ABG-2653-2020; Xu, Hongyan/I-4518-2017	Jiang, Hanchao/0000-0003-3391-4477; Shi, Wei/0000-0002-6879-7656; 													1932-6203					MAY 6	2020	15	5							e0232803	10.1371/journal.pone.0232803	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0232803								32374789					WOS:000537283500061

Assessing the utility of using current generation high-resolution satellites (Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8) to monitor large water supply dam in South Africa	REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT												The Vaal Dam is one of the largest impounded water resources in South Africa with a capacity of 2330 x 10(6) m(3) and surface area of 321.07 km(2). The Dam is part of the Vaal river system with a catchment area of about 37 100 km(2) and is designed to supply water to the large metropolitan city of Johannesburg in the north and the surrounding areas in the Gauteng Province serving approximately 13 million people. The Dam is biologically productive and experiences frequent algal blooms especially during summer months (February to April). Recent studies have indicated the presence of toxic cyanobacteria genera such as Anabaena, Lyngbya, and Microcystis and these can be of great concern for ecosystem health as well as biodiversity. Currently, ground-based methods are employed to assess and monitor the water quality of the Dam. This method is costly and lacks the temporal and spatial resolution. Therefore, a more efficient observation tools are required for effective monitoring. Satellite remote sensing is an efficient tool that can allow accurate and timely detection of harmful algal blooms (HABs) such as the toxic cyanobacteria genera and other algal types. This study focuses on assessing the utility of using current generation Satellites (Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8) to characterize the water quality and estimate concentrations of chlorophyll a as a proxy for HABs and the total suspended matter (TSM). The optimal correlation between in-situ and chlorophyll a retrieved from blue-green band ratio of Landsat 8 [Rrs (560)/Rrs (443)], and red/NIR of Sentinel 2 [Rrs (705)/Rrs (665)] were found to be the best indices for Chl-a retrieval in the Vaal Dam.

Analysis of bigmouth buffalo Ictiobus cyprinellus spawning phenology in Minnesota reveals 50-year recruitment failure and conservation concern	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The bigmouth buffalo Ictiobus cyprinellus (Catostomidae) is a freshwater fish native to North America that is known for its longevity. During the 1970s, the bigmouth buffalo was recorded as declining in Canada, Minnesota, and North Dakota and became a protected species in Canada. In the USA, population declines are exacerbated by wasteful recreational bowfishing, lack of fisheries management, and overall lack of knowledge. However, recent studies have revealed the exceptional lifespan of bigmouth buffalo, their negligible senescence, slow growth, delayed maturity, and episodic recruitment. Yet little is known about the spawning phenology of bigmouth buffalo, nor their age demographics in east central Minnesota. In this 2021-2023 study of bigmouth buffalo from Rice Lake National Wildlife Refuge we found that 99.7% (389 of 390) of the extant population hatched prior to 1972 despite annual spawning in Rice Lake. Moreover, recruitment success declined significantly since water control measures were established (1953). We found males arrive to spawning grounds with females but depart later, that both the midpoint and duration of spawn significantly vary across years, and that more massive females of the same age range invest disproportionately more in ovaries. Extensive post-spawn seining revealed bigmouth buffalo young-of-the-year in low numbers, but by mid-to-late summer they were no longer evident having likely succumbed to predation. Overall, these findings thoroughly reveal one of the oldest populations of vertebrate currently known (median age of 79 years as of 2024) and expose the stark vulnerability of a bigmouth buffalo population for which substantial recruitment has not occurred for more than six decades. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that the long-lived bigmouth buffalo is vulnerable, that a precautionary approach is immediately needed, and that the unlimited and unregulated kill-fishery be closed.																			2045-2322					SEP 3	2024	14	1							19444	10.1038/s41598-024-70237-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-70237-5								39227625					WOS:001305757100096

We measured ALT along 10 routes with lengths ranging from 0.7 to 6.9 km located on the Alaska North Slope near Toolik Lake and the Happy Valley airstrip (between 68.475 degrees and 69.150 degrees N, and -149.512 degrees and -148.769 degrees E). Using a ground-penetrating radar (GPR) system in a common-offset configuration, we measured the two-way traveltimes from the surface to the bottom of the active layer at the end of summer, when the thaw depth was greatest. We used 500 and 800 MHz antennas; the 500 MHz antenna provided suitable vertical resolution, while producing more unambiguous active-layer reflections in the presence of nonideal antenna coupling and active layer inhomogeneity. We derived ALT measurements and their uncertainties from GPR two-way traveltimes, with mechanical probing for velocity calibration. Using an empirical relationship between the wave velocity and soil volumetric water content (VWC), we found that the velocities were consistent with soil VWCs ranging from 0.46 to 0.63. In 31% of traces, the permafrost table horizon was identifiable, resulting in ALT measurements with uncertainties of generally less than 25%. The average ALT was 48.1 cm, with a standard deviation of 16.1 cm. We found distinct patterns of ALT spatial variability at different sites and different length scales. At some sites, the ALT at one point was effectively un-correlated with ALT at other points separated by lag distances as small as tens of meters; for other sites, there was correlation at lag distances up to approximately 400 m. The ALT statistics were similar to nearby long-term in situ ALT measurements from the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring Network, through which yearly ALT measurements have been made since 1990.					; JAFAROV, ELCHIN/G-1616-2016; ZHANG, TINGJUN/AAX-3662-2020; Liu, Lin/Q-4237-2018; Jafarov, Elchin/G-1616-2016	zebker, howard/0000-0001-9931-5237; JAFAROV, ELCHIN/0000-0002-8310-3261; Liu, Lin/0000-0002-9581-1337; Parsekian, Andrew/0000-0001-5072-9818; ZHANG, Tingjun/0000-0001-6974-9501													0016-8033	1942-2156				MAR-APR	2016	81	2					H9	H19		10.1190/GEO2015-0124.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1190/GEO2015-0124.1													WOS:000377883100017

Factors Influencing Mortality of Eared Grebes (Podiceps nigricollis) during a Mass Downing	WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												During the fall, hundreds of thousands of Eared Grebes (Podiceps nigricollis) stage on the Great Salt Lake, Utah. Mortalities resulting from birds being forced to the ground (downings) during migration occur every few years. A large (>7,000 birds) die-off of migrating Eared Grebes occurred 12 December 2011 in and around Cedar City, Utah. We examined body condition, age, sex, and heavy metal concentrations among downed birds and those that still occupied the Great Salt Lake both pre- and post-downing. Eared Grebes that we collected pre-downing were heavier (523 g) than deceased birds (433 g). Body weight (g) and subcutaneous fat thickness (mm) were lower in downed birds than pre-downing birds, likely the result of the 400-km flight from the staging area to Cedar City. Liver, heart, and intestine weights were all significantly greater in both pre- and post-downing birds than downed birds. This may be because of tissue catabolism during flight or incomplete physiological changes before migration. Adult biased age ratios were observed in all groups but pre-downing (34 adults: 5 juveniles) and post-downing (39: 2) groups were less biased than the downed group (100: 1). Mercury and selenium wet weight concentrations in all groups were above the level observed to impact some birds' reproduction and locomotion. Mercury concentrations in the liver ranged from 4.4-25.8 ppm wet weight and mercury concentrations measured in birds collected pre- and post-downing were lower than downed birds. Despite high levels of mercury and selenium, no adverse effects of heavy metal contamination have been noted in studies of Eared Grebes on the Great Salt Lake. Weather was likely the proximate cause of the downing, but impacts of heavy metal toxicity should be examined further to determine their effect on migrating Eared Grebes.																			1559-4491	1938-5447				SEP	2014	126	3					584	591		10.1676/13-192.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1676/13-192.1													WOS:000342962600019
J	Wang, PL; Shen, H; Xie, P				Wang, Peili; Shen, Hong; Xie, Ping			Can Hydrodynamics Change Phosphorus Strategies of Diatoms?-Nutrient Levels and Diatom Blooms in Lotic and Lentic Ecosystems	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Diatom blooms occur in many water bodies worldwide, causing significant ecological and social concerns. In order to understand the mechanisms of diatom blooms formation, the effects of varying phosphorus (P) concentration and hydrodynamics on the growth of diatoms were studied by combining results from field observations and laboratory experiments. The field investigation showed that spring diatom blooms (Cyclotella meneghiniana and Stephanodiscus hantzschii) occurred in Lake Taihu and Hanjiang River with similar environmental factors such as water temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen in 2008. Concentrations of total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen, and ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N) in Lake Taihu were significantly higher than the concentrations in the Hanjiang River. Laboratory experiments were conducted to evaluate growth and physiological responses of four lotic diatoms (Cyclotella atomus, Fragilaria crotonensis, Nitzschia palea, and S. hantzschii, isolated from the Hanjiang River) and three lentic diatoms (C. meneghiniana, Melosira varians, and Stephanodiscus minutulus, isolated from Lake Taihu, Lake Donghu, and Guanqiao Pond, respectively) to various P concentrations under small-scale turbulent and standing conditions. Our results showed that, with turbulence, lotic diatoms C. atomus, F. crotonensis, N. palea, and S. hantzschii demonstrated a significant increase in affinity for P compared with lentic diatoms C. meneghiniana, M. varians, and S. minutulus. Moreover, lotic diatoms C. atomus, F. crotonensis, and N. palea had higher growth rates and photosynthetic efficiencies with small-scale turbulence than with standing conditions both in P-limited and P-replete conditions. Lotic species S. hantzschii and three lentic diatoms (C. meneghiniana, M. varians, and S. minutulus) grew well under standing conditions. Our results may explain our field observation that the occurrence of diatom blooms in lakes is often associated with higher TP concentrations whereas in rivers, diatom blooms occur at a wide range of TP concentrations under flows. Therefore, different hydrodynamics and nutrient concentrations determined the dominant diatom species, according to their habitat-dependent physiological characteristics.

J	Kukulak, J; Paulo, A; Kalicki, T				Kukulak, Jozef; Paulo, Andrzej; Kalicki, Tomasz			Lithology of lacustrine deposits in the Colca Valley	JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES												Remnant lacustrine sediments of three major lakes are preserved in the Rio Colca Valley in the Western Cordillera of the Central Andes, SW Peru. The older lake extended between Pinchollo and Coporaque until 0.61 Ma, while two Late Pleistocene lakes lied upstream of Chivay. The river cut through the sediments to a depth of approximately 300 m between Chivay and Pinchollo, over a distance of 30 km and formed several terraces in the lacustrine deposits. The highest outcrops of lacustrine sediments lie now at elevations of 3500-3600 m. Three types of lacustrine deposits are present. Spatially dominant are regularly layered and laminated fine-grained sediments (silt, sand, and locally diatomaceous ooze). The second type are coarse gravels and sands accumulated in deltas, and the third - colluvial material. The lacustrine sediments are weakly cemented. Petrographic and mineralogical analysis of the fine-grained varieties showed that their material came from many sources. Its major part came from the lake catchment and was supplied by the river, like gravels and coarse sands. Similar in origin are dark-gray fine sands derived from local regolith. White silts and fine sands are of volcanic origin (tuffites), probably derived from nearby volcanic pyroclastic covers of the Barroso and Tacaza groups. Additional pyroclastic material was supplied by volcanic ash falling out directly to the lake. Activity of nearby stratovolcanoes (eg. Hualca Hualca, Sabancaya, Ampato, Huarancante) and dwarf volcanoes of the Andahua Group during the existence of the lake is confirmed by intercalations of pumice, coarse volcanic debris and lava in the lacustrine sediments. The existence of the lakes between Pinchollo and Chivay can be related to the period of the Latest Pliocene Late Pleistocene. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The study aims to investigate the hydrochemistry and water quality of the area using graphical, multivariate, and Water Quality Index (WQI). The result shows that the order of the principal cation and anion distributions is Na+ > Ca2+ > K+ > Mg2+ and HCO3- > Cl- > SO42- > F- > NO3-, NH4+, respectively. The primary water type is Na-HCO3, which demonstrates the hydrolysis of sodium-rich silicate minerals and the evolution of groundwater. The WQI revealed that very poor water (34.2%) comprised most of the samples and was distributed throughout the study region. Following this, good water quality accounted for 21.05%, poor water quality also accounted for 21.05%, and excellent water quality represented 15.77% of the samples. The study's findings indicate that fluoride concentration, with an average value of 8.09 mg/l, is the main contributor to the region's poor drinking water quality. The problem with water quality worsens as it approaches the outlet of the catchment. In terms of irrigation water quality, the Sodium Absorption Ratio (SAR) demonstrates that surface water (Rivers) samples (average SAR value = 2.57) were very acceptable for irrigation to groundwater with an average SAR value of 22.4. The entire surface water sample's (rivers) sodium hazard vs. salinity hazard falls into category C1-S1, and both the electrical conductivity and sodium hazard index are quite low, making it appropriate for irrigation. The study findings will assist government agencies and water management authorities in safeguarding the local population against issues related to water quality.

J	Nie, XY; Xu, J; Ge, Y; Zhou, WY				Nie, Xiaoyan; Xu, Jia; Ge, Ying; Zhou, Wenyi			High spatio-temporal resolution dynamic water monitoring using multi-source Chinese Gaofen imagery: a case study in the Eastern Nile Basin	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												The East Nile Basin (ENB) is a major water source for several African countries, and the supply, distribution, and management of water resources in the basin are directly related to the survival and development of millions of people. However, most of the basin falls within arid or semi-arid regions, and the uneven distribution of water resources severely limits the development of the countries within the basin. Achieving accurate monitoring and effective management of water resources has become a critical issue for sustainable development in this region. A robust adaptive threshold method considering boundary optimization was proposed to accurately extract water body information from GF-1and GF-6 WFV imagery. The study analyzed the spatio-temporal dynamic changes of six key lakes in basin countries, including Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan from 2019 to 2024. The findings were as follows: (1) The proposed water extraction method effectively addressed the issue of uneven spectral index gradients, with an overall accuracy of over 97.67% and a Kappa value exceeding 95.24%. It was able to accurately and efficiently extract lakes in arid regions. (2) High spatiotemporal resolution monitoring revealed the variation patterns of the lakes. The interannual changes of Tana, Roseires, Merowe, and Nasser were not significant, with notable seasonal variations, the low-water-level period occurring in July and the high-water-level period in September or October. For GERD and Toshka, the interannual variation was large, with each increase occurring between July and October. (3) The variation in lake areas was primarily attributed to precipitation in the upstream Blue Nile, artificial water storage by dams, and other factors. Tana was mainly affected by precipitation, while GERD's changes were primarily related to precipitation and its own water storage, Roseires, Merowe, and Nasser, as artificial reservoirs, were influenced by their own water storage and the storage in upstream reservoirs, while Toshka's changes were related to overflow from Nasser's high water levels. The current research findings could provide scientific guidance for water resources assessment and management in the ENB.																				2296-6463				MAY 2	2025	13								1569178	10.3389/feart.2025.1569178	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2025.1569178													WOS:001488920600001
J	Vandervoort, DS				Vandervoort, DS			Stratigraphic response to saline lake-level fluctuations and the origin of cyclic nonmarine evaporite deposits: The Pleistocene Blanca Lila Formation, northwest Argentina	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Stratigraphic analysis of Pleistocene nonmarine bedded evaporites in northwest Argentina elucidates the effect that episodic saline lake expansion and contraction have on the stratigraphic completeness of units deposited and preserved in a continental saline environment, Stratigraphic successions in these rocks contain features that relate uniquely to fluctuations in saline lake level, Bounding the top of each succession is a surface with evidence for an abrupt increase in water depth, Because sediment accumulation and stratal preservation vary spatially as a function of lake level, the degree of stratigraphic completeness varies among locations. These results have implications for attempts to extract the record of continental climate change from saline lake strata. Bedded evaporites in these strata accumulated in a saline lake characterized by a marginal zone of gypsum and ulexite with elastic interbeds and an accumulation of halite in the saline lake center. Four internally conformable successions of genetically related lithofacies assemblages are recognized, Each succession consists of a basal sandstone that is the initial accumulation of the lake-level rise and lake highstand. Overlying this sandstone are cyclic evaporite and fine-grained elastic deposits of the lake-level fall. These units are modified by desiccation-related processes resulting from lake contraction and desiccation around the lake margins. Subsequent lake-level rise resulted in subaqueous mechanical erosion of clastics and dissolution of interbedded evaporites, In more basinward regions, dissolution of evaporites occurred prior to accumulation of lake highstand units, In the saline lake center, the lake never dried up entirely, and evidence for partial lake desiccation is equivocal.																			0016-7606					FEB	1997	109	2					210	224		10.1130/0016-7606(1997)109<0210:SRTSLL>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0016-7606(1997)109<0210:SRTSLL>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1997WK21900006

Long-term observations of deepwater renewal in Crater Lake, Oregon	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We examine observations of key limnological properties (primarily temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen), measured over a 14-year period in Crater Lake, Oregon, and discuss variability in the hypolimnion on time scales of days to a decade. During some years (e.g., 1994-1995), higher-than-average wintertime deep convection and ventilation led to the removal of significant amounts of heat and salt from the hypolimnion, while dissolved oxygen concentrations increase. In other years, such as the winter of 1996-1997, heat and salt concentrations increase throughout the year and dissolved oxygen levels drop, indicating conditions were dominated by the background geothermal inputs and dissolved oxygen consumption by bacteria (i.e., minimal deep convection). Over the entire 14 year period, no statistically significant trend was observed in the annual hypolimnetic heat and salt content. Measurements from several thermistors moored in the hypolimnion provide new insight into the time and space scales of the deep convection events. For some events, cool water intrusions are observed sequentially, from shallower depths to deeper depths, suggesting vertical mixing or advection from above. For other events, the cooling is observed first at the deepest sensors, suggesting a thin, cold water pulse that flows along the bottom and mixes more slowly upwards into the basin. In both cases, the source waters must originate from the epilimnion. Conditions during a strong ventilation year (1994-1995) and a weak ventilation year (1996-1997) were compared. The results suggest the major difference between these 2 years was the evolution of the stratification in the epilimnion during the first few weeks of reverse stratification such that thermobaric instabilities were easier to form during 1995-1997. Thus, the details of surface cooling and wind-driven mixing during the early stages of reverse stratification may determine the net amount of ventilation possible during a particular year.

J	Krevs, A; Kucinskiene, A				Krevs, Alina; Kucinskiene, Ale			Microbial decomposition of sedimentary organic matter in small temperate lakes	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Human activity in the catchment and along the shoreline of lakes has a diverse impact on their water ecosystem. One little explored consequence of human activities is the impact on the benthic zone of lakes. To evaluate the impact of different pressures of human activity on the benthic bacterial abundance and community activity, we performed physicochemical and microbiological investigations in the bottom sediments of two groups of small lakes with a similar mean depth, situated in the vicinity of Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. Four of the lakes are situated on the territories protected by the state and also used for recreation, and the other four are located in an urban landscape. The content of organic carbon (OC) in the bottom sediments did not differ significantly between the recreational and urban lakes of medium depth, with the exception of a shallow, naturally-aging recreational lake, where the highest concentration of sedimentary OC accumulates. Bacterial numbers did not respond to the sedimentary content of OC. The highest microbial densities and benthic community respiratory activity (expressed as the rate of OC mineralization) occurred in the lakes situated in an urban landscape. In the urban lakes, anaerobic processes prevailed in the OC mineralization. In the sediments of these lakes, the most intensive sulfate reduction and the highest contents of hydrogen sulfide were also determined. In late summer, during intensive sedimentary OC mineralization, from 18 to 71 mg OC m(2) d(-1) was mineralized via sulfate reduction in the recreational and urban lakes, respectively. Our research shows that, in urban lakes, the mineralization of sedimentary organic matter with a predominance of anaerobic processes proceeds more intensively than in recreational lakes, and that it can potentially stimulate internal eutrophication in small and shallow lakes with growing urban areas located in their catchments.																			1863-9135					JUN	2018	191	3					239	251		10.1127/fal/2018/1093	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/fal/2018/1093													WOS:000437048300006
J	GELHAR, LW; WELTY, C; REHFELDT, KR				GELHAR, LW; WELTY, C; REHFELDT, KR			A CRITICAL-REVIEW OF DATA ON FIELD-SCALE DISPERSION IN AQUIFERS	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												A critical review of dispersivity observations from 59 different field sites was developed by compiling extensive tabulations of information on aquifer type, hydraulic properties, flow configuration, type of monitoring network, tracer, method of data interpretation, overall scale of observation and longitudinal, horizontal transverse and vertical transverse dispersivities from original sources. This information was then used to classify the dispersivity data into three reliability classes. Overall, the data indicate a trend of systematic increase of the longitudinal dispersivity with observation scale but the trend is much less clear when the reliability of the data is considered. The longitudinal dispersivities ranged from 10(-2) to 10(4) m for scales ranging from 10(-1) to 10(5) m, but the largest scale for high reliability data was only 250 m. When the data are classified according to porous versus fractured media there does not appear to be any significant difference between these aquifer types. At a given scale, the longitudinal dispersivity values are found to range over 2-3 orders of magnitude and the higher reliability data tend to fall in the lower portion of this range. It is not appropriate to represent the longitudinal dispersivity data by a single universal line. The variations in dispersivity reflect the influence of differing degrees of aquifer heterogeneity at different sites. The data on transverse dispersivities are more limited but clearly indicate that vertical transverse dispersivities are typically an order of magnitude smaller than horizontal transverse dispersivities. Reanalyses of data from several of the field sites show that improved interpretations most often lead to smaller dispersivities. Overall, it is concluded that longitudinal dispersivities in the lower part of the indicated range are more likely to be realistic for field applications.

Phylogenomics and biogeography of arid-adapted Chlamydogobius goby fishes	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION												The progressive aridification of the Australian continent from similar to 20 million years ago posed severe challenges for the persistence of its resident biota. A key question involves the role of refugial habitats - specifically, their ability to mediate the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation, and their potential to shape opportunities for allopatric speciation. With freshwater species, for example, the patchiness, or absence, of water will constrain distributions. However, aridity may not necessarily isolate populations if disjunct refugia experience frequent hydrological connections. To investigate this potential dichotomy, we explored the evolutionary history of the Chlamydogobius gobies (Gobiiformes: Gobiidae), an arid-adapted genus of six small, benthic fish species that exploit all types of waterbodies (i.e. desert springs, waterholes and bore-fed wetlands, coastal estuarine creeks and mangroves) across parts of central and northern Australia. We used Anchored Phylogenomics to generate a highly resolved phylogeny of the group from sequence data for 260 nuclear loci. Buttressed by companion allozyme and mtDNA datasets, our molecular findings infer the diversification of Chlamydogobius in arid Australia, and provide a phylogenetic structure that cannot be simply explained by invoking allopatric speciation events reflecting current geographic proximity. Our findings are generally consistent with the existing morphological delimitation of species, with one exception: at the shallowest nodes of phylogenetic reconstruction, the molecular data do not fully support the current dichotomous delineation of C. japalpa from C. eremius in Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre-associated waterbodies. Together these findings illustrate the ability of structural (hydrological) connections to generate patterns of connectivity and isolation for an ecologically moderate disperser in response to ongoing habitat aridification.

We quantified losses of stocked, age-0 striped bass to predation by largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides in Smith Mountain Lake, Virginia, where first-year striped bass survival averages 25% and the largemouth bass is the principal littoral piscivore. To examine their diet composition and abundance, largemouth bass were sampled throughout the month following the stocking of striped bass in two coves in 1994 and one cove in 1995. We used a bioenergetics model to extrapolate total prey consumption over the month and the numerical contribution of striped bass to the largemouth bass diet. Only 14 striped bass were recovered in 1, 147 largemouth bass stomachs over the 2 years. Percentage losses of striped bass to largemouth bass predation were 0.1% in each cove in 1994 and 3.0% in the single cove in 1995. Predation may have been constrained by the small size (24-74 mm) of striped bass and by the availability of spawning alewives Alosa pseudoharengus as alternate prey (i.e., adult alewives constituted the bulk of the largemouth bass summer diet). In pool experiments, largemouth bass ate significantly more alewives than striped bass when both prey were available; their consumption of striped bass increased in trials where alewives were absent. Abundance of alternate prey and their use by largemouth bass should be assessed before selecting striped bass stocking sites. Spreading the stocking over multiple sites to reduce predation mortality was unnecessary in Smith Mountain Lake.

Potential for release of sediment phosphorus to Lake Powell (Utah and Arizona) due to sediment resuspension during low water level	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Wildman RA, Hering JG. 2011. Potential for release of sediment phosphorus to Lake Powell (Utah and Arizona) due to sediment resuspension during low water level. Lake Reserv Manage. 27:365-375. The water level in Lake Powell, an important water-supply reservoir on the Colorado River, United States, decreased in most years from 1999 to 2010, exposing the sediment delta in the inflowregion of this reservoir. This study assesses the potential for sediment-associated phosphorus (P) to enter the water column during sediment resuspension. We collected sediment samples from the reservoir inflow region and performed a sequential extraction and a sorption experiment that focused on P. We also collected water samples at locations upstream and downstream of the exposed sediment delta and measured soluble reactive P during base flow and during the yearly flood associated with spring runoff. Results indicate that extractable P is associated with various operationally defined fractions as follows: 50% with calcite and biogenic apatite, 29% with detrital apatite, 10% with Fe(III)-oxide minerals, 6% with organic matter and 4% with easily exchangeable solid-phase association sites. Sorption experiments indicate that the equilibrium P concentration is 0.19 +/- 0.07 mu M. Particle size is correlated with sediment P; coarse sediment contains and sorbs much less extractable P than fine sediment does. Measurements of water samples indicate that sediment resuspension probably releases P from sediment to overlying water during base flow, but the effect during floods is less clear. These results indicate that lowering reservoir levels introduces sediment-associated P to the reservoir when sediment resuspension occurs. [Supplemental materials are available for this article.

J	Effler, SW; Matthews, DA; Perkins, M; Johnson, DL				Effler, SW; Matthews, DA; Perkins, M; Johnson, DL			Patterns and impacts of inorganic tripton in Cayuga Lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Inorganic tripton in the upper waters of Cayuga Lake, NY, is characterized, quantified and contrasted for shallow (<6 m) and deep (>100 m) water regions based on analyses with scanning electron microscopy equipped with automated image analysis and X-ray energy spectroscopy (SAX) of samples collected in 1999 and 2000. The impacts of this material on water clarity and the phosphorus ( P) pool are evaluated based on paired measurements of turbidity (T-n), Secchi disc transparency (SD), chlorophyll, and four fractions of particulate P (PP) determined according to selective extraction protocols. The major components of inorganic tripton in the lake are reported to be clay minerals and quartz, received from the watershed, and calcium carbonate (CaCO3), that is produced internally. Clay minerals are the dominant component in a shallow region that receives tributary inflows. CaCO3, precipitated during a mid-summer whiting event, is reported to be the dominant component of inorganic tripton for the deep water region for a low runoff year, while clays can become dominant in these areas after prolonged intervals of high runoff. It is demonstrated that inorganic tripton, rather than phytoplankton, is the primary regulator of T-n and SD, it represents most of the PP, and is primarily responsible for the higher T-n, lower SD, and higher TP in the shallow area compared to the deep water region. Efforts to improve clarity in this shallow region of the lake should consider the feasibility of controlling the input of terrigenous suspensoids rather than reductions in P loading.

The effect of soil hydrological conditions on the growth of natural and artificially planted Oak (Quercus robur L.) stands on the floodplain of the Ural River in its middle reaches	EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE												The flood regime in the middle course of the Ural River has been studied on the basis of data obtained at hydrological stations from 1912 to 1990. Its effect on the growth and productivity of oak stands on different elements of the floodplain is discussed. The particle-size distribution and the reserves of physical clay, clay, humus, and available potassium and phosphorus under natural (three plots) and artificially planted (three plots) oak stands have been determined. It is proved that natural oak stands are allocated to levees with considerable content of physical clay (< 0.01 mm) in the soil profile, which provides penetration of the tree roots to a depth of 6 m and more, down to the ground-water level during the summer low-water period. The role of water infiltration into the banks in the periods of low floods is shown to affect the ground-water level at a distance of up to 700 m from the river bed. The artificial cultivation of oak stands on the floodplain requires the proper selection of particular ecological niches. The successful growth of artificially planted oak stands is only possible near the lakes within the central floodplain. Problems of the expansion of oak stands onto the high elements of the central floodplain, the replacement of oak by other tree species, the natural regrowth of oak trees, and the shift of their southern boundary onto the floodplain in the lower course of the Ural River are discussed.																			1064-2293					APR	2006	39	4					410	422		10.1134/S1064229306040089	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1064229306040089													WOS:000245173600008
J	PREPAS, EE; RIGLER, FH				PREPAS, EE; RIGLER, FH			IMPROVEMENTS IN QUANTIFYING THE PHOSPHORUS CONCENTRATION IN LAKE WATER	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Vertical and horizontal patterns in limnetic P concentrations ([P]) were detected in an oligotrophic lake by dividing the total P pool into 2 fractions: dissolved and particulate matter smaller than 250 .mu.m (smaller fraction) and particulate matter larger than 250 .mu.m (larger fraction). The smaller fraction was estimated from samples collected with a water bottle, and the larger fraction was estimated with tow net samples taken at several stations and to various depths. Samples were digested with potassium persulfate which gave less variable results than other acid digestion techniques. The average variance associated with the mean [P] (n = 3) for samples collected and analyzed was < 0.05 mg P/m3. During summer stratification there was a consistent metalimnetic maximum in the smaller fraction, and there were small but significant differences in the concentrations found at 2 stations < 1 km apart. During the same period the larger fraction was a significant portion (14-28%) of the P pool in the epilimnion which varied from 3-5 m in depth. It was a relatively constant portion of the P in the trophogenic zone (0-10 m) and in the 0-20-m portion of the water column, i.e., 10-14% and 7.3-8.8%, respectively. In a separate experiment by removing from 1.0 to 2.4 .times. 10-2 mg/m3. This reduction occurred because the larger fraction contained zooplankters with relatively high but variable amounts of P and which occur in densities too low to be adequately sampled with the smaller fraction.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1982	39	6					822	829		10.1139/f82-112	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f82-112													WOS:A1982NV44200003

In 2008, DNA stock identification showed that these juveniles were from the Harrison River, a population with a sea-type life history in which juveniles enter the ocean during the year of emergence from the gravel. Using information collected in 1998-2010, we describe the early ocean life and production of Harrison River sea-type Sockeye Salmon. Juveniles entered the Strait of Georgia from the Fraser River over an extended period, with most entering after mid-July-about 8 weeks later than lake-type juveniles, which had virtually all left the strait by that time. The September diets of sea-type juveniles were highly selective for hyperiid amphipods, which were not abundant in the zooplankton. Interaction with juvenile Pink Salmon O. gorbuscha during this early marine period was identified as potentially affecting the age structure of returning adults. Juvenile Sockeye Salmon remained in the strait until the fall and then moved offshore, where they remained until returning as age-3 or age-4 adults. There was a strong positive relationship between the September CPUE of juveniles in the Strait of Georgia and the total adult return of Harrison River Sockeye Salmon, indicating that total production in recent years was likely related to conditions in the strait. From 2005 to 2011, Harrison River Sockeye Salmon production exhibited a large increase in comparison with the total production of Sockeye Salmon in the Fraser River system. This recent increase in production of late-ocean-entering juveniles with a sea-type life history identifies the importance of managing for biodiversity of Sockeye Salmon populations within the Fraser River drainage.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					2016	145	2					348	362		10.1080/00028487.2015.1123182	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2015.1123182													WOS:000374323600012

They constitute 30% of the country's production and are mainly used in the ceramic whiteware industry. The deposits belong to the Baquero Formation (Lower Cretaceous) and unconfomably overlie either the ash-flow tuffs of the Chon-Aike Formation (Middle Jurassic), which are altered to kaolinite and minor illite, or the ash-fall tuffs of Bajo Grande Formation (Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous), which are altered mainly to smectites. The presence of illite or smectite, as well as the kaolinite crystallinity, depends on the stratigraphic position of the kaolin horizons within the Lower Member of the Baquero Formation and on the lithology of the underlying rocks. Kaolin beds composed of well-crystallized kaolinite at the base of the sequence overlying Chon-Aike rocks are the purest. Kaolinite becomes less well cystallized with transport. Edge-to-face and swirl SEM textural patterns indicate the compaction of flocculated clays and clay movement during drainage and compaction. Mineralogical, petrological, and physico-structural evidence (i.e., form, extent, thickness) indicates that the kaolin deposits are sedimentary, formed by the transportation and deposition of previously formed kaolinite. Kaolin beds are ovoidal in plan and lenticular in profile, with thickness ranging from centimeters to 11 meters, and are the culmination of fining-upward clastic sequences. Sedimentary facies analysis indicates that the kaolin deposits were formed in a fluvial environment from currents with a high suspended-load/bed-load ratio, as would result from deposition in ox-bow lakes.																			0895-9811					NOV	1992	6	4					223	235		10.1016/0895-9811(92)90043-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0895-9811(92)90043-X													WOS:A1992MQ57600001

During the summer of 1991, mass incidence of death among eels was observed in the lake Balaton without the affection of other fish species. During the pathological investigation of dead, as well as by electric fishing caught eels, pathological changes of the swim-bladder dominated (Table 1, Figs 4 and 5). At the early stage of the mass incidence of deaths, 30 to 40 nematodes were found in the swim-bladder that represented a manifold value, as compared to those found in the European lakes. A brown-red fluid was observed in the lumen of swim-bladder in case of the death of worms. When parasites were not found in the affected swim-bladder, its wall was enlarged, the lumen was narrowed and partly became atelectasic. The gross- and histopathological examinations revealed foci with life and dead larvae in the wall of swim-bladder and intestines (Figs 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10). The generally pale livers showed degeneration and necrosis of hepatocytes. indicating a toxic effect (Fig. 11). The pathological, histological, bacteriological, toxicological and virological investigation, except for the parasitic infestation and a secondary bacterial infection, excluded all the other etiological factors. Unusual concentration of parasites and their intermediate hosts (fresh-water crustacean) was promoted by the environmental factors.																			0025-004X					JAN	1993	48	1					11	21																WOS:A1993KN49000002
J	PAYETTE, S; FILION, L				PAYETTE, S; FILION, L			HOLOCENE WATER-LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS OF A SUB-ARCTIC LAKE AT THE TREE LINE IN NORTHERN QUEBEC	BOREAS												Water-level changes of a small subarctic lake, located near the tree line in northern Quebec, were inferred from stratigraphic analysis of buried peat and minerogenic sediments deposited over the last 6000 C-14 years, i.e. the time lapse since the final withdrawal of the postglacial Tyrrell Sea waters. Two major periods of water-level fluctuations were recorded: a generally low level of the lake from 5400-5300 BP to 3600-3500 BP and a predominantly high water level from 3500 BP to present. The most important lowering occurred between 4600 and 4100 BP, when the water level was at least 60-100 cm lower than present. Three brief lowerings also occurred around 2600-2400, 2100-2000 and 1300 BP. An important lowering at 300-250 BP coincided with the Little Ice Age period. At that time the lake level was at least 45-50 cm lower than present, and this facilitated tree growth in the shore zone. The generally low lake level before 3500 BP was probably caused by dry and warm conditions (with high evaporation), whereas the 300-250 BP lowering was most likely due to a decrease in the annual snow fall. The formation of permafrost mounds in the shore zone after 2100-2000 BP was associated with a lower lake level. The absence of any pedogenic development in sandy deposits at the top of the mounds suggests a rather recent origin, possibly during the Little Ice Age. The overall chronology of predominantly high and low water levels is partly similar to that of other lakes from temperate North America and northern Europe.																			0300-9483					MAR	1993	22	1					7	14		10.1111/j.1502-3885.1993.tb00159.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1502-3885.1993.tb00159.x													WOS:A1993KW54100002

Megan			Challenges and successes of using Two-Eyed Seeing to teach Indigenous science at a predominantly white institution	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Two-Eyed Seeing, or Etuaptmumk (in Mi'kmaw), is an approach to learning and science that braids both Indigenous and Western knowledges and ways of knowing. This approach has many benefits including a better understanding of the world and greater effectiveness at addressing large problems. In fall 2021, we used Two-Eyed Seeing to teach science at a predominantly white institution in Michigan (USA). In an online setting, participants learned from six Indigenous experts on topics ranging from the Odawa Nation's connections to water to Indigenous education, and chemistry. The course was challenging to design and implement because of the Western/colonial structure of the institution, higher education, and Western science. Funding was both necessary for course design and constrained, as applications required speakers to have credentials commensurate with Western scientists, curriculum vitae, and advanced approval. Navigating Indigenous spaces brought challenges in building relationships, trust, and respect. Regardless of these constraints, this course proved to be highly successful. We received tremendous support from university administrators that were willing to fund this course. Additional faculty (both Indigenous and non-Indigenous) contributed to grant writing and course design, and the course was populated to capacity approximately-one month after its listing by both Indigenous and non-Indigenous students. The course invested heavily in reciprocity and relationship building with Indigenous experts; and, after its completion, the course fueled future collaborations among faculty/staff, students, and Indigenous scientists. This course demonstrates the potential for relationship building and incorporation of Indigenous expertise in higher education. (c) 2023 The Authors.

The research works (2004-2015) included bathymetry, hydrological regime, water and sediment quality, and hydrobiological analyses. Due to the connection with the river, the hydrological regime was significantly determined by the Elbe River. Spatial electrical conductivity differences were found. Values of pH fluctuated (lower ANC(4.5)) during the year rising with phytoplankton development. Associated parameter of organic matter content (mean CODMn = 5.5 mg L-1) was similar to that in the river. The Elbe represented a source of nitrogen (max. N-NO3 = 5.9 mg L-1) and phosphorus for the lake, where the phosphorus concentrations reached maximum levels in summer (max. TP = 0.220 mg L-1) under low oxygen saturation. The concentrations of Cd, As, Hg, and Pb in sediments exceeded the upper limit values set in the new assessment system developed by the International Commission for the Protection of the Elbe River, and together with a high index of geoaccumulation in the case of Ag, the concentrations of these elements indicate significant contamination. Although the lake was not extremely polluted, high concentrations of nutrients and sediment load could represent a risk for aquatic ecosystems. The comparison of the results with other studies on oxbow lakes situated in different river basins provided new and complex conclusions in a broader context.					; Janský, Bohumír/R-4548-2017; Chuman, Tomas/H-7870-2014; Chalupová, Dagmar/A-2416-2017	Chuman, Tomas/0000-0003-2525-5379; 													1866-6280	1866-6299				SEP	2019	78	18							559	10.1007/s12665-019-8566-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-019-8566-8													WOS:000484942300001

Even when aimed at community empowerment, a lack of historical awareness can lead to underappreciation of the institutional, economic, and socioecological contexts that resource users navigate. In this article, we explore the history of fisheries management in Lake Malawi through comparative investigation of two enduring management regimes that developed in the mid-twentieth century: centralised fisheries management and the chief-led regime at Mbenji Island. We argue that the long-term successes of Mbenji Island fisheries in comparison to under-resourced and patchy governmental management has resulted from targeted technical regulations combined with robust leadership, proactive enforcement, sustained ecological and economic benefits, transparent processes, and embeddedness in existing institutions and beliefs. Yet, this regime has not existed in isolation from centralised management but, instead, has been directly and indirectly impacted by it. Pairing comparative historical analysis with analysis of fish specimens and water quality, we consider the underlying principles, long-term outcomes, and entanglements of these two regimes. Such an approach offers important insights into questions of governance legitimacy, the feedback between management regimes, and the role of science within management. Ultimately, the findings reported in this paper agree with recent surveys emphasising the need to focus on processes centred on participation and capacity building rather than set ecological outcomes within small-scale fisheries management. However, we argue that this requires deep historical awareness and reflection that is too often neglected.

The results showed that: 1) Water depth had no significant effect on the germination of both submerged macrophytes. The final germination rate of P. crispus turions was higher than 80%, and the final germination rate of the H. verticillata winter buds was 100%; 2) Water depth affected the survival rate of both submerged macrophytes, and the seedlings at depths of 150, 175 and 200 cm all eventually died; 3) Water depth altered the morphological characteristics of P. crispus and H. verticillata seedlings. (4) Increasing water depth significantly affected biomass (p < .05), with the biomass initially tending to increase, but then decreasing. The root to shoot ratio of both submerged macrophytes decreased with increasing water depth; 5) Chlorophyll contents of P. crispus and H. verticillata increased with water depth from 25 to 150 cm; 6) Water depth had an obvious effect on the photosynthetic fluorescence of submerged macrophytes. The Fv/Fm increased slightly from water depths from 25 to 75 cm, and then decreased significantly when water depth exceeded 100 cm. The ETRmax was significantly different among all treatment groups, and ETRmax was obviously higher at water depths of 25 and 50 cm than at all other depths. These results showed that submerged macrophytes have a limited water depth tolerance range. In Lake Gehu, the recovery of submerged macrophytes will be better in areas with water depths less than 125 cm.

Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners were analysed in all materials. Interpretative parameters, like salinity and suspended particulate matter concentration, organic carbon, Al and Si were also determined. Low levels of PUB in sediments are in conformity with the absence of industrial activities in the drainage basin. Both coarser material and fresh surface sediments transported by the flood contained slightly higher PCB concentrations (0.8-1.8 ng g(-1)) than surface sediments (0.1 - 1.1 ng g(-1)). Furthermore, PCB concentrations were higher in suspended particulate matter transported by moderate river flows (October), particularly of upstream limit of salinity (0.4 to 30.1 ng g(-1)) than in May (0.8 and 8.2 ng g(-1)). Alterations were also recorded in PCB composition. Less chlorinated compounds (higher ratio between tri + tetra-CB and hexa-CB) were enriched in coarser and fresh surface sediments, as well as in a sediment layer of the core taken outside the estuary. This ratio increased also in suspended particulate matter of the upstream limit of salinity collected in October. Changes of PCB concentrations and proportions of congeners evidence the importance of storm water runoff to the PCB input into this low-contaminated estuarine system. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

This type of convection typically occurs in spring, when melting snow on the ice cover enables solar radiation to penetrate into the water body. The diurnal dynamics of the stratification system of five distinct layers is analyzed by means of consecutive CTD profiles and with the aid of a one-dimensional model. The model solves the transfer equation of heat and salinity and includes convective procedures to react on density instabilities. This study is focused on the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) balance. The stratification analysis reveals the importance of several processes for the TKE balance, namely: (1) the entrainment into the top layer from the convective layer below, (2) the inflow of water from melted ice, and (3) the volumetric solar heating. Enabled by the analysis of the temperature microstructure profiles, two TKE budgets are presented. The temporally averaged budget reveals a vertical distribution of generation and dissipation rate similar to the case of cooling-induced convection in a surface boundary layer. But contrary to this reference regime, a transition layer was found in the upper convective layer, where both rates drop back to zero toward the layer above. The second TKE budget is spatially averaged over the convective layer but resolves the diurnal dynamics. The generation rate and dissipation rate feature similar diurnal dynamics, where the dissipation lags on average by 1.5 hours. The temporal change rate of TKE was found to be on the same order of magnitude as the generation rate and the dissipation rate, while the export rate of TKE out of the convective layer was found to be less significant.

Stratigraphy, paleomagnetism, and anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility of the Miocene Stanislaus Group, central Sierra Nevada and Sweetwater Mountains, California and Nevada	GEOSPHERE												Paleomagnetism and anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) reveal pyroclastic flow patterns, stratigraphic correlations, and tectonic rotations in the Miocene Stanislaus Group, an extensive volcanic sequence in the central Sierra Nevada, California, and in the Walker Lane of California and Nevada. The Stanislaus Group (Table Mountain Latite, Eureka Valley Tuff, and the Dardanelles Formation) is a useful stratigraphic marker for understanding the post-9-Ma major faulting of the easternmost Sierra Nevada, uplift of the mountain range, and transtensional tectonics within the central Walker Lane. The Table Mountain Latite has a distinctively shallow reversed-polarity direction (I = -26.1 degrees, D = 163.1 degrees, and alpha(95) = 2.7 degrees) at sampling sites in the foothills and western slope of the Sierra Nevada. In ascending order, the Eureka Valley Tuff comprises the Tollhouse Flat Member (I = -62.8 degrees, D = 159.9 degrees, alpha(95) = 2.6 degrees), By-Day Member ( I = 52.4 degrees, D = 8.6 degrees, alpha(95) = 7.2 degrees), and Upper Member (I = 27.9 degrees, D = 358.0 degrees, alpha(95) = 10.4 degrees). The Dardanelles Formation has normal polarity. From the magnetization directions of the Eureka Valley Tuff in the central Walker Lane north of Mono Lake and in the Anchorite Hills, we infer clockwise, vertical-axis rotations of similar to 10 degrees to 26 degrees to be a consequence of dextral shear. The AMS results from 19 sites generally show that the Eureka Valley Tuff flowed outward from its proposed source area, the Little Walker Caldera, although several indicators are transverse to radial flow. AMS-derived flow patterns are consistent with mapped channels in the Sierra Nevada and Walker Lane.

We have found them in the benthic zone of 4 deep lakes, Bosque Azul, Dos Lagos, Ensueno, and Tziscao of Lagunas de Montebello National Park in Chiapas. We recovered 43 specimens belonging to 13 species from the samples, all of which except Americabrya arida were first records for the state of Chiapas; the most abundant were A. arida and Lepidocyrtus lanuginosus. Species richness of each lake varied between 1 and 12; density varied between 15 +/- 25 and 133 +/- 118 org m(-2), and biomass varied between 0.02 and 4.3 +/- 4.4 and 0.02 mu g m(-2). Tziscao showed the highest abundance (35 individuals), species richness (12 species), and density (133 +/- 118 org m(-2)), and Bosque Azul showed the highest average biomass (4.3 +/- 4.4 mu g). Together, 96% of the organisms were collected during summer when lakes were thermally stratified (warm monomixis); 44% of the organisms were recovered from deep anoxic samples (> 20 m). Springtails were found living in warm waters in conditions varying from well oxygenated to anoxic, a slightly basic pH range (7.1-8.3), and a high range of electric conductivity (219.7-1716.0 mu S cm(-1)) values. Sediments were mainly composed of sands and mud (silt and clay) with a wide organic matter range (15.4-51.2%) and sedimentary carbonates (6.0-98.3%). Of the 43 specimens, 17 were adults (12 males and 5 females) and 26 were immature, both with gut content composed mostly of Cladosporium hyphae and conidia. These are the first records of submerged Collembola inhabiting the deep benthic zones of Mexican lakes.					; Alcocer, Javier/S-7672-2019	Alcocer, Javier/0000-0002-0535-7936; 													2044-2041	2044-205X					2018	8	3					264	272		10.1080/20442041.2018.1439863	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2018.1439863													WOS:000456214100002
J	Ma, L; Spalding, RF				Ma, L; Spalding, RF			Herbicide persistence and mobility in Recharge Lake watershed in York, Nebraska	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Elevated levels of herbicides in surface and groundwater are a concern in the cornbelt in the USA. This study was conducted to interpret the herbicide behavior in a watershed system using data collected from runoff, Recharge Lake, and groundwater influenced by agriculture and lake seepage. The York Ground Water Recharge Project was constructed on a tributary of Beaver Creek, which drains a 3327-ha watershed of primarily row-cropped heavily irrigated farmland. The estimated average runoff is 1.48 x 10(6) m(3) yr(-1) under a precipitation norm of 635 mm yr(-1). Maximum atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine) inputs to Recharge Lake occurred in May and June runoff events and resulted in average lake concentrations of 36 and 17 mu g L(-1) in 1993 and 1994, respectively. Only about 0.28 and 0.19% of total applied atrazine was lost to runoff in 1993 and 1994, respectively. The deethylatrazine (DEA) to atrazine molar ratio (DAR) decreased rapidly over a period of several hours in runoff samples, which is consistent with inputs from recently atrazine-treated soil. After the spring runoff, herbicide levels in Recharge Lake rose rapidly in response to the runoff event, then diminished gradually over a period of months. Atrazine concentrations in Recharge Lake decreased exponentially with time. Degradation half-lives were 237 d (r = 0.93) in 1993 and 209 d (r = 0.91) in 1994. Adjusted DEA concentrations in Recharge Lake remained relatively constant, indicating little evidence for biotic degradation and suggesting that abiotic degradation of atrazine to hydroxyatrazine (2-hydroxy-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine) was the most likely major degradative pathway in Recharge Lake.																			0047-2425	1537-2537				JAN-FEB	1997	26	1					115	125		10.2134/jeq1997.00472425002600010018x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1997.00472425002600010018x													WOS:A1997WE44200028

Modeling the Dynamics of Supraglacial Rivers and Distributed Meltwater Flow With the Subaerial Drainage System (SaDS) Model	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												Meltwater produced at the surface of glaciers and ice sheets has important implications for basal sliding rates and therefore ice flow velocities. In order to determine the role of supraglacial water in ice dynamics and predict future changes, we first need to understand and be able to accurately predict moulin input rates. To this end, we present the Subaerial Drainage System (SaDS) model. SaDS is a dynamic model that couples supraglacial runoff in the bare-ice ablation zone in a distributed sheet with flow in discrete channels. Flow in the distributed sheet drives melt through potential energy dissipation, allowing a channel network to form naturally with no prior assumptions about channel locations. We apply the model to a synthetic ice sheet margin and carry out a suite of sensitivity tests. Modeled moulin inputs show expected behaviors including large diurnal variability, multi-hour lags following peak surface melt, and demonstrate complex and diverse seasonal dynamics. The sensitivity tests illustrate the range of possible model behaviors and constrain the parameter values for which the model predicts physically realistic moulin inputs. We also apply the model to a similar to 20 x 27 km(2) catchment on the southwestern Greenland Ice Sheet using RACMO melt forcing and previously mapped moulin locations. Modeled supraglacial lake and stream locations match those mapped from Landsat 8 images, and moulin inputs show varied daily and seasonal dynamics. These results demonstrate that the model is a promising tool to provide moulin inputs for subglacial and ice dynamic studies. Plain Language Summary Throughout the summer, the surface of glaciers is covered by a network of rivers and lakes. These rivers often drain through moulins (vertical shafts from the surface to the base of the ice that let water drain through the glacier). The rate of water flow through these moulins can change the speed at which glaciers flow since water can pool underneath the glacier, allowing the glacier to slide against the bedrock. This is important because changes to glacier flow speeds can impact the rate of sea level rise. In this study we introduce a new tool, called the Subaerial Drainage System (SaDS) model, that simulates flow through glacial surface rivers and lakes in order to calculate water input into moulins. We show that SaDS more accurately represents changes in flow into moulins caused by rivers drying up or expanding than previous simulations. SaDS is a significant step forward for making realistic predictions of moulin inputs, which will be key for determining how the world's ice sheets and glaciers change as the climate continues to warm. Key Points SaDS dynamically models supraglacial water flow in a distributed sheet and in supraglacial channels Modeled moulin inputs show complex and heterogeneous seasonal dynamics Predicted supraglacial lake and river locations agree with mapping on the Greenland Ice Sheet						Hill, Tim/0000-0002-3538-7060; Dow, Christine/0000-0003-1346-2258													2169-9003	2169-9011				DEC	2021	126	12							e2021JF006309	10.1029/2021JF006309	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JF006309													WOS:000757163400010

The Young Everest Study: effects of hypoxia at high altitude on cardiorespiratory function and general well-being in healthy children	ARCHIVES OF DISEASE IN CHILDHOOD												Objectives: To assess the effect of altitude and acclimatisation on cardiorespiratory function and wellbeing in healthy children. Methods: A daily symptom diary, serial measurements of spirometry, end-tidal carbon dioxide (etCO(2)) and daytime and overnight pulse oximetry (SpO(2)), were undertaken at sea level and altitudes up to 3500 m in healthy children during a trekking holiday. SpO(2) at altitude was compared with that in flight and during acute hypoxic challenge (breathing 15% oxygen) at sea level. Results: Measurements were obtained in nine children aged 6-13 years (median 8). SpO(2) decreased significantly during the hypoxic challenge (difference -5%, 95% CI -6 to -3%, p<0.01) but remained above 90% in all children. There was a significant fall in daytime and overnight SpO(2) (95% CI - 11.9 to -7.5% and -12 to -8, respectively) and etCO(2) (-8.5 to -4.5 mm Hg) as the children ascended to 3500 m. There was a significant increase in SpO(2) (95% CI 1.1 to 4.9%) and a further drop in etCO(2) (-5.9 to -0.8 mm Hg) after a week at altitude, etCO(2) being negatively correlated with SpO(2). There was no correlation between SpO(2) during hypoxic challenge, in flight or at altitude. Lung function remained within 7% of baseline in all but two children, in whom reductions of up to 23% in FVC and 16% FEV1 were observed at altitude. The children generally remained well, but the Lake Louise scoring system was unreliable in this age group. Conclusions: A wide range of physiological responses to altitude are evident in healthy children. This study should inform future larger studies in children to improve understanding of responses to hypoxia in health and disease.

Holocene climate change influences on trace metal and organic matter geochemistry in the sediments of an Arctic lake over 7,000 years	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												This study employed a 6.48 m long dated sediment core to characterize the amount of variation in background trace metal concentrations, and develop an understanding of the role of climatic influences on sediment inorganic and organic geochemistry in a High Arctic lake over similar to 7000 years of the Holocene. Element geochemistry reflected varying detrital contributions from two geological sources within the catchment: carbonates (dolomites and limestones) which provided the dominant major element by weight (i.e., Ca), and carbonaceous mudrocks (primarily shales) which may have contributed most of the other trace and minor elements. The presence of eroded shale-hosted organic matter (OM) in sediments was confirmed by reflectance measurements on reworked vitrinitic macerals which had similar values to Palaeozoic carbonaceous rocks in the watershed. Bimodal distribution of the reflectance data suggested that two sources of vitrinitic macerals were present, from different formations. Variable dilution of shale-sourced elements by carbonates, related to climate (temperature)-influenced rates of dissolution and erosion, was the dominant process controlling inorganic geochemical composition. RockEval pyrolysis of bulk sediment OM revealed the unusual finding of two distinct sources of sediment kerogen which alternated in importance during the Holocene: a "baseline" state of eroded shale-hosted OM which was probably always present but which dominated sediment OM when autochthonous (algal) production was minimal, and an "enhanced algal state" which dominated when limnological conditions favored higher autochthonous productivity. Periods with more frequent examples of the enhanced algal state occurred during the mid- and late-Holocene, coincident with periods of relatively high summer air temperatures in the region. This study provides evidence that climate, particularly air temperature, influenced sediment inorganic and organic geochemical compositions in this lake through its effect on catchment geology erosion rates and aquatic primary productivity. It shows the value of studying very long periods of sediment accumulation as a background context for recent sediment metal concentrations. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Süfke, F; Gutjahr, M; Gilli, A; Anselmetti, FS; Glur, L; Eisenhauer, A				Suefke, Finn; Gutjahr, Marcus; Gilli, Adrian; Anselmetti, Flavio S.; Glur, Lukas; Eisenhauer, Anton			Early stage weathering systematics of Pb and Nd isotopes derived from a high-Alpine Holocene lake sediment record	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Radiogenic Pb and Nd isotopes are well established tools in paleoceanographic science tracing ambient climate and continental runoff to the oceans down to sub-millennial timescales. Particularly in case of Pb isotopes, a clear climate dependency of continental isotopic runoff on glacial-interglacial transitions has been observed. Pb isotopes were reported to be released incongruently during initial chemical weathering. This incongruent release implies that Pb isotopic runoff compositions differ from the bulk catchment Pb isotopic signal. Yet only little is known about the processes leading to the incongruent release and the timescales of weathering on the continents. In this study we targeted the adsorbed trace metal signature in sediments from a Swiss high-Alpine lake that have accumulated since the retreat of the large Alpine ice domes during the last deglaciation to investigate initial Pb and Nd isotope weathering processes in a granitic environment. Additionally, selected adsorbed element concentrations and ratios were analysed to complement the isotopic physico-chemical weathering information. The integrity of the presented isotope records is supported by further investigation into the lake environment (e.g. oxic/anoxic conditions) and its potential influence on the isotopic record. The Pb isotope records during the early lake phase witnessed high-amplitude isotopic fluctuations linked to the initial chemical weathering of fine glacial substrate. This finding is also supported by the lithology of the core and rapidly decreasing adsorbed Th and U concentrations. Following this early lake phase, the majority of the Holocene traced congruent release of Pb-207/Pb-204 and Pb-206/Pb-204 and a significant depletion of Pb-208/Pb-204 in the adsorbed phase. These findings corroborate earlier suggestions of more effective weathering of uranogenic minerals yet also call for the presence of more weathering-resistant thorogenic minerals in the lake catchment. The latest 2.2 ka of the record are significantly overprinted by anthropogenic Pb deposition coinciding with the rise and fall of the Roman Empire. Finally, our data suggest that Nd isotopes are equally affected by incongruent weathering during the initial deglacial weathering processes, albeit at smaller magnitude than seen for Pb isotopes.

These dry high-mountain environments are very sensitive to changes in climatic boundary conditions, particularly humidity since temperatures are far below freezing. Here we present a reconstruction of climatic changes since the Last Glacial Maximum for the Chilean dry Andes of the southern hemisphere. We reconstructed regional equilibrium line altitudes (ELA) for three different moraine stages, representing extensive past glaciations in this currently unglaciated region. Comparison of the regional pattern of the ELA with modem climate conditions allows us to draw implications about the paleoclimatic conditions during the best preserved 'moraine stage II' glaciations in the northern as well as in the southern part of the research area. Our results suggest humid conditions in the northern part (18-24 degreesS) during Late Glacial times, with strongly increased convective precipitation during austral summer. The temporal-coincidence of glaciers in the mountains and high lake levels on the Altiplano (Tauca Phase) is evident. To the south, no simple shift of the Westerlies is implied by our glacier reconstructions. The northern limit of effective moisture for glacier formation did not shift significantly, but stayed in the area of the present day northernmost glaciers of the Westerlies at about 27 degreesS. But further south, precipitation increased significantly, accompanied by at least 2-3 degreesC colder conditions. The age of this glaciation is uncertain, but probably of Late Glacial or Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) times. Overall, glaciers in the dry Andes of South America clearly responded to large changes in the humidity, not primarily the temperature regime, with all its consequences on the environment (hydrology, vegetation, etc.), illustrating the different regional responses to global climatic change.

Assessing the Effects of Historical Exposure to Endocrine-Active Compounds on Reproductive Health and Genetic Diversity in Walleye, a Native Apex Predator, in a Large Riverine System	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												In this combined field and laboratory study, we assessed whether populations of native walleye in the Upper Mississippi River experienced altered genetic diversity correlated with exposure to estrogenic endocrine-active compounds (EACs). We collected fin-clips for genetic analysis from almost 600 walleye (13 sites) and subsampled 377 of these fish (6 sites) for blood and reproductive organs. Finally, we caged male fathead minnows at 5 sampling sites to confirm the presence of estrogenic EACs. Our findings indicate that male walleye in four river segments produced measurable concentrations of plasma vitellogenin (an egg-yolk protein and, when expressed in male fish, a biomarker of acute estrogenic exposure), a finding consistent with the presence of estrogenic EACs and consistent with published historical data for at least three of these study sites (Grand Rapids, St. Paul, and Lake City on Lake Pepin). Patterns of vitellogenin induction were consistent for native walleye and caged fathead minnows. No widespread occurrence of histopathological changes, such as intersex was found compared with published reports of intersex at the furthest downstream study site. To assess possible effects of estrogenic exposure on the genetic diversity of walleye populations at the study sites, we DNA-fingerprinted individual fish using 10 microsatellite loci. Genetic differences were observed between populations; however, these differences were consistent with geographic distance between populations, with the largest observed difference in genetic diversity found between fish upstream and downstream of St. Anthony Falls (and/or Lock and Dam 1 of the Mississippi River), traditionally a historical barrier to upstream fish movement. Although the persistent occurrence of endocrine disruption in wild fish populations is troubling, we did not detect degradation of reproductive organs in individual walleye or alteration in genetic diversity of walleye populations.

Impact of model grid spacing on regional- and urban- scale air quality predictions of organic aerosol	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Regional-scale chemical transport model predictions of urban organic aerosol to date tend to be biased low relative to observations, a limitation with important implications for applying such models to human exposure health studies. We used a nested version of Environment Canada's AURAMS model (42- to- 15- to- 2.5-km nested grid spacing) to predict organic aerosol concentrations for a temporal and spatial domain corresponding to the Border Air Quality and Meteorology Study (BAQS-Met), an air-quality field study that took place in the southern Great Lakes region in the summer of 2007. The use of three different horizontal grid spacings allowed the influence of this parameter to be examined. A domain-wide average for the 2.5-km domain and a matching 15-km subdomain yielded very similar organic aerosol averages (4.8 vs. 4.3 mu g m(-3), respectively). On regional scales, secondary organic aerosol dominated the organic aerosol composition and was adequately resolved by the 15-km model simulation. However, the shape of the organic aerosol concentration histogram for the Windsor urban station improved for the 2.5-km simulation relative to those from the 42- and 15-km simulations. The model histograms for the Bear Creek and Harrow rural stations were also improved in the high concentration "tail" region. As well the highest-resolution model results captured the midday 4 July organic-aerosol plume at Bear Creek with very good temporal correlation. These results suggest that accurate simulation of urban and large industrial plumes in the Great Lakes region requires the use of a high-resolution model in order to represent urban primary organic aerosol emissions, urban VOC emissions, and the secondary organic aerosol production rates properly. The positive feedback between the secondary organic aerosol production rate and existing organic mass concentration is also represented more accurately with the highest-resolution model. Not being able to capture these finer-scale features may partly explain the consistent negative bias reported in the literature when urban-scale organic aerosol evaluations are made using coarser-scale chemical transport models.

A comparative analysis of the palaeoecological and palaeohydrological records of two neighbouring Eemian lakes: Implications for palaeolake evolution in Central Poland	CATENA												The paper presents high-resolution palaeoecological studies of two neighbouring palaeolakes, Struga and Paryso<acute accent>w, in Central Poland based on the presence of inter alia pollen, Cladocera, diatoms, and sediment analyses (loss-on-ignition). The investigated sites belong to the Eemian Lake District in the Polish Lowlands. The analysis of the two lakes revealed considerable differences in terms of the duration of their Eemian phases (Regional Pollen Assemblage Zones E1-E7) and their evolution. The Struga palaeolake began functioning in the Late Saalian (MIS 6) and survived as a lake into the terminocratic interglacial phase. In contrast, the Paryso<acute accent>w palaeolake was a rapidly overgrowing water body that ceased functioning during the hornbeam phase (E5 RPAZ) and was reactivated by increased climate humidity at the end of the Eemian. It hence seems that different types of lakes functioned in a small region of the Garwolin Plain during the Last Interglacial period (MIS 5e) but experienced different shallowing processes under the same climate conditions; this finding emphasises the important role played by the local context in palaeoenvironmental interpretations. The differences observed in the present study may be attributed to the geomorphological situations of the lakes and the possibility of groundwater recharge. Indeed, groundwater levels fell during the earlier part of the climatic optimum of the Eemian interglacial due to drier climate conditions; this may have been responsible for the shallowing observed in lakes at the high-altitude tops of kettle holes, such as Paryso<acute accent>w, but not those in low-lying subglacial troughs, such as Struga.

Mercury exposure and reproduction in fish-eating birds breeding in the Pinchi Lake region, British Columbia, Canada	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												To determine whether Hg from geologic/mining-related sources at Pinchi Lake (BC, Canada) was causing elevated Hg exposure and/or adversely affecting reproduction in fish-eating birds, breeding bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) on Pinchi Lake and four nearby reference lakes were sampled for blood and feather Hg concentrations and monitored for reproductive success during the summers of 2000, 2001, and 2002. Eggs of red-necked grebes (Podiceps grisgena) also were collected and analyzed. Mercury levels in species at various trophic levels from Pinchi Lake averaged approximately twice those in the same species from nearby lakes combined, even in the absence of substantial new inputs of Hg to Pinchi Lake over several decades. In Pinchi Lake, Hg concentrations in blood and feathers of eagles and eggs of grebes were significantly higher than those in corresponding samples from reference lakes. However, the mean Hg concentration (0.25 mu g/g wet wt) in grebe eggs from Pinchi Lake was substantially lower than accepted threshold levels for reproductive toxicity in most avian species (0.5-1.0 mu g/g wet wt). Mercury concentrations in the blood of adult eagles and their chicks were highly correlated (r = 0.91, p = 0.004). Despite elevated Hg exposure in adult eagles nesting on Pinchi Lake (blood Hg concentration, 4.3-9.4 mu g/ml), birds appeared to be in good body condition, did not differ significantly in terms of weight from eagles nesting on reference takes, and exhibited no evidence of obvious abnormal behavior or lack of coordination. Eagle reproductive success and productivity on Pinchi Lake were not significantly different from those on all reference lakes combined (p = 0.483).																			0730-7268					MAY	2006	25	5					1433	1440		10.1897/05-181R.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1897/05-181R.1								16704079					WOS:000240373600034
J	Scott, CPJ; Sousounis, PJ				Scott, CPJ; Sousounis, PJ			The utility of additional soundings for forecasting lake-effect snow in the Great Lakes region	WEATHER AND FORECASTING												The impact of initializing a mesoscale model with additional sounding data over the Great Lakes region is investigated. As part of the Lake-Induced Convection Experiment (Lake-ICE) field study during the winter of 1997/98, six supplementary Cross-chain Loran Atmospheric Sounding System (CLASS) units and three Integrated Sounding System (ISS) units were used in addition to those from the standard synoptic upper-air network. The three ISS units were in the vicinity of Lake Michigan, and the six CLASS units were in the data-sparse region of central and northeastern Ontario and western Quebec. The Pennsylvania State University-National Center for Atmospheric Research fifth-generation Mesoscale Model running on a doubly nested grid is used to simulate the lake-effect snow event of 4-5 December 1997. This model output from a 30-km horizontal resolution grid shows that the six CLASS soundings capture a warm layer below 850 hPa that appears to be the result of diabatic heating from the Great Lakes. This leads to an improved simulation of the surface pressure fields over the course of the simulation. A nested 10-km horizontal resolution grid shows that the initialization data from the CLASS sites seemed to have a greater influence on the propagation of a mesoalpha-scale trough that caused significant snowfall to the lee of Lake Michigan than data from the ISS sites. The inclusion of the CLASS sounding data changes the track of the precipitation maximum by approximately 25 km and agrees better with reflectivity data from the Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler. Implications for forecasters in the Great Lakes region are discussed.																			0882-8156						2001	16	4					448	462		10.1175/1520-0434(2001)016<0448:TUOASF>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0434(2001)016<0448:TUOASF>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000170271000005

Fazle			Metamorphic pressure-temperature evolution of garnet-chloritoid schists from the Lake Zone, SW Mongolia	JOURNAL OF MINERALOGICAL AND PETROLOGICAL SCIENCES												Garnet-chloritoid schists occur in the Chandman district of the Lake Zone, SW Mongolia, which is located within the central part of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt. The Chandman district is composed of Neoproterozoic ophiolites of the Khantaishir Formation, eclogite-bearing orthogneisses and micaschists of the Alag Khadny metamorphic complex, marbles of the Maykhan Tsakhir Formation, and the basement block of the Zamtyn Nuruu Formation. Garnet-chloritoid schists occur as lenses or layers within marbles of the Maykhan Tsakhir Formation, which lie in contact with eclogite bodies. They consist mainly of garnet, chloritoid, phengitic muscovite, chlorite and quartz, with minor amounts of kyanite, rutile, ilmenite, zircon and carbonaceous matter. The texture and mineral chemistry of the garnet-chloritoid schists record prepeak and peak stages of high-pressure intermediate type metamorphism. The pre-peak stage of epidote-amphibolite facies conditions (T = 500-510 degrees C and P = 7-8 kbar) is deduced from cores of garnet containing mineral inclusions of chloritoid, Fe-rich chlorite, phengitic muscovite, and quartz. The peak mineral assemblage of the garnet-chloritoid schists defined by garnet rims containing chloritoid, phengitic muscovite, Mg-rich chlorite, kyanite and quartz as inclusions indicates T = 560-590 degrees C and P = 10-11 kbar, falling in transitional conditions between the epidote-amphibolite and the eclogites facies. The pressure conditions of the garnet-chloritoid schists are distinctly lower than those of the eclogites (T = 590-610 degrees C and P = 20-25 kbar), whereas temperature conditions are similar. The eclogites are considered to have formed by subduction of oceanic crust. In contrast, the metamorphism of the garnet-chloritoid schists was probably related to collisional tectonic event in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt.

J	Robinet, A; Bernon, N; Lerma, AN				Robinet, Arthur; Bernon, Nicolas; Lerma, Alexandre Nicolae			Multi-Decadal Shoreline Variability Along the Cap Ferret Sand Spit (SW France) Derived from Satellite Images	REMOTE SENSING												Building shoreline position databases able to capture event- to centennial-scale coastal changes is critical for scientists to improve knowledge of past coastal dynamics and predict future changes. Thanks to the commissioning of several satellites acquiring recurrent high-resolution optical images over coastal areas, coastal scientists have developed methods for detecting the shoreline position from satellite images in most parts of the world. These methods use image band analyses to delineate the waterline and require post-processing to produce time-consistent satellite-derived shorelines. However, the detection accuracy generally decreases with increasing tidal range. This work investigates an alternative approach for meso- and macrotidal coasts, which relies on the delineation of the boundary between dry and wet sand surfaces. The method was applied to the high-energy meso-macrotidal km-scale Cap Ferret sand spit, SW France, which has undergone large and contrasted shoreline changes over the last decades. Comparisons with topographic surveys conducted at Cap Ferret between 2014 and 2020 have shown that the raw satellite-derived wet/dry line reproduces well the mean high water shoreline, with an overall bias of 1.7 m, RMSE of 20.2 m, and R2 of 0.86. Building on this, the shoreline variability at Cap Ferret was investigated over the 1984-2021 period. Results have evidenced an alongshore gradient in the dominant modes of variability in the last 2 km of the sand spit. Near the tip, the shoreline has chronically retreated on the decadal scale at about 8.4 m/year and has been strongly affected on the interannual scale by the onset and migration of shoreline undulations having a wavelength of 500-1200 m and a cross-shore amplitude of 100-200 m. Some 3 km away from the sand spit extremity, the shoreline has been relatively stable in the long term, with a dominance of seasonal and interannual variability. This work brings new arguments for using the wet/dry line to monitor shoreline changes from spatial imagery at meso- and macrotidal sandy coasts.

Assessing groundwater accessibility in the Kharga Basin, Egypt: A remote sensing approach	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												We used multi-map analysis of remote sensing and ancillary data to identify potentially accessible sites for groundwater resources in the Kharga Basin in the Western Desert of Egypt. This basin is dominated by Cretaceous sandstone formations and extends within the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer. It is dissected by N-S and E-W trending faults, possibly acting as conduits for upward migration of groundwater. Analysis of paleo-drainage using Digital Elevation Model (DEM) generated from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data shows that the Kharga was a closed basin that might have been the site of a paleolake. Lake water recharged the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer during the wetter Holocene time. We generated the following layers for the multi-map analysis: (1) Fracture density map from the interpretation of Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI), SRTM DEM, and RADARSAT data. (2) Thermal Inertia (TI) map (for moisture content imaging) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. (3) Hydraulic conductivity map from mapping lithological units using the Landsat OLI and previously published data. (4) Aquifer thickness map from previously published data. We quantitatively ranked the Kharga Basin by considering that regions of high fracture density, high TI, thicker aquifer, and high hydraulic conductivity have higher potential for groundwater accessibility. Our analysis shows that part of the southern Kharga Basin is suitable for groundwater extraction. This region is where N-S and E-W trending faults intersect, has relatively high TI and it is underlain by thick aquifer. However, the suitability of this region for groundwater use will be reduced significantly when considering the changes in land suitability and economic depth to groundwater extraction in the next 50 years.

J	Lechelt, JD; Bajer, PG				Lechelt, Joseph D.; Bajer, Przemyslaw G.			Elucidating the mechanism underlying the productivity-recruitment hypothesis in the invasive common carp	AQUATIC INVASIONS												Across-ecoregion analyses showed that the recruitment of common carp, Cyprinus carpio (Linnaeus 1758), a globally invasive fish, is strongly influenced by lake productivity: while recruitment was frequent in hypereutrophic lakes, it was invariably absent in oligotrophic lakes. This led to a hypothesis that common carp larvae might have faster growth rates in productive lakes that allow them to outgrow native predators, whereas larvae might encounter nutritional bottlenecks in oligotrophic lakes. We shed some light on this hypothesis by documenting how zooplankton communities found in oligo-, meso-, and eutrophic lakes in Minnesota, USA affected larval carp survival, growth and diet composition. We cultured larval carp in tanks fed zooplankton at naturally occurring densities from three lakes of varying trophic states for 20 days during two consecutive springs. The growth rates were significantly higher (up to 5 times) among larvae fed zooplankton from the eutrophic lake and lowest in larvae fed zooplankton from the oligotrophic lake. Despite their small size (similar to 6 mm), carp larvae selected large zooplankton (0.3-0.6 mm), primarily Bosmina spp., even on the first day of exogenous feeding. This pattern was consistent across all treatments. Rotifers were generally not found in the stomachs of larval carp, despite their high abundance, even if other food items were scarce. The densities of cladocera were highest in the productive lake, especially during one of the two years when larval carp showed very rapid growth rates. Our study shows that larval carp have well defined dietary preferences and that common carp recruitment might be especially likely to occur in productive systems with abundant cladocera populations in which carp larvae are expected to be more likely to escape gape-limited, native predators.																			1798-6540	1818-5487				OCT	2016	11	4					469	482		10.3391/ai.2016.11.4.11	http://dx.doi.org/10.3391/ai.2016.11.4.11													WOS:000385925200011

Vegetation response to glacial-interglacial climate variability near Lake Malawi in the southern African tropics	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Pollen records from Lake Malawi, Africa spanning the last 135 kyr show substantial and abrupt vegetation response to multiple episodes of extreme aridity between 135 and 75 ka. Peaks in both the relative abundance and total production of Podocarpus pollen define the first two of these drought episodes. From 135 to 127 and again from 117 to 105 kyr BP. Podocarpus percentages remain above 16% with peak values as high as 38% indicating a period marked by a cool climate resulting in expansion of montane forest taxa to lower elevations. Marine palynological records from the Angola Margin and Congo Fan show similar peak Podocarpus percentages at this time (oxygen isotope stage 5d) indicating a similar climate across the African continent at this latitude. From 105 to 90 ka, continuing drought resulted in total pollen accumulation rates in Lake Malawi to fall to less than 300 grains/cm(2)/yr of predominately grass pollen. This episode in African history was severe enough to cause the disappearance of pteridophytes and forest taxa such as Uapaca and Brachystegia as well as montane taxa (Podocarpus, Olea spp. and Ericaceae) within the pollen source area of Lake Malawi. These taxa all remain nearly absent from the surrounding vegetation for the next 18,000 years. The resultant semi-desert vegetation would have been inhospitable for early humans living within or traveling through the Lake Malawi region. Increasing moisture following these arid intervals allowed expansion, creation and maintenance of a more diverse landscape vegetation mosaic around Lake Malawi including Zambezian miombo woodland, humid evergreen woodland and afromontane forests. The relative abundance of each fluctuated in response to either cooling (i.e. afromontane expansion from 60 to 56 ka) or moisture balance (i.e. increasing humid evergreen woodland between 75 and 65 ka). Notably there was no significant change in vegetation composition during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) (30-15 ka) as compared to the previous 20,000 years. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

J	Hu, FS; Wright, HE; Ito, E; Lease, K				Hu, FS; Wright, HE; Ito, E; Lease, K			Climatic effects of glacial Lake Agassiz in the midwestern United States during the last deglaciation	GEOLOGY												Stable isotope and pollen analyses of a sediment core from Deep Lake, Minnesota, provide new information on the climatic effects of glacial Lake Agassiz in Minnesota and insights into the cause of the prominent Picea recurrence during the Younger Dryas in the southern Great Lakes region. Bulk-carbonate delta(18)O exhibited large fluctuations between 12.0 and 9.1 ka (dates are in calendar years throughout this paper unless indicated otherwise), probably reflecting the effects of glacial Lake Agassiz superimposed on climatic warming related to large-scale climatic controls, In particular, a 3 parts per thousand decrease in delta(18)O 11.2-10.2 ka interrupted the delta(18)O enrichment of 1 parts per thousand from 12.0 to 11,2 ka and 3.5 parts per thousand from 10.2 to 9.1 ka This delta(18)O decrease coincided with the expansion of Lake Agassiz, We interpret this decrease as a result of decreased summer temperature and increased precipitation derived from the cold and isotopically light meltwaters of Lake Agassiz, During this delta(18)O decline, Pinus pollen continued to increase at the expense of Picea pollen at Deep Lake, as at other Minnesota sites, providing evidence that climatic cooling induced by Lake Agassiz did not cause a reversal to a Picea-dominated vegetation. The absence of such a vegetational response implies that the prominent Picea recurrence during the Younger Dryas in the southern Great Lakes region was not caused solely by climatic cooling due to increased flux of meltwater from Lake Agassiz into the Great Lakes. Instead the Picea recurrence might have been driven primarily by the westward penetration of the Younger Dryas cooling.

Recent advances in object-based image analysis (OBIA) and machine-learning algorithms offer new image classification tools; however, few comparisons of different approaches have been discussed to date. We applied OBIA to delineate wetland plant functional types (PFTs) for Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China and Ramsar wetland conservation site, from a spring 2008 Landsat TM image. We targeted major PFTs that represent dominant vegetation groups along wetland inundation gradients and affect ecosystem biogeochemical cycles and ecological habitats. Classification results were compared among: a) several "small" object segmentation scales (with average object sizes 1350-9000 m(2)); b) algorithms from six families of statistical machine-learning classifiers (Bayesian, Logistic, Neural Network, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machines) and c) two hierarchical levels of vegetation classification, a generalized 3-class set and a more specific 6-class set. We also examined the response of classification accuracy to four basic object-level texture metrics. The highest accuracies (> 85-90%) and best agreement among algorithms occurred at coarser object scales rather than close-to-pixel scales. No single machine-learning algorithm was consistently superior at all scales, although support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor and artificial neural network most frequently provided the highest overall and PFT-specific accuracies. Including texture metrics had both positive and negative low-magnitude effects on classification accuracy that were not consistent among scale values, algorithms or PFT classes. Individual PFTs differed in scales at which they were best discriminated from others, reflecting their unique landscape positions, ecology of dominant species and disturbance agents. There was a 29-35% disagreement between mapped areas of generalized PFTs and their respective subclasses, suggesting potential mismatches between the ecological classification scheme and PFT landscape patch structure, and raising concern on error propagation in multi-scale classifications. We conclude that OBIA with machine-learning classifiers is useful for landscape vegetation analyses, however, considerations of spatial scale and image segmentation outcomes are critical in mapping PFTs and should be more thoroughly investigated in future work.

Enhancing nitrification at low temperature with zeolite in a mining operations retention pond	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Ammonium nitrate explosives are used in mining operations at Diavik Diamond Mines Inc. in the Northwest Territories, Canada. Residual nitrogen is washed into the mine pit and piped to a nearby retention pond where its removal is accomplished by microbial activity prior to a final water treatment step and release into the sub-Arctic lake, Lac de Gras. Microbial removal of ammonium in the retention pond is rapid during the brief ice-free summer, but often slows under ice cover that persists up to 9 months of the year. The aluminosilicate mineral zeolite was tested as an additive to retention pond water to increase rates of ammonium removal at 4 C. Water samples were collected across the length of the retention pond monthly over a year. The structure of the microbial community (bacteria, archaea, and eukarya), as determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of PCR-amplified small subunit ribosomal RNA genes, was more stable during cold months than during July September, when there was a marked phytoplankton bloom. Of the ammonia-oxidizing community, only bacterial amoA genes were consistently detected. Zeolite (10 g) was added to retention pond water (100 mL) amended with 5 mM ammonium and incubated at 12 C to encourage development of a nitrifying biofilm. The biofilm community was composed of different amoA phylotypes from those identified in gene clone libraries of native water samples. Zeolite biofilm was added to fresh water samples collected at different times of the year, resulting in a significant increase in laboratory measurements of potential nitrification activity at 4 C. A significant positive correlation between the amount of zeolite biofilm and potential nitrification activity was observed; rates were unaffected in incubations containing 1-20 mM ammonium. Addition of zeolite to retention ponds in cold environments could effectively increase nitrification rates year-round by concentrating active nitrifying biomass.					; Stein, Lisa/E-6374-2016	Yakiwchuk, Brian/0009-0003-7526-1838; 														1664-302X					2012	3									10.3389/fmicb.2012.00271	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2012.00271								22866052					WOS:000208863600317

This view, however, does not follow from the published geological and molecular evidence. The former does indeed suggest that the LV basin dried out less than 15 000 years ago, but it does not provide any information about the species that re-colonized the new lake or that remained in the rivers draining the area. The molecular evidence is inconclusive with respect to the origin of the LV haplochromines because cichlids from critical regions around LV were not adequately sampled; and as far as the age of the LV haplochromines is concerned, it in fact led to an estimate of 250 000-750 000 years old. In the present study, mitochondrial DNA (control region) variation was determined by heteroduplex and sequencing analyses of more than 670 specimens collected at widely distributed East African riverine and lacustrine localities. The analyses revealed the existence of seven haplogroups (I-VII) distinguishable by characteristic substitutions. All endemic LV samples tested fell into one of these haplogroups (V) which, however, was also found to be present at various other localities, both riverine and lacustrine, outside LV. Within this haplogroup, four subgroups (VA through VD) could be distinguished, two of which (VB and VC) were represented in LV and at other localities. The great majority of the LV haplochromine species could be classified as belonging to the VC subgroup, which was found only in LV and in the rivers draining into it. Hence, while the endemic haplochromine species of LV could not have originated from a single founding population, the lake does harbour a large species flock which probably arose in situ.																			0962-8452					MAY 22	2000	267	1447					1049	1061		10.1098/rspb.2000.1109	http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2000.1109								10874756					WOS:000087418700014

Forest change over 155 years along biophysical gradients of forest composition, environment, and anthropogenic disturbance	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Understanding temporal forest change across spatial biophysical gradients is fundamental to managing dynamic forests across variable landscapes. This is especially true for identifying how biophysical variation mediates forest development through multi-century changes in climate and eras of forest manipulation by humans. We examined 155 years of forest change across a 13,000-ha mixed conifer landscape in the Spring Mountains, Nevada, USA. We reconstructed forest composition at 31 sites in 1855 (pre-Euro-American settlement, and near the end of the Little Ice Age), 1881 (logging era), 1900 (before establishment of government forest reserve), 1950 (mid-century fire exclusion), and 2009 (present forest). Differing from many other western conifer landscapes, density of large trees (>50 cm in diameter) increased through time. Aside from large trees and one measure of species compositional change, five other measures of forest change (e.g., percent difference in tree density) were spatially variable across the landscape and not well represented by 'average' change in the study area. Forest composition in 1855 minimally influenced the next 155 years of forest change. In contrast, the amount, timing, and direction of forest change were linked with topographic gradients. Forests on warm slope aspects incurred the least amount of change, which also was delayed in time, whereas forests on cooler aspects already appreciably changed by 1900. Warm aspects were the only ones to lose trees during the most recent 60-year period (1950-2009), with a decline in median tree density of 13%, compared to continued gains on moister sites. Management applications of this spatio-temporal variation include anchoring fuel treatments around areas of open, little-changed forest to increase effective size of treatments.

OXIDATION-REDUCTION RELATIONS AT THE MUD-WATER INTERFACE	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Redox potentials of mud cores from 7 lakes, including acid bog, unproductive, and productive types, were measured with Mortimer''s multiple electrode. A break existed below the surface, but variation in measurement was too great to characterize its depth within [plus or minus] 30-50%. Accuracy of potential measurement is limited by lack of poise, so that the scatter of units of the multiple electrode increases as a standard solution or a natural mud is diluted with distilled water. With the muds studied the scatter was [plus or minus sign] 50 mv. In poorly poised systems the area of platinum is also important, so that potentials of 0.01 to 0.42 volts were obtained on the same samples with electrodes of different sizes. The presence of H2S causes a voltage drop, e.g., 20-minute bubbling of a reduced solution with H2S caused the voltage to fall from 0.63 to 0.17 v. Production of H2S in nature is abolished by O2. As a further difficulty the sediments of some lakes are able to deposit a sulfide plating on submerged platinum. Evidence is presented that the real oxidized layer is 1 mm or less thick, and that the reported break in the electrode curve at about 1 cm is caused by factors other than oxidation of iron salts, e.g., turbulent stirring of the sediment by wind-induced currents, and presence of sulfide.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1958	3	3					308	317		10.4319/lo.1958.3.3.0308	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1958.3.3.0308													WOS:A1958WY36000007

Impact of a natural disturbance on the performance and microbial communities in a full-scale constructed wetland for industrial wastewater treatment	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Constructed Wetlands (CWs) are a cost-effective, versatile and sustainable choice for wastewater treatment. In these environments, microbial communities play a significant role in pollutant removal. However, little is known about how microbial communities in full-scale CWs contribute to maintaining water quality or how their dynamics change in response to pulse disturbances such as fire or freezes. Furthermore, few studies have examined the relationship between CW microbial community structure and performance in full-scale industrial operations. We characterized the water-column and leaf-litter layer microbial communities in a 110-acre free water surface CW that provides tertiary wastewater treatment to a plastics manufacturing plant. The CW's sampling campaign was conducted over a 12-month period that included Winter Storm Uri, a 100-year freeze event. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequences revealed that the bacterial communities experienced a temporal shift. There was also a shift in microbial community structure between the influent and the first segment of the CW. However, no differences in microbial community structure were observed in the second segment of the CW. There was a negative association between microbial community diversity and chlorophyll a, as well as microbial community diversity and total suspended solids (TSS); demonstrating an increase in microbial biodiversity as water quality improved throughout the CW. Six months after the freeze, CW performance in terms of removal of water quality constituents began to return to former removal trends. Yet, there was still a significant difference in microbial community structure within the CW relative to the previous year. This suggests CW functional resilience despite a shift in microbial community structure in the wetland.

J	Chucholl, C				Chucholl, Christoph			Feeding ecology and ecological impact of an alien 'warm-water' omnivore in cold lakes	LIMNOLOGICA												The present study attempted to investigate the feeding ecology and ecological impact of Procambarus clarkii, the world's worst invasive crayfish and a recent invader in colder climates, by linking stomach-content analysis with an in situ enclosure experiment in lakes in southern Germany. The stomach-content analysis showed that P. clarkii is a polytrophic omnivore that feeds on. macrophytes, detritus and macroinvertebrates. The trophic diversity of its diet was highest in mid-summer and in smaller crayfish. Chironomidae larvae and Dreissena polymorpha were the most preferred prey, whereas sediment-dwelling taxa were rarely consumed. The number of consumed small and agile prey negatively correlated with the crayfish size, suggesting an ontogenetic shift in diet. A five-week enclosure experiment was used to determine the impact of P. clarkii on the basal levels of a typical littoral food web of cold lakes at different crayfish densities (0, 2.5, and 5 crayfish m(-2)). The abundance of aquatic snails sharply decreased with increasing crayfish density and conditioned leaf breakdown was up to five times higher in the presence of crayfish than in the control treatment without crayfish. Crayfish also had a negative effect on macrophyte biomass, resulting from both consumption and uprooting. However, the impact mechanisms and outcomes differed among macrophyte species. In the crayfish treatments, the final biomass of the indigenous Myriophyllum spicatum and Chara sp. was significantly reduced relative to the initially stocked biomass, whereas the alien Elodea nuttallii was able to gain biomass. This finding is consistent with an invasional meltdown scenario, in that P. clarkii indirectly facilitated a dominance of E. nuttallii. Overall, the results concordantly suggest that P. clarkii is a keystone species that can profoundly alter recipient communities via direct trophic links and non-consumptive destruction, and may indirectly facilitate other invasive alien species.

J	Effler, SW; Gelda, RK; Matthews, CMB				Effler, SW; Gelda, RK; Matthews, CMB			Implications of industrial loads for ammonia pollution in an urban lake	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												The recent history of loading of total ammonia (T-NH3) and organic nitrogen (N) from a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility to a municipal treatment plant (Metro) in Syracuse, New York, and the discharge of these constituents from Metro to N-polluted Onondaga Lake is documented. Further, the benefit of the implementation of pretreatment at the pharmaceutical plant, and the effect of an upset event at this treatment facility on loading to Metro and the lake and in-lake concentrations are also documented. Models are used as analytical tools to couple loading and in-lake concentrations, to delineate the role that this pharmaceutical facility has played in the lake's ammonia pollution problem, and to evaluate the potential implications of future pretreatment upset events for the success of a rehabilitation program that is underway for the lake. The responsiveness of the lake to reductions in external loading is established by the lower T-NH3 concentration observed in the upper waters of the lake in the spring of 1999. Model analysis demonstrates this reduction was primarily (similar to 75%) because of the decrease in loading from the pharmaceutical facility achieved by pretreatment. An abrupt increase in loading in May 1999 associated with an upset event at the pretreatment facility caused a corresponding increase in the T-NH, concentration of the lake of approximately 0.5 mg N/L. Model projections demonstrate that the load from the pharmaceutical plant before construction of the pretreatment facility exacerbated the lake's ammonia problems by increasing the occurrence and margin of violations of the toxicity standard. Continued upset events at the pretreatment plant could compromise the lake rehabilitation program.

J	Howell, ET				Howell, E. Todd			The aquatic environment of Parry Sound, a deep-water embayment complex of Georgian Bay protected from Dreissena	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The coastline of eastern Georgian Bay in the Parry Sound region is a distinctive nearshore environment consisting of a large deep-water embayment partially isolated from the open lake and connected with other embayments of diverse morphometric features. The underlying geology of the embayments and their watersheds contrasts with the larger lake basin, resulting in heterogenous water quality stemming from mixing of the high-alkalinity, low phosphorus waters of Georgian Bay with the low-alkalinity and higher phosphorus waters draining watersheds of the Canadian Shield. In 2016, water quality was examined in the deep basin of Parry Sound known as the Big Sound, and six connected embayments to examine the influences of watershed loading and anthropogenic development to enable better detection of changes related to human activity. Inter-basin mixing and river loading accounted for much of the variability in major ions, water clarity and nutrients except for Deep Bay, an embayment exhibiting signs of nutrient enrichment. The oligotrophic conditions in Parry Sound have changed little since 1990 unlike Lake Huron where the dreissenid invasion has correlated with falling phosphorus levels. Low calcium levels may limit dreissenid mussel numbers in Parry Sound and are hypothesized to have pre-empted mussel-related changes in water quality. Apparent productivity, light regime and water column stratification of the Big Sound and connected embayments contrast with the adjacent nearshore of Georgian Bay indicating an aquatic environment distinct from the exposed nearshore of Georgian Bay.

J	Benavente, CA; Bohacs, KM				Benavente, Cecilia A.; Bohacs, Kevin M.			Advances in Limnogeology: The lake-basin-type model revisited 25 years after…anomalies, conundrums and upgrades	DEPOSITIONAL RECORD												The lake-basin-type model classified the stratigraphic record of ancient lake systems according to rates of potential accommodation relative to sediment + water supply. The model convolved all modes and paths of water supply (direct fall, surficial, subsurface) with amounts and types of sediment supply (clastic, biogenic, chemical) into a single basin-filling volume term (sediment + water); its major strength was its widespread applicability. This was supported by subsequent investigations confirming the utility of this approach, but it also revealed some important limitations due to simplifications in the original model. The model has been expanded here to address all inland waters (lakes, ponds, wetlands, playas) as well as adding two major subdivisions of the sediment + water term: (1) water supply paths and (2) the volume of water supply relative to sediment supply. Water supply flow paths in the subsurface are subdivided into 'throughflow', 'recharge' and 'discharge'. Each of these groundwater hydrology states can be defined quite precisely by the ratio of net outflow to inflow, from persistently open to consistently closed. These paths can be deciphered using stable carbonate and oxygen isotope composition of primary lacustrine limestones, detailed sedimentology, stratigraphy, palaeontology and mineralogy. Distinguishing water supply paths provides additional insights into playa systems and the occurrence and character of evaporites and carbonates. The volume ratio of water to sediment supply most directly influences the water depths of lakes, ponds and wetlands, which affect water body hydrodynamics and ecosystem behaviour as well as the details of stratal stacking and depositional sequences. It helps fine-tune estimates of the distribution of sediment texture, bedding, composition and organic matter content. The aim of this contribution is to address questions about the fundamental types of inland water bodies and to explain the new lake-basin subtypes and provide examples that illustrate their potential to enable higher-resolution, robust analysis of inland water systems and their stratigraphic records. This manuscript is a review of the lake basin type models applied in Limnogeology, their evolution since the last update (2000), integration with new data and finally the presentation of a new lake basin type model proposal as a result of this process. It is intended as a novel and useful contribution for the Limnogeology community.image																				2055-4877				NOV	2024	10	5					748	792		10.1002/dep2.280	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/dep2.280		APR 2024											WOS:001209699200001

Observations made and samples collected under the 3.5 m ice in 1980 by SCUBA divers reveal that an extensive benthic microbial mat dominated by the filamentous blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) Phormidium frigidum and Lyngbya martensiana is growing there. As is the case in other Antarctic lakes investigated by us thus far, the mat in Lake Vanda traps and binds sediment and precipitates calcite and is undisturbed by grazers and burrowers. Therefore, stromatolitic laminae are being generated. Unlike the other Antarctic lakes investigatd in this region, Lake Vanda has an ice cover and water that transmits significantly more light; an ice cover that is permeable to gases and aeolian sediment; no zone of lift-off mat where photosynthetically generated oxygen would render the mat buoyant and cause it to separate from the substrate and float away; and mat that has a distinctive pinnacle macrostructure. Although the laminae being laid down by the Lake Vanda mat do not retain the cone and ridge morphology of the living mat, the pinnacle macrostructure of the mat is similar to the Precambrian Conophyton stromatolites as well as microbial structures forming in Yellowstone hot springs, freshwater marshes in the Bahamas, and hypersaline intertidal mats in Baja California, Mexico, and Shark Bay, Australia. This suggests Conophyton-like structures similar to those abundant during the Precambrian can form under widely varying environmental conditions and high latitudes should not be overlooked as sites of formation of ancient stromatolites.																			0149-0451	1521-0529					1983	3	1					33	48		10.1080/01490458309377782	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490458309377782													WOS:A1983QD61100003
J	Eshenroder, RL; Bronte, CR; Peck, JW				Eshenroder, RL; Bronte, CR; Peck, JW			Comparison of lake trout-egg survival at inshore and offshore and shallow-water and deepwater sites in Lake Superior	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH					1994 International Conference on Restoration of Lake Trout in the Laurentian Great Lakes (RESTORE)	JAN 10-14, 1994	ANN ARBOR, MI	Great Lake Fishery Commiss, Board Tech Experts				We incubated lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) eggs over winter at shallow (10 m) and deep locations (20 m) on Gull Island Shoal, Lake Superior; at a shallow-water (10 m) site off the mainland (Bark Point); and in flowing Great Lakes water at two laboratories. Survival to hatch was significantly higher in the laboratories and averaged 80.9%. In Lake Superior, egg survival among incubators at all sites was significantly higher (P < 0.0001) for incubators that remained buried in spawning substrates (15.1-21.0%) than for incubators that were partially or completely exposed to water currents (1.0-12.6%). Egg survival for incubators that remained buried at the shallow-water sites was significantly higher at Bark Point (44.6%) than at Gull Island Shoal (21.0%). Egg survival among incubators that remained buried at the deep (14.4%) and shallow-water sites (21.0%) on Gull Island Shoal was not significantly different. Because incubators that were completely buried or partially exposed only appeared to differ in their degree of exposure, we concluded that survival of eggs in the lake was reduced by mechanical stress associated with water turbulence. Lower egg survival at Gull Island Shoal, a known lake trout-spawning site, was not expected and appeared to have been caused by a strong gale that occurred when these eggs were in late epiboly, a sensitive embryological stage. We present a hypothesis suggesting that lake trout recruitment in the Great Lakes is limited by availability of spawning habitat.																			0380-1330						1995	21			1			313	322		10.1016/S0380-1330(95)71105-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(95)71105-4													WOS:A1995UL89400028

Locations ranged from Winnipeg, Manitoba (49 degrees 49' N), to Rosemount in east central Minnesota (44 degrees 44' N). Newly emerged first summer generation adults were held in field cages at each location for 7-14 d, then observed for 7 d in the laboratory for frequency of oviposition and frequency of burrowing behavior associated with diapause. Females from the Red River Valley seldom oviposited and although frequency of burrowing varied among locations it was independent of field and laboratory conditions. Under long-day laboratory conditions, 9-15% of females from east central Minnesota oviposited with frequency dependent on photoperiod experienced in the field, the critical photoperiod was 15.8 h. Under long-day laboratory conditions, 18-52% of beetles fi om east central Minnesota burrowed with frequency dependent on cumulative temperatures experienced in the field. Cool conditions were associated with higher frequencies of burrowing. Beetles front Rosemount exhibited identical responses under short-day and long-day laboratory conditions. In contrast, under short-day conditions, beetles from Big Lake did not oviposit and frequency of burrowing was not dependent on field conditions. We concluded that there is local geographic variation in Colorado potato beetle populations not only between the Red River Valley and east central Minnesota, but also among the different locations within these two areas.																			0046-225X	1938-2936				DEC	2000	29	6					1123	1132		10.1603/0046-225X-29.6.1123	http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0046-225X-29.6.1123													WOS:000166389300005
J	Matias, NG; Boavida, MJ				Matias, NG; Boavida, MJ			Effects of catchment development on the trophic status of a deep and a shallow reservoir in Portugal	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Although catchment nutrient flux regulation is considered vital for controlling eutrophication, direct measurement of runoff loads is difficult. Shallow eutrophic Divor and smaller deep mesotrophic Apartadura, with different catchment uses but almost identical lake-to-watershed area ratios, were studied. Ratios suggest both reservoirs should be oligo- to meso-trophic. Divor catchment intensive livestock farming opposes to subsistence farming in Apartadura catchment. Runoff coefficients indicated that cattle accounted for 75% of TP mass export in Divor but only about a third in Apartadura, where goats and sheep dominated. In both watersheds agriculture, including pasture, dominated TP export over woodland/brush cover. Because of the large agricultural component, people contributed < 1% TP loading to Divor and 2-4% to Apartadura, reflecting population densities. Despite differences in watershed use and lake morphometry, reservoirs showed similar behaviour (summer hypolimnion anoxia, photic zone algal biomass). Transparent Apartadura was dominated by large algal particles and probably P-limited, while turbid Divor contained surplus phosphorus because of large amounts of fine suspended clay particles. The differences in mean depth, not watershed loading, apparently accounted for most of the differences in trophic state. Based on results, management actions to reduce eutrophication in the two reservoirs will differ. Divor drainage will primarily require better manure disposal and fertilizer use reduction but will probably not show trophic state improvement. Apartadura drainage will require diffuse-source P-control (constructed wetlands, riparian buffers) and it should respond by regaining an oxygenated hypolimnion. Stakeholder voluntary cooperation as well as modifying people's perceptions regarding water resources will be needed to comply with the legally binding EU Water Directives.

Drivers and timing of grass carp movement within the Sandusky River, Ohio: implications to potential spawning barrier response strategy	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Understanding the timing and drivers of migration can be beneficial for improving response efforts aimed at reducing invasive species densities. Efforts by management agencies to remove grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), an invasive species to the Laurentian Great Lakes, have been ongoing in Lake Erie tributaries since 2018. To bolster efforts, deployment of a non-physical barrier has been proposed downstream of a known grass carp spawning location near Brady's Island (BI) in the Sandusky River, OH, USA to limit recruitment. However, knowledge of grass carp migratory timing, the environmental variables that cue carp migration, and the potential effects the barrier might impose on native fish [e.g., walleye (Sander vitreus)] movements would help inform barrier deployment and scheduling. We used detection data from grass carp (n = 29) and walleye (n = 84) tagged with acoustic transmitters to address four objectives: (1) quantify interannual variation (years = 2015-2021) of grass carp migration timing to BI; (2) evaluate timing of different grass carp movement modalities (residents and migrants); (3) assess overlap in migration timing with native walleye, and (4) evaluate environmental cues of grass carp migration to BI. Median grass carp arrival at BI occurred within a three-week period (148-165 Julian days), suggesting that deploying a barrier immediately prior to this time frame may be effective for deterring grass carp spawning. Temperature, photoperiod, and discharge influenced grass carp migration timing given that most arrival events occurred at daylengths > 14.5 h, temperatures exceeding 18 degrees C, and low discharge events (< 3,000 cubic feet second(-1) [CFS]). Minimal interannual variability in migration timing existed for grass carp and walleye over a six-year period. However, the median departure time of walleye was more than 45 days before the median arrival time of grass carp, suggesting a spawning barrier may minimally affect walleye spawning. No differences in arrival timing at BI were observed between grass carp migratory contingents, indicating that if a barrier were deployed in the spring, it would likely affect all grass carp spatial contingents. This work highlights management implications of barrier control efforts of aquatic invasive species and provides insight into the environmental cues that grass carp use for upstream migration.

Development of a Method for the Determination of Total Selenium in Soil, Maize Plants, and Maize Flour by Inductively Coupled Plasma Tandem Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS/MS)	ANALYTICAL LETTERS												Selenium (Se) is a micronutrient that has multiple biochemical effects ranging from a nutritional deficiency at low levels to toxicity at high levels. Its quantification in environmental systems is vital to protect the health of people and animals. This study developed and validated methods to determine the total selenium (Se) concentration in soil, maize plants, and maize flour. The performance of the methods was ascertained using matrix certified reference materials (CRMs), namely NMIJ CRM 7303-a (trace elements in lake sediments), NIST SRM 1646-a (estuarine sediments), NIST SRM 1570-a (spinach leaves), NIST SRM 1571 (orchard leaves), NCS ZC 73010 (maize flour) and NIST RM 8437 (hard red spring wheat flour). All methods fulfilled the performance requirements of the AOAC International. An acceptable accuracy was achieved with percentage recoveries between 57 and 102% and En-scores within +/- 1 limits. Repeatability (RSDr, %) and intermediate precision (RSDR, %) ranged from 4 to 12%, and 9 to 15%, respectively. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for soil were 0.024 ng. g-1 and 0.082 ng. g-1, respectively. The LODs and LOQs for maize plants and flour were 0.0036 and 0.0179 ng. g-1, respectively. The performance characteristics of the methods were comparable with previously reported methods, confirming reliability. The measurement uncertainty was evaluated following the guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement (GUM). Relative expanded uncertainty at a 95% level of confidence (k=2) was less than 24% for the final measurement results for all the different matrices.					; Nomngongo, Philiswa Nosizo/I-3263-2016; Nomngongo, Philiswa/I-3263-2016	Botha, Angelique/0000-0003-3987-359X; Nomngongo, Philiswa Nosizo/0000-0001-7615-0548; Takata, Nwabisa/0000-0003-3422-8698; 													0003-2719	1532-236X				SEP 21	2024	57	14					2200	2214		10.1080/00032719.2023.2288930	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00032719.2023.2288930		NOV 2023											WOS:001118788600001
J	Goovaerts, P				Goovaerts, Pierre			From Natural Resources Evaluation to Spatial Epidemiology: 25 Years in the Making	MATHEMATICAL GEOSCIENCES												When, in the winter of 1994, under the supervision of my postdoc adviser Andre Journel, I started writingGeostatistics for Natural Resources Evaluationin the bedroom of a tiny Palo Alto apartment, little did I know that 25 years later I would be conducting National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded research on medical geostatistics from a lakefront office nestled in the Irish Hills of Michigan. The professional and personal path that led me to trade the mapping of heavy-metal concentrations in the topsoil of the Swiss Jura for the geostatistical analysis of cancer data was anything but planned, yet Andre's help and guidance were instrumental early on. Looking back, shifting scientific interest from the characterization of contaminated sites to human health made sense, as the field of epidemiology is increasingly concerned with the concept of exposome, which comprises all environmental exposures (e.g., air, soil, and drinking water) that a person experiences from conception throughout the life course. Although both environmental and epidemiological data exhibit space-time variability, the latter have specific characteristics that required the adaptation of traditional geostatistical tools, such as semivariogram and kriging. Challenges include: (i) the heteroscedasticity of disease rate data (i.e., larger uncertainty of disease rates computed from small populations), (ii) their uneven spatial support (e.g., rates recorded for administrative units of different size and shape), and (iii) the limitations of Euclidean metrics to embody proximity when dealing with data that pertain to human mobility. Most of these challenges were addressed by borrowing concepts developed in adjacent fields, stressing the value of interdisciplinary research and intellectual curiosity, something I learned as a fresh PhD in agronomical sciences joining Andre's research group at the Stanford Center for Reservoir Forecasting in the early 1990s.																			1874-8961	1874-8953				FEB	2021	53	2			SI		239	266		10.1007/s11004-020-09886-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11004-020-09886-x		AUG 2020						33767799					WOS:000563657200002

Fork length (L-F) frequency distributions of juvenile pink salmon caught in the lake during the summer in 1991 and 1999-2003 indicated a growth rate of 0.54 mm day(-1), 54% greater than the estimated growth rate of juvenile sockeye salmon sampled from 1958 to 2003 (0.35 mm day(-1)). Examination of daily growth rings on otoliths indicated that pink salmon in Lake Aleknagik grew an average of 1.34 mm day(-1) in 2003 but sockeye salmon grew only 0.63 mm day(-1) (average specific growth rates were 3.0 and 1.8% day(-1), respectively). Pink salmon increased from c. 32 turn L-F and 0.2 g at emergence to 78 mm L-F and 3.0 g within 3-4 weeks. After experiencing these rapid growth rates, the pink salmon appeared to leave the lake by late July in most years. The diets of pink and sockeye salmon in the littoral zone of the lake were very similar; >80% of the stomach contents consisted of adult and pupal insects and the remainder was zooplankton. This high degree of diet overlap suggested that the observed differences in growth rate were not attributable to variation in prey composition.

Role of nearshore benthic algae in the Lake Michigan silica cycle	PLOS ONE												Si cycling is linked with processes from global carbon sequestration to community composition and is especially important in aquatic ecosystems. Lake Michigan has seen dramatic fluctuations in dissolved silica (dSi) over several decades, which have been examined in the context of planktonic processes (diatom blooms), but the role of benthic organisms (macroalgae and their epiphytes) in Si cycling have not been explored. To assess significance of nearshore benthic algae in Si dynamics, we assembled dSi data from an offshore site sampled since the late 1980's, and sampled off three Milwaukee beaches during 2005-19. Using colorimetric assays and alkaline digestion, we measured dSi, biogenic silica in particulate suspended material (pSi) and biogenic silica in benthic macroalgae (Cladophora) and epiphytic diatoms (bSi). Offshore, dSi increased about 1 mu M per year from 25 mu M in the late 1980's to nearly 40 mu M in 2019. Nearshore dSi fluctuated dramatically annually, from near zero to concentrations similar to offshore. Both Cladophora and its epiphytes contained significant bSi, reaching up to 30% of dry mass (300 mg Si g dry mass(-1)) of the assemblage in summer. Microscopic analyses including localization with a Si-specific-stain and X-ray microanalysis showed bSi in epiphytic diatom cells walls, but the nature and localization of Si in macroalgae remained unclear. A simple model was developed estimating Si demand of algae using the areal macroalgal biomass, growth rates inferred from P-content, and bSi content, and comparing Si demand with dSi available in the water column. This indicated that 7-70% of the dSi in water overlying nearshore benthic algal beds could be removed per day. Key elements of the Si cycle, including which organisms sequester bSi and how rapidly Si is recycled, remain unclear. This work has implications for coastal marine waters where large macroalgal biomass accumulates but bSi content is virtually unknown.

Surface ice motion deviating toward the margins during speed-up events at Gornergletscher, Switzerland	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												High frequency ice flow measurements during speed-up events in Gornergletscher, Switzerland, revealed intriguing ice motion which has never been reported in detail before. During the summer 2005, more than a 100% flow speed increase was observed three times at four GPS stations installed across Gornergletscher. The speed-ups were accompanied by a decimeter scale surface uplift. Two of the events were triggered by intensive surface melt and rainfall, while the third one was due to the outburst of Gornersee, a glacier-dammed lake located 2 km upglacier. An interesting observation was ice motion deviating toward the side margins during the events. As the glacier accelerated, a transverse (cross glacier) velocity component was generated, turning the flow direction away from the central flow line toward the margins. When the glacier decelerated, the transverse velocity component reversed so that the ice flowed back to the azimuth of the initial flow direction. In the most significant case, the trajectory of the survey stake deviated from the original track by 0.2 m in the transverse direction. We hypothesize that the observed lateral ice motion was caused by locally elevated subglacial water pressure. When the ice sole decoupled from the bed at a part of the glacier, a point source of vertical displacement was transmitted to the surface through viscous ice. This caused the transverse as well as vertical surface motion, as observed in ground motion during magma intrusion. The hypothesis was tested with a two-dimensional ice flow model applied to the transverse glacier cross section. The model confirmed that the surface ice would move toward the margins as observed in Gornergletscher, if subglacial water pressure exceeded the ice overburden pressure over a limited part of the bed.

J	KEMPEMA, EW; HOLMAN, RA				KEMPEMA, EW; HOLMAN, RA			VIDEO MONITORING OF NEARSHORE ICE IN SOUTHERN LAKE-MICHIGAN	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We set up a time-lapse video camera system on the southwestern shore of Lake Michigan for 16 days in January and February 1991 to monitor ice conditions. The system was used to determine longshore and cross-shore ice-drift rates in a zone of mobile brash and slush ice on 11 days. Daily mean longshore ice drift was to the southeast on 10 of these days at speeds ranging between 0.047 and 0.377 m s-1. Mean cross-shore ice drift was always offshore and varied between 0.009 and 0.126 m s-1. Shear and strain were rare in the brash/slush zone. On 6 of the days when drift rates were determined, we were also able to determine the width of the brash/slush zone. Using these data along with published values of ice thickness, ice concentration, and sediment concentration in ice, we were able to estimate longshore and cross-shore sand fluxes and longshore sand transport rates. The longshore and cross-shore ice-induced sand fluxes ranged from 0.008 to 0.760 t hr-1 and 0.0016 to 0.096 t hr-1, respectively. Net ice-induced longshore sand transport was to the south at rates of 1.8 to 83.7 t hr-1. Measured cross-shore sand flux was consistently offshore. The calculated fluxes indicate that large amounts of sand are moved alongshore and offshore by ice in southernwestern Lake Michigan during the winter months.																			0380-1330						1994	20	1					196	205		10.1016/S0380-1330(94)71140-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(94)71140-0													WOS:A1994NL34800015
J	Peterson, SA; Urquhart, NS				Peterson, SA; Urquhart, NS			Estimating trophic state proportions of a regional lake population: Are larger samples always better?	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												During the summers of 1991-1994, the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) sampled 344 lakes throughout the northeastern United States using a proportional stratified sampling design based on lake size. Approximately one-quarter of the 344 lakes were sampled each year (4 years) for total phosphorus to determine the proportion (and associated 95% confidence intervals) of the northeast lake population greater than or equal to 1 ha (11,076 +/- 1,699 lakes) that was in oligotrophic, mesotrophic, eutrophic, or heupereutropic (4 classes) condition according to the total phosphorus criteria of the North America Lake Manegement Society. Estimates for the second, third, and fourth yr were developed as cumulative of the previous yr samples and the current yr samples for the northeast as a whole and for each of its three ecoregions (4 regions). New confidence intervals were computed for each cumulative yr condition estimate. This produced a total (4 years x 4 classes x 4 regions) of 64 cumulative yr tropic condition estimates. Confidence intervals for 21% of these estimates did not shorten with increased sample size. This phenomena raised questions about the accuracy of estimates based on cumulative sampling procedures. We explain why and how the phenomenon comes about with both straight random and proportional random sampling. Further, we present an example of the effects this phenomenon has on lake tropic state condition estimates in the northeastern United States.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				MAY	2000	62	1					71	89		10.1023/A:1006298230353	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1006298230353													WOS:000085980300005

The soil arthropod community in the Mefite Geological Site (Italy), characterized by a sulphurous lake and intense degassing, was the focus of this study. In details, the objectives were: i) to characterize soil arthropod community at different distances from the Mefite lake; ii) to identify resilient taxa acting as bioindicators to assess soil ecotoxicity. Soil cores were collected at A) 30m, B) 80m, C) 120m away from the lake; soil organic matter (SOM), and pH, ecotoxicity tests (Lepidium sativum: germination index, elongation inhibition; Folsomia candida: survival, reproduction), and identification of soil arthropods (orders, Collembola families, Protura species) have been carried out. Statistical analyses assessed the impact of sulphurous emissions on soil chemistry, ecotoxicity, and arthropod parameters (community structure, taxa associations, biodiversity indices like Shannon and Simpson, and soil biological quality index - QBS-ar). The results showed: no SOM differences; pH: A < B < C; the highest ecotoxic effects were observed in A for both target species; arthropod community composition and QBS-ar varied notably in A compared to C, with the lowest soil biodiversity found in A. Hypogastruridae (Collembola) showed a clear association with A, while Protura were notably absent in A. This study also provided the first records of 4 Protura species in Campania, updating existing knowledge. Overall, arthropod community biodiversity and composition proved to be effective soil bioindicators in highly acidic conditions, reflecting soil ecotoxicity. In particular, the QBS-ar index demonstrated sensitivity in sulphurous environments.

To date, most sea level reconstructions for the Arabo-Persian Gulf are based on uncalibrated C-14 ages without correction for marine reservoir effects, or lack precision with regard to the effects of neotectonic changes, indicators of sea level used, errors in elevation of sedimentary units used, and the relationship with actual tides. As a consequence, the nature and timing of relative sea level (RSL) changes during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene remain poorly understood. To help address this, we use sea level index points (SLIPs) based on calibrated C-14 ages to present a RSL curve for the central-southern Gulf of Saudi Arabia from coastal sabkha deposits near the archaeological site of Dosariyah. The sediments record rapid transgression during the early Holocene with a mid-Holocene high-stand immediately prior to 6880-6560 cal. BP when the upper limit for the palaeo Mean Highest High tide water (MHHW) was 2.8-3.10 m above present day mean sea level. Transgression continued until shortly after 5575-5310 cal. BP with an upper limit to the palaeo-MHHW of 3.75 m above present sea levels. Thereafter a fall in RSL was recorded, with the regression leading to the progradation of the coastal system and the development of coastal sabkhas. Nonetheless later transgressions are recorded in the region between 4848-4536 and 4335-3949 cal BP. Radiometric dating results from archaeological excavations at Dosariyah, one of the most important Neolithic coastal sites in the Gulf, suggest that occupation of the site during the Neolithic coincides with the mid-Holocene marine transgression (ca. 7200-6500 cal. BP). Whilst the close proximity of the site to the sea may have facilitated maritime exchange activities, occupation of the site was short-lived and the phase of abandonment occurred during a period of rapid RSL rise, which would have transformed the area around Dosariyah into an island or certainly cut it off tidally from the mainland.

J	Paszkowski, CA; Tonn, WM				Paszkowski, CA; Tonn, WM			Community concordance between the fish and aquatic birds of lakes in northern Alberta, Canada: the relative importance of environmental and biotic factors	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Community concordance measures the degree to which patterns in community structure in a set of sites are similar between two different taxonomic groups. Although seldom incorporated into studies of lake ecosystems, aquatic birds can be influenced by the same environmental features of lakes which affect fish and invertebrates, and can interact with these organisms directly as predators, competitors or prey. We surveyed lakes in north-central Alberta, Canada, to determine if co-occurring fish and aquatic bird assemblages displayed concordance, and assessed the relative importance of environmental and biotic factors in contributing to observed concordance. 2. In 41 lakes (3-305 ha), we encountered seven species of fish and thirty-one avian taxa which subsequently were used in multivariate analyses. Fish assemblages dominated by large piscivores were in large deep lakes, whereas fishless lakes and lakes with only small-bodied fish were small and shallow, and thus, prone to winter hypoxia. Bird assemblages displayed three general patterns: (a) small shallow lakes supported a 'core' of widespread species (between three and eight species per lake); (b) large, deep lakes supported more species (between 11 and 16), including large, aerially foraging piscivores; and (c) large, shallow lakes supported the most species (between 15 and 23), including many ducks. 3. Randomization tests of matrix concordance and Mantel tests both showed that fish and bird assemblages were significantly concordant. Concordance reflected the fact that both groups were strongly affected by the same key environmental factors, principally lake size and maximum depth, and to a lesser extent, productivity and geographic isolation. Direct interactions between birds and fish, such as predation and competition, appeared to play much smaller roles in shaping the two assemblages.

Assessing rain-on-snow event dynamics over Alaska using 30 year satellite microwave observations	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Rain-on-snow (ROS) events are characterized by liquid precipitation or condensation onto snow surfaces that can lead to snowmelt and the formation of ice layers. ROS events can directly alter the physical structure and thermal properties of the snowpack, leading to rapid melting and runoff-induced flooding, reduced snow insulation, and permafrost degradation. However, tracking ROS events and regional trends remain uncertain due to limited ground measurements and lack of long-term satellite ROS observations representing vast and remote boreal-Arctic landscapes. We quantified ROS dynamics over Alaska by developing a daily 6 km resolution ROS record using an established gradient ratio polarization approach and 30 year (1988-2017) satellite observations from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Image Sounder (SSMI/S) sensors. The data record captured well-documented ROS events and showed high consistency (R 0.94) with alternative ROS predictions from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS/2 sensors. Analysis showed an overall increasing ROS frequency with significant trends mainly identified during early winter. Notable rises in ROS frequency were also detected in mid-to-high elevation ranges (>400 m above sea level (ASL)), while this increase diminished at higher elevations (>1000 m ASL). Our analysis further confirmed that the warming climate plays a fundamental role in driving these ROS events, with significantly positive correlations between ROS frequency and air temperature. However, the significant correlations did not extend to the Eastern and Western Gulf climate zones of southern Alaska, where the ROS retrievals were likely affected by coastal ocean contamination of SSMI/S observations.

Inland aquatic systems and their fauna at Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve, Western Australia, with emphasis on microinvertebrates	PACIFIC CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Context. Decisions about fauna conservation priorities in a region, and management actions required to facilitate conservation objectives, require as much information as possible about the ecology of fauna species present. Aims. This paper summarises information on the inland aquatic fauna of Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve as part of the process of documenting the Reserve's conservation values. Key Results. Surveys in the early 1990s, and subsequently, show that rivers, creeks, and lakes of the Reserve support a rich aquatic invertebrate fauna. The microinvertebrate community is unusually rich in rotifers and cladocerans. Probably nine Indigenous fish species occur in the Reserve, including the vulnerable Nannatherina balstoni, restricted Galaxias maculatus and critically endangered Galaxias truttaceus. The installation of a vertical slot fish ladder on the Goodga River weir has likely helped these species by expanding available habitat. Although the low nutrient status and relatively deep water of the lakes limit their waterbird value, considered together the Reserve's lakes fall just outside the top 10% of nature reserves in Western Australian for number of waterbird species supported. Conclusions. The richness of aquatic invertebrate species in the Reserve's lakes contrasted with previous results from rivers in south-western Australia and has led to a changed understanding of both the diversity and conservation significance of the inland aquatic invertebrate fauna in Western Australian lakes. Implications. Invertebrate community composition and conservation values are not recognised unless surveyed by people with appropriate taxonomic expertise. Without such surveys the focus of conservation effort and management may be, at least partially, misdirected.

Previously, shoreline inputs were considered minor, as annual river discharges account for only 0.36% of the total hydrologic volume of the lake. However, thermal bar formation and wind shear from prevailing westerlies impound warm waters along the southern coastline, creating a coastal exposure corrider with strong counterclockwise circulation known as the Keweenaw Current. Discharges from rivers and industrial sources are confined, then entrained. Here infared AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) satellite imagery was utilized, verified by NDBC (NOAA National Data Buoy Center) buoy surface data, to document thermal features of offshore waters and the coastal zone. Five stamp mills at Freda/Redridge discharged over 45 million metric tons of stamp sands between 1895 and 1922. The coarse fraction forms beach sands that now extend 23 kilometers north from their sources and that blanket shallow-water sandy sediments. The finer fractions disperse much farther than the coarse fractions, moving along the primary track of the Kewwwnaw Current. The two particle types have distinctive reflective spectra. An additional transport mechanism, revealed by RADARSAT ScanSAR (Synthetic Aperature Rader) imagery, is ice rafting. Nearshore ice incorporates large amounts of coastal sands and deeper-water sediments. Spring break-up of coastal ice results in large drifting ice packs that are pushed by prevailing westerlies and currents around the tip of the Keweenaw Peninsula into the Caribou Basin.																			0380-1330						1999	25	4					642	662		10.1016/S0380-1330(99)70768-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(99)70768-9													WOS:000085976300006

A machine learning approach to nearshore wave modeling in large lakes using land-based wind observations	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												This study presents a novel machine learning-based (ML) framework that utilizes the ConvLSTM-1D model to simulate wave heights at a nearshore location in Lake Michigan using a nonuniform land-based array of wind observations from a broad geographic region as an input. This approach was applied to Lake Michigan to perform a 70-year ice-free hindcast of waves near Chicago, IL (USA). Because of annual winter gaps in Great Lakes buoy observations, output from the Wave Information System model (WIS) was used for the training, validation, and testing of the ML model. Models with different numbers of wind stations were tested, showing that a single wind station as an input feature produced a reasonably accurate wave height. However, the wave height model accuracy increased as more wind input data was included from around the lake, largely plateauing beyond the inclusion of four stations that spanned Lake Michigan's southern basin. The optimized model lookback period was found to be 10 h for all models, suggestive of a fetch-limited temporal coupling between the wind observations and nearshore waves. The extended time series showed a statistically significant increase in the interannual standard deviation of the storm wave height and the storm height over the mean wave height while no correlation was found with the annual water level time series. The ML framework offers a promising avenue for utilizing historical wind records to extend wave height time series for nearshore locations, particularly in enclosed and semi-enclosed basins where waves are strongly linked to local winds.																			0380-1330					AUG	2025	51	4							102445	10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102445	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102445		AUG 2025											WOS:001540922200037
J	Cao, XY; Song, CL; Zhou, YY				Cao, Xiuyun; Song, Chunlei; Zhou, Yiyong			Limitations of using extracellular alkaline phosphatase activities as a general indicator for describing P deficiency of phytoplankton in Chinese shallow lakes	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYCOLOGY												Extracellular phosphatase can be produced by phytoplankton to utilize organic phosphorus under phosphorus (P) deficiency. However, there is a controversy about its use as an indicator of P deficiency in natural phytoplankton community inferred by such an "induction-repression" mechanism. Size-fractionation of alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentration, algal density, and composition were determined in six Chinese shallow lakes ranking in gradient of trophic status, where a positive relationship between SRP concentration and algal density was observed. Enzyme-labeled fluorescence (ELF) method was used to localize phosphatase on cell membrane of algae. The so-called algal APA that associated with coarser particle (> 3.0 A mu m) accounted for the largest part of total APA. Within a lake with lower SRP concentration, the "induction-repression" mechanism held true. Contrastingly, both algal and total APA were positively related to SRP concentration based on the data across all study lakes with statistical significance, which may be explained firstly by algal composition. The lakes with higher SRP concentration were dominated by diatoms and green algae, while they easily produced extracellular phosphatases as evidenced by ELFA labeling. In parallel, the lakes with lower SRP concentration were dominated by cyanobacteria, while it was never ELFA-positive; secondly, ELFA-positive dots or structures suggested that, in lakes with higher trophic status, attached bacteria or heterotrophic microorganisms could substantially contribute to extracellular phosphatases for hydrolyzing organophosphoric compounds but probably utilizing the organic moiety as an organic carbon source. This process simultaneously produces inorganic P, leading to the co-occurrence of high phosphate concentration and APA. So, the contributor of APA are complex, which may produce extracellular phosphatase species-specific or not exclusively for P nutrient and consequently make it difficult to normalize APA with the exact biomass estimators. Therefore, it is not reasonable to use APA, normalized or not, as a general indicator for describing P deficiency of phytoplankton in shallow lakes especially eutrophic ones.																			0921-8971	1573-5176				FEB	2010	22	1					33	41		10.1007/s10811-009-9422-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-009-9422-0													WOS:000274435300004

Within a chronologic framework provided by magnetostratigraphy, we analyzed the carbonate delta O-18 and geochemical element contents of 243 sediment samples from the NHA drill core in the Nihewan Basin, and combined them with grain size and magnetic susceptibility records. Our results revealed the paleoclimatic characteristics in the Nihewan Basin during 3.66-2.89 Ma for the first time. The interval of 3.58-3.31 Ma had the warmest and most stable climate during this interval, with low-amplitude fluctuations in all proxies, and with the following general characteristics: delta O-18 <-8 parts per thousand, CIA > 40%, Rb/Sr > 0.3, Sigma REE > 180 mu g/g, and TiO2 > 0.7%). The climate remained warm overall during 3.31-3.10 Ma, but there were three pronounced cold events (at similar to 3.30 Ma, similar to 3.23 Ma, and similar to 3.14 Ma) with the following general characteristics: delta O-18 > -7 parts per thousand, CIA < 35%, Rb/Sr < 0.2, Sigma REE < 160 mu g/g, TiO2 < 0.6%). These events are correlative with increases in global ice volume, corresponding respectively to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) M2, KM6, and KM2. The climate cooled substantially after 3.10 Ma, and most of the proxy index values were close to those during the three previous cold events. We ascribe this to increases in global ice volume and the strengthening of the East Asian winter monsoon.

Holocene carbon dynamics at the forest-steppe ecotone of southern Siberia	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												The forest-steppe ecotone in southern Siberia is highly sensitive to climate change; global warming is expected to push the ecotone northwards, at the same time resulting in degradation of the underlying permafrost. To gain a deeper understanding of long-term forest-steppe carbon dynamics, we use a highly resolved, multiproxy, palaeolimnological approach, based on sediment records from Lake Baikal. We reconstruct proxies that are relevant to understanding carbon dynamics including carbon mass accumulation rates (CMAR; g C m(-2) yr(-1)) and isotope composition of organic matter (delta C-13(TOC)). Forest-steppe dynamics were reconstructed using pollen, and diatom records provided measures of primary production from near-and off-shore communities. We used a generalized additive model (GAM) to identify significant change points in temporal series, and by applying generalized linear leastsquares regression modelling to components of the multiproxy data, we address (1) What factors influence carbon dynamics during early Holocene warming and late Holocene cooling? (2) How did carbon dynamics respond to abrupt sub-Milankovitch scale events? and (3) What is the Holocene carbon storage budget for Lake Baikal. CMAR values range between 2.8 and 12.5 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Peak burial rates (and greatest variability) occurred during the early Holocene, associated with melting permafrost and retreating glaciers, while lowest burial rates occurred during the neoglacial. Significant shifts in carbon dynamics at 10.3, 4.1 and 2.8 kyr BP provide compelling evidence for the sensitivity of the region to sub-Milankovitch drivers of climate change. We estimate that 1.03 Pg C was buried in Lake Baikal sediments during the Holocene, almost one-quarter of which was buried during the early Holocene alone. Combined, our results highlight the importance of understanding the close linkages between carbon cycling and hydrological processes, not just temperatures, in southern Siberian environments.					; Piotrowska, Natalia/S-4528-2018; Swann, George/B-2794-2011; Rioual, Patrick/H-5140-2018	Leng, Melanie/0000-0003-1115-5166; Piotrowska, Natalia/0000-0002-8194-6767; Mackay, Anson/0000-0002-6328-769X; Swann, George/0000-0002-4750-9504; Rioual, Patrick/0000-0001-9491-9197													1354-1013	1365-2486				MAY	2017	23	5					1942	1960		10.1111/gcb.13583	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.13583								27935187					WOS:000397800600016

There were zones of open water (Unvegetated Zone) as well as zones of rush and aquatic vegetation (Vegetated Zone) distinguished in the examined ponds. The influence of the rush vegetation, nymphaeids and elodeids on the abiotic parameters of an aquatic environment was examined. Water samples were taken during the summer of 2004 from 12 stations within the open water and 24 within macrophytes. The plant matter was randomly collected in triplicate from the central part of the vegetated stand. The influence of macrophytes on the abiotic features of water was estimated using the parameter of the plant length (cm l(-1)) and the plant biomass (g l(-1)). In the studied ponds 12 aquatic macrophyte communities were distinguished. A salient feature of submerged macrophytes was a great density of plant stems along with considerebly low biomass, however, the rush vegetation (Phragmitetum communis, Typhetum latifoliae) when compared to nymphaeids (Polygonetum natantis, Potametum natantis) and elodeids (Potametum lucentis) was characterised by lower stem densities and higher biomass. The water bodies were alkaline and of pronounced hardness. In most of them high trophy conditions were found with especially high concentrations of phosphorus (96 mu g l(-1) on average). There was significant differentiation in the water chemistry (mainly in respect to mineral compounds) between the Vegetated and Unvegetated Zones as well as between particular aquatic macrophyte communities.					; Kuczyńska-Kippen, Natalia/AAC-1955-2022; Joniak, Tomasz/K-5802-2019	Joniak, Tomasz/0000-0001-7395-1585; Kuczynska-Kippen, Natalia/0000-0002-0513-9461													0018-8158					JUN	2007	584						101	109		10.1007/s10750-007-0595-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-007-0595-8													WOS:000246583500011
J	Zhou, Z				Zhou, Zibanai			Perceptions of tourism business managers towards the impacts of climate change in selected tourist sites in Zimbabwe	ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY												Climate change remains a significant challenge, which threatens the tourism sector in Zimbabwe. This study employs the destination sustainability theory to examine the perceptions of tourism business managers on the impacts of climate change on tourism activities in selected tourist centres in Zimbabwe. A qualitative research approach was adopted in which in-depth interviews were conducted with 30 managerial employees selected through purposive and snow ball sampling strategies. Participants were drawn from multiple study sites, namely Nyanga and Chimanimani; Hwange, Victoria Falls, and Binga; Kariba, Lake Chivero, Mana pools; and Gonarezhou. Findings showed that the perception of tourism facilities managers towards climate change were varied, with managers mostly concerned about climate change induced risk of flooding, shortened tourists vacation time, delayed opening of facilities, damage to supportive tourism infrastructure, loss of biodiversity and reduced capacity utilisation. Additionally, findings reveal that tourism is highly sensitive and vulnerable to the impacts of climate change in the selected study sites due to mediating variables encompassing over-dependence on tourism resources sensitive to climate change, an undiversified tourism market base, and reliance on outdoor tourist activities, coupled with other site specific variables. Overall, tourist sites lack adaptive capacity to recover from the impacts of climate change, hence the adoption of a wide range of smart climate change proofing strategies, notably sinking of boreholes to alleviate water shortages, translocation of wildlife, clearing blocked roads, rehabilitating damaged bridges, investing in energy saving appliances, and green energy. The findings of the study underscore the need for tourism facilities managers to adopt a climate change centric approach when developing climate change proofing strategies to enhance the sustainability and resilience of the sector.

Tracking ∼200 years of water quality in Muskrat Lake, a eutrophic lake trout lake in Ontario (Canada) with cyanobacterial blooms	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Simmatis B, Nelligan C, Ruhland KM, Jeziorski A, Castro V, Paterson AM, Smol JP. 2020. Tracking similar to 200 years of water quality in Muskrat Lake, a eutrophic lake trout lake in Ontario (Canada) with cyanobacterial blooms. Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XXX-XXX. Muskrat Lake is a deep (64 m), eutrophic lake in southeastern Ontario, Canada, that supports a natural lake trout population. Frequent algal blooms and low deep-water dissolved oxygen concentrations have generated management concerns. Based on anecdotal reports, algal blooms first occurred in the 1920s. Concern regarding recreational activities has escalated since the early 1980s. Monitoring records for total phosphorus (TP) and dissolved oxygen concentrations are sparse, requiring paleolimnological methods to extend our knowledge of past lake conditions. We inferred trends in past whole-lake primary production using visual-range spectroscopy-inferred chlorophyll a, nutrients using diatom assemblage changes, and end-of-summer volume-weighted hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations (VWHO) using chironomids to assess environmental conditions in Muskrat Lake over the past similar to 200 years. Diatom taxa indicative of mesotrophic conditions were present throughout the sedimentary record, which suggests that Muskrat Lake was moderately productive before European settlement, with conditions worsening somewhat after ca. 1920, following land clearance and agricultural development. Chironomid-inferred VWHO trends suggest that the hypolimnion was not naturally well oxygenated, but deep-water oxygen levels declined further after ca. 1900 following European settlement. After ca. 1990, changes in diatom assemblage composition were consistent with climate-mediated increases in thermal lake properties, which might have contributed to cyanobacterial dominance. Whole-lake primary production increased after ca. 1900 and peaked ca. 1960, remaining stable until ca. 2006, after which it declined. Overall, Muskrat Lake has been productive over the past similar to 200 years, but the cumulative effects of changes in nutrient loading and mixing patterns should be considered in future management decisions.					; Smol, John/A-8838-2015; Jeziorski, Adam/AAJ-6982-2020	Simmatis, Brigitte/0000-0003-2078-1724; 													1040-2381	2151-5530				JUL 2	2020	36	3			SI		260	277		10.1080/10402381.2020.1755749	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2020.1755749		MAY 2020											WOS:000535347100001
J	Chen, QQ; Zhu, RB; Wang, Q; Xu, H				Chen, Qingqing; Zhu, Renbin; Wang, Qing; Xu, Hua			Methane and nitrous oxide fluxes from four tundra ecotopes in Ny-Alesund of the High Arctic	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												During the summers of 2008 and 2009, net methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes were investigated from 4 tundra ecotopes: normal lowland tundra (LT), bird sanctuary tundra (BT), the tundra in an abandoned coal mine (CT) and the tundra in scientific bases (ST) in Ny-Alesund of the High Arctic. Tundra soils in CT (184.5 +/- 40.0 mu g CH4/(m(2).hr)) and ST (367.6 +/- 92.3 mu g CH4/(m(2).hr)) showed high CH4 emissions due to the effects of human activities, whereas high CH4 uptake or low emission occurred in the soils of LT and BT. The lowland tundra soils (mean, -4.4-4.3 mu g N2O/(m(2).hr)) were weak N2O sources and even sinks. Bird activity increased N2O emissions from BT with the mean flux of 7.9 mu g N2O/(m(2).hr). The mean N2O fluxes from CT (45.4 +/- 10.2 mu g N2O/(m(2).hr)) and ST (78.8 +/- 18.5 mu g N2O/(m(2).hr)) were one order of magnitude higher than those from LT and BT, indicating that human activities significantly increased N2O emissions from tundra soils. Soil total carbon and water regime were important factors affecting CH4 fluxes from tundra soils. The N2O fluxes showed a significant positive correlation with ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) contents (r = 0.66, p < 0.001) at all the observation sites, indicating that ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) content acted as a strong predictor for N2O emissions from tundra soils. The CH4 and N2O fluxes did not correspond to the temperature variations of soil at 0-15 cm depths. Overall our results implied that human activities might have greater effects on soil CH4 and N2O emissions than current climate warming in Ny-Alesund, High Arctic.

Climate, catchment runoff and limnological drivers of carbon and oxygen isotope composition of diatom frustules from the central Andean Altiplano during the Lateglacial and Early Holocene	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Diatom-based carbon and oxygen isotope analyses (delta C-13(diatom) and delta O-18(diatom)) were performed on diatomrich laminated sediments of Lake Chungara (Andean Altiplano, northern Chile) deposited during the Lateglacial and Early Holocene (12,400-8300 cal years BP) to reconstruct climate change and environmental response across this major climate transition. The delta C-13(diatom) data show both centennial-to-millennial scale changes related to fluctuations in lake productivity and CO2 concentration in the lake water, and variations in carbon sources to the lake through time. The delta O-18(diatom) data reflect changes in lake hydrology and climate. The combination of delta C-13(diatom) and delta O-18(diatom) data reveals interactions between the internal lake processes and its catchment runoff. During wet periods (low delta O-18(diatom) values) delta C-13(diatom) indicates an enhanced contribution of allochthonous carbon, whereas during dry periods (high delta O-18(diatom)) delta C-13(diatom) values suggest more autochthonous carbon production and recycling. These decadal-to-centennial oscillations are not recognized after 10,000 cal years BP, possibly as a result of ENSO-like phenomenon weakening. Humid conditions during the Lateglacial-Early Holocene transition (12,400-10,100 cal years BP) were possibly due to the establishment of La Nina-like conditions in the tropical South Pacific. Whereas, dry conditions in the Early Holocene (10,100-9100 cal years BP) may be caused by the northward migration of the ITCZ due to both ENSO-like weakening and an insolation minimum. Finally, a return to humid conditions at the end of the Early Holocene (9100-8300 cal years BP) is coincident with an increase in summer insolation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Intraspecific models and spatiotemporal context of size - mass relationships in adult dragonflies	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY												Length-mass equations are valued for their efficiency and reliability because many animals, including aquatic macroinvertebrates, show predictable correlations between mass and linear body dimensions. Our paper explores overlooked aspects of length-mass applications, including relationships for adult aquatic insects, intraspecific variation, and spatiotemporal context. We analyzed the length-mass relationship in 5 species of adult dragonfly (Anisoptera: Libellulidae) during 2 collection periods (early and late summer flight) at 3 study locations in northern Mississippi, USA. Despite narrow ranges in body and wing length, and given that dragonflies gain postemergence mass without associated changes in skeletal size, both body and wing length showed potential for estimating individual dry mass (R-2 >= 0.5 in most cases). We also found strong associations between dry and wet length and consistent variation in individual dry mass as a percentage of individual wet mass (similar to 65% water content) in these samples. Species-level mass estimates from independently derived species-level equations were far more accurate than estimates based on previously published equations for use at higher taxonomic levels (family, order). Patterns of individual mass per unit length generally differed among study locations and, especially, collection periods. Regression models with similar slopes (i.e., similar individual differences in mass per unit length) were susceptible to length-adjusted location or time effects (i.e., elevation differences in the best-fit lines). Our study underscores the importance of intraspecific variation, taxonomic resolution, and spatiotemporal context in length-based modeling of adult dragonfly mass.

J	Ufimtsev, GF; Skovitina, TM; Kulchitsky, AA				Ufimtsev, GF; Skovitina, TM; Kulchitsky, AA			Rockfall-dammed lakes in the Baikal region: Evidence from the past and prospects for the future	NATURAL HAZARDS												The mountain province of East Siberia, which includes the Baikal Rift system, is a zone of high tectonic and seismic hazard. Earthquakes and coseismic faulting are dangerous not only by themselves but also as far as they initiate rock collapse and downslope movement of unconsolidated deposits, which may block river valleys and produce rockfall-dammed lakes. Within some rifts of the rift system, evidence of past dammed lakes was discovered that arose instantly, in a geological sense, and flooded large areas of forest. In mountains around some rift basins, small living dammed lakes were encountered, as well as traces of catastrophic debris flows that may have accompanied breaching of earlier collapse-produced dams. Analysis of geomorphological setting in the region, especially in the Muya Rift Basin, revealed conditions favourable to hazardous origination of rockfall-dammed lakes. A large dammed lake may come into existence due to the collapse of bedrock over the narrow antecedent valley of Vitim in the Muya Rift. Preliminary estimates based upon data on the Vitim River discharge showed that the lake might form in as short as 27 days, though the rapidity of its formation, and hence the degree of the risk, can vary as a function of the highly variable amount of summer discharge of the river. Rockfall-dammed lakes may also originate in the Boors of Chara and Tunka Rift Basins. Due to their rapid formation, lakes will bring about extensive flooding and cause danger to the taiga, railways and constructions in this populated developing area, and will cause degradation of the permafrost.

However, metabarcoding studies of avian biodiversity using eDNA have received little attention. In this study, we compared waterbird biodiversity derived from eDNA metabarcoding with that obtained from traditional point counting surveys at 23 sites in Tai Lake of eastern China and evaluated the accuracy of eDNA metabarcoding for waterbird community studies. The point counting method recorded a higher total number of waterbird species (22) compared to the eDNA technique (16). While eDNA achieved a 74.5% detection rate for waterbird species and was able to identify a significantly greater number of species (12.48 +/- 1.97) at each sampling site than point counting method (6.13 +/- 2.69), particularly highlighting several rare and elusive species, it failed to detect some species commonly observed by the point counting method. The alpha diversity analysis revealed no significant differences in waterbird diversity between the eDNA method and the point counting method, except that the eDNA method exhibited lower Pielou evenness. Waterbird eDNA sequencing abundance correlated significantly with species occurrence, whereas Spearman's analysis indicated no significant difference between eDNA sequence abundance and species abundance from the point counting method. eDNA method detected no significant difference in waterbird composition between sampling sites, while the point counting method revealed significant differences. Consequently, eDNA is an effective complementary tool for assessing the diversity of wintering waterbirds in lakes, though it is unable to capture the full diversity of waterbird communities. It is crucial to develop sampling strategies that comprehensively monitor species composition and integrate eDNA with traditional survey methods for accurate evaluation of community structure.																			2053-7166					JUN	2025	16	2							100236	10.1016/j.avrs.2025.100236	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.avrs.2025.100236													WOS:001471090300001

However, key population groups, including people living in fishing communities, continue to face an elevated risk of infection and have high rates of undiagnosed disease. We set out to investigate how intersecting inequalities make young fishermen working on the southern shores of Lake Malawi particularly vulnerable to HIV-infection. We used qualitative research methods including observations (over a 15-month period), in-depth interviews (59) and focus group discussions (16) with a range of male and female participants living and working in two fishing villages. We found that the roles that men occupied in the fishing industry depended on several factors, including their age, socio-economic position and the amount of experience they had in the industry. In turn these roles shaped their lives, including exposure to occupational risks, mobility, living conditions, economic remuneration and social standing within the community. In this context, younger and poorer men occupied roles with the lowest social standing in the industry. Nevertheless, in these communities where poverty was pervasive, young fishermen were able to exert the power they gained through access to money and fish over poorer younger women - pressuring them into sex and increasing the risk of HIV for both men and women. Drawing on an intersectionality framework, we contextualised these findings to consider how young men's social location, relationships and experiences of both privilege and marginalisation were shaped by broader economic and political processes. We conclude that interventions to prevent HIV in fishing communities need to address how power plays out in the broader social and economic environment.					; Desmond, Nicola/GYQ-8574-2022; Seeley, Janet/B-4467-2013	Sadalaki, John/0000-0002-8860-2924; Desmond, Nicola/0000-0002-2874-8569; MacPherson, Eleanor/0000-0002-7142-1158; Lalloo, David/0000-0001-7680-2200; Theobald, Sally/0000-0002-9053-211X; Seeley, Janet/0000-0002-0583-5272													0277-9536	1873-5347				DEC	2020	266								113429	10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113429	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113429								33099188					WOS:000592409800016

The TIC concentration is inferred to reflect temperatures over the lake region and an increase in the TIC concentration implies an increase in the temperature. TOC concentration is considered to reflect the precipitation in the lake basin and higher TOC concentrations denote more precipitations. Thus AMS C-14 time series of the TIC and TOC records of Daihai Lake sediments uncovers a detailed history of changes in temperature and precipitation in north- central China during the last c. 12 000 yr. The Holocene, an epoch of postglacial warmth, started c. 11 500 cal. yr BP, and can be subdivided into three stages: the early ( c. 11 500 - 8100 cal. yr BP), middle ( c. 8100 - 3300 cal. yr BP) and the late Holocene ( c. 3300 - 0 cal. yr BP). The climate was warm and dry during the early Holocene, warm and wet during the middle Holocene, and in the late Holocene became cooler and drier but displayed a relatively warmer and wetter interval between c. 1700 and 1300 cal. yr BP. The Holocene Climatic Optimum, defined as a postglacial episode of both megathermal and megahumid climate, might have occurred in north- central China between c. 8100 and 3300 cal. yr BP, and the climate during this period was variable and punctuated by cool and/ or dry events. We infer that changes in the temperature were directly controlled by changes in summer solar radiation in the Northern Hemisphere resulting from progressive changes in the Earth's orbital parameters. Whereas an increase in the monsoonal precipitation could be closely related to an increase in the sea surface temperature of the low- latitude Pacific Ocean, an increase in the temperature and size of the Western Pacific Warm Pool and a westward shifted and strengthened Kuroshio Current in the western Pacific.																			0959-6836	1477-0911				JUN	2006	16	4					551	560		10.1191/0959683606hl950rp	http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683606hl950rp													WOS:000238438800008

Disease prevalence in flounder (Platichthys flesus) from the Dutch Wadden Sea as indicator of environmental quality: A summary of 1988-2005 surveys	JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH												In 1988, epizootics of ulcer disease in the flatfish flounder in the Dutch Wadden Sea were reported near freshwater drainage sluices of IJsselmeer Lake, locally affecting up to 38.9% of fish. Other diseases such as fin rot and lymphocystis were less frequent, but followed a similar pattern. Results of follow-up surveys in the Wadden Sea in 1994-2005 confirm previous findings and also show significantly elevated ulcer prevalences at other smaller drainage works. The most likely stress factors that contributed to the development of the epizootics at these sites include osmotic stress, adverse water quality conditions including chemical contaminants, nutritional deficiencies, and obstruction to fish migration. It was shown that discharges of IJsselmeer Lake freshwater in 1988-96 had a wide effect on the prevalence and distribution of ulcers and lymphocystis in the western Wadden Sea. A general reduction in disease prevalence in flounder in the entire Dutch Wadden Sea was observed during 1988-2005, which was most likely due to a general improvement in water quality and locally improved habitat conditions for flounder near drainage sluices. Ulcer prevalences outside the two IJsselmeer Lake sluices (Den Oever and Kornwerderzand) declined in this period from approximately 30% to 10% for medium-sized fish. Other skin diseases have also displayed a downward trend at both sites in recent years, with prevalences falling sharply to below 1%. Elsewhere in the Wadden Sea and the Ems-Dollard estuary, disease prevalences have declined towards natural background levels (<1%). It is concluded that skin diseases, especially ulcers, are useful indicators of environmental quality in the Wadden Sea. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Particularly interesting are effects on clay formation because clays are abundant and have high surface-to-volume ratio, resulting in clays making up a large fraction of the overall mineral-fluid interface and having an effective control of mineral reactions. Thus, biological control on clay composition would affect element budget globally and the mineralogy of subsequent diagenetic processes. Biological acceleration of clay production would result in enhanced clay control of mineral reactions and faster organic C sequestration, by adsorption on clay minerals, with implications for the C and related cycles. We investigated the combined effect of microbial activity and water chemistry on the composition of neoformed clay by reacting volcanic glass with natural waters covering a large composition range (fresh water from a lake and a spring, seawater, and hypersaline water). The microbes (bacteria, fungi, and algae) were totally or partially identified using molecular and microscopy techniques. The solid alteration products were analyzed using cryo-SEM to investigate the mineral-microbe interface and TEM-AEM to study the composition of the neoformed clay. The solution chemistry was also investigated. We found that clay composition was controlled mainly by glass chemistry, rather than biological activity, through a mechanism of in situ transformation. The resulting clay was Al-rich (dioctahedral composition). In one case (inorganic experiment, freshwater lake), the specific inorganic conditions of pH and Mg and Si concentration promoted formation of Mg-rich (trioctahedral clay). Microbes, however, did influence clay composition by confining glass grains in biofilms where water chemistry is significantly different from the bulk solution. Alteration in such conditions generated significant amounts of trioctahedral, Mg-rich clay in the hypersaline water experiment, whereas it favored production of dioctahedral, Al-rich clay in the freshwater lake experiment. It is thus demonstrated that biofilms can exert an effective control on clay mineralogy.

J	Allum, DJM; Stastna, M				Allum, Donovan J. M.; Stastna, Marek			Radiatively Driven Convection: A Comparison Between Two- and Three-Dimensional Simulations	ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN												At the end of winter as solar radiation and increasing air temperatures melt the snow layer above the ice, significant radiation from the sun is able to enter the water column. In the cold water regime ($T\lt 4<^>{\circ }$T<4 degrees C, where $4<^>{\circ }$4 degrees C is the freshwater temperature of maximum density) increasing the temperature also increases the density. Therefore, adding heat near the surface results in radiatively driven convection (RDC). This process under ice has received attention recently due to both its uniqueness (solar radiation driving convection that is shielded from wind), and its sensitivity to climate change (i.e. the narrow temperature range over which it can occur). We report on direct numerical simulations designed to compare RDC in 2D and 3D. Our work demonstrates that a volumetric forcing term leads to a Rayleigh-Taylor-like instability whereby heat is exchanged with a motionless ambient below. 2D simulations have significantly less viscous dissipation and larger convective velocities, compared to 3D simulations, but the depth of the convective layer grows at a similar rate. Upwelling plumes are largely irrotational, contributing to most - but not all - of the difference in viscous dissipation between 2D and 3D. In 3D, large convective plumes persist, but the features are significantly smaller scale and upwelling plumes are rotational and dissipative. The research shows that if broad features like the evolution of the depth of a convective layer are of interest, 2D simulations may be sufficient. However, modellers should be cautious about using 2D simulations to accurately describe turbulent motions and transport under ice, and should opt for 3D for a more complete description where possible.																			0705-5900	1480-9214				MAY 27	2025	63	3					159	171		10.1080/07055900.2025.2507883	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07055900.2025.2507883		JUN 2025											WOS:001504238400001

Using an echosounder, we captured the short-term, massive loss of submerged macrophytes attributed to the abnormal fluctuation of the water level induced by the approach of a catastrophic super typhoon in the southern basin of Lake Biwa, Japan. This paper investigates the physical processes responsible for the loss of vegetation using a high-resolution circulation model in Lake Biwa as a pilot study area. The circulation model was coupled with dynamical models of the fluid force and erosion acting on the vegetation. Our simulation successfully reproduced the water level fluctuation and high-speed current (torrent) generated by the typhoon gale. The simulated results demonstrated that the fluid force driven by the gale-induced torrent uprooted submerged macrophytes during the typhoon approach and that this fluid force (rather than erosion) caused the outflow of vegetation. As a result, this uprooting attributed to the fluid force induced the massive loss of submerged macrophytes in a large area of the southern basin, which might have increased primary production and reduced the stock of fish such as bluegill in the lake. Our model can estimate the reduction in the macrophyte height within the range of - 1.3 to - 0.4 m, suggesting that fluid forces greater than the time-averaged value (1.24 x 10(-4) N) were available. Flow speeds of approximately 0.8 m/s might be the critical value that induces the fluid force acting on the uprooting of the submerged macrophytes. Our approach is practical for evaluating changes in lake environments attributed to the massive outflow of submerged macrophytes under various climate change scenarios.																			2197-4284					AUG 16	2021	8	1							46	10.1186/s40645-021-00440-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40645-021-00440-9													WOS:000686640900001

K.; Fielding, Christopher R.; Yang, Mingyu			Origin, distribution, and significance of brine in the subsurface of Antarctica	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Brine formed through the cryogenic concentration of seawater remains one of the least understood components of Earth's cryosphere. Cryogenic brine is a prominent feature of the McMurdo region of Antarctica, where it has been documented below the Taylor Glacier, in numerous ice-covered lakes in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, and in an extensive, seaward-flowing groundwater system in the Taylor Valley. A much larger and less studied body of brine exists offshore in the McMurdo Sound subsurface, where it saturates the pore space and has precipitated intergranular cement in Cenozoic glaciomarine strata deep within the Victoria Land Basin. This review examines the nature and distribution of brine in the McMurdo region to assess its volume, genesis, and significance. Constraints on subsurface fluid migration are considered in the context of available data. Geochemical data indicate that the brine is the product of seawater freezing, with water-rock interaction and evaporation, espe-cially in the McMurdo Dry Valleys where brines stayed close to the surface, leading to further compositional modification. The volume of brine in the region is currently estimated at 27,000 km(3). However, accounting for the widespread distribution of brine-precipitated carbonate cement requires that a much larger volume of brine moved through the subsurface in the past. Brine geochemistry is consistent with a genetic relationship between brine in the Taylor Valley and offshore in the subsurface of the Victoria Land Basin. Chronostratigraphic con-straints point toward episodic, rather than continuous brine formation. A proposed scenario involves flooding of the McMurdo Dry Valleys during Neogene periods of relative warmth to form fjord-like systems, which were then cut off during subsequent cooling and ice sheet growth. Isolated bodies of seawater were concentrated via freezing to form brine, which percolated into the subsurface and flowed seaward. Among the enduring features that may record the presence of brine in the geologic record, brine-precipitated cement phases hold the most promise for preservation on Earth as well as on Mars.					; Yang, Mingyu/HII-2795-2022	Haacker, Erin/0000-0003-4836-4113; Yang, Mingyu/0000-0002-0565-2820; Frank, Tracy/0000-0002-8422-7389; 													0012-8252	1872-6828				NOV	2022	234								104204	10.1016/j.earscirev.2022.104204	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2022.104204		OCT 2022											WOS:000880565800002

Reconstructing the evolution of an eroded Miocene caldera volcano (Yamanlar volcano, Izmir, Turkey)	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												The Miocene Yamanlar composite volcano is located in the central part of a shear zone in western Turkey. The volcano's deeply-eroded interior provides excellent three-dimensional exposure of a faulted caldera-floor and caldera-fill rocks as well as surrounding extracaldera ignimbrites. We present a much-revised stratigraphy and geological map of Yamanlar in order to quantify the evolutionary stages of the volcano. The Yamanlar volcanic cone was composed of >800 m of basaltic-andesite to andesite lavas and lava domes. The volcano underwent at least one phase of caldera formation associated with an explosive eruption that deposited an ignimbrite sheet within and outside the caldera. Lithofacies architecture analysis is applied to the proximal and medial exposures of the Early-Middle Yamanlar Formation, which occurs outside of the caldera. Field evidence of the succession indicates a caldera-forming eruption. Our results indicate that the formation of the Yamanlar caldera resulted from one major catastrophic eruption that generated several sustained pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) subdivided by fall deposits with sharp contacts. The ignimbrite sheet is composed of four flow units. The presence of numerous coarse-grained lithic-rich horizons within the ignimbrite sheet is consistent with caldera subsidence. Post-caldera volcanism is indicated by intrusions and lava domes erupted along the inferred caldera-bounding faults, some of which record similar to 90 m of displacement. Widespread, coarse-grained breccias that overlie the ignimbrite sheet are interpreted as debris avalanche deposits resulting from gravitational failure of the flanks of the volcano or the caldera wall during or after caldera subsidence.

Measurements of acute tolerance were used to estimate the range of tolerance and indicate the optimum range of survival. Acute tolerance was compared between adult and juvenile over time. In both temperature and salinity trials, the upper limit of tolerance was successfully detected, but this limit was not significantly different between life stages or over exposure times. A minimum temperature increment of 6.4 degrees C above the control temperature (22 degrees C) was detrimental to survival. Similarly, a detrimental effect was observed when salinity increased by 11 PSU above the control salinity (22 PSU). In contrast, animals seem to be more resistant to lower temperature and lower salinity. While the lower limit was found at salinity of 0.2-0.3 PSU in juveniles, this study did not reach the lower limit of temperature and salinity in other studies. Likely, the thermal tolerance of this species is approximately from 4 to 28.4 degrees C while the halo tolerance is estimated not more than 33 PSU. The optimal temperature for survival falls in the range of 4-28 degrees C whereas the optimal salinity occurs from 5 to 30 PSU. In general, this study shows that D. australis is a eurythermal and euryhaline species, but a rapid increase of temperature could threaten its survival. This study contributes to the understanding of the impact of global warming and increasing salinity on the biodiversity of zooplankton fauna in arid regions.

J	RYAN, CA; DOWLING, G				RYAN, CA; DOWLING, G			DROWNING DEATHS IN PEOPLE WITH EPILEPSY	CANADIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL												Objective: To determine the demographic characteristics and risk factors associated with death from drowning among people with epilepsy. Design: Retrospective review of medical examiner's investigations into deaths from drowning from Jan. 1, 198 1, to Dec. 31, 1990. Setting: Alberta. Measures: Personal data, medical history, circumstances surrounding the death, autopsy findings and results of postmortem toxicologic analyses. Results: Of 482 deaths from drowning in Alberta during the study period, 25 (5%) were considered by the medical examiner's office to be directly related to seizures. Fifteen (60%) of the 25 deaths occurred while the person was taking a bath, unsupervised. Only one person (4%) died while taking a shower. The remaining deaths occurred on a river or lake (16%), in a private pool (8%), in a public pool (8%) and in a jacuzzi (4%). Two people fell out of moving boats while having a seizure; neither had been wearing a personal flotation device. Nineteen (83%) of 23 people who had been receiving anticonvulsant drug therapy had undetectable or subtherapeutic levels of one or more of the drugs at autopsy. Ethanol was not a factor in any of the deaths. Conclusions: Seizure-related drownings represent a small but potentially preventable proportion of all drownings. Enhanced seizure control and compliance with anticonvulsant drug therapy may prevent some of these deaths. In addition, all people with epilepsy, regardless of the level of control of their condition, should be encouraged to take showers while sitting instead of baths. The presence of people in the same house who are not directly supervising the person in the bathroom does not protect against drowning. Personal flotation devices should be worn at all times during boating activities.																			0820-3946					MAR 1	1993	148	5					781	784											8439937					WOS:A1993KP69800027
J	Turner, CE; Peterson, F				Turner, CE; Peterson, F			Reconstruction of the Upper Jurassic Morrison formation extinct ecosystem - a synthesis	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												A synthesis of recent and previous studies of the Morrison Formation and related beds, in the context of a conceptual climatic/hydrologic framework, permits reconstruction of the Late Jurassic dinosaurian ecosystem throughout the Western Interior of the United States and Canada. Climate models and geologic evidence indicate that a dry climate persisted in the Western Interior during the Late Jurassic. Early and Middle Kimmeridgian eolian deposits and Late Kimmeridgian alkaline, saline wetland/lacustrine deposits demonstrate that dryness persisted throughout the Kimmeridgian. Tithonian-age coal reflects lower evaporation rates associated with a slight cooling trend, but not a significant climate change. With a subtropical high over the Paleo-Pacific Ocean and atmospheric circulation generally toward the east, moisture carried by prevailing winds "rained out" progressively eastward, leaving the continental interior-and the Morrison depositional basin-dry. Within the basin, high evaporation rates associated with the southerly paleolatitude and greenhouse effects added to the dryness. Consequently, the two main sources of water-groundwater and surface water-originated outside the basin, through recharge of regional aquifers and streams that originated in the western uplands. Precipitation that fell west of the basin recharged aquifers that underlay the basin and discharged in wetlands and lakes in the distal, low-lying part of the basin. Precipitation west of the basin also fed intermittent and scarce perennial streams that flowed eastward. The streams were probably "losing" streams in their upstream reaches, and contributed to a locally raised water table. Elsewhere in the basin, where the floodplain intersected the water table, small lakes dotted the landscape. Seasonal storms, perhaps in part from the Paleo-Gulf of Mexico, brought some precipitation directly to the basin, although it was also subjected to "rain out" en route. Thus, meteoric input to the basin was appreciably less than groundwater and surface water contributions. The terrestrial Morrison ecosystem, which can be likened to a savannah, expanded with the northward retreat of the Late Jurassic Western Interior Seaway. The ecosystem was a complex mosaic, the components of which shifted through time. Riparian environments probably were the most diverse parts of the ecosystem, where a multi-storeyed canopy supported a diverse fauna, from insects to dinosaurs. Equable conditions also existed in wetlands, lakes, and elsewhere on the floodplain when seasonal rainfall brought an herbaceous groundcover to life. Eolian environments and alkaline, saline wetlands were inhospitable to life. Large herbivorous dinosaurs were adapted to this semi-arid landscape. Their size was an adaptive asset based on considerations of food requirements associated with a low metabolism and was also an advantage for migration during drought. Some of the large sauropods were adapted to browsing the higher vegetation associated with riparian environments; others to grazing the herbaceous groundcover on the floodplain and charophytes in the wetlands. The extensive distal wetlands may, in fact, have been refugia for some of these herbivores during the dry season and droughts. Extended periods of drought account for some of the dinosaur death assemblages; yet, the ecosystem could also sustain the most unusual life forms that ever roamed the Earth. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

J	Davis, CA; Smith, LM				Davis, CA; Smith, LM			Foraging strategies and niche dynamics of coexisting shorebirds at stopover sites in the southern Great Plains	AUK												Shorebirds encounter variable and unpredictable food resources at stopover sites during migration through interior North America. We studied foraging strategies and niche dynamics of American Avocets (Recurvirostra americana), Long-billed Dowitchcrs (Limnodroms scolopaceus scolopaceus), Least Sandpipers (Calidris minutilla), and Western Sandpipers (C.)mauri) at stopover sites in 60 playa lakes of the southern Great Plains. Those species were selected because they are common in our study area during migration and represent a wide range of morphological classes. Overall foraging niches (linear combination of diet diversity, prey size, foraging-method diversity, and water depth) of avocets and dowitchers were segregated from each other and from Least and Western sandpipers. Overall foraging niches of Least and Western sandpipers were similar. Examination of single niche dimensions showed that avocets and dowitchers consumed larger prey and foraged in deeper water than did Least and Western sandpipers. Within the range of prey sizes consumed by the four individual species, all species selected small prey (0.1-5.0 mm). Preference of relatively small prey by avocets and dowitchers was likely a function of small prey being more abundant in playas than large prey (> 10 mm). However, selection of small prey by Least and Western sandpipers was likely a function of lower handling costs associated with small prey Abundance of prey items in diets of each species was not correlated with nutritional and energetic quality of prey items, but abundance of prey in the diet was correlated with abundance of prey in playa lakes. That suggests that all four shorebird species adopt an opportunistic foraging strategy during migration. Use of opportunism is likely critical for shorebirds to continue migration and arrive on breeding grounds in good condition.																			0004-8038					APR	2001	118	2					484	495		10.1642/0004-8038(2001)118[0484:FSANDO]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1642/0004-8038(2001)118[0484:FSANDO]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000169466700018

TRIN. ex. STEUD. and Potamogeton perfoliatus L., in 2000. The purpose of the study was to estimate to what extent the littoral phytoplankton and epiphytic algae (their biomass, chlorophyll a content and dominant species) can be used as a criterion for the trophic state of the lake. In wind-open areas, phytoplankton biomass in the littoral is commonly more than ten times higher than in open water due to the presence of the macroscopic cyanobacterium Gloeotrichia echinulata (J.S. SMITH) P. RICHTER. This alga is abundant in the moderately eutrophic northern lake's part and rare in the strongly eutrophic southern part; hence also biomass in the southern part is considerably lower. In open water, phytoplankton biomass increases southward with increasing trophy. Algal biomass in the littoral depends on wind direction and can change completely in a few days. Epiphyton biomass and Chla content increased southward with increasing trophic state. They both revealed significant Spearman correlations (P < 0.05) with wind index and transparency (negative), and with abundance of the host plant, both reed and pondweed (positive). The phytoplankton biomass of the littoral of the large and shallow Lake Peipsi can not be used as a criterion of trophic state, however, the species composition of the dominants, particularly cyanobacteria, is well applicable for this purpose. The biomass and Chla content of the epiphyton can be used as a criterion for trophic state.																			0075-9511	1873-5851				MAY	2004	34	1-2					90	97		10.1016/S0075-9511(04)80026-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0075-9511(04)80026-4													WOS:000222030800012

The research was carried out in the years 2008-2012, between April and October. From each of the three measuring stations located in the lakes included the study, two separate water samples were taken for chemical analysis. The studied lakes had pH values in the neutral range 7.61 to 7.88. According to the classification of the European Union Water Framework Directive, all lakes were classified as first class. By analyzing the average annual values, one can note that the pH, O-2diss and NO3-concentration showed a relatively small variation in all the investigated lakes. The total phosphorus concentration was 0.42-0.63 mgP dm(-3). The concentrations of PO43-diss in the tested lake waters varied more significantly-corresponding to water quality classes ranging from III through IV. The concentrations saturation with O-2 was 50.3-96.8 %. In the case of nitrogen compounds, nitrates and nitrites values for these indicators fell into the I and II class in all the surveyed lakes. The indicator which proves high productivity of the lakes is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5). The level of this indicator in the studied Lakes was at level III. The highest concentration of oxygen in the lake waters was found in the Lake Miedwie (about 8.9 mg O-2 dm(-3)).																			0970-7077	0975-427X				JUL	2014	26	14	B				4189	4192		10.14233/ajchem.2014.16059	http://dx.doi.org/10.14233/ajchem.2014.16059													WOS:000344361100009

The pond is affected by annual mass cyanobacterial blooms, limiting its use. The improvement of the state of water quality involved the application of underwater aerating reactors. The economic analysis of their application was also an important issue. The analysis of the effectiveness of the proposed solution was conducted from February to October 2021. The results from the analysis of water from the pond showed that the nutrient content and phytoplankton structure conformed to the trophic status of eutrophy-hypertrophy. The primary factors causing excessive eutrophication of the pond included nutrient supply from the river, sediments, and fallen tree leaves. No development of cyanobacterial scum was observed in the water body, a phenomenon which was interpreted as the effect of the operation of the aerators ensuring additional water circulation in the pond and promoting its aeration. It was found that permanent improvement of the water quality in the studied water body is largely dependent on limiting the nitrogen and phosphorus supply to the pond. This should involve the application of systems combining traditional hydrotechnical infrastructure with Nature-Based Solutions (NBS). The economic analysis of the use of underwater aeration reactors confirmed the validity of searching for alternative solutions to power them, e.g., a photovoltaic installation. When designing a reactor system with a photovoltaic installation, it is necessary to choose the correct dimensions to reduce construction costs and, thus, increase the profitability of the potential investment.					; Duda, Sylwia/IIJ-1960-2023; Kończak, Magdalena/AAM-5155-2020	Chmiel, Stanislaw/0000-0002-5821-2124; Duda-Saternus, Sylwia/0000-0002-9092-9854; Konczak, Magdalena/0000-0001-7251-6100														2071-1050				JUL	2024	16	13							5629	10.3390/su16135629	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su16135629													WOS:001269898600001
J	Farmer, JG; Eades, LJ; Graham, MC				Farmer, JG; Eades, LJ; Graham, MC			The lead content and isotopic composition of British coals and their implications for past and present releases of lead to the UK environment	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH												More than 60 coal samples, predominantly from the principal coalfields of England and Wales (25) and Scotland (30), were analysed for lead by AAS and for stable lead isotopes by ICP-MS. While the average lead content of Scottish coal, 23.9 mg kg(-)1, was more than double that of coal from England and Wales, 11.0 mg kg(-)1, the corresponding mean Pb-206/Pb-207 ratios (+/- 1 s.d.) were nearly identical, at 1.181 +/- 0.011 and 1.184 +/- 0.006, respectively. In the light of the lead isotopic signatures of British coals and of both indigenous (Pb-206/Pb-207 similar to 1.17) and imported Australian (Pb-206/Pb-207 similar to 1.04) lead ores, an approach based on estimated lead emissions from these sources and the deconvolution of the historical lead and Pb-206/Pb-207 records preserved in lake sediments, peat bogs and archival herbage material indicates that coal combustion became an increasingly significant contributor to atmospheric lead deposition in the UK during the period 1830-1930, especially after the onset of England's decline as a major location of lead mining and smelting in the late-19th Century. Since 1930 and the introduction of leaded petrol, the atmospheric Pb-206/Pb-207 ratio in the UK has been strongly influenced by car-exhaust emissions of comparatively Pb-206-depleted lead of predominantly Australian origin, counter-balanced to some extent by coal-combustion emissions of lead, although these have fallen dramatically since the mid-1950s. Nevertheless, with the introduction and substantial uptake of unleaded petrol in the UK during the last decade, even the declining releases from coal, along with contributions from other sources, are continuing to affect the atmospheric lead content and Pb-206/Pb-207 ratio.																			0269-4042					SEP	1999	21	3					257	272		10.1023/A:1006688515919	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1006688515919													WOS:000084348800004

Vegetation mediated the impacts of postglacial climate change on fire regimes in the south-central Brooks Range, Alaska	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												We examined direct and indirect impacts of millennial-scale climate change on fire regimes in the south-central Brooks Range, Alaska, USA, using four lake sediment records and existing paleoclimate interpretations. New techniques were introduced to identify charcoal peaks semi-objectively and to detect statistical differences between. re regimes. Peaks in charcoal accumulation rates provided estimates of. re return intervals (FRIs), which were compared among vegetation zones identified by fossil pollen and stomata. Climatic warming between ca. 15 000-9000 yr BP ( calendar years before Common Era [CE] 1950) coincided with shifts in vegetation from herb tundra to shrub tundra to deciduous woodlands, all novel species assemblages relative to modern vegetation. Two sites cover this period and show decreased FRIs with the transition from herb to Betula-dominated shrub tundra ca. 13 300-14 300 yr BP (FRImean = 144 yr; 95% CI = 120-169 yr), when climate warmed but remained cooler than present. Although warming would have favored shorter FRIs in the shrub tundra, the shift to more continuous, flammable fuels relative to herb tundra was probably a more important cause of increased burning. Similarly, a vegetation shift to Populus-dominated deciduous woodlands overrode the influence of warmer- and drier-than-present summers, resulting in lower. re activity from ca. 10 300-8250 yr BP (FRImean = 251 yr; 95% CI = 156-347 yr). Three sites record the mid-to-late Holocene, when climatic cooling and moistening allowed Picea glauca forest-tundra and P. mariana boreal forests to establish ca. 8000 and 5500 yr BP, respectively. FRIs in forest-tundra were either similar to or shorter than those in the deciduous woodlands (FRImean range = 131-238 yr). The addition of P. mariana ca. 5500 yr BP increased landscape. ammability, overrode the effects of climatic cooling and moistening and resulted in lower FRIs (FRImean = 145 yr; 95% CI = 130-163). Overall, shifts in. re regimes were strongly linked to changes in vegetation, which were responding to millennial-scale climate change. We conclude that shifts in vegetation can amplify or override the direct influence of climate change on fire regimes, when vegetation shifts significantly modify landscape flammability. Our findings emphasize the importance of biophysical feedbacks between climate, fire, and vegetation in determining the response of ecosystems to past, and by inference, future climate change.

J	Sanderson, BG				Sanderson, Brian G.			Circulation and the nutrient budget in Myall Lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												A two-dimensional model is used to study transport of material within Myall Lakes and is coupled to the ocean using a one-dimensional model of Lower Myall River. Runoff from the catchment is calculated from water levels and compares favourably with rainfall assuming an average runoff yield of 28% and a runoff coefficient of 47% for events above the 90th percentile. Most of the runoff enters Bombah Broadwater which is also the only basin connected to the ocean. Intermittent runoff events rapidly displace water from Bombah Broadwater into Boolambayte Lake and from Boolambayte Lake into Myall Lake. Displaced water is mixed within basins by wind-driven circulation within the time scale that levels fall as water drains from the lakes to the ocean. Only 7% of the nutrient load entering Bombah Broadwater becomes resident Myall Lake. About 40% of the nutrient load entering Boolambayte Lake becomes resident in Myall Lake. Median time scales for loss of conservative material entering each basin with the runoff are: 140 days for Bombah Broadwater, 118 days for Boolambayte Lake, and 535 days for Myall Lake. Salinity fluctuates greatly in Bombah Broadwater but is stable in Myall Lake. Material loss from Bombah Broadwater is characterized by many time scales associated with runoff from the catchment and low-frequency changes in ocean water level. Comparison of observed distributions of total nitrogen with simulations indicates that there are sources of total nitrogen in Boolambayte Lake and Myall Lake and sinks of total nitrogen in Bombah Broadwater. There appear to be sinks of total phosphorus throughout the Myall Lakes.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				AUG	2008	608						3	20		10.1007/s10750-008-9380-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-008-9380-6													WOS:000256474300002
J	Korup, O				Korup, O			Geomorphometric characteristics of new Zealand landslide dams	ENGINEERING GEOLOGY												This study presents results from a quantitative analysis of a new inventory of n = 232 landslide dam occurrences in New Zealand. Previously published data were expanded by documentation of recent events and evidence from a regional air-photo reconnaissance focused on the upland regions of southwestern South Island. Additional geomorphometric data on landslide dams, associated lakes, and contributing catchment characteristics, were extracted from a 25-m Digital Elevation Model (DEM), augmented by limited ground truthing, and compiled in a GIS-based inventory. The New Zealand case examples fall into the global trend, although they contain both two extremely large features in terms of landslide dam volume V-D and lake volume V-L. Analysis suggests that landslide dam height H-D, landslide dam volume V-D, lake volume V-L, contributing catchment area A(C), and local relief H-R, are key variables for assessing landslide dam stability independently from other catchment parameters such as lithology, climate, or dam sedimentology. They may be provisionally used as representative characteristics of landslide dams, irrespective of environmental boundary conditions, such as climate, geology, or site-specific valley geomorphometry. Three newly proposed dimensionless indices, i.e., the Backstow Index I-s, Basin Index I-a, and Relief Index I-r, based on landslide dam height H-D allow limited, yet promising, preliminary assessments of landslide dam stability. Compared with worldwide examples, they also demonstrate a much narrower conditional range for the formation of stable landslide dams in New Zealand. Catchment parameters such as maximum elevation E-max, upstream relief H-R, contributing catchment area A(C), and relief ratio R-R are significantly different at sites of former and existing landslide-dammed lakes, and may be used as independent variables in future terrain-based classification schemes. Generally, data are incomplete with underreporting of small and ephemeral landslide dams, and over-representation of earthquake case studies. Nonparametric correlation highlights the statistical interdependence between geomorphometric variables as an artefact of initial data calculation, while varying accuracy poses a significant drawback for complex multivariate statistical techniques such as principal component, cluster, or discriminant analyses.

As the lake fills, survey targets on the surface of the 'ice dam' (the glacier adjacent to the lake) move obliquely to the ice margin and rise substantially. As the lake drains, ice motion speeds up, becomes nearly perpendicular to the face of the ice dam, and the ice surface drops. Vertical movement of the ice dam probably reflects growth and decay of a wedge of water beneath the ice dam, in line with established ideas about jokulhlaup mechanics. However, the distribution of vertical ice movement, with a narrow (50-100 m wide) zone where the uplift rate decreases by 90%, cannot be explained by invoking flexure of the ice dam in a fashion analogous to tidal flexure of a floating glacier tongue or ice shelf. Rather, the zone of large uplift-rate gradient is a fault zone: ice-dam deformation is dominated by movement along high-angle faults that cut the ice dam through its entire thickness, with the sense of fault slip reversing as the lake drains. Survey targets spanning the zone of steep uplift gradient move relative to one another in a nearly reversible fashion as the lake fills and drains. The horizontal strain rate also undergoes a reversal across this zone, being compressional as the lake fills, but extensional as the lake drains. Frictional resistance to fault-block motion probably accounts for the fact that lake level falls measurably before the onset of accelerated horizontal motion and vertical downdrop. As the overall fault pattern is the same from year to year, even though ice is lost by calving, the faults must be regularly regenerated, probably by linkage of surface and bottom crevasses as ice is advected toward the lake basin.					; Anderson, Suzanne/F-4039-2014; Walder, Joseph/J-8939-2017; ANDERSON, SUZANNE/F-4039-2014	Anderson, Robert/0000-0003-2759-4833; Walder, Joseph/0000-0003-3523-2998; ANDERSON, SUZANNE/0000-0002-6796-6649													0022-1430	1727-5652					2006	52	178					440	450		10.3189/172756506781828610	http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/172756506781828610													WOS:000243288600012

Holocene climate aridification trend and human impact interrupted by millennial- and centennial-scale climate fluctuations from a new sedimentary record from Padul (Sierra Nevada, southern Iberian Peninsula)	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Holocene centennial-scale paleoenvironmental variability has been described in a multiproxy analysis (i.e., lithology, geochemistry, macrofossil, and microfossil analyses) of a paleoecological record from the Padul Basin in Sierra Nevada, southern Iberian Peninsula. This sequence covers a relevant time interval hitherto unreported in the studies of the Padul sedimentary sequence. The similar to 4700-year record has preserved proxies of climate variability, with vegetation, lake levels, and sedimentological change during the Holocene in one of the most unique and southernmost wetlands in Europe. The progressive middle and late Holocene trend toward arid conditions identified by numerous authors in the western Mediterranean region, mostly related to a decrease in summer insolation, is also documented in this record; here it is also superimposed by centennial-scale variability in humidity. In turn, this record shows centennial-scale climate oscillations in temperature that correlate with well-known climatic events during the late Holocene in the western Mediterranean region, synchronous with variability in solar and atmospheric dynamics. The multiproxy Padul record first shows a transition from a relatively humid middle Holocene in the western Mediterranean region to more aridity from similar to 4700 to similar to 2800 cal yr BP. A relatively warm and humid period occurred between similar to 2600 and similar to 1600 cal yr BP, coinciding with persistent negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) conditions and the historic Iberian-Roman Humid Period. Enhanced arid conditions, co-occurring with overall positive NAO conditions and increasing solar activity, are observed between similar to 1550 and similar to 450 cal yr BP (similar to 400 to similar to 1400 CE) and colder and warmer conditions occurred during the Dark Ages and Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), respectively. Slightly wetter conditions took place during the end of the MCA and the first part of the Little Ice Age, which could be related to a change towards negative NAO conditions and minima in solar activity. Time series analysis performed from local (Botryococcus and total organic carbon) and regional (Mediterranean forest) signals helped us determining the relationship between southern Iberian climate evolution, atmospheric and oceanic dynamics, and solar activity. Our multiproxy record shows little evidence of human impact in the area until similar to 1550 cal yr BP, when evidence of agriculture and livestock grazing occurs. Therefore, climate is the main forcing mechanism controlling environmental change in the area until relatively recently.

The flow of melt-water from the northern tributary forms a lake (Lake Merzbacher) that is dammed by the calving ice front of the southern Inylchek Glacier. At least once a year a glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) occurs and the complete water of the Lake Merzbacher drains through sub-glacial channels. To monitor the glacier dynamics including the post-drainage ice dam response, a small network of remotely operated multiparameter stations (ROMPS) was installed at different locations at the glacier. Directly located near the ice dam, a continuously measuring kinematic GNSS station provides precise long-term data of variations in the dynamics of the ice dam for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. While the station reflects the horizontal motion of the ice dam towards the Lake Merzbacher, the vertical component shows a clear loss of elevation as a "long-term" response after the GLOF lasting for several weeks instead of only a few days. In correspondence to the elevation decrease, the surface velocity has a higher variability due to a relaxing process of the ice dam but changes significantly to a nearly constant velocity during the winter time.

J	Allis, R; Bromley, C; Currie, S				Allis, Rick; Bromley, Chris; Currie, Steve			Update on subsidence at the Wairakei-Tauhara geothermal system, New Zealand	GEOTHERMICS												The total subsidence at the Wairakei field as a result of 50 years of geothermal fluid extraction is 15 +/- 0.5 m.. Subsidence rates in the center of the subsidence bowl have decreased from over 450 mm/year during the 1970s to 80-90 mm/year during 2000-2007. The location of the bowl, adjacent to the original liquid outflow zone of the field, has not changed significantly. Subsidence at the Tauhara field due to Wairakei production was not as well documented in the early years but appeared later and has been less intense than at Wairakei. Total subsidence of 2.6 +/- 0.5 m has also occurred close to the original liquid outflow zone of this field. and maximum subsidence rates in this area today are in the 80-100 mm/year range. In the western part of the Wairakei field, near the area of hot upflow, subsidence rates have approximately doubled during the last 20 years to 30-50 mm/year. This increase appears to be have been caused by declining pressure in the underlying steam zone in this area, which is tapped by some production wells. At Tauhara field, two areas of subsidence have developed since the 1990s with rates of 50-65 mm/year. Although less well-determined, this subsidence may also be caused by declining pressure in shallow steam zones. The cause of the main subsidence bowls in the Wairakei-Tauhara geothermal system is locally high-compressibility rocks within the Huka Falls Formation (HFF), which are predominantly lake sediments and an intervening layer of pumice breccia. At Wairakei, casing deformation suggests the greatest compaction is at 150-200 m depth. The cause of the large compressibility is inferred to be higher clay content in the HFF due to intense hydrothermal alteration close to the natural fluid discharge areas. Future subsidence is predicted to add an additional 2-4 m to the Wairakei bowl, and 1-2 m elsewhere, but these estimates depend on the assumed production-injection scenarios.

J	Cheng, F; Zika, U; Banachowski, K; Gillenwater, D; Granata, T				Cheng, Fang; Zika, Ulrike; Banachowski, Keith; Gillenwater, Daniel; Granata, Tim			Modelling the effects of dam removal on migratory walleye (Sander vitreus) early life-history stages	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Many dams in the USA have outlived their intended purpose and an increasing number are being considered for removal. Yet, quantitative studies of the potential physical, biological and ecological responses are needed to assess dam removal decisions. In this paper, the responses of migratory walleye (Sander vitreus) to increased spawning habitat availability as a result of dam removal was studied by comparing scenarios with and without a high-head dam in the Sandusky River (Ohio), a major tributary to Lake Erie. A conceptual, ecological model was proposed to define the relationship between hydrodynamics and walleye spawning, egg hatching, larval drift and survival. A mathematical, ecological model of the early life-history stages was then developed and coupled with time series of depth and velocity predictions over the spawning grounds from a I-D hydrodynamic model. Model simulations were run for 1984-1993 for both the with- and without-dam scenarios to assess the potential benefit of dam removal. The simulation results demonstrated that velocity, depth and water temperature are major factors influencing adult walleye spawning success. Without the dam, 10 times the amount of spawning habitat would be available for walleye to spawn. This increase in spawning habitat area resulted in up to five times the total egg deposition and seven times the larval output to the nursing grounds, based on the assumption that 5% of the walleye population of Lake Erie migrated up the Sandusky River to spawn. We concluded that the spawning habitat in the current condition (with the dam) is limiting and additional spawning habitat upstream could significantly increase the number of larval walleye drifting to Lake Erie. The model sensitivity analysis showed that the number of walleye migrating up the river in spring is the dominant factor for larval recruitment to the lake.

Our results showed several limitations. First, the extraction efficiency strongly depends on the extraction solvent, and extraction with 5% acetic acid in 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)-methanol was confirmed as being the most appropriate for three different sediments (recovery: 33.1-44.9% of total MCs according to HPLC analyses). Second, the recovery of MCs was affected by the type of sediment but did not clearly correlate with the content of organic carbon. These results suggest that the sorption of MCs onto inorganic materials such as clay minerals is probably a more important process than interactions of the MCs with organic sediment matter. Third, the structure of the MCs is another crucial factor that affects the sorption of MCs and their recovery from sediments. Hydrophilic MC-RR gave much lower recoveries (20.0-38.8%) than MC-YR (44.1-59.5%) or MC-LR (55.3-77.8%) from three different types of spiked sediments. Recovery results analysed with HPLC-DAD correlated well with ELISA analyses. Further, extraction with 5% acetic acid in 0.2% TFA-methanol was used for analyses of MCs in 34 natural sediment samples collected from Brno reservoir (Czech Republic) from April to October 2005. Concentrations of MCs in sediments ranged from 0.003 to 0.380 mu g/g sediment d.m. (ELISA results) or 0.016-0.474 mu g/g d.m. (HPLC results). These values are equivalent to 0.63-96.47 mu g/L of sediment (ELISA) or 4.67-108.68 mu g/L (HPLC), respectively. Concentrations of sediment MCs showed both temporal and spatial variability, with the highest MC contents observed in the spring (April and May) and the lowest concentrations in July and August. Our results demonstrate the suitability of the methods described here for studying the occurrence, fate and ecological role of MCs in the aquatic environment.

This study aimed to clarify the spatiotemporal variability and environmental effects of methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in ice and water columns during different ice-covered periods. We surveyed the ice-growth, ice-stability, and ice-melt periods in an ice-covered reservoir located in Northeast China. The results showed that underlying water (CH4: 1218.9 +/- 2678.9 nmol L-1 and N2O: 19.3 +/- 7.3 nmol L-1) and ice (CH4: 535.2 +/- 2373.1 nmol L-1 and N2O: 9.9 +/- 1.5 nmol L-1) were sources of atmospheric greenhouse gases. N2O concentrations were the highest in the bottom water of the reservoir while CH4 accumulated the most below the ice in the riverine zone. These can be attributed to differences in the solubilities and relative molecular masses of the two gases. Higher concentrations of N2O, TN, TP, DOC, and DIC were recorded in the underlying water than those in the ice due to the preferential redistribution of these substances in the aqueous phase during ice formation. Additionally, we distinguished between bubble and no-bubble areas in the riverine zone and found that the higher CH4 concentrations in the underlying water than those in the ice were due to CH4 bubbles. In addition, we reviewed various substances in ice-water systems and found that the substances in ice-water systems can be divided into solute exclusion and particle entrapment, which are attributed to differences between dissolved and particulate states. These findings are important for a comprehensive understanding of substances dynamics during ice-covered periods.

In this paper, we summarize the knowledge upon the distribution of amphipods in Moldovan inland waters based on literature survey combined with our new original data and present a comprehensive checklist of recorded amphipod species. The new original data come from samples collected in 2012 at 25 sites across Moldova from a variety of freshwater habitats, ranging from springs and streams to rivers and artificial lakes. In the collected material, we identified only 4 species of gammarids - one, Gammarus kischineffensis, belonging to family Gammaridae and three species of Pontogammaridae: Pontogammarus robustoides, Obesogammarus crassus and Dikerogammarus haemobaphes. Presence of all these species has already been reported from Moldova. This number is surprisingly low if compared to the total number of amphipod species known to occur in the country, which is 18. However, 14 of these species are Ponto-Caspian elements and were reported only from the largest Moldovan rivers, Dniester and Prut. Further 12 Ponto-Caspian amphipod species may likely occur in the Moldovan section of the Dniester as they were found before in the lowest run of the river, already on the Ukrainian territory. Leaving out the Ponto-Caspian fauna, only five typically freshwater species were reported from Moldova so far: G. kischineffinsis, G. balcanicus, Synurclla ambulans, Niphargus birsteini and N. yaroshenkoi. This poverty is striking if compared to surrounding countries. Interpreting these results within a geological and palaeogeographical framework, we may suppose that it is due to the low landscape complexity combined with the relatively young age of the Moldavian Plateau and its hydrological network.

Literature suggests that habitat and environmental variables such as water chemistry jointly influence benthic algal species richness and assemblage composition. However, the combined effects of habitat and water chemistry on benthic algal communities are poorly understood especially in subarctic freshwaters. This study compared benthic diatom assemblages on rocks and on sediment and examined if environmental variables affect diatoms similarly in these habitats. A total of 20 subarctic ponds were sampled for diatoms on sediment and rock in summer 2022 in northern Fennoscandia. Differences in species richness and Pielou evenness between habitats were analysed by a paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The most significant environmental variables influencing diatom species richness were determined by generalized linear models. Differences in diatom assemblage compositions were analysed using non-metric multidimensional scaling, analysis of similarities, and Jaccard similarity index. Finally, to study how environmental variables shape diatom compositions on rock and sediment, a redundancy analysis was performed. According to our results species richness and evenness were significantly higher on sediment than on rock, and water pH was the major determinant for diatom richness in both habitats. Diatom assemblage composition did not differ between rocks and sediment, and composition was shaped by the same environmental variables such as pond surface area and water pH in both habitats. Our results support the prevailing conception that sediment habitat contains higher diatom species richness than rocks, while assemblage composition does not differ between these habitats. This study highlights the role of water pH on benthic diatoms regardless of their habitat. Given that global warming is expected to affect water pH levels, such a change will probably have a notable influence also on subarctic diatom communities in the future decades.

EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH												We need to know if and how western barbastelles Barbastella barbastellus are affected by wind farming in Sweden. This is because wind turbines are frequently constructed in barbastelle habitats and yet there is no national guideline on how the arising conflict should be handled. We studied the movement, behavior and mortality of a barbastelle population at a wind farm in southern Sweden, using radio-telemetry, automatic bat detectors and carcass searches. The tagged bats (6 males and 8 females) roosted mainly under loose bark of dead oak trees and foraged in patches of mature deciduous woodlands or pockets of mature spruce trees within 15 km of the roosts. Extensive areas of young spruce plantation, open farmland and lakes were not used for roosting or foraging but were crossed by commuting bats. Continuous recordings with bat detectors frequently picked up barbastelles at forest edges 30 m from the turbines, but rarely over the turbine pads within 10 m from the turbines and never at heights of 30 and 100 m at the turbine towers. Barbastelles were apparently not attracted to the wind turbines and did not seem to interact with them in any way. Carcass searches under 10 wind turbines at 1-week intervals over three summers did not reveal any dead barbastelles, although three other species were recovered. We conclude that wind farming is not nessarily incompatible with effective conservation of barbastelles in Sweden, but instead of focusing on wind turbines, effors should concentrate on (a) preservation and restoration of mature, age-structured deciduous woodlands and spruce forests, including very small and isolated patches, which provide food and roosts, and probably also (b) avoidance of outdoor lighting in areas used by barbastelles. Designating large circular buffer zones around each known or suspected colony according to current practice would be inefficient or meaningless in our case, because barbastelles use extensive home ranges and switch roost frequently. We argue that barbastelle management must be applied on a landscape scale.

J	Vermeersch, PM; Van Neer, W				Vermeersch, Pierre M.; Van Neer, Wim			Nile behaviour and Late Palaeolithic humans in Upper Egypt during the Late Pleistocene	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The reconstruction of the environment and the human population history of the Nile Valley during the Late Pleistocene have received a lot of attention in the literature thus far. There seems to be a consensus that during MIS2 extreme dry conditions prevailed over north-eastern Africa, which was apparently not occupied by humans. The Nile Valley seems to be an exception; numerous field data have been collected suggesting an important population density in Upper Egypt during MIS2. The occupation remains are often stratified in, or at least related to, aeolian and Nile deposits at some elevation above the present-day floodplain. They are rich in lithics and animal bones, mainly fish, illustrating the exploitation of the Nile Valley by the Late Palaeolithic inhabitants. The fluvial processes active during that period have traditionally been interpreted as a continuously rising highly braided river. In this paper we summarize the evidence thus far available for the Late Pleistocene on the population densities in the Nile Valley, and on the models of Nilotic behaviour. In the discussion we include data on the environmental conditions in Eastern Africa, on the aeolian processes in the Western Desert of Egypt derived from satellite images, C-14 and OSL dates, in order to formulate a new model that explains the observed high remnants of aeolian and Nilotic deposits and the related Late Palaeolithic sites. This model hypothesizes that, during the Late Pleistocene, and especially the LGM, dunes from the Western Desert invaded the Nile Valley at several places in Upper Egypt. The much reduced activity of the White Nile and the Blue Nile was unable to evacuate incoming aeolian sand and, as a consequence, several dams were created in the Upper Egyptian Nile Valley. Behind such dams the created lakes offered ideal conditions for human subsistence. This model explains the occurrence of Late Palaeolithic hunter fisher gatherers in a very arid environment with very low Nile flows, even in late summer. (C) 2015 The Authors.

These parameters are commonly sampled at point locations that represent only a local phenomenon. Based on the kriging analysis and methods of geographic information system (GIS), this study developed modeling procedures to investigate regional water quality of Lake Erie. Data of dissolved oxygen, water temperature, and calcium, obtained from the International Joint Commission, were sort in terms of time and water depth. Then, the analysis of semi-variogram were conducted assuming water quality data are regional variables. Appropriate semi-variogram models were fitted with a 95% confidence level. Results of the kriging analysis based on fitted models were spatially expressed as grid vector values. Finally, a conversion vector values to a raster format resulted in regionalized images showing spatial characteristics of water quality in terms of time and depth, where map algebra were performed. Based on the study, the following conclusions are made: (1) a GIS graphical representation shows that an increase of calcium from the southwest to the northeast of the lake; (2) images of dissolved oxygen as percent saturation obtained by map algebra reveal a decrease of dissolved oxygen distribution from the northeast to the southwest region; (3) the ambient temperature during summer months intensifies the stratification between the warm waters of epilimnion and cool waters of hypolimnion.																					0-7844-0359-7				1998							1464	1474																WOS:000081713600246
J	HAJDU, L				HAJDU, L			ALGAL SPECIES-DIVERSITY IN 2 EUTROPHIC FISHPONDS	ACTA BOTANICA ACADEMIAE SCIENTIARUM HUNGARICAE												A set of hypothetical data has confirmed that a great number of indices are very sensitive to sample size and are unsuitable for algological purposes. In further studies only H", J and S [Shannon''s measure of diversity, evenness, and number of species, respectively] will be used. The volumetric biomass of the various algal species is given. Diversities calculated from the individual and from volume data are correlated with each other in a non-fertilized fishpond, while in the fertilized 1 they did not correlate. This is due to the lower evenness and equitability (J and .epsilon.), primarily to the salient data of the absolutely dominant species. The diversity computed from the volume data appears to lag behind its possible maximum even more than that experienced in the individual data. This tendency is more pronounced in the fertilized lake. The fishponds are rich in genera (2.3 infrageneric taxa fall to one genus, on average) and the diversity on genus level did not significantly differ from that of the species. On division level, the loss of information is indeed significant. The Chlorophyta division was always quantitatively dominant. Some diversity problems, i.e., sensitivity of the used indices to the sample size; correlations between diversities calculated on the basis of number of specimens per species and of volume per species, partition of the diversity to some taxonomic levels and relationships between the diversity of individual divisions and that of the total algal flora were examined.																			0001-5350						1977	23	3-4					333	351																WOS:A1977FE31000003
J	Huang, Y; Miao, KH; Liu, XG; Jiang, Y				Huang, Yong; Miao, Kehan; Liu, Xiaoguang; Jiang, Yin			The Hysteresis Response of Groundwater to Reservoir Water Level Changes in a Plain Reservoir Area	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Reservoir immersion will lead to some environmental geological problems, such as soil swamping or salinization, reduction of building foundation strength, or even overall instability. Reservoir scope of immersion is closely related to changes in groundwater levels. According to the geological and hydrogeological conditions pertaining in the Jiangxiang reservoir area, the analytical method is employed to calculate the change in groundwater levels in an unconfined aquifer when the reservoir water level rises rapidly to a constant value and changes periodically. Combined with the related functions of MATLAB (TM) software, the lag and immersion times are determined in different locations around the reservoir. The results show that the change of the groundwater level exhibits hysteresis relative to that of the reservoir water level owing to the low permeability of silty loam and clay. The closer to the reservoir, the faster the groundwater level rises or falls. In the Guo Xiaoxu section, when the reservoir water level rises rapidly to 42.5 m, the groundwater level near the reservoir remains lower than the reservoir water level after 50 years. If the hydraulic conductivity is increased by three orders of magnitude, the groundwater level and the reservoir water level changes are positively correlated, and the hysteresis is not obvious. In the crop areas, the scope of immersion in the Guoxiaowei section is 31 m with the immersion elevation of 43.23 m, and the corresponding immersion time is 15,766 d. In residential areas, the scope of immersion of the Qigang section is 308 m with the immersion elevation of 46.78 m, and the corresponding immersion time is 16,354 d. The calculated scope of immersion and time at different locations provide a scientific basis for the design of the reservoir water level and the range of demolition affecting local residents.

J	Arp, G; Reimer, A; Reitner, J				Arp, G; Reimer, A; Reitner, J			Calcification in cyanobacterial biofilms of alkaline salt lakes	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												Geomicrobiological analysis of calcifying biofilms of three alkaline salt lakes characterized by moderate to high carbonate alkalinity indicates that microbial carbonate rock formation is not directly linked to cyanobacterial carbon fixation. The present review summarizes results from two published case studies that have been carried out at Pyramid Lake, USA, and Lake Nuoertu, PR China. New observations and data are presented for a current project on Satonda Crater Lake, Indonesia, that revise previous conclusions concerning the relationship between cyanobacteria and biofilm calcification. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in the investigated lakes are mostly produced by cyanobacteria; their properties are discussed as key factors in biofilm calcification. In particular, EPS are capable of binding divalent cations (e.g. Ca2+) from the liquid phase by their carboxylate and sulphate groups. Therefore, despite a high supersaturation of the lake water with respect to calcium carbonate minerals, precipitation does not take place immediately. A delayed onset of precipitation can be achieved by a continuous Ca2+ supply that exceeds the Ca2+-binding capacity of the EPS, and/or an exoenzymatic degradation (decarboxylation, cleavage) of mucous substances that reduces the binding capacity and causes secondary Ca2+ release. The resulting microcrystalline precipitates are randomly distributed within the EPS, usually away from any of the living cyanobacteria. This suggests that the effect of photosynthetic CO2 fixation in increasing supersaturation is of secondary importance at high alkalinities. In contrast to biofilm-covered surfaces, calcium carbonate minerals nucleate and grow rapidly at surfaces poor in EPS when the critical supersaturation lever for non-enzymatically controlled carbonate precipitation is reached. Examples of such surfaces poor in EPS are dead, lysed green algal cells and thin, discontinuous biofilms in voids of microbial reef rocks. Calcium carbonate crystals directly linked to cyanobacterial cells or filaments have been observed only exceptionally, e.g. on Calothrix.																			0967-0262	1469-4433				OCT	1999	34	4					393	403		10.1080/09670269910001736452	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09670269910001736452													WOS:000083751200008
J	Smith, JP				Smith, JP			An energy-circuit population model for Great Egrets (Ardea alba) at Lake Okeechobee, Florida, USA	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												I simulated the annual population cycles of Great Egrets (Ardea alba) at Lake Okeechobee, Florida, to provide a framework for evaluating the local population dynamics of nesting and foraging wading birds. The external forcing functions were solar energy, minimum air temperature, water depth, surface-water drying rate, and season. Solar input controlled the production of prey at moderate to high lake stages, but water area exerted primary control during a two-year drought. Modeling prey production as a linear function of water area resulted in underestimation of prey density during the drought, suggesting that prey organisms maintained high fecundity while concentrated in submerged vegetation at the lakeward fringe of the littoral zone, Simulation confirmed that large influxes of wading birds during the drought were the combined result of a regional refuge response and the availability of concentrated prey. Modeling immigration and emigration as primarily functions of the surface-water drying rate, rather than lake stage, resulted in a closer match of observed and simulated population trends for foraging birds, suggesting that the pattern of surface-water fluctuations was a more important factor than water depth. Simulation indicated an abrupt-threshold response rather than a linear association between foraging efficiency and low temperatures, which reduce activity levels of forage fishes. Great Egret breeder recruitment is primarily a function of prey availability, climate, and hydrologic trends, but simulation confirmed the concurrent involvement of a seasonal or physiological-readiness factor. An attractor function driven by high winter lake stages was necessary to reproduce observed patterns of breeder recruitment, suggesting that Great Egrets initiate nesting based on environmental cues that lead to peak food availability when nestlings are present. Poor correspondence of reproductive effort and nest productivity suggested that the drought compromised the birds' predictive abilities. The need to model breeder recruitment as a function of a maximum rate rather than the size of the local foraging population suggested that birds may nest on the lake even though on-lake foraging conditions are poor. Simulated and observed estimates of egg and hatching production did not match, suggesting that the causes of failure during incubation were complex or more localized than could be accounted for with lakewide hydrologic and climatic data. A forced increase in prey consumption of 12% was necessary to reproduce observed, high levels of nest productivity in 1990, which corresponded to the finding that panhandled fish constituted 10-12% of the biomass fed to Great Egret nestlings that year.

Records of Phyllodistomum sp. and Dendrorchis sp. from the urinary bladder of goodeines have been previously published, although the identification at species level was not achieved. A few specimens were collected and fixed to conduct a scanning electron microscopy study, and to obtain sequences of a mitochondrial (COI) and nuclear (28S rRNA) gene, to be analysed in the context of the molecular phylogeny of gorgoderid trematodes. Based on the new findings, two new species of Phyllodistomum Braun, 1899 are described. Phyllodistomum cribbi n. sp. was found in Zoogoneticus quitzeoensis (Bean), Allotoca zacapuensis Meyer, Radda & Dominguez-Dominguez, Hubbsina turneri de Buen and Z. purhepechus Dominguez-Dominguez, Perez-Rodriguez & Doadrio from Zacapu Lake, and La Luz Spring, in Michoacan, central Mexico. Phyllodistomum wallacei n. sp. parasitized Xenotaenia resolanae Turner, Ilyodon furcidens (Jordan & Gilbert), and Allodontichthys tamazulae Turner from the Cuzalapa, Ayuquila and Tamazula Rivers in Jalisco, western Mexico. These species are compared with several freshwater Phyllodistomum species from different areas of the world, especially a group of eight species that comprise a monophyletic clade in recent phylogenetic hypotheses of the Gorgoderidae Looss, 1899. The two new species are distinguished from other close relatives by the combination of morphological traits such as the body shape, sucker ratio, shape of the gonads, and extension of intestinal ceca. The new species are distinct in some ultrastructural characters of the body surface when compared with those species where scanning electron micrographs (SEM) and/or microphotographs are available. Data of two molecular markers (28S rRNA and COI genes) demonstrate that the two new species are distinct from each other and from those species of Phyllodistomum Braun, 1899 for which sequences are available.					; Perez-Ponce de Leon, Gerardo/U-3869-2017; de León, Gerardo/U-3869-2017	Martinez-Aquino, Andres/0000-0003-2574-8739; Perez-Ponce de Leon, Gerardo/0000-0001-6472-5113; 													1175-5326	1175-5334				SEP 7	2015	4013	1					87	99		10.11646/zootaxa.4013.1.6	http://dx.doi.org/10.11646/zootaxa.4013.1.6								26623884					WOS:000360847000006

G.; Opfergelt, Sophie			Mineral organic carbon interactions in dry versus wet tundra soils	GEODERMA												Mineral organic carbon interactions (aggregation, organo-mineral associations and organo-metallic complexes) enhance the protection of organic carbon (OC) from microbial degradation in soils. The northern circumpolar permafrost region stores between 1,440 and 1,600 Pg OC of which a significant portion is already thawed or about to thaw in coming years. In the light of this tipping point for climate change, any mechanism that can promote OC stabilization and hence mitigate OC mineralization and greenhouse gas emissions is of crucial interest. Here, we study interactions between metals (Fe, Al, Mn and Ca) and OC in the moist acidic tundra ecosystem of Eight Mile Lake, near Healy, AK, USA. We collected thirteen cores (124 soil samples) in late summer 2019 with shallow and deep active layers (45 to 109 cm deep) and varying water table depths. We find that between 6% and 59% of total OC in Eight Mile Lake tundra soils is mineral-associated (mean 20%), in organomineral associations (association between poorly crystalline oxides and OC) and in organo-metallic complexes (associations between Fe, Mn, Al, Ca polyvalent cations and organic acids). We find that total Fe and Mn concentrations can be used as good proxies to assess the reactive pool of these metals able to form associations with OC, i.e., poorly crystalline oxides or metals complexed with OC. We observe that in the active layer, mineral OC interactions are mostly as organo-metallic complexes with Fe cations, with an accumulation at the water table level acting as a soil redox interface. In waterlogged soils with a water table level above surface, no such accumulation of OC-Fe complexes is found due to the absence of a redox interface below soil surface. In the permafrost layer, we find that a combination of complexed metals and poorly crystalline Fe oxides act as reactive phases towards OC. Knowing that upon permafrost thaw tundra soils will become wetter or drier, the assessment of mineral-bound OC in drier or wetter tundra soils is a needed step to better constrain the changes in the proportion of non-protected OC more likely to contribute to C emissions from tundra soils.					; Schuur, Edward/ACG-9944-2022; Opfergelt, Sophie/L-2107-2015	Bemelmans, Nathan/0000-0002-7359-9742; 													0016-7061	1872-6259				AUG	2023	436								116552	10.1016/j.geoderma.2023.116552	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2023.116552		JUN 2023											WOS:001015722900001

Four RCBs, one per nursery, were actively used as an irrigation water source. Analysis was done for 18 water quality variables, including ammonium-nitrogen (NH4+-N), nitrate-nitrogen (NO3--N), ortho phosphate-phosphorus (PO4-P), total-phosphorus (T-P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sulfur (S), aluminum (Al), boron (B), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), pH, total alkalinity (T-Alk), electrical conductivity (EC), and sodium (Na). The degree and rate of monthly change varied considerably between RCBs. Macronutrients generally increased at most nurseries in 1-2 months after fertilizer application particularly in three RCBs (MD21, VA11, and VA12), with levels of N- and P forms exceeding preferred criteria for irrigation water by June and July in VA11 and VA12. Micronutrients fluctuated less but did vary per RCB with the most monthly change occurring in MD21. Even though pH fluctuated, pH tended to remain alkaline or neutral to acidic respective of the RCB during the entire sample period. T-Alk tended to increase over the summer. EC primarily fluctuated in RCBs with high macronutrient levels. Although levels of N- and P forms were mostly suitable by irrigation water criteria, they were frequently above U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) nutrient criteria for promoting healthy water environments of lakes and reservoirs, and are discussed.

J	Sundelin, B; Rosa, R; Wiklund, AKE				Sundelin, Brita; Rosa, Rui; Wiklund, Ann-Kristin Eriksson			Reproduction disorders in the benthic amphipod Monoporeia affinis:: an effect of low food resources	AQUATIC BIOLOGY												The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of food availability on reproduction by comparing the response of reproductive biomarkers of a deposit-feeding amphipod Monoporeia affinis in 2 Swedish lentic environments (Lake Vanern and Lake Vattern) differing in eutrophication level, during the period between 1995 and 2002. In ultraoligotrophic Lake Vattern, a very low fecundity (living eggs female(-1)) was found and severe embryo aberrations in terms of undifferentiated eggs (% female(-1)), dead eggs (% female(-1)) and the percent of females with dead broods were recorded. A significant negative correlation between fecundity and (1) undifferentiated eggs and (2) dead eggs and broods were obtained in both lakes. Amphipods collected in Lake Vattern in 2001 showed significantly lower concentrations of lipids-mainly triacylglycerols (TAG)-and of fatty acids (FAs) than amphipods collected in the more eutrophic Lake Vanern. Dramatically increased spring bloom diatom abundance in Lake Vattern resulted in increased fecundity and lipid and fatty acid concentrations (namely monounsaturated fatty acids, MUFA) and decreased embryo aberrations. A significant relationship between fecundity and diatom biovolume in Lake Vanern and total algal biovolume in Lake Vattern was found. No other alga taxa influenced the fecundity. In Lake Vattern total algal biovolume was negatively related to undifferentiated eggs. MUFA and saturated fatty acids (SFAs) seem to be important for vitellogenesis and oogenesis and also constitute fuel during embryogenesis. Other environmental variables in bottom waters (i.e. oxygen, pH and temperature) and sediment organic content did not influence the reproduction variables. Our findings strongly suggest a relationship between embryo aberrations (e.g. undifferentiated eggs and dead broods) and low food resources.

The present biomarker investigation in conjunction with previously published multi-proxy records was applied to reconstruct organic matter (OM) sources forming the peat succession spanning the last 8000 cal yr BP and shift in hydrological conditions from the Kedarnath region, Garhwal Himalaya. Intensified monsoon prevailed from similar to 7515 until similar to 2300 cal yr BP but with reversal to transient arid period particularly between similar to 5200 and similar to 3600 cal yr BP as revealed by the variability in n-C-23/n-C-31, ACL (average chain length of n-alkanes) and P (aq) (P-aqueous) values. A prolonged arid phase is recognizable during the interval between similar to 2200 and similar to 370 cal yr BP suggested by the n-alkane proxies. Regional scale heterogeneity in the monsoonal pattern is known in the studied temporal range of mid to late Holocene across the Indian subcontinent that is probably a result of complex climate dynamics, sensitivity of proxies and impact of teleconnections. The biomarker signatures deduced from gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) analysis are suggestive of a mixed biotic input that includes prokaryotes, Sphagnum spp. and gymnosperm flora. The mid chain alkanes viz. n-C-23 and n-C-25 denote the presence of typical peat forming Sphagnum moss that preferentially grows in humid and waterlogged conditions. Diterpane marker such as ent-kaurane indicates contribution of gymnosperms, whereas the hopanes are signatures of microbial input. The preservation of organic matter is attributed to little microbial degradation in a largely suboxic depositional environment. Our study strengthens the applicability of organic geochemical proxies for the reconstruction of past climate history and indicates their suitability for use on longer timescales given the high preservation potential of the molecular remains.					; Mishra, Praveen K./AAC-7064-2022; Srivastava, Pradeep/AAC-3039-2020	Yadav, Ankit/0000-0002-1194-8687; Mishra, Praveen K./0000-0003-3860-892X; Srivastava, Pradeep/0000-0002-9591-7764														2296-6463				SEP 6	2021	9								703362	10.3389/feart.2021.703362	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2021.703362													WOS:000698803500001

Archeological evidence has shown that the Baodun Culture likely originated from the upper reaches of the Minjiang River, with two possible routes for human migration into the lower Chengdu Plain proposed: (1) At about 5000 a BP, favorable climatic conditions in the upper reaches of the Minjiang stimulated the growth of populations and the development of agriculture in the region. Due to this shift, some groups expanded from the upper Minjiang River to sites in the northern area of the Chengdu Plain, such as the Guiyuanqiao site; (2) during 4800-4300 a BP, a drying event occurred in the upper regions of the river valley causing a reduction in agricultural harvests and the migration of populations into sites - including the Baodun site - from this area of the Minjiang to the southwest piedmont of the Chengdu Plain. A multi-facetted study of the T3321 profile at Baodun site, including pollens, grain size, and geochemistry, demonstrates that after 6000 a BP, the climate of the Chengdu Plain shifted from cool, toward warmer and dryer conditions. However, as the Chengdu Plain is located in an alluvial fan, hydrothermal conditions here are still generally better than those in the upper reaches of Minjiang River. A change in the proportion of Concentricystes seen in the profile T3321 also indicates that after 4700 a BP, the lake and marsh areas associated with the Baodun site further decreased. However, as a result of this reduction, more terrestrial surfaces were exposed, providing favored space for Baodun Cultural groups in the area of the site. Due to such conditions, by about 4600 cal. a BP, people in the upper reaches of the Minjiang River had primarily moved to the southwest piedmont regions of the Chengdu Plain.

This leads to the continuous degradation and destruction of houses, buildings and of the roads, waterworks and sewerage infrastructure in several districts of the town. Research of mass-wasting processes is hampered by the limited geotechnical and hydrogeological information concerning the deeply weathered Tertiary and Quaternary lavas. There is also a disagreement about the exact location of active faults, believed to play a role in the mass wasting. Additionally, there is little information about the exact location and the rate of soil movements and whether ground instability is caused by tectonics and seismics or by increase in hydrostatic pressure. Based on aerial photographic interpretation, landslides cover more than 15% of the town of Bukavu. Thirty-one landslides occur outside the Bukavu "microrift" and do not contact active faults. Rather, they occur in actively incising river basins, ostensibly caused by neotectonic activity. Four from the six landslides within the "micrograben" are bigger and wider than the others, apparently governed by preexisting tectonically induced landforms. They are adjacent to or crossed by active faults. They also fall far below the envelope of topographic thresholds for landslides established for North America and verified in Rwanda. Therefore, this threshold, a combination of slope at the head of the slide and surface drained to it, seems a promising tool to discriminate hydrologically from tectonically seismically induced landslides. Recent soil movements in Bukavu generally correspond to landslide distribution portrayed on the geomorphologic map. Most Bukavu soil movements occur on previous slides. Therefore, from an engineering-geologic standpoint, old landslides should be avoided, or, if economically feasible, be mitigated. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

J	KOH, T; OKABE, K				KOH, T; OKABE, K			SPECTROPHOTOMETRIC DETERMINATION OF SULFIDE, SULFITE, THIOSULFATE, TRITHIONATE AND TETRATHIONATE IN MIXTURES	ANALYST												The proposed method consists of five procedures: the thiocyanate formed from the hydrogen sulfide evolved in Procedure 1 and an excess of iodine for reaction with the sulfur dioxide evolved in Procedure 2 are measured; the thiosulfate in Procedure 3 and the thiosulfate, plus that formed from tetrathionate by its sulfitolysis in Procedure 4, and finally an excess of iodate for the oxidation of thiosulfate, trithionate and tetrathionate in Procedure 5, are all measured by spectrophotometry. Procedure 1 can be applied to the determination of up to 6 x 10(-4) mol l(-1) of sulfide Procedure 2 for up to 2.4 x 10(-4) mol l(-1) of sulfite, and Procedure 3 for up to 4.8 x 10(-4) mol l(-1) of thiosulfate. Procedure 4 is for the measurement of up to 4.8 x 10(-4) mol l(-1) of the total amount of thiosulfate plus tetrathionate, and Procedure 5 determines up to 4.5 x 10(-5) mol l(-1) of the total thiosulfate, trithionate plus tetrathionate. The method can be successfully applied to the determination of sulfide, sulfite, thiosulfate trithionate and tetrathionate mixed in various amounts. The relative standard deviations, based on eight replicate analyses of a 10 mi solution containing a mixture of 1.0 mu mol of sulfide, sulfite, thiosulfate, trithionate and tetrathionate, were 1.5, 1.2, 1.1, 1.9 and 1.1% for sulfide, sulfite, thiosulfate, trithionate and tetrathionate respectively. Good recoveries of thiosulfate trithionate and tetrathionate from hot-spring and lake water samples, to which various known amounts of thiosulfate, trithionate and tetrathionate had been added, were achieved with an average recovery of 98.9%.																			0003-2654					NOV	1994	119	11					2457	2461		10.1039/an9941902457	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/an9941902457													WOS:A1994PT44500036

The dating of the tephra level corresponds to the mid-18th century but there is no scientific record nor geological evidence of this event. The sediment sequences were collected from lakes Nahuel Huapi, Moreno Oeste, and Toncek, in northern Patagonia, located downwind from the Cord'on Caulle Volcanic Complex (CCVC), the potential source, at 45, 86, and 95 km respectively. These environments are frequently impacted by tephra falls from different sources in the Southern Volcanic Zone. Particle morphology, glass and mineral chemistry, together with textural analysis, provided a detailed characterization of the tephra layer recovered at each site. This characterization allowed the association of the tephra material with the CCVC predominantly, with minor Osorno volcano contributions. Historical records of both volcanic systems included eruptions in the mid-18th century (1759 CE and 1752-1796 CE, respectively). Hence, the characterization and the comparison with historical records of volcanic eruptions let us conclude that the tephra is composed of materials dispersed by CCVC in the nearby lakes, whereas contributions from Osorno volcano are observed in environments to the south of the study site, during the mid-18th century. The study demonstrates the potential of this type of detailed characterization in lake sequences to develop and support increasing research on historical volcanic records, helping to improve the knowledge of the volcanic hazard of a region.

On a regional scale, the lakes modulate the timing and rate of freshwater flow through the subglacial system to the ocean by acting as reservoirs. More than 100 hydrologically active subglacial lakes that drain and recharge periodically have been documented under the Antarctic Ice Sheet, while only approximately 20 active lakes have been identified in Greenland. Active lakes may be identified by local changes in ice topography caused by the drainage or recharge of the lake beneath the ice. The small size of the Greenlandic subglacial lakes puts additional demands on mapping capabilities to resolve the evolving surface topography in sufficient detail to record their temporal behaviour. Here, we explore the potential for using CryoSat-2 swath-processed data, together with TanDEM-X digital elevation models, to improve the monitoring capabilities of active subglacial lakes in Greenland. We focus on four subglacial lakes previously described in the literature and combine the data with ArcticDEMs to obtain improved measurements of the evolution of these four lakes. We find that with careful tuning of the swath processor and filtering of the output data, the inclusion of these data, together with the TanDEM-X data, provides important information on lake activity, documenting, for example, that the ice surface collapse basin on Flade Isblink Ice Cap was 50 % (30 m) deeper than previously recorded. We also present evidence of a new, active subglacial lake in southwestern Greenland, which is located close to an already known lake. Both lakes probably drained within 1 month in the summer of 2012, which suggests either that they are hydrologically connected or that the drainages were independently triggered by extensive surface melt. If the hydrological connection is confirmed, this would to our knowledge be the first indication of hydrologically connected subglacial lakes in Greenland.

An age-depth model was constructed using a combination of Pb-210, C-14, and tephra to determine a 2800 year history of lake ontogeny (natural aging), biological diversity, and regional climate variability. Diatoms form six strong paleoecological assemblages over time in response to changes in local hydrological and sedimentological conditions (including metals). Selected environmental variables explained 28.8% of the variance in the diatom assemblages, with Fe, Ca, and sediment end member distribution being important indicators. The diatom assemblages correlated to the Iron Age Cold Epoch (2800-2300 cal BP), Roman Warm Period (2250-1610 cal BP), Dark Age Cold Period (1500-1050 cal BP), Medieval Climate Anomaly (ca. 1100-800 cal BP), and the Little Ice Age (800-200 cal BP). The disappearance of Staurosira venter highlights the change from the Iron Age Cold Epoch to the Roman Warm Period. After deposition of the White River Ash (833-850 CE; 1117-1100 cal BP), transition to circumneutral conditions was followed in tandem by a transition to planktic influenced communities. Ten discrete peaks of Cu, Pb, and Zn were observed and attributed to soluble mobility from catchment soils through enhanced seepage and spring snowmelt. The prominent metal spikes were aligned with increases in Brachysira neoexilis. Downward mobilization of arsenic and antimony from contaminated surficial sediments highlight the problem of post depositional industrial contamination of paleosediments. Results demonstrate that paleoclimatic changes in the region, modulated by solar radiation, impacted temperature and precipitation in the lake catchment, influencing temporal shifts in diatom ecology. Changes in diatom taxa richness provided valuable information on the relative influence of water quality (planktic taxa) and sediment input (benthic taxa). The diatom assemblage succession also provides evidence that natural aging over time has played a role in the ecological evolution of the lake.						galloway, jennifer/0000-0002-4548-6396; Nasser, Nawaf/0000-0001-9057-3248; Hamilton, Paul/0000-0001-6938-6341													0959-6836	1477-0911				JUL	2021	31	7					1124	1137	09596836211003214	10.1177/09596836211003214	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836211003214		APR 2021											WOS:000649058700001

An adult bluegill reproduction study was conducted in six littoral enclosures located in a 2-ha pond near Duluth, Minnesota. Decreased growth of Y-O-Y-bluegill resulted from the reduction or elimination of preferred invertebrate prey items by diflubenzuron that led to different and/or less Y-O-Y food consumption. Adult bluegill behavior and spawning, embryo hatching, larval survival until swim-up, and Y-O-Y biomass were also studied. Before the first two diflubenzuron applications, spawning occurred in all enclosures; following the first application, spawning occurred in both control enclosures and one 30-mu g/L enclosure. Successful embryo hatching and larval swim-up occurred in all enclosures prior to the first application, and in one control and one 30-mu g/L enclosure following application. The Y-O-Y growth was the most sensitive end point, and Y-O-Y biomass was among the least sensitive end points for bluegill reproductive success. The Y-O-Y bluegills (and potentially other fish species) that are exposed to diflubenzuron concentrations of greater than or equal to 2.5 mu g/L may experience reduced growth, which can result in greater starvation, increased predation, reductions in over-winter survival, and diminished to poor recruitment.																			0730-7268	1552-8618				AUG	1995	14	8					1345	1355		10.1002/etc.5620140810	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/etc.5620140810													WOS:A1995RK78600010
J	WELLS, K; WONG, GJ				WELLS, K; WONG, GJ			PARTIAL INTERSTERILITY AND EVIDENCE OF ALLOPATRIC SPECIATION IN EXIDIOPSIS-PLUMBESCENS (EXIDIACEAE)	MYCOLOGIA												Two partially intersterile populations of Exidiopsis plumbescens are documented by pairing tests and morphological analyses. One population, E. plumbescens var. plumbescens, extends from Vancouver, British Columbia (Canada), to northern California (USA). The second population, E. plumbescens var. fabalispora, is known from Brackendale, Whistler, and Manning Park, British Columbia and Priest Lake, Idaho. Significant differences between the two populations were noted in basidial length/width ratio and basidiospore length; however, the most significant and consistent difference was basidiospore length/width ratio. On the basis of mean basidiospore length/width ratios, two specimens from Ontario are included in var. fabalispora. The type specimen of E. plumbescens, from Bingen, Washington, has a mean basidiospore length/width ratio within the range of var. plumbescens. No obvious differences in substrata between the populations were noted. Lower winter temperatures within the known range of var. fabalispora and variations in the amount of rainfall may be the basis for the partial reproductive isolation. The varying lengths of interfertility between the two populations suggest that several polygenic loci control interferitility with each positive locus exerting an additive effect, i.e. slightly enhancing interfertility. Although some overlapping of the two populations was noted, based on mean basidiospore length/width ratios and interfertility of specimens collected near the boundary between var. plumbescens and var. fabalispore, variations in interfertility and basidiospore length/width ratios do not seem to be consistently correlated with distance from the common boundary. Our data suggest that speciation in E. plumbescens is allopatric and is a gradual process responding to differences in climatic factors.																			0027-5514	1557-2536				JUL-AUG	1989	81	4					567	586		10.2307/3760133	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3760133													WOS:A1989AM25100010

Since the Middle Pleistocene, eruption of similar to 350 km(3) of basalt through rhyolite has produced a 30 km, arc front chain of nested calderas and overlapping stratovolcanoes. ELVC has experienced as many as five major caldera-forming eruptions, the most recent, at similar to 27 ka, produced similar to 50 km(3) of rhyolitic ignimbrite and ash fall. These violent silicic events were interspersed with less energetic, but prodigious, outpourings of basalt through dacite. Holocene eruptions are mostly basaltic andesite to andesite and historically recorded activity includes over 40 eruptions within the last 200 yr, all from Pavlof volcano, the most active site in the Aleutian Arc. Geochemical and geophysical observations suggest that although all ELVC eruptions derive from a common clinopyroxene + spinel + plagioclase fractionating high-aluminum basalt parent in the lower crust, magma follows one of two closely spaced, but distinct paths to the surface. Under the eastern end of the chain, magma moves rapidly and cleanly through a relatively young (similar to 28 ka), hydraulically connected dike plexus. Steady supply, short magma residence times, and limited interaction with crustal rocks preserve the geochemistry of deep crustal processes. Below the western part of the chain, magma moves haltingly through a long-lived (similar to 500 ka) and complex intrusive column in which many generations of basaltic to andesitic melts have mingled and fractionated. Buoyant, silicic melts periodically separate from the lower parts of the column to feed voluminous eruptions of dacite and rhyolite. Mafic lavas record a complicated passage through cumulate zones and hydrous silicic residues as manifested by disequilibrium phenocryst textures, incompatible element enrichments, and decoupling of REEs and HFSEs ratios. Such features are absent in mafic lavas from the younger part of the chain, highlighting the importance of plumbing architecture and longevity in creating petrologic diversity. Supplemental Data include 156 major element (XRF) and 128 trace element (ICP-MS) whole-rock analyses, 23 new 40Ar/39Ar ages, a generalized geologic map with associated unit descriptions and field photographs, and photomicrographs of key petrographic features.

Published by Elsevier B.V. Emmons Lake Volcanic Center (ELVC) on the lower Alaskan Peninsula is one of the largest and most diverse volcanic centers in the Aleutian Arc. Since the Middle Pleistocene, eruption of similar to 350 km(3) of basalt through rhyolite has produced a 30 km, arc front chain of nested calderas and overlapping stratovolcanoes. ELVC has experienced as many as five major caldera-forming eruptions, the most recent, at similar to 27 ka, produced similar to 50 km(3) of rhyolitic ignimbrite and ash fall. These violent silicic events were interspersed with less energetic, but prodigious, outpourings of basalt through dacite. Holocene eruptions are mostly basaltic andesite to andesite and historically recorded activity includes over 40 eruptions within the last 200 yr, all from Pavlof volcano, the most active site in the Aleutian Arc. Geochemical and geophysical observations suggest that although all ELVC eruptions derive from a common clinopyroxene + spinel + plagioclase fractionating high-aluminum basalt parent in the lower crust, magma follows one of two closely spaced, but distinct paths to the surface. Under the eastern end of the chain, magma moves rapidly and cleanly through a relatively young (similar to 28 ka), hydraulically connected dike plexus. Steady supply, short magma residence times, and limited interaction with crustal rocks preserve the geochemistry of deep crustal processes. Below the western part of the chain, magma moves haltingly through a long-lived (similar to 500 ka) and complex intrusive column in which many generations of basaltic to andesitic melts have mingled and fractionated.

Lake sediments are excellent archives to apply these tools due to their rapid and amplified response to environmental pressures. For the past thirty years, the hypersaline lagoons of the Rio de Janeiro coastal plain have been studied as natural laboratories for the observation of the biogeochemical processes involved in modern dolomite precipitation. Here, we apply a multiproxy approach to charac-terize two depositional stages during the Holocene that may have triggered primary dolomite formation in these lagoonal environments. A first stage, with two sub-stages (1A -6.1 to 4.2 kyr. BP; 1B -4.2 to -3.6 kyr. BP) was deposited during the sea-level rise, with sediments containing an abundance of long-chain n-alkanes with 2H-depleted (d2Hn-alk) signatures indicating riverine inputs of terrestrial organic carbon during prevailing wet conditions. A second stage (<,.,3.6 kyr. BP), comprising lacustrine facies, was characterized by high amounts of authigenic carbonate precipitates (calcite, Mg-calcite, Ca -dolomite, and dolomite). The carbonates are the result of physico-chemical changes in the water after the isolation of the lagoons from both the Atlantic Ocean and the neighboring Lagoa de Araruama due to a fall in sea level and aridification associated with intensification of the coastal upwelling after 2.2 kyr. BP. The n-alkanes deposited during this phase contain variable proportions of long and short -chain homologues indicating a mixed source of organic matter (terrestrial higher plants and microorganisms), as well as changes in vegetation associated with the driest conditions, inferred from the 2H -enriched n-alkane homologous. These results clearly demonstrate a climatic influence on dolomite formation in coastal hypersaline environments linked to sea-level change and coastal upwelling phenomena. With these observations, we hypothesize that the existence of similar palaeoceanographic and environmental conditions in the geologic past may have triggered the formation of extensive microbial dolomite deposits. This study provides new elements to interpret the formation of massive dolomite deposits in the geological record, for example, along the Late Triassic Tethys margin.(C) 2022 The Author(s).

J	Webb, S				Webb, Steve			Palaeotrophic reconstruction and climatic forcing of mega-Lake Eyre in late Quaternary Central Australia: a review	BOREAS												Extreme Quaternary climatic variation in Australia brought radical environmental changes to various parts of the continent. In this article, I discuss these changes in terms of mega-lake development in Central Australia, and in particular the southern Lake Eyre Basin (SLEB). The formation of these features, together with the fossil record of the region, throws light on the palaeoclimatic and palaeobiological relationships of megafauna and other animal groups, and the trophic development required to support them. Australian continental drying during the late Quaternary has been noted by many workers, but this process was punctuated by strong pluvial episodes of decreasing strength from MIS 5e. Mega-lake development during MIS 5 resulted from unusual monsoonal and evaporative patterns at that time. However, the climatic forcing behind mega-lake formation and the rate of lake growth is not well understood, although species composition in SLEB aquatic fossil fauna assemblages attests to the size and development of these lakes and indicates their long-term persistence. The degree of trophic development and the maintenance of broad, well-bedded aquatic and terrestrial ecological frameworks and biotic variety support that conclusion. The fossil record contributes to our understanding of mega-lake and palaeoriverine trophic complexity, the speed and duration of lake-fill and the intensity and persistence of the supporting intracontinental moisture balance. Although other more remote mega-lakes formed in Central Australia, they were not populated by complex trophic systems or megafauna populations. This discrepancy between the various geographic areas sheds light on the biogeography and population distribution of megafauna, thus helping form a better picture of the reasons behind the final extinction of relict populations of this group in MIS 4.

J	SEA, DS; WHITLOCK, C				SEA, DS; WHITLOCK, C			POSTGLACIAL VEGETATION AND CLIMATE OF THE CASCADE RANGE, CENTRAL OREGON	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Pollen data from two sites provide information on the postglacial vegetation and climate history of the Cascade Range. Indian Prairie in the western Cascade Range was colonized by subalpine forests of Pinus, Picea, and Tsuga and open meadows prior to ca. 12,400 C-14 yr B.P. The treeline lay 500 to 1000 m below its modern elevation and conditions were cooler than at present. From ca. 12,400 to ca. 9950 C-14 yr B.P. Abies became important and the forest resembled that presently found at middle elevations in the western Cascade Range. The pollen record implies a rise in treeline and warmer conditions than before. From ca. 10,000 to 4000-4500 C-14 Yr B.P., conditions that were warmer and effectively drier than today led to the establishment of a closed forest composed of Pseudotsuga, Abies, and, at lower elevations, Quercus and Corylus. During this period, Gold Lake Bog in the High Cascades was surrounded by closed forest of Pinus and Abies. The early-Holocene pollen assemblages at both Indian Prairie and Gold Lake Bog lack modern analogues, and it is likely that greater-than-present summer radiation fostered unique climatic conditions and vegetation associations at middle and high elevations. In the late Holocene, beginning ca. 4000-4500 C-14 yr B.P., cooler and more humid conditions prevailed and the modern vegetation was established. A comparison of these sites with others in the Pacific Northwest suggests that major patterns of vegetational change at individual sites were a response to large-scale changes in the climate system that affected the entire region.

Igneous rocks in Iceland with delta O-18 values significantly higher than unaltered oceanic crust (similar to 5.7 parts per thousand) are therefore rare. Here we report on rhyolitic intra-caldera samples from a cluster of Neogene central volcanoes in Borgarfjorour Eystri, Northeast Iceland, that show whole-rock delta O-18 values between +2.9 and +17.6 parts per thousand (n = 6), placing them among the highest delta O-18 values thus far recorded for Iceland. Extra-caldera rhyolite samples from the region, in turn, show delta O-18 whole-rock values between +3.7 and +7.8 parts per thousand (n = 6), consistent with the range of previously reported Icelandic rhyolites. Feldspar in the intra-caldera samples (n = 4) show delta O-18 values between +4.9 and +18.7 parts per thousand, whereas pyroxene (n = 4) shows overall low delta O-18 values of +4.0 to +4.2 parts per thousand, consistent with regional rhyolite values. In combination with the evidence from mineralogy and rock H2O contents, the high whole-rock delta O-18 values of the intra-caldera rhyolites appear to be the result of pervasive isotopic exchange during subsolidus hydrothermal alteration with O-18-enriched water. This alteration conceivably occurred in a near-surface hot spring environment at the distal end of an intra-caldera hydrothermal system. and was probably fed by waters that had already undergone significant isotope exchange with the country rock. Alternatively, O-18-enriched alteration fluids may have been produced during evaporation and boiling of standing water in former caldera lakes, which then interacted with the intra-caldera rock suites. Irrespective of the exact exchange processes involved, a previously unrecognized and highly localized delta O-18-enriched rock composition exists on Iceland and thus probably within the Icelandic crust too.					; Riishuus, Morten/E-7888-2010; Harris, Chris/H-8720-2012; Burchardt, Steffi/A-3107-2013	Harris, Chris/0000-0003-0340-6674; Troll, Valentin/0000-0003-1891-3396; Deegan, Frances/0000-0002-9065-9225; 													0026-461X	1471-8022				OCT	2018	82	5					1147	1168		10.1180/mgm.2018.114	http://dx.doi.org/10.1180/mgm.2018.114													WOS:000452016700011
J	VALTONEN, ET; RINTAMAKI, P; LAPPALAINEN, M				VALTONEN, ET; RINTAMAKI, P; LAPPALAINEN, M			TRIAENOPHORUS-NODULOSUS AND T CRASSUS IN FISH FROM NORTHERN FINLAND	FOLIA PARASITOLOGICA												10,288 fish specimens of 34 species from three water bodies in northern Finland were studied mainly in 1978-1982 Triaenophorus noduloses and Triaenophorus crasuss parasites. Six of the 31 species from the Bothnian Bay were found to harbour Triaenophorus nodullosus plerocercoids, four of the 11 from the cold, oligotrophic Lake Yli-Kitka in northeastern Finland and only one of the 6 from the small, eutrophic Lake Kuivasiarvi. The ruff (Gymnocephalus cernuus) was most essential intermediate host in the lakes, as supported by stomach analysis of predator fish. Although the highest prevalences were found in adult burbot (Lota lota) in two of the areas, those fish are more likely a blind end in the life cycle of Triaenophorus nodulosus in the present case. Triaenophorus crassus larvae were found only in three coregonid species and once in the intestine of a lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis) from the sea. Neither the prevalence not the intensity of infection in most of the intermediate fish hosts of Triaenophorus nodulosus was seen to increase with the length of the fish. The only exception was the ruff in Lake Yli-Kitka, where a sharp increase was encountered. No prominent seasonal variation in Triaenophorus larvae infections was found in any of the cases. The prevalence of Triaenophorus nodulosis infection in its final host, the pike (Esox lucius), was highest in the sea (93%) and lowest in the eutrophic lake (47%). Seasonally, the lowest T. nodulosus infections were found in June-July in the two lakes. A clear maturation cycle was also found with the youngest worms in the summer months in all cases. T. crassus was found in every third pike of the sea and its porportion in relation to Triaenophorus nodulosis is higher in the smaller and largest fish. In only 12%t of the pikes did the number of Triaenophorus crassus exceed that of Trianenophorus nodulosus however the mean ratio being 1:13 to favour of Triaenophorus nodulosis. The results give an indication that the composition of the fish fauna in each water body has a considerable influence on the Triaenophorus nodulosis burden and its distribution among its potential intermediate fish hosts. With the most stable environmental conditions and the greatest variety of fish species, the parasite burden in the Bothnian Bay is most evenly distributed among the 6 intermediate hosts. The fewer fish species occur in the water body, as in the present eutrophic lake, the more the significant of a few or even one intermediate host will increase.																			0015-5683	1803-6465					1989	36	4					351	370											2488051					WOS:A1989CA52700010

During pollen zone NM-I (ca. 18,500-12,500 yr B.P.) the Nichols Meadow area contained a stream during the Tioga glacial stage. The presence of high Artemisia and Gramineae pollen percentages along with a very low pollen influx rate reflects a cold-dry steppe-woodland environment. Pollen zone NM-II (ca. 12,500-8800 yr B.P.) documents the development of a lower montane forest and giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) community which existed around a small meadow. The higher sediment accumulation rates suggest that fallen trees contributed to the aggregation of meadow sediments. Early Holocene aridity is recorded in pollen zone NM-III (ca. 8800-6000 yr B.P.) by poorly preserved pollen. We infer that the forest trees closed in on the meadow and occupied the meadow floor. The reduction in available moisture caused giant sequoia to become locally extinct in the Nichols Meadow area probably moving into their current distribution within the Nelder Grove. Pollen zone NM-IV (6000 yr B.P.-present) reflects the development of the modern Nichols Meadow. Less sand in the meadow sediments, due to stable vegetation surrounding Nichols Meadow, allowed the increased retention of ground water. This along with the neoglacial cooling trend at ca. 3000 yr B.P. caused ground water to rise and saturate the meadow. These events excluded the conifers from the meadow surface and allowed herbaceous vegetation associated with wet meadows to dominate. Overgrazing and channeling of the meadow's outflowing stream caused the water table to drop, resulting in the incision of the meadow.																			0031-0182					NOV	1994	112	1-2					1	17		10.1016/0031-0182(94)90132-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0031-0182(94)90132-5													WOS:A1994QA18400001

A cosmogenic 10Be chronology for the local last glacial maximum and termination in the Cordillera Oriental, southern Peruvian Andes: Implications for the tropical role in global climate	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Resolving patterns of tropical climate variability during and since the last glacial maximum (LGM) is fundamental to assessing the role of the tropics in global change, both on ice-age and sub-millennial timescales. Here, we present a Be-10 moraine chronology from the Cordillera Carabaya (14.3 degrees S), a sub range of the Cordillera Oriental in southern Peru, covering the LGM and the first half of the last glacial termination. Additionally, we recalculate existing 10Be ages using a new tropical high-altitude production rate in order to put our record into broader spatial context. Our results indicate that glaciers deposited a series of moraines during marine isotope stage 2, broadly synchronous with global glacier maxima, but that maximum glacier extent may have occurred prior to stage 2. Thereafter, atmospheric warming drove widespread deglaciation of the Cordillera Carabaya. A subsequent glacier resurgence culminated at -16,100 yrs, followed by a second period of glacier recession. Together, the observed deglaciation corresponds to Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1: similar to 18,000-14,600 yrs), during which pluvial lakes on the adjacent Peruvian-Bolivian altiplano rose to their highest levels of the late Pleistocene as a consequence of southward displacement of the inter-tropical convergence zone and intensification of the South American summer monsoon. Deglaciation in the Cordillera Carabaya also coincided with the retreat of higher latitude mountain glaciers in the Southern Hemisphere. Our findings suggest that HS1 was characterised by atmospheric warming and indicate that deglaciation of the southern Peruvian Andes was driven by rising temperatures, despite increased precipitation. Recalculated 10Be data from other tropical Andean sites support this model. Finally, we suggest that the broadly uniform response during the LGM and termination of the glaciers examined here involved equatorial Pacific sea-surface temperature anomalies and propose a framework for testing the viability of this conceptual model.

Furthermore, a fish-kill in the Eastern Basin of the lake, in addition to a cyprinid reduction programme (biomanipulation; 1988-1992), in contrast to theory, did not lead to any increase in zooplankton biomass or size. This absence of response in the pelagic food chain may have been attributed to the increase in abundance of YOY (0+) fish, following the fish reduction programme. Despite the lack of effect on zooplankton, there was a decrease in phytoplankton biomass, a change in species composition and an increase in water transparency following biomanipulation. In 1989, one year after the fish-kill in Eastern Basin, the Secchi depth (summer mean) increased from 60 cm to 110 cm. In the following years, water transparency increased further, despite an increase in phosphorus loading. An unexpected effect of the biomanipulation was an increase in benthic invertebrate and staging waterfowl abundances, which occurred 2-4 years after fish reduction. Hence, the response in the benthic community following biomanipulation was considerably stronger than in the pelagic community. A likely explanation is that reduction in abundance of the benthic feeding fish species bream (Abramis brama), strongly affected the benthic invertebrate fauna. In this paper, we present what we believe happened in Lake Ringsjon, and which processes are likely to have been important at various stages of the restoration process.

As an additional measure to improve the quality of the lake water, the structure of the fish population in Lake Klein Vogelenzang (18 ha) was altered in 1989 by the removal of ca. 100 kg ha-1 bream from the lake in April and December. This constituted about 50 % of the total bream biomass in the lake. The fish-stock reduction in April, 1989, was initially followed by high phosphorus concentrations, probably the result of considerable phosphorus release from the sediments. The resulting heavy algal blooms that occurred reduced the transparency to very low values. During the summer the zooplankton population increased markedly in numbers coinciding with reductions in total suspended matter including (blue-green) algae. A great improvement in Secchi-disc transparency was observed and by the end of December, 1989, the bottom of the lake (1.5-2.0 m) was visible. After heavy storms in January and February 1990, transparency dropped to < 1 m as a result of resuspension of high concentrations of suspended matter from the bottom sediments. Although transparency over the rest of 1990 was higher than in 1988, i.e. the year preceding the removal of fish (biomanipulation), it was lower than expected, based on the results of 1989. The study shows that technical and biological factors can cause serious management problems for the implementation of biomanipulation in larger water bodies.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY 15	1992	233	1-3					213	224		10.1007/BF00016110	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00016110													WOS:A1992JD64800022

If the environment changed significantly during the period of deposition (several years) one can expect a mixture of species having different or contradictory ecological affinities. In this paper we present analyses of diatoms in surface sediment samples collected in the Lake Ossa area (3 degrees 50'N, 9 degrees 36E) and fossil diatoms from a mid-late Holocene core retrieved in the deepest part of the lake. The Lake Ossa area alternates between a short dry season centered at around the northern winter and a long rainy season during the rest of the year entailing significant changes in water level and pH. Based on multivariate analyses, we will show here that mean annual water depth is the most significant variable explaining the distribution of diatoms in the entire Lake. However, seasonal changes of water level are poorly recorded by diatom assemblages, except in some flat areas on the borders of the lakes where a mixing between species with different affinities to water depth is likely due to seasonal changes in water level. Inferred water depth based on a quantitative transfer function reflected essentially secular to millennial changes in the studied core. The relationship between pH and diatoms is not statistically significant but seasonal to multi-annual pH variations mainly observed in the central parts of the lake are reflected by a mixing of acidophilous and alkaliphilous species. Hierarchical ascending cluster analysis (HAC) considered as the most efficient mean of describing diatom mixing shows that seasonal to multi-annual changes in pH are recorded both in the modern and fossil assemblages. According to the degree of mixing between diatoms with different pH affinities we conclude that short-term pH variability was weaker than today between 5200 and 2700 cal yr BP, stronger between 2700 and 2000 cal yr BP, weaker again between 2000 and 600 cal yr BP and similar to present from 400 cal yr BP onwards. Short-term changes were thus superimposed on secular to millennium trends recorded by modifications in the abundance of alkaliphilous diatoms. All these changes are interpreted as variations in precipitation according to a previous model showing that pH is strongly controlled by acidic meteoric water. Inferred water depth slightly changed over the last 5500 years showing weak variations of precipitation minus evaporation balance at secular to millennial time scales. These results will be used to refine previously published paleoclimatic interpretations, which explained changes in precipitation and P-E balance by modifications in the vertical structure of the atmosphere and subsequently by changes in cloud cover, convective or stratiform.

During the incubation period, CDOM was produced from phytoplankton and macrophytes, and partly decomposed by microorganisms. The absorption spectra of the phytoplankton derived and the macrophyte derived CDOM were distinct and characterized by peaks and shoulders in the UV bands. Production of CDOM absorption at 350 nm, a(350), was 0.0125 m(2)/g per unit of chlorophyll a from phytoplankton CDOM from 0-3 d. Meanwhile a(350) production was 2.708 x 10(-4) m(2)/g per unit of wet biomass from macrophytes CDOM from 1-7 d. Despite the high production of CDOM by phytoplankton and macrophytes, extrapolation of these values to the field indicated that about 15% of total CDOM was produced from phytoplankton during algal blooms in Meiliang Bay in summer and about 8% of total CDOM was produced from macrophytes in the macrophyte dominated littorals. The mean value of the spectral slope (S) describing the exponential decrease of the absorption spectrum, which was strongly correlated to an optical index of molecular size, for the phytoplankton derived CDOM was 10.26 +/- 2.05 mu m(-1), which was significantly lower than the mean S of 14.47 +/- 2.88 mu m(-1) for the macrophyte derived CDOM (t-test, p < 0.001). The mean value of the spectral slope ratio (S-R) for the phytoplankton derived CDOM was 1.79 +/- 0.52, which was significantly higher than that of 0.35 +/- 0.58 for the macrophyte derived CDOM (t-test, p < 0.001). Three fluorescent components were validated in parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) models calculated separately for phytoplankton derived and macrophyte derived CDOM, each CDOM source resulting in distinct excitation and emission maxima for each component. The significant differences in CDOM absorption spectra, S, S-R and PARAFAC fluorescence component characteristics, all showed that phytoplankton derived CDOM was compositionally distinct from macrophyte derived CDOM. Overall both sources were important to the CDOM pool in the shallow temperate lake. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Horvath, TG; Lamberti, GA				Horvath, TG; Lamberti, GA			Recruitment and growth of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) in a coupled lake-stream system	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, is invading inland lakes and their outflowing streams in North America and Europe, yet little is known about mussel population dynamics in streams that provide natural conduits for dispersal. We compared veliger abundance, mussel recruitment, and growth of adult mussels in two connected lakes and their common outlet stream in southwestern Michigan, USA. Mean veliger abundance in the lakes was 31-92% higher and more variable over time than in the stream. Recruitment also was higher and more variable in the lakes (10.2 +/- 9.9 x 10(4) settlers m(-2) month(-1)) than in the stream (142.0 +/- 16.7 settlers m(-2) month(-1)). Recruitment in the stream declined exponentially with distance downstream (y = 679 e(-0.006d). R(2) = 0.75) from the lake outlet and no recruitment was detected farther than e 1.8 km downstream. Mean adult growth was lowest in Eagle Lake (3.2 +/- 0.1), but growth in Christiana Lake (8.6 +/- 0.3 mm) was similar to growth in the stream (9.5 +/- 0.3 mm) during the summer. Veliger abundance in the stream did not decline with distance downstream in 1994 or 1995, but declined significantly from 8.8 veligers/L at the lake outlet to 2.1 veligers/L near the mouth (ca. 18 km downstream) in 1996. Mean flux of veligers through the stream was about 800 million veligers/d in 1996. We conclude that small outflowing streams can provide a corridor for veliger dispersal into downstream ecosystems, but appear themselves to support only small populations of zebra mussels.																			0003-9136					MAY	1999	145	2					197	217																WOS:000080998600005
J	Ioannidis, Y; Bousbouras, D				Ioannidis, Y; Bousbouras, D			The space utilization by the reptiles in Prespa National Park	HYDROBIOLOGIA												In the first part of this paper data are presented on the habitat segregation of the reptile species of Lake Prespa National Park. Twenty species of reptiles are present in the study area. Most of them are of East-Mediterranean origin, some are Balkan endemics and a few are of northern origin. Systematic surveys and counts of reptiles were conducted in each of the following habitats: marshes and reedbeds, wet meadows, rocky coastal areas and sandy beaches, cultivated land, grazing lands, mixed deciduous, oak and beech forests, sub-alpine and alpine meadows. A list is provided of the typical reptile species occurring in each of these habitats, with notes on abundance and habits. The highest reptilian diversity was found in man-made/modified habitats, namely the farmland zone, which structurally is the more diversified. There was a dramatic fall of species richness with increasing altitude. The second part of the paper describes qualitative differences in habitat utilization among the members of the two major reptilian groups, lizards and snakes. The Sand Lizard Lacerta agilis is found exclusively in the alpine and subalpine grasslands above 1600 m. asl., the Common Wall Lizard Podarcis muralis is the more euryecous while all other Lacertids show a clear specialization in habitat use though retaining various degrees of overlap. Among snakes the Adder Vipera berus is restricted to high mountain grasslands, the two Natrix species are common and more or less confined to areas close to the lakes while the Nose-horned Viper Vipera anmmodytes the third commonest species of the area prefers rocky/stony slopes. The notes on habitat utilization by the remaining species of snakes are only of indicative value because of small number of observations.																			0018-8158					AUG 22	1997	351						135	142		10.1023/A:1003076810835	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003076810835													WOS:A1997YG80000011

We show that the hydrological response to the Holocene humid phase in the northern tropics strongly differs from a region to another. The humid period is significantly shorter in the Arabian peninsula and the horn of Africa compared to northern Africa even though its maximum is contemporaneous (11,000-7,000 cal yr BP). Western India displays a specific hydrological signal characterized by the importance of well-developed fluvial systems from the Himalayas and the paucity of lakes compared to the other regions. In western India, the humid peak is shifted toward the mid Holocene (8,000-6,000 cal yr BP). Both marine records show a peak between similar to 11,000 and 7,000 cal yr BP for the Holocene humid period, in good accordance with African-Arabian records. However, while continental hydrological data suggest that the onset and termination of this humid period might have been relatively progressive, the marine windborne records indicate abrupt transitions, somewhat out-of-phase with continental evidence (e.g. abrupt decrease of aeolian proxies as early as similar to 15,000 cal yr BP). Discrepancies between marine and continental likely result from the fact that aeolian fluxes at a given marine location do not simply record monsoon-related changes of humidity over the adjacent continental sources but could be affected also by changes of the source area (e.g., emersion of the Arabo-Persian gulf associated to the glacial, low sea-level stand), and changes in wind intensity and/or direction.

J	Staniforth, RJ				Staniforth, RJ			Effects of urbanization on bird populations in the Canadian central Arctic	ARCTIC												Development of the Hamlet of Baker Lake (Qamani'tuaq) in the central Canadian Arctic during the 1950s was typical of the local urbanization that has occurred in Arctic regions during the latter half of the 20th century. The effects of urbanization on bird populations were examined by comparing populations before and after 1950, comparing populations in anthropogenic ecosystems with natural ones, and recording the presence or absence of exotic species usually associated with human dwellings and settlements. Of a total 60 local species, 21 had not been reported prior to 1950. Most of these were waterfowl, shorebirds, and gulls, all species that benefited from the presence of sewage lagoons and a refuse dump, or were associated with building sites (American robin). Semipalmated plovers were associated with gravel pits and gravel roadsides, whereas semipalmated sandpipers, Lapland longspurs, homed larks, Savannah sparrows, and white-crowned sparrows were most abundant in town. Vagrants from south of the tree line have been reported from the study site. It is hypothesized that climatic amelioration in association with the development of urban ecosystems may have encouraged migration overshoots in these species. These vagrants may be the early colonizers that eventually result in breeding range extensions, as has been observed in several waterfowl species, American robins, and white-throated sparrows. Twelve apparent species losses have occurred since 1950, but these are likely due to general scarcity or lack of observers rather than reduced abundance. No exotic "city" species, such as rock doves, European starlings, or house sparrows, have been recorded in Baker Lake. It is not anticipated that these species would become established or survive at Baker Lake in the near future, because of its isolation and severe winters.																			0004-0843					MAR	2002	55	1					87	93																WOS:000174673600008
J	O'Gorman, R; Elrod, JH; Schneider, CP				O'Gorman, R; Elrod, JH; Schneider, CP			Reproductive potential and fecundity of lake trout strains in southern and eastern waters of Lake Ontario, 1977-1994	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We assessed the reproductive potential of various genetic strains of hatchery lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) in southern and eastern Lake Ontario fi om indices of fecundity and indices of male abundance. Indices were constructed from catches of mature lake trout in gill nets during September 1980 to 1994 after correcting for mortality from sea lampreys (Petromyzon marinus) which occurred between September sampling and late fall spawning. Strain and age were assigned to individual lake trout based on clipped fins and maxillary bones or coded wire tags. Fecundity-length relationships for fish of the same age, determined from mature females collected in 1977 to 1981 and 1994, were nos different (P > 0.05) among genetic strains. For all strains combined, fecundity-length relationships in 1977 to 1981 were not different among fish of various ages but in 1994, age-5 and -6 fish had fewer eggs (P < 0.003) than age-7 fish, and age-7 fish had fewer eggs (P < 0.003) than fish of age 8, 9, or 10. Annual indices of fecundity varied 19 fold and indices of mature males varied 11 fold; both indices were low in the early 1980s, increased sharply in the mid 1980s, and peaked in 1993. The strain which dominated fecundity and mature male indices shifted during the study from Seneca Lake strain to Lake Superior strain and then back to Seneca Lake strain. However, changes in either reproductive potential or genotypes do not appear responsible for the abrupt appearance of naturally-produced yearling lake trout throughout southern and eastern Lake Ontario in 1994-1995, the first widespread occurrence of juveniles produced by hatchery lake trout in Lake Ontario.																			0380-1330						1998	24	1					131	144		10.1016/S0380-1330(98)70805-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(98)70805-6													WOS:000072958100012

The frequency of algal proliferation has increased all over the world due to changes in the water quality factors of the water systems. This study determined the correlation between Uroglena americana (U. americana) and water quality factors. U. americana mainly proliferated in late April at the surface level of the source water when the water temperature was in the range of 15.8-17.9 ?. Water temperature was negatively correlated with U. americana throughout the sampling period. In spring, the dissolved nitrogen (DN), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), fluorescence substance (peaks 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), and electrical conductivity (EC) were positively correlated with the U. americana whereas the pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), oxidative reduction potential (ORP), turbidity, color, and dissolved phosphorus (DP) were negatively correlated. The total bacteria (16S rDNA) of source water showed a strong positive correlation (r = 0.66 at p = 0.05) with U. americana. The proliferation of U. americana also could be influenced by the associated microalgae species of source water. The Peridinium and Asterionella species were negatively correlated with U. americana, whereas the Euglena, Chlamydomonas, and Nitzchia species were positively correlated; among them, Euglena sp showed a significant positive correlation (r = 0.90, at p = 0.01) with U. americana. The obtained results of this study could be applied to the source water quality management and the optimization of the operating conditions of drinking water treatment plants to ensure the quality of drinking water.

Achieng; Davidsdottir, Brynhildur; Fridleifsson, Ingvar Birgir			Potential contribution of geothermal energy to climate change adaptation: A case study of the arid and semi-arid eastern Baringo lowlands, Kenya	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS												The impacts of recurrent droughts have increased vulnerability and reduced the adaptive capacity of the people living in arid and semi-arid lands (ASALS) of Kenya. Current interventions are short-term and curative in nature, hence unsustainable. Some of the most arid and semi-arid lands are located within the Kenyan Rift system, which has an estimated geothermal potential of about 7000 to 10,000 MWe, out of which only 200 MWe has been developed, and about 5000 MWe planned by 2030. Recent power sector reforms have built institutional structures that will accelerate development of geothermal energy. The paper analyses the potential use of geothermal energy resources in eastern Baringo lowlands between Lake Bogoria and Silali prospects, which has an estimated potential of >2700 MWe, in creating the necessary adjustments needed to adapt to the impacts of recurrent droughts by locals. Opportunities for direct and indirect uses of geothermal energy exist in climate vulnerable sectors, such as, agriculture, fisheries, water, livestock production as well as alternative income generating activities such as, tourism, micro enterprises, aloe, honey and beeswax production, fabric dyeing and others using resources sourced from within a 50 km radius. The possibility of accelerated geothermal development and proposed utilisation schemes in causing maladaptation if unsustainably implemented is also discussed. The paper draws a Lindal diagram adapted to the study area showing potential utilisation in the above sectors, and new flow diagram showing potential for cascaded use of geothermal hot water through the different processes. An estimated capacity of 100 MWt and 100 MWe can be used in the potential utilisation schemes discussed in this article to meet local adaptation and lighting needs and much less in a cascaded process. Potential barriers and possible solutions are also discussed. The study concludes that geothermal energy is a vital option for adaptation in the study area if sustainably used. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A 4000 yr old fossil assemblage in the Mare Aux Songes (MAS), southwest Mauritius, Mascarene Islands, contains bones of 100000+ individual vertebrates, dominated by two species of giant tortoises Cylindraspis triserrata and C. inepta, the dodo Raphus cucullatus, and 20 other vertebrate species (Rijsdijk, Hume, Bunnik, Florens, Baider, Shapiro et al. (2009) Mid-Holocene vertebrate bone Concentration-Lagerstatte on oceanic island Mauritius provides a window into the ecosystem of the dodo (Raphus cucullatus). Quaternary Science Reviews 28: 14-24). Nine radiocarbon dates of bones statistically overlap and suggest mass mortality occurred between 4235 and 4100 cal. yr BP. The mortality period coincides with a widely recognized megadrought event. Our multidisciplinary investigations combining geological, paleontological and hydrological evidence suggests the lake was located in a dry coastal setting and had desiccated during this period. Oxygen isotope data from a Uranium-series dated stalagmite from Rodrigues, an island 560 km east of Mauritius, supports this scenario by showing frequently alternating dry and wet periods lasting for decades between 4122 and 2260 cal. yr BP. An extreme drought resulted in falling water-tables at MAS and elsewhere on the island, perhaps deprived these insular vertebrates of fresh water, which led to natural mass mortalities and possibly to extirpations. In spite of these events, all insular species survived until at least the seventeenth century, confirming their resistance to climatic extremes. Despite this, the generally exponential increase of combined human impacts on islands including loss of geodiversity, habitats, and stocks of fresh water, there will be less environmental safe-haven options for insular endemic and native vertebrates during future megadrought conditions; and therefore will be more prone to extinction.					; Baider, Claudia/C-2570-2009; Florens, F.B.V./C-2572-2009; Rijsdijk, kenneth/A-2415-2013; Meijer, Hanneke/A-1912-2013; Zinke, Jens/G-5026-2011	Meijer, Harro A.J./0000-0001-8744-5632; Rijsdijk, kenneth/0000-0002-0943-2577; Baider, Claudia/0000-0002-2203-2076; Brinkkemper, Joost/0000-0003-2506-9066; Vonhof, Hubert/0000-0002-0897-8244; Meijer, Hanneke/0000-0001-7066-6869; Porch, Nick/0000-0001-7179-3843; Florens, Francois Benjamin Vincent/0000-0002-1720-5438; Zinke, Jens/0000-0002-0634-8281													0959-6836	1477-0911				DEC	2011	21	8					1179	1194		10.1177/0959683611405236	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683611405236													WOS:000297760600001
J	Kovac, V				Kovac, V			Biology of Eurasian ruffe from Slovakia and adjacent central European countries	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH					International Symposium on Eurasian Ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus) Biology, Impacts, and Control	1995	THUNDER BAY, MI					Research information on Eurasian ruffe from previously published peer-review literature, reports, and previously unavailable or unpublished research from Slovakia and central Europe is synthesized. The synthesis focuses on geographical distribution, habitat requirements, reproductive biology, early development, diet, morphology, age and growth, and karyotype, analysis. In Slovakia, the Eurasian ruffe prefers lentic to lotic environment. It is benthic but does not demonstrate any substrate preferences. However, it requires clean and well-oxygenated water. Males attain sexual maturity at standard length 32 to 80 mm, females at 57 to 90 mm. Eurasian ruffe is a polycyclic species with asynchronous ripening of eggs and protracted spawning. it spawns between mid-April and mid-June at water temperatures 7.1 to 20.2 degrees C. Absolute individual fecundity is very variable, ranging from 1,000 to 150,000 eggs. The diameter of eggs varies from 0.97 mm to 1.07 mm. Embryos attain 3.35 mm to 3.81 mm at hatching. Ruffe feed mainly on larvae of chironomids, being active throughout the year including winter. Most individuals attain a maximum age of 6 years, exceptionally 7 or 8 years, and a maximum size of 15 cm, exceptionally 20 cm in total length. In the Danube River, the abundance of the ruffe ranges from 49 to 4,254 ind/ha in side-arms, and from 378 to 14,934 ind/ha in oxbow lakes. Ruffe is a prey species for large piscivores, such as pike and pikeperch. Fish eggs have not been found in stomachs of ruffe from the Danube. Therefore, the only impact of the species on local fish assemblages can be competition for food.

Ikaite formation in streams affected by steel waste leachate: First report and potential impact on contaminant dynamics	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Highly alkaline (pH 9-12) waters can arise from a range of globally significant and environmentally impactful industrial processes such as lime, steel and cement production, alumina refining and energy generation (e.g. combustion ashes). Such residue storage sites are often characterized by extreme geochemical conditions that can be hazardous to aquatic life but are quickly becoming a critical focus for resource recovery and carbon capture initiatives. The very high rates of mineral precipitation at these sites can give rise to the formation of transient minerals that are not currently well understood. As such our estimates of carbon budgets and understanding of trace metal dynamics at highly alkaline sites is currently limited. This study provides a significant advancement in the basis for characterising hyperalkaline carbonate systems through identification and chemical analysis of transient minerals forming in sites receiving high pH (>11) steel slag leachate in northern England. Whilst most of the secondary deposits at the study sites appear to be dominated by calcite, this study provides the first account of ikaite (CaCO3.6H(2)O) crystallization within steel-slag leachate, using novel field (Fourier Transform Infra-Red) supported by rapid laboratory (X-Ray Diffraction) validation. This study suggests that ikaite is a secondary mineral with a primary phase being amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC). Trace element analysis of ikaite forming in these steel-slag leachate affected waters is demonstrates its strong affinity to incorporate relatively large inventories of potentially harmful metals (e.g. lead and cadmium). Importantly, ikaite is only stable at low temperatures (-4 to 8 degrees C) and thus is of significant concern given its potential to release hazardous pulses of contamination during warming events in the spring. The findings provide an improved understanding of carbonate precipitation processes at highly alkaline sites which in turn should influence future research endeavours around mineral carbonation, trace metal dynamics and environmental remediation at these sites globally.

J	Dong, YJ; Wu, NQ; Li, FJ; Huang, LP; Wen, WW				Dong, Yajie; Wu, Naiqin; Li, Fengjiang; Huang, Linpei; Wen, Wenwen			Time-Transgressive Nature of the Magnetic Susceptibility Record across the Chinese Loess Plateau at the Pleistocene/Holocene Transition	PLOS ONE												The loess stratigraphic boundary at the Pleistocene/Holocene transition defined by the magnetic susceptibility (MS) has previously been assumed to be synchronous with the Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 2/1 boundary, and approximately time-synchronous at different sections across the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP). However, although this assumption has been used as a basis for proxy-age model of Chinese loess deposits, it has rarely been tested by using absolute dating methods. In this study, we applied a single-aliquot regenerative-dose (SAR) protocol to the 45-63 mu m quartz grain-size fraction to derive luminescence ages for the last glacial and Holocene sections of three loess sections on a transect from southeast to northwest across the CLP. Based on the 33 closely spaced optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) samples from the three sections, OSL chronologies were established using a polynomial curve fit at each section. Based on the OSL chronology, the timing of the Pleistocene/Holocene boundary, as defined by rapid changes in MS values, is dated at similar to 10.5 ka, 8.5 ka and 7.5 ka in the Yaoxian section, Jingchuan and Huanxian sections respectively. These results are clearly inconsistent with the MIS 2/1 boundary age of 12.05 ka, and therefore we conclude that the automatic correlation of the Pleistocene/Holocene transition, as inferred from the MS record, with the MIS 2/1 boundary is incorrect. The results clearly demonstrate that the marked changes in MS along the southeast to northwest transect are time-transgressive among the different sites, with the timing of significant paleosol development as indicated by the MS record being delayed by 3-4 ka in the northwest compared to the southeast. Our results suggest that this asynchronous paleosol development during the last deglacial was caused by the delayed arrival of the summer monsoon in the northwest CLP compared to the southeast.					li, fengjiang/KRP-7774-2024; Wu, Naiqi/C-2953-2017	Dong, Yajie/0000-0003-3913-2812; Li, Fengjiang/0000-0003-3748-8305													1932-6203					JUL 17	2015	10	7							e0133541	10.1371/journal.pone.0133541	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0133541								26186443					WOS:000358198700156
J	Paperna, I; Ogara, W				Paperna, I; Ogara, W			Description and ultrastructure of Lankesterella species infecting frogs in Kenya	PARASITE												Two species of Lankesterella are described from Kenyan frogs. In the first, lankesterello ptychadeni n. sp. from the frog Ptychadena mascareniensis (Dumeril & Bibron) found in the Lake Victoria region of Kenya, oogony and sporogony take place in the gut epithelium and in the lamina propria. Oocysts yield eight sporozoites which accumulate in both the gut mucosal epithelium and in the lamina propria. In the same frog merogony stages were traced in the liver, and sporogony stages, with eight sporozoite progeny, occurred in detached endothelial cells in the blood, alongside sporozoites in the erythrocytes. These stages represent either a different generation of the same species or belong to a different species. The second, Lankesterella dicroglossi n. sp. recovered from Dicroglossus occipitalis (Gunther), in a spring south of Lake Baringo in Kenya, walled oocysts ore formed in the reticuloendothelial cells of the liver, spleen, and lungs and in the blood-vessel endothelium. Infected endothelium detaches into the blood stream. Oocysts yield over 40 sporocysts. The latter were seen accumulating in macrophage centers, as were invading circulating erythrocytes. An ultrastructural study of L. ptychadeni oocysts and sporozoites reveales features in common with previously ultrastructurally studied Lankesterella spp., together with unique fine-structural features in the oocysts not reported to date: a large, rolled mitochondrion, an electron-dense tubulo-vesicular network, expended Golgi-adjunct structures and endoplasmic reticulum Riled with coarse granules.																			1252-607X	1776-1042				DEC	1996	3	4					341	349		10.1051/parasite/1996034341	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/parasite/1996034341													WOS:A1996WB07500006

Emergent vegetation in Netley-Libau Marsh: Temporal changes (1990-2013) in cover in relation to Lake Winnipeg level and Red River flow	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												A time-series (1990-2013) of classified vegetation cover maps was produced for Netley-Libau Marsh, a 26,000 ha coastal wetland on Lake Winnipeg, to assess its current status and verify earlier trends of emergent vegetation loss. Open water area in the marsh was measured from late-summer Landsat images for 20 years; three classes of vegetation types (emergents, wet meadows, upland) could also be identified for 12 images covering the same period. Temporal changes in area and distribution of marsh vegetation were related to adjoining Lake Winnipeg water-level and Red River discharge, as well as marsh connectivity and bathymetry. From 1990 to 2002, an increase in open-water areas and decrease in emergent vegetation coincided with rising levels and flows. The year 2003 marked major wetland regeneration and a decrease of open-water area under extremely low water-levels and flows. From 2005 to 2013, openwater area remained consistent, under high but variable levels and flows. A strong negative correlation was found between area of emergent vegetation and mean Red River discharge in the previous JuneJuly. Superimposition of the limit of new emergent vegetation observed in 2003 with depth contours surveyed in 2010 revealed the dynamic nature of marsh bathymetry. Periods of extremely low water as short as one year (2003) induced a marked expansion in emergent vegetation cover that persisted over the next ten years despite higher water-levels. Rather than being gradual, changes in the spatial extent of NetleyLibau Marsh vegetation appeared to proceed by fits and starts, wherein periods of relative stasis were disrupted by major changes in abundance.

Mercury stable isotope compositions of Chinese urban fine particulates in winter haze days: Implications for Hg sources and transformations	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Atmospheric pollution by fine particulates and mercury (Hg) in emerging economies is a serious environmental concern. Here, we present Hg concentrations and isotope compositions of 24-hour integrated fine particulate matter (PM2.5) samples collected during January 2014 at four large Chinese cities (three inland cities: Beijing, Changchun and Chengdu; one coastal city: Hong Kong), with an aim of identifying the potential Hg sources and transformation processes. Mean concentrations of PM2.5 (171 +/- 62 mu g m(-3)) and PM2.5-bound Hg (1.3 +/- 1.1 ng m(-3)) in Chengdu were the highest. Overall, PM2.5 samples in Chinese inland cities were characterized by moderately negative delta Hg-202 (-1.08 +/- 0.64 parts per thousand, 1 sigma), slightly negative Delta Hg-199 (- 0.13 +/- 0.28 parts per thousand, 1 sigma) and insignificant Delta Hg-200 (0.03 +/- 0.05 parts per thousand, 1 sigma). On average, delta Hg-202 of PM2.5 was the highest in Chengdu (- 0.74 +/- 0.67 parts per thousand, 1 sigma), followed by Beijing (- 1.11 +/- 0.26 parts per thousand, 1 sigma) and Changchun (- 1.60 +/- 0.45 parts per thousand, 1 sigma). PM2.5 from Beijing showed the most negative Delta Hg-199 (- 0.31 +/- 0.40 parts per thousand, 1 sigma) that was significantly lower than Changchun (- 0.12 +/- 0.21 parts per thousand, 1 sigma) and Chengdu (- 0.02 +/- 0.15 parts per thousand, 1 sigma). Coal combustion and cement production were identified to be the dominant sources of PM2.5-bound Hg in these cities, with additional Hg sources from non-ferrous metal smelting in Chengdu. Besides, Hg emissions from biomass burning were evident in specific days for each city. We found that source materials and isotope fractionation during emission processes could not fully explain the observed Hg isotope compositions in PM2.5, especially the large negative Delta Hg-199 values ( < -0.3 parts per thousand) in Beijing. The near-unity slope of Delta Hg-199 vs. Delta Hg-201 in PM2.5 samples from each studied city indicates that Hg n in the fine aerosols was likely photo-reduced to different degrees in the atmosphere following emission from sources.

Pollen and macrofossil-inferred palaeoclimate at the Ridge Site, Hudson Bay Lowlands, Canada: evidence for a dry climate and significant recession of the Laurentide Ice Sheet during Marine Isotope Stage 3	BOREAS												We examine pollen, macrofossils and sedimentological proxies from the Ridge Site, an 18-m sequence of glacial and non-glacial sediments exposed along the bank of the Ridge River in the southern Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL), Canada. As the HBL is located in the previously glaciated region of North America, palaeorecords from this region have important implications for understanding ice-sheet palaeogeography and climate for the late Pleistocene. Two diamicton units were interpreted as subglacial till deposited by a glacier flowing toward the south-southwest (lower diamicton) and west-southwest (upper diamicton), respectively. Confined between these tills is a 6-m non-glacial unit, constrained to Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3; c. 57000 to c. 29000 a BP) by three radiocarbon dates. Quantitative analyses of the pollen record (dominated by Sphagnum, Cyperaceae, Pinus, Picea, Salix, Alnus and Betula) suggest that average summer temperature (June, July, August) was 14.6 +/- 1.51 degrees C, which is similar to that of the present day at the site. Total annual precipitation was 527 +/- 170mm as compared to 705mm present-day. The macrofossil record confirmed the local presence of Betula, Salix and conifers. Our results, in combination with other records from the periphery of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, suggest that vast boreal forest-type vegetation, along with a drier interstadial climate, existed in the region during MIS 3. We also compare pollen-derived palaeoclimate reconstructions from the Ridge Site with reconstructions from a previously published site along the Nottaway River, HBL, which was dated to MIS 5a-d (c. 109000 to c. 82000 a BP). This comparison suggests that, with additional data, it may be possible to differentiate MIS 3 and MIS 5 deposits in the HBL on the basis of relative continentality, with MIS 3 characterized by lower total annual precipitation, and MIS 5 by values similar or greater than present-day.					; Finkelstein, Sarah/K-8202-2012	Finkelstein, Sarah/0000-0002-8239-399X; Dalton, April Sue/0000-0002-0725-1385													0300-9483	1502-3885				JUL	2017	46	3					388	401		10.1111/bor.12218	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bor.12218													WOS:000404144500002

Paleoenvironmental records in this part of the semiarid Andes are key to estimating the effects of past climate changes on local communities helping to forecast the ecological and biological responses under the aridification trend projected during the 21(st) century. Here we present a 2400-year multiproxy paleoenvironmental reconstruction based on pollen, diatoms, chironomids, sedimentological and geochemical data (XRF and ICP-MS data) of Laguna El Calvario (29 degrees S; 3994 m a.s.l), a small and shallow Andean lake. Four main hydrological phases were established based on changes in the lithogenic and geochemical results associated with allochthonous runoff input and the subsequent response of the biological proxies. Between 2400 and 1400 cal yrs BP, wetter than present conditions occurred based on the intense weathering of the lake basin and the dominance of upper Andean vegetation. A decrease in moisture along with sub-centennial discrete wet pulses and lake-level changes occurred until similar to 800 cal yrs BP followed long-term stable climate conditions between 1850 and 1950 AD as suggested by a drop in vegetation productivity and low lake levels. From 1950 AD to the present, a decline in moisture with a severe trend to drier conditions occurring in the last decades occurred as reflected by an upward vegetation belt displacement around Laguna El Calvario along with a turnover of diatom assemblages and high productivity in the water column.					; Maldonado, Antonio/D-7568-2013; Muñoz, Praxedes/P-5259-2016; munoz, praxedes/P-5259-2016	Martel-Cea, Alejandra/0000-0001-8132-3765; munoz, praxedes/0000-0002-0402-681X													2296-701X					DEC 8	2023	11								1227020	10.3389/fevo.2023.1227020	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2023.1227020													WOS:001128774800001

The accuracy of GPR measurements of ice thicknesses is highly dependent on the dielectric constant value of ice. Research on the dielectric constant of ice has mainly focused on pure ice; however, pure ice is not commonly found in natural rivers. In fact, hydrodynamic and meteorological factors, as well as boundary conditions, affect ice in natural rivers, which can be treated as a mixture of pure ice, air bubbles, sediment, and pure water. Therefore, the dielectric constant of ice in natural rivers often differs from the theoretical value of pure ice, a fact that has often been neglected in prototype measurements. During eight years of prototype monitoring in the Heilong River and Yellow River (China), it was found that variations in the dielectric constants of ice in the two rivers produced errors in the GPR ice thickness measurements. In this study, we measure the dielectric constant of ice at 158 measurement points across more than 20 river sections, and we present a recommended range of values for the dielectric constant. Regarding media, such as air bubbles, sediment, and water in natural river ice, we analyze sand (both dry and wet) in icebound sediment and the effects of air bubbles, sediment, and water upon the ice's dielectric constant. Using temperature and voltage measuring rods installed in the ice, we demonstrate that the water content in the ice differs significantly according to the freeze-up and breakup periods. The present study recommends guidelines including suitable timing, ice-condition, and dielectric-constant reference values for GPR-based ice thickness measurements to improve the measurement accuracy. Thus, this work can serve as a reference for future applications in similar rivers.

Bradford			Natural and cultural eutrophication of Sluice Pond, Massachusetts, USA, recorded by algal and protozoan microfossils	HOLOCENE												Microfossil studies from Sluice Pond, Massachusetts, identified two environmental perturbations that impacted algal and protozoan communities: (1) natural eutrophication and water column mixing driven by the mid-Holocene drought and (2) cultural eutrophication, increasing bottom water anoxia, and toxicity accompanying human settlement. SP09 KC2 from the deep basin of this partially meromictic pond has an abundant and diverse record of dinoflagellate cysts spanning 11,400 years. Bottom water anoxia appears to have prevented benthic protozoans from colonizing until lake levels fell throughout New England during the mid-Holocene drought. Lower lake levels allowed mixing of the water column and a thecamoebian fauna rich in centropyxids, Pontigulasia compressa, and Difflugia oblonga to flourish in SP09 KC2. This lowstand is marked by an unconformity spanning the mid-Holocene hemlock minimum (5400-3500 cal. BP) in SP07 PC4 and by an increase in nutrients in the water column allowing mesotrophic-eutrophic dinoflagellate taxa (Peridinium cf. gatunense and Peridinium willei) to increase at the expense of Peridinium wisconsinense. Rising lake levels in response to the warm, wet climate are recorded by increasing abundances of protozoa tolerant of lower dissolved oxygen (DO) throughout Sluice Pond similar to 2200 cal. BP - the thecamoebians Arcella vulgaris, Difflugia protaeiformis, and Cucurbitella tricuspis and the ciliate Codonella cratera. Subsequent decline in lake level associated with late Holocene aridity allowed a diverse thecamoebian community to thrive until around 300 years ago when a more intense phase of eutrophication resulted from human impact. Bottom water anoxia due to enhanced biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) is recorded by the dominance of C. tricuspis in sediments rich in ragweed pollen and other weedy plants. Peak cyst concentrations in this interval in SP07 PC4 reflect cultural eutrophication leading to high primary productivity and low DO, promoting cyst preservation. Low microfossil concentrations in the surface sediments are attributed to low DO and toxicity.																			0959-6836	1477-0911				DEC	2014	24	12					1731	1742		10.1177/0959683614551227	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683614551227													WOS:000346178500010

Surrounding vegetation was a grassy alpine herbfield with many Asteraceae, Apiaceae and Gentianella diemensis, corresponding to the regional Club Lake Zone C, dated to the same period. Astelia died out c. 6500 years before present approximately at the Club Lake C/D 1 boundary, marked by spread of Pomaderris in subjacent montane forests. Thereafter, shrubs, mainly Myrtaceae and Epacridaceae, and Restionaceae (Empodisma and Restio australis) dominated the bog. Epacris cf. paludosa and C. pityoides seem to have been the earliest shrubs to invade, Baeckea, probably B. gunniana, and Richea continentis reaching maximum prominence 5000-3000 years before present. Sphagnum was uncommon until recently. Regional arboreal pollen enable comparisons with other sites in south-eastern Australia but immigration of the tree-line species Eucalyptus pauciflora subsp. niphophila (snowgum) is not well expressed in the pollen spectra. Surface and near-surface counts of this species are higher than at any preceding time, and correspond most closely to surface counts in adjacent young snowgum woodland. The co-occurrence of weed pollens, probably associated with the late 19th and early 20th century practice of summer pasturing stock on the alpine-subalpine tract, suggests that pasturing and burning, responsible for widespread severe fires on this range, led both to the formation of dense even-aged snowgum woodland that had been open and patchy at this altitude, and a spread of Sphagnum on the bog surface.																			0067-1924						1999	47	5					725	744		10.1071/BT98002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/BT98002													WOS:000082859700004

Computer-controlled greenhouses were used to determine diurnal ecosystem flux of CO2 under four treatments: 340 ppm, 510 ppm, and 680 ppm CO2, as well as 680 ppm CO2 with a four degree centrigrade increase in temperature. For the seven days of data analyzed, net daily CO2 flux was significantly different between treatments. Net uptake was positively correlated with CO2 concentration in the chamber and negatively correlated with temperature. A nonlinear model was used to analyze this data set and to determine some of the reasons for different net CO2 flux. This model allowed an estimation of light utilization efficiency, total conductance of CO2, and a comparable measure of total respiration. From this analysis we conclude that nutrient limitations in the arctic decrease the capacity of tundra plants to make use of elevated CO2 concentrations. The plants respond by decreasing conductance in the presence of elevated CO2, which results in approximately equal gross uptake rates for the three CO2 treatments. Apparent changes in system respiration result in higher net uptake under elevated CO2 but this may be due to biases in the data. The treatment with increased temperature exhibited higher conductances and, consequently higher gross uptake of CO2 than the other treatments. Higher temperatures, however, also increase respiration with the result being lower net uptake than would be expected in the absence of temperature increases.

Viviparus are among the dominant members of the benthic fauna at the 2nd trophic level in these localities. A growth survey involved regular sampling for measurements of growth, fecundity, mortality and biomass production. V. georgianus were variable in .female. life span, with 2 populations having a 36 mo. maximum life and the remaining 2 populations having a 28 mo. maximum life. Maximum life span of .male..male. was similar in all populations at 21-22 mo. Analyses of growth and biomass production as organic C and total N were utilized to estimate standing crop biomass leading to productivity rates, and of changing C:N ratios during growth and reproduction. Productivity ranged from 0.911-8.303 mg C/(m2 .cntdot. day). The .female. portions of the populations were .apprxeq. 5.times. as productive as the .male. portions. The lower life span, growth rates and productivity of .male..male. are believed to be linked to increased .male. mobility during the breeding period, with subsequent decrease in filter-feedind during spring primary productivity. Reproduction in V. georgianus was iteroparous and viviparus, with a gestation time of .apprxeq. 9 mo. Fecundity varied 7-fold between the populations, with reproductive output paralleling the productivity rate. Fecundity of .female..female. approximates a 1:3:2 ratio for 1, 2 and 3 yr old .female..female., respectively. Reproductive output with respect to .female. age is discussed.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1978	59	4					742	750		10.2307/1938778	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1938778													WOS:A1978GB33300016
J	Finkenbinder, MS; Abbott, MB; Steinman, BA				Finkenbinder, Matthew S.; Abbott, Mark B.; Steinman, Byron A.			Holocene climate change in Newfoundland reconstructed using oxygen isotope analysis of lake sediment cores	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Carbonate minerals that precipitate from open-basin lakes can provide archives of past variations in the oxygen isotopic composition of precipitation (delta O-18(ppt)). Holocene delta O-18(ppt) records from the circum- North Atlantic region exhibit large fluctuations during times of rapid ice sheet deglaciation, followed by more stable conditions when interglacial boundary conditions were achieved. However, the timing, magnitude, and climatic controls on century to millennial-scale variations in delta O-18(ppt) in northeastern North America are unclear principally because of a dearth of paleo-proxy data. Here we present a lacustrine sediment oxygen isotope (delta O-18) record spanning 10,200 to 1200 calendar years before present (cal yr BP) from Cheeseman Lake, a small, alkaline, hydrologically open lake basin located in west-central Newfoundland, Canada. Stable isotope data from regional lakes, rivers, and precipitation indicate that Cheeseman Lake water delta O-18 values are consistent with the isotopic composition of inflowing meteoric water. In light of the open-basin hydrology and relatively short water residence time of the lake, we interpret down-core variations in calcite oxygen isotope (delta O-18(cal)) values to primarily reflect changes in delta O-18(ppt) and atmospheric temperature, although other factors such as changes in the seasonality of precipitation may be a minor influence. We conducted a series of climate sensitivity simulations with a lake hydrologic and isotope mass balance model to investigate theoretical lake water delta O-18 responses to climate change. Results from these experiments suggest that Cheeseman Lake delta O-18 values are primarily controlled by temperature and to a much lesser extent, the seasonality of precipitation. Increasing and more positive delta O-18(cal) values between 10,200 and 8000 cal yr BP are interpreted to reflect the waning influence of the Laurentide Ice Sheet on atmospheric circulation, warming temperatures, and rapidly changing surface ocean delta O-18 from the input of glacial meltwater into the western North Atlantic Ocean. The increasing trend is interrupted by abrupt negative delta O-18(cal) anomalies at 9700 cal yr BP, associated with a transition to colder sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the Labrador Sea and renewed Laurentide Ice Sheet retreat, and at 8500 cal yr BP that coincides with a well-established cooling event in the circum-North Atlantic region. After 8000 cal yr BP, delta O-18(cal) values gradually decrease until 4300 cal yr BP, which reflects a cooling trend related to declining Boreal summer insolation and lower sea surface temperatures in the western North Atlantic Ocean. delta O-18(cal) becomes slightly more positive from 4300 to 2500 cal yr BP and thereafter declines to the most negative values of the late Holocene by 1200 cal yr BP. The middle to late-Holocene transition at similar to 4300 cal yr BP corresponds with a shift to wetter conditions in Newfoundland that is also seen in other paleo-proxy records from the region. The discordance between the Cheeseman Lake delta O-18(cal) record and declining insolation could in part reflect warmer temperatures or an increase (decrease) in warm (cold) season precipitation. Considering evidence from other paleo-records in Newfoundland, we suggest this transition resulted from a change in synoptic scale atmospheric circulation to a configuration similar to the positive mean state phase of the Pacific-North American pattern. Proxy evidence from Cheeseman Lake therefore supports the idea that a substantial climatic change occurred during the middle to late-Holocene transition (between similar to 5000 to similar to 4000 cal yr BP) in northeastern North America.

Fluxes out of the sediment were approximately equal to fluxes across the air-sea interface as determined by flux chamber and were of the order of 3 - 6 mg CH4 m-2 d-1. Ebullition, observed during one set of flux chamber experiments, increased air-sea fluxes by several orders of magnitude. Methane oxidation rates within the waters of the basin were measured by using (CH4)-C-14, and a maximum in oxidation rate was observed at the oxic-anoxic interface. Oxidation rates were about a factor of 10 lower than either measured sediment-water or air-sea fluxes. Fluxes across the pycnocline also were lower than sediment-water fluxes and fell at the low end of the range of calculated air-sea fluxes (which were lower than measured air-sea fluxes). Therefore, on the basis of a short term survey, the system appeared to be roughly at steady state. However, in spite of the appearance of steady state, methane profiles measured over a period of several years varied dramatically suggesting that episodic events (ebullition, tidal mixing, upwelling, and intrusion events) must be major factors in the methane budget not obvious from short-term experiments. Episodic events are probably also important for other systems such as productive coastal environments, suboxic estuaries or any other systems in which reduced gases might accumulate within or below a pycnocline. When the pycnocline is tilted or breaks down, substantial amounts of gases may be released to the atmosphere.					; Crill, Patrick/ABC-1357-2021	Crill, Patrick/0000-0003-1110-3059; 													0886-6236					SEP	1993	7	3					491	507		10.1029/93GB00869	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/93GB00869													WOS:A1993LX22200002

The terminus has retreated 3 km during the 20th century and the lower part of the glacier has thinned 200 m or more since 1909. Glacier-wide volume loss between 1948 and 2000 is estimated at 5.5 km(3). Wastage has been the strongest in the glacier's lower reaches, but the glacier has also thinned at higher elevations. The shrinkage of Mendenhall Glacier appears to be due primarily to surface melting and secondarily to lake calving. The change in the average rate of thinning on the lower glacier, <1 m a(-1) between 1948 and 1982 and >2 m a(-1) since 1982, agrees qualitatively with observed warming trends in the region. Mean annual temperatures in Juneau decreased slightly from 1947 to 1976; they then began to increase, leading to an overall warming of similar to 1.6 degreesC since 1943. Lake calving losses have periodically been a small but significant fraction of glacier ablation. The portion of the terminus that ends in the lake is becoming increasingly vulnerable to calving because of a deep pro-glacial take basin. If current climatic trends persist, the glacier will continue to shrink and the terminus will recede onto land at a position about 500 m inland within one to two decades. The glacier and the meltwaters that flow from it are integral components of the Mendenhall Valley hydrologic system. Approximately 13% of the recent average annual discharge of the Mendenhall River is attributable to glacier shrinkage. Glacier melt contributes 50% of the total river discharge in summer.

Here, the mineralogy of the ExoMars landing sites Oxia Planum and Mawrth Vallis is analysed based on multispectral datasets of the CRISM Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars of Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, TES Thermal Emission Spectrometer of Mars Global Surveyor and OMEGA Visible and Infrared Mineralogical Mapping Spectrometer of Mars Express are integrated and interpreted. Primary and secondary minerals of carbonates, oxides, silicates and sulphates mineral groups are characterized, with most minerals produced by aqueous alteration, with 35 mineral species identified, amongst which phyllosilicates are the dominant group. Coexisting mineral types point to distinct hydrothermal and alteration stages. Our investigation supports that water must have been present on early Mars on superficial and endogenous processes, causing direct precipitation and transformations of secondary minerals, with some not usually formed simultaneously. Hence, it is likely that species may have arisen at different times, due to changes of Martian climate. Some minerals may have formed in the subsurface. The Martian palaeoenvironments might include subaerial, underwater, and shallow subsurface hydrothermal systems, cold springs, alkaline lakes, sabkhas, and playas. Our results contribute to our understanding of the planned landing sites to prepare for what the ExoMars rover mission may encounter, highlighting the impact that water may have had on the mineral genesis, alteration processes and their astrobiological potential.																			1026-8774	2007-2902				AUG	2023	40	2					174	186		10.22201/cgeo.20072902e.2023.2.11744	http://dx.doi.org/10.22201/cgeo.20072902e.2023.2.11744													WOS:001047360400006

The study sites were located in fire and summer-drought adapted, xerophytic vegetation with many endemics on acidic, nutrient-poor, sandy soils in south-central peninsular Florida. Sizes of individual stems from 72 sets of nested permanent quadrats were measured in 1969, 1979, and 1989. Patterns of vegetation change differed by community. Flatwood and bayhead quadrats showed rapid increases in densities and basal areas of Persea borbonia (red bay). In the southern ridge sandhill community, evergreen clonal Quercus species (oaks) and Pinus clausa (sand pine) increased in dominance and grasses declined. Oaks (especially Q. geminata) also increased in importance in scrubby flatwoods. Sand pine scrub was relatively stable in composition, but experienced marked structural changes due to substantial sand pine mortality (18 % during 1969-1979, 39 % during 1979-1989). Compositional changes in the absence of fire were greatest whereas structural changes were least in southern ridge sandhill and scrubby flatwoods, both communities which normally receive frequent, recurrent fire. Compositional changes were lowest in sand pine scrub, which is normally infrequently burned. Classic successional patterns such as species replacement, decreases in density, and increases in basal area were generally lacking. Tree densities increased in two of four community types (southern ridge sandhill, scrubby flatwoods); while basal area declined in the flatwoods/bayhead and sand pine scrub sites. Directions of compositional vectors included divergent, opposing, and complex patterns, suggesting vegetation change in the absence of fire has a strong stochastic component.																			1100-9233					APR	1993	4	3					375	386		10.2307/3235596	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3235596													WOS:A1993LB33300010
J	Döpfner, M; Quillfeldt, P; Bauer, HG				Doepfner, Markus; Quillfeldt, Petra; Bauer, Hans-Guenther			Changes in Behavioral Time Allocation of Waterbirds in Wing-Molt at Lake Constance	WATERBIRDS												The reduced mobility of flightless waterbirds during wing-feather molt should influence time allocation during the day, but time-budget studies are lacking in most species. Here, time budget: of flightless and fully-winged individuals at Lake Constance, Central Europe, were compared for five waterbird species with different feeding ecology, and varying sensitivity to disturbances or predation pressure. Significant differences in diurnal activity budgets of flightless and fully-winged birds were observed in all five species. Different behaviors were responsible for the observed differences. Flightless Mute Swans 6 gnus olor spent more time feeding while decreasing locomotory activity. Red-crested Pochard Netta rufina also increased feeding, but, in addition, had increased locomotory activity while resting less. In contrast, flightless individuals of both Gadwall Anas strepera and Tufted Ducks Aythya fuligula spent less time foraging, while there was no such change in Eurasian COOL Fulica atra. More consistent patterns were observed in vigilance behavior, which increased in three of the five species. Comfort activities, Such as preening, increased in two species, and were unchanged in the remaining three. Social interactions, which constituted only a small part of the daily budget, only changed ill Gadwall. The present data suggest that the five waterbird species meet the increased energy demands during molt by either one or a combination of behavioral adaptations, i.e. different strategies, such as higher nutrient intake (e.g. Mute Swan, Red-crested Pochard), lower energy consumption by reducing the locomotory component (e.g. Mute Swan, Tufted Duck) Or a breakdown of energy reserves deposited prior to the molting period resulting ill more time spent resting (e.g. Gadwall). Also, increased resting times during the day may indicate nocturnal feeding, which needs to be examined in more detail. Received 25 September 2008, accepted 3 February 2009.

Legionella bacteria are commonly found in natural aquatic environments such as rivers, lakes, ponds and hot springs. Legionella infection occurs through the inhalation of water-air aerosol generated, for example, by showers or hot tubs. The most common species responsible for infection is Legionella pneumophila, which can cause Pontiac fever, and Legionnaires' disease, as well as a rare extrapulmonary form. The aim of the study's is to assess the susceptibility of Legionella pneumophila bacteria isolated from water systems of public buildings in Poland to antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents used in the treatment of Legionellosis pneumonia. Materials and method. A total of 100 L. pneumophila strains isolated from public buildings, such as hospitals and water recreation facilities, were used for the study. The drug sensitivity of the following antibiotics was determined: erythromycin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, rifampicin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline. Mean MIC50 and MIC90 values were read using accepted standards. Results. The highest mean MIC value was obtained for tetracycline 6,130+/-0,353 mu g/ml (with a range from 1,500 mu g/ml to 16,000 mu g/ml. In contrast, the lowest MIC was recorded with rifampicin: 0.020+/-0.037 mu g/ml (with a range from 0.016 mu g/ml to 0.380 mu g/ml). Conclusions. The lowest biocidal concentration was found for levofloxacin, the highest for tetracycline. The highest MIC50 and MIC90 values were found for tetracycline and the lowest for rifampicin. The highest biocidal values were found for azithromycin and the lowest for tetracycline.

Our study is based on two sediment cores: (i) from the San River (Stubno-Naklo site in south-eastern Poland; S-N) and (ii) from the Dniester River (Luka site in western Ukraine) valleys. Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) C-14 dating was performed on terrestrial plant macrofossils from each site to produce Bayesian age depth models and to calculate sedimentation rates (SRs). The SR in both sites was characterised by high variability reflecting the developmental stage of oxbow lake. The highest SR values (1.18-1.23 cm yr(-1)) were identified at the S-N site at the beginning of the Holocene (ca. 11,550-11,470 cal. BP) and related to enhanced overbank deposition. The lowest SR values (0.01-0.02 cm yr(-1)) were identified in the transitional layer between the Younger Dryas and the Preboreal chronozone (ca. 11,810-11,160 cal. BP) in the Luka profile; this may have been related to the sedimentary gap(s) caused by falls in the water table and/or temporary desiccation of the water body. Moreover, our study revealed the presence of three distinctly aged AMS C-14 dates in the Younger Dryas section of the Luka profile. These radiocarbon inversions were completely undetected by pollen analysis, which indicated the domination of Pinus and Betula without any significant fluctuations throughout the entire subsection. The presence of such 'cryptic' insertions of older material could lead to erroneous palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. Similarly the S-N site revealed anomalously 'aged' dates which were also difficult to detect by pollen analysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here we describe the diet and feeding selectivity of two flamingo species, the Andean Flamingo Phoenicoparrus andinus and Chilean Flamingo Phoenicopterus chilensis, which coexist in a lowland area of Argentina. Environmental characteristics and available food resources were assessed at twelve lakes where feeding flocks of both species of flamingos occurred. Food items found in faeces (16S rRNA for bacteria and archaea) and microscopic analyses (for Cyanobacteria, microalgae and microinvertebrates) were analysed, and the birds' feeding selectivity and niche overlap were estimated. Results showed that the lakes were of eutrophic to hypereutrophic status, and with hypohaline to mesohaline salinity levels. Predominant microorganisms belonged to the Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia, Chloroflexi, Euryarchaeota, Cyanobacteria, Bacillariophyta and Copepoda phyla. Euryarchaeota and Firmicutes were the main phyla found in the faeces, with Chloroflexi and Planctomycetes also present in smaller quantities. Proteobacteria were well represented in Andean Flamingo faeces, but Verrucomicrobia were scarce in both species. Cyanobacteria, Bacillariophyta, Diet and feeding selectivity of Chilean and Andean Flamingos Copepoda, Cladocera, and Rotifera were abundant in Chilean Flamingo faeces, and larger organisms belonging to Ostracoda, Nematoda, and Diptera were also found. The most consumed taxa were in the intermediate to large size range (10(4) to 2x10(5) mu m(3), and 10(8) to 2x10(8) mu m(3)). Andean Flamingo faeces were composed mainly of microalgae, especially diatoms. Cladocera and Copepoda species were found to a lesser extent, showing the flamingos' preference for intermediate prey sizes (10(4) to 2x10(5) mu m(3)). Food selection was probably dependent on the spatial variability in prey availability, as both positive selectivity (for Bacillariophyceae) and avoidance (for Copepoda) were observed in Chilean Flamingos. In contrast, Andean Flamingos showed a high positive selection for diatoms, and strong negative selection for microinvertebrates. Both flamingo species can apparently coexist whilst feeding on a wide spectrum of microorganisms, but trophic niches differed in the amounts of Cyanobacteria, microalgae and microinvertebrates taken. Such a low niche overlap probably contributes to the coexistence of both sympatric species in similar waters.

Climate-mediated changes in small lakes inferred from midge assemblages: the influence of thermal regime and lake depth	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Subfossil midge (Chironomidae and Chaoboridae) assemblages were examined in the surficial sediments (0-1 cm) from small inland lakes in the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) of northwestern Ontario, Canada. In these boreal lakes, maximum depth (Z(max)), alkalinity, Secchi depth and chlorophyll-a concentrations explained significant amounts of variation in the subfossil assemblages. Constrained ordinations (redundancy analysis) indicated that the relationship between Z(max) (as sqrt Z(max)) and assemblage composition was strong enough to develop a paleolimnological inference model. Model statistics suggested that a robust model was generated (r (2) = 0.78, RMSEP = 0.533, max bias = 0.674); however, when the model was applied to a subfossil stratigraphy from an ELA lake sediment core, results suggested that the inference model had produced an unrealistically shallow Z(max) inference. Further analyses indicated that thermal regime had a strong influence on assemblage composition; when the influence of thermal regime was partialled out, there was a much weaker relationship between Z(max) and assemblage composition, particularly for stratified lakes. A thermal regime inference model was subsequently developed, which, when applied to the lake sediment core stratigraphy, indicated that the shallow Z(max) inference may have been the result of a period of increased mixing or polymixis in this stratified lake. Water column mixing may increase due to hypolimnetic warming and increased water clarity resulting from declines in dissolved organic carbon. In a training set where there are strong correlations between lake depth and assemblage composition, this relationship is not necessarily a strict function of lake depth, but of some other highly correlated variable, likely thermal conditions.

Marine Distribution, Life History Traits, and the Accumulation of Polychlorinated Biphenyls in Chinook Salmon from Puget Sound, Washington	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) levels and the factors affecting PCB accumulation in subadult and maturing Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha from Puget Sound were characterized. Specifically, we (1) determined PCB levels in Chinook salmon from Puget Sound and compared them with levels in Chinook salmon front other West Coast populations, (2) determined whether PCB accumulation mainly occurred in the freshwater or marine habitats, and (3) quantified the relative importance of fish age, fish size (fork length), lipid content. and saltwater age (the number of winters spent in saltwater) on PCB concentration. The average PCB concentration measured in skinless muscle tissue samples of subadult and maturing Chinook salmon collected from Puget Sound was 53 ng/g (wet weight), which was 3-5 times higher than those measured in six other populations of Chinook salmon on the West Coast of North America. Concentrations in the Puget Sound samples varied from 10 to 220 ng/g. A comparison of PCB body burdens between subyearling smolts and returning adults revealed that almost all of the PCBs (>96%) were accumulated in the marine habitats. Surprisingly. although PCBs were mostly accumulated in marine habitats. PCB exposure was lowest in the largest fish that spent the most little in saltwater. Collectively, saltwater age. fish size, and lipids only accounted for 37% of the observed variation in PCB concentration, indicating that some other attribute of the fish's marine ecology accounted for the variation in PCB levels among Puget Sound Chinook salmon and for their elevated PCB levels relative to other West Coast populations. We hypothesized that residency in the contaminated Puget Sound environment was a major factor contributing to the higher and more variable PCB concentrations in these fish. This hypothesis was supported with an independent data set from a fishery assessment model, which estimated that 29% of subyearling Chinook-salmon and 45% of yearling out-migrants from Puget Sound displayed resident behavior.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				MAY	2009	138	3					616	632		10.1577/T08-003.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T08-003.1													WOS:000268501100014
J	Csato, I; Kendall, CGS				Csato, I; Kendall, CGS			Modeling of stratigraphic architectural patterns in extensional settings - towards a conceptual model	COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES												Our earlier studies on active continental extensional basins revealed that high-frequency changes in sea/lake-level, spatially heterogeneous subsidence/uptift and multiple sources of sediment supply with varying rates and directions are the main Factors that influence the formation of stratigraphic architectural patterns. Thus, the evolving stratal geometry results from the sea/lake-level-[time], subsidence-[time, space] and sediment supply-[time, space, direction, composition] functions. The stratigraphic simulation results presented here demonstrate that Type I and 2 unconformities and conformities may develop in segments of an extensional basin during a sea/lake-level fall depending on the local subsidence rates. These different surfaces can be time-equivalent along the basin margin. A sea/lake-level rise can either form a highstand systems tract (HST) or a transgressive and an overlying highstand systems tract (HST), depending on the sediment supply. A decrease and a subsequent increase in sediment supply during a stable base level stand can produce the same architectural patterns (backstepping of transgressive systems tract (TST) and aggradational or progradational patterns of HST) as a rise in the base level at constant sediment supply. Stratigraphic architectures built from multiple sediment sources show a variety of patterns as responses to spatial and temporal changes in intensities of individual sediment supply sources.

J	Liu, JT; Fang, SW				Liu, Jutao; Fang, Shaowen			Comprehensive evaluation of the potential risk from cyanobacteria blooms in Poyang Lake based on nutrient zoning	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The potential risk from cyanobacteria blooms is the basis for predicting, preventing, and managing eutrophication. Poyang Lake lies on the southern bank of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. This lake is a large shallow lake connected to the Yangtze River and is affected by monsoon. The comprehensive evaluation index system, evaluation model, and method of the potential risk from cyanobacteria blooms were constructed based on the nutrient zoning in Poyang Lake, and the potential risk from cyanobacteria blooms was evaluated in 2013. (1) The evaluation index system comprises physical, chemical, and biological indicators. The physical indicators consist of blocking degree, lake region location, transparency (Secchi disk depth, SD), and temperature; the chemical indicators consist of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP); and the biological indicators consist of chlorophyll a (Chla) and phytoplankton biomass. Among the indicators, blocking degree and lake region location along with the prevailing wind direction were selected to represent the indicators affected by water retention time and wind direction. (2) We established a comprehensive evaluation method for assessing the potential risk from cyanobacteria blooms by adopting both analytic hierarchy process weighting and a comprehensive evaluation method. (3) Results show that the high-risk periods for cyanobacteria blooms were August, July, and December, and the high-risk regions were in the Northeastern Lake Region, Western Lake Region and Northern Lake Region. The Northeastern Lake Region is particularly in high risk in August and July. These cyanobacteria blooms presented heavy risk or close to heavy risk. Based on the risk evaluation indicators, outbreaks of cyanobacteria blooms are limited by temperature and location. Chla and phytoplankton biomass were the key indices affecting the level of potential risk from cyanobacteria blooms during the high-water-level period (July and August). In contrast, TN and TP are the key indices affecting the level of harm during the low-water-level period. Within a year, Chla, phytoplankton biomass, and TP are key indicators for the prediction of cyanobacteria blooms in Poyang Lake.																			1866-6280	1866-6299				MAY	2017	76	9							342	10.1007/s12665-017-6678-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-017-6678-6													WOS:000401323600014
J	RIDING, R				RIDING, R			ORIGIN AND DIAGENESIS OF LACUSTRINE ALGAL BIOHERMS AT THE MARGIN OF THE RIES CRATER, UPPER MIOCENE, SOUTHERN GERMANY	SEDIMENTOLOGY												The marginal carbonate facies of the Miocene Ries meteorite crater lake in southern Germany contain bioherms up to 7 m high and 15 m across built by the green alga Cladophorites. The algae were externally encrusted during life by micrite, probably precipitated in response to photosynthetic uptake of CO2, which produced tufts of fine (100 .mu.m diameter), calcareous tubes. Coalescence of tufts, together with incorporation of peloidal and skeletal sand, created nodules and cones of algal tufa which in turn formed larger masses some of which are in the form of compound cones up to 2 m high. The bioherms are constructed by beds and groups of these cones and masses, and are surrounded by poorly cemented peloid, ostracod and gastropod sands. Five depositional and diagenetic stages of development can be distinguished: (1) growth and calcification (probably calcitic) of Cladophorites in shallow fresh-or slightly brackish water; (2) emergence due to a temporary fall in lake level and veneering of the algal tufa and adjacent sediments by laminated sinter; (3) resubmergence and deposition of peloidal and skeletal sands; (4) burial and partial phreatic dolomitization, together with dissolution of aragonite and penecontemporaneous deposition of thin isopachous rims of dolomite rhombs; (5) local vadose cementation by rhombs, spar and spikes of low-magnesian calcite. States 1-3 probably occurred several times. Most of the biohermal and surrounding sediments were produced by biological processes in the lake; subaerial sinter deposition and meteoric cementation have contributed relatively minor amounts of material and the majority of the sediments retain porosities of 10-30%.																			0037-0746	1365-3091					1979	26	5					645	680		10.1111/j.1365-3091.1979.tb00936.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3091.1979.tb00936.x													WOS:A1979HP73100002
J	Bianchi, TS; Argyrou, ME				Bianchi, TS; Argyrou, ME			Temporal and spatial dynamics of particulate organic carbon in the Lake Pontchartrain estuary, southeast Louisiana, USA	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The spatial and temporal distribution of particulate organic carbon (FOG) was examined in the Lake Pontchartrain estuary, along with changes in freshwater and nutrient inputs. Increased turbidity due to increases in suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations during high freshwater discharge resulted in low inputs from autochthonous POC. For example, annual averages of chlorophyll a (2.3 +/- 0.9 mu g l(-1)) and POC (0.9 +/- 0.6 mg l(-1)) were found to be considerably lower than in other shallow turbid systems. A low NIP ratio was maintained throughout the study (from 2.3 to 8.3), primarily due to low inputs of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN). Thus, phytoplankton communities in the Lake Pontchartrain estuary were primarily limited by light and nitrogen. Stations in the upper estuary were generally more light-limited as opposed to nitrogen-limited stations in the lower estuary. Based on chlorophyll a/carotenoid ratios, the most dominant phytoplankton classes were cyanobacteria, cryptophytes, chrysophytes and chlorophytes-with episodic cyanobacterial blooms occurring in the summer months. High carbon/chlorophyll it ratios suggested that much of the POC contained low concentrations of chlorophyll a that had degraded during its transport from adjacent wetlands. High C/N ratios (7.4 to 30.6) further suggested that allochtonous inputs of organic carbon from terrigenous sources were likely to be important. Lignin-phenol concentrations in sediments from the upper region of the estuary indicated chat the Lake Pontchartrain estuary had received higher inputs of terrigenous organic carbon compared to other estuaries in the Gulf region.

Late Quaternary human occupation of the Kilwa coast (Tanzania): OSL ages and paleoenvironmental proxies from isotope geochemistry	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS												We report new geochronologic and paleoenvironmental data for Mnaraeka 01, a prehistoric site located in the Kilwa district of coastal Tanzania. The oldest trace of human activity at the site comes from a context dated to 71 f 6 thousand years ago (ka) where flaked stones but techno-typologically non-diagnostic were uncovered. Stratigraphic units dated to 43.9 f 2.4 ka and 41.8 f 2.1 ka have revealed stone artifacts broadly characteristic of the Middle Stone Age (MSA) while a context dated to 10.0 f 0.6 ka has produced artifacts referrable to the Later Stone Age (LSA). Eight soil samples from the site subject to stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses reflect grassy-woodland habitat during the settlement episodes with delta 13C values ranging from-19.3%o to-27.8%o (vs. VPDB). The results demonstrate the persistence of coastal woodland vegetation and human foraging populations in coastal East Africa during the onset of the cold Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 4, between the cold spells of Heinrich Events 4 and 5, and during the Holocene Climatic Optimum. Our study shows that the Stone Age archaeology of coastal Tanzania has the potential to shed light on the role of coastal ecozones as potential refugia for human populations during variable climate conditions of the late Quaternary. Furthermore, the emergent datasets from Mnaraeka 01 open a window into the deep human history preserved in the Kilwa basin.

J	Lafffaille, P; Brosse, S; Gabas, S; Lek, S				Lafffaille, P; Brosse, S; Gabas, S; Lek, S			Fish spatial distribution in the littoral zone of Lake Pareloup (France) during summer	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												We studied the spatial distribution of I I fish species in the littoral zone of Lake Pareloup (South-West of France) using a non-destructive Point Abundance Sampling by Scuba diving. The fish spatial assemblage was investigated with seven commonly used environmental variables (topographical, biological and substratum variables). Three fish groups colonising three different habitats were identified. The spatial distribution of each fish species was mainly influenced by two environmental factors: distance from the bank (highly correlated with depth) and vegetation cover. i) Young-of-the-year (YOY) cyprinids and northern pike were mainly associated with a small distance from the bank (less than 6 m). ii) Older cyprinids and perch (greater than or equal to1+) were located between 6 and 12 m from the bank. iii) YOY perch and older northern pike (greater than or equal to1+), occurred independently of the distance from the bank, but exhibited different responses to the percentage of vegetation cover: pike preferred areas with dense vegetation cover, while YOY perch abundance decreased rapidly with increasing vegetation cover. Thus, YOY fishes were common and abundant in shallow water, whereas large predators such as northern pike were found in vegetated areas. Therefore, vegetation cover, although generally considered as a crucial 0+ fish habitat, was here a secondary variable after distance from the bank. We hypothesised that the high density of predators (and especially northern pike) inside the vegetation as well as their high predation efficiency in this area could explain such a spatial distribution, shallow littoral areas being, in that case, safer from predation than vegetated ones for YOY fishes.					; Brosse, Sebastien/AAC-4689-2019	Brosse, Sebastien/0000-0002-3659-8177; 													0003-9136					DEC	2001	153	1					129	144																WOS:000173368100007
J	Old, GH; Lawler, DM; Snorrason, A				Old, GH; Lawler, DM; Snorrason, A			Discharge and suspended sediment dynamics during two jokulhlaups in the Skafta river, Iceland	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												This paper investigates the dynamics and significance of discharge and suspended sediment transport (SST) during two jokulhlaups (glacier outburst floods) in the Skafta River, south Iceland. Jokulhlaups occur frequently in many glacial environments and are highly significant in the gemorphological evolution of river basins and coastal environments. However, direct high-resolution monitoring of jokulhlaups has rarely been accomplished and hardly ever at more than one station in a downstream sequence. Here we present detailed data on jokulhlaup discharge and water quality from an intensive monitoring and sampling programme at two sites in summer 1997 when two jokulhlaups occurred. Evidence is discussed that supports the origin of both jokulhlaups being subglacial reservoirs, produced over several months by subglacial geothermal activity. At the downstream site, Asa-Eldvatn, the larger jokulhlaup (1) had a peak discharge of 572 m(3) s(-1) and a peak suspended sediment flux of 4650 kg s(-1)(channel-edge value) or 4530 kg s(-1) (cross-sectional). These values compare to the non-jokulhlaup flow of 120 m(3) s(-1) and suspended sediment flux of 190 kg s(-1)(channel-edge) or 301 kg s(-1) (cross-sectional). Significantly, the jokulhlaups transported 18(.)8 per cent of the annual runoff and 53 per cent of the annual suspended sediment transport in 6(.)6 per cent of the year. Furthermore, water chemistry, suspended sediment and seismic data suggest that volcanic activity and geothermal boiling (possibly including steam explosions) may have occurred during Jokulhlaup 1. The research illustrates the value of integrating high-resolution, multi-point field monitoring of meteorological, hydrological, hydrochemical, geomorphological and seismological data for understanding the dynamics, significance and downstream translation of jokulhlaups.

J	THERIAULT, RJ; ROSS, GM				THERIAULT, RJ; ROSS, GM			ND ISOTOPIC EVIDENCE FOR CRUSTAL RECYCLING IN THE CA 2.0 GA SUBSURFACE OF WESTERN CANADA	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Sm-Nd isotopic data are presented for 23 drill-core samples from five aeromagnetically and geochronologically (U-Pb zircon) distinct domains of the Precambrian basement of northern Alberta. The domains in question are the Taltson (1.96-1.94 Ga), Buffalo Head (2.32-1.99 Ga), Chinchaga (2.19-2.09 Ga), Ksituan (1.99-1.90 Ga), and Nova (2.81 Ga). These domains are truncated to the north and south by the Great Slave Lake shear zone and the Snowbird tectonic zone, respectively. Initial epsilon-Nd values are -5.0 to -9.7 for the Taltson, +0.2 to -6.3 for the Buffalo Head, +0.6 to -1.8 for the Chinchaga, -1.8 to -2.1 for the Ksituan and +5.6 for the Nova. Crustal residence model ages fall in the 2.5-2.8 Ga range. The Nd isotopic signatures may be viewed in terms of mixing a minimum of 10% Archean continental crust with a depleted-mantle component. Speculations on the tectonic history of the basement domains in question involve the assembly of Archean crustal nuclei to form the Buffalo Head - Chinchaga composite domain. Arc magmatism resulting from plate subduction to the east and west of the Buffalo Head - Chinchaga composite domain would have generated the Taltson and Ksituan domains. The Nd isotopic data suggest that the basement of northern Alberta consists of crust of late Archean crustal residence age which has been extensively remobilized in the Early Proterozoic.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				AUG	1991	28	8					1140	1147		10.1139/e91-104	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/e91-104													WOS:A1991GK39100002

(2017). Cases in which the concentration of BC exceeded the 85th percentile were selected to evaluate composite synoptic situations, resulting in a total of fifteen cases analyzed. These fifteen cases occurred during one of the three prevalent synoptic situations identified and labeled as: i) Coastal low, characterized by weak easterly winds and low planetary boundary layer (PBL) height due to an enhancement of the temperature inversion before the arrival of the coastal low; ii) Pre-frontal, also characterized by low PBL height, with a cold front approaching from the South and the coastal low retreating northwards, also associated with pollution episodes in Santiago (Rutllant and Garreaud, 1995); and iii) SEP anticyclone characterized by large stability, very low gradient in the mean sea level pressure and weak westerly-southwesterly wind due to the dominance of the southeast Pacific anticyclone. Coastal low cases were observed not only during winter but also in all four months of the VAMPIRE field campaign, while Pre-frontal cases were observed only at the end of July and August 2014. All three synoptic situations are consistent with a reduced synoptic forcing, in which the mesoscale sea-land breeze predominates and advects large pollutant concentrations from local/regional emission sources to the research site. Detailed analysis is presented here for two case studies: one Coastal low and one Pre-frontal, combining the observations of pollutants as well as mesoscale modeling with the WRF model to estimate back-trajectories and evaluate the relative role of the synoptic and mesoscale forcing on the pollution episodes in Valparaiso. These synoptic conditions and their interplay with meso-scale circulations identified during VAMPIRE provide evidence and insight that will aid in future air quality forecasts for Valparaiso.

Based on amphibian surveys conducted in ponds and lakes in the northeast quadrant of MORA during the summers of 1993-1995, 20 sites were resampled in 1996 to document and evaluate distributions of the two species relative to site habitat characteristics. Distributions of larvae were assessed either by nearshore snorkel or visual encounter surveys of each study site. Twelve environmental variables representing pond and lake physical characteristics, water quality, and nutrient concentrations were measured. The occurrences at each site of three major habitat components (i.e., pond bottom firmness, coarse woody debris, and emergent/aquatic vegetation) were qualitatively estimated. Allotopic distributions of larval populations of both species were related to site elevation, maximum depth, organic content of bottom substrates, and surface area. Ambystoma gracile sites were larger, deeper, lower in elevation, had flocculent sediment higher in organic content, abundant coarse woody debris, and limited emergent/aquatic vegetation relative to A. macrodactylum sites. Ambystoma macrodactylum sites were smaller, shallower, higher in elevation, had firm sediments low in organic content, and had a greater occurrence of emergent/aquatic vegetation than did A. gracile sites. Two sites supported syntopic populations and exhibited many of the habitat characteristics observed at sites inhabited by each species. The distribution of each species in MORA was related to the interconnection between habitat characteristics of ponds and lakes and species life-history patterns and possibly interspecific interactions.																			0022-1511					MAR	2003	37	1					24	34		10.1670/0022-1511(2003)037[0024:HSOAGA]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1670/0022-1511(2003)037[0024:HSOAGA]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000185910400004

The central metamorphic belt in central Qiangtang divides it into South Qiangtang basin and North Qiangtang basin. This study conducted a series of teleseismic receiver functions across the Qiangtang basin. The teleseismic data came from a temporary seismic array in Qiangtang basin. High-quality receiver functions were picked up from 738 teleseismic traces of 338 teleseismic events recorded by 27 stations along 88. 5 degrees E in 2009-2010. 1-D S-wave velocity model was calculated by the nonlinear inversion of conjugate gradients algorithm for the complex spectrum ratios of receiver function. Because the method made full use of amplitude ratio between the vertical and radial components of the receiver function in time domain, the final model from the method is completely independent of the initial model parameters. The velocity model indicated that the Moho beneath Qiangtang area rises slowly from south to north. The South Qiangtang basin has an average Moho depth of 68 km. In the North Qiangtang basin the average Moho depth is 60 km, which are in accordance with H-kappa stack and deep seismic reflection results. There is a continuous low velocity layer beneath the North Qiangtang basin. While in the South Qiangtang basin the low velocity area is discontinuous, which causes hot springs along thrust faults. The sedimentary thickness was determined by deep seismic reflection and Poisson's ratio. There is one large sedimentary basin in the South Qiangtang basin and two in the North. Geological survey suggested that the two depressions in North Qiangtang, Longwei Co and Baitan Lake, have pretty good outlook in petroleum exploration.																			0001-5733					MAR	2017	60	3					941	952		10.6038/cjg20170309	http://dx.doi.org/10.6038/cjg20170309													WOS:000396386700009

Stock size criteria were developed from areas of the Great Lakes where natural reproduction has been successful (defined as detection of age-1 or older recruits by assessment fishing). We contrasted them with stocks in areas with no natural reproduction. Based on the relative abundance of spawners measured in the fall and the presence or absence of natural reproduction in 24 areas of the Great Lakes, we found three distinct sets of lake trout populations. In seven areas of successful natural reproduction, the catch-per-unit-effort (CPE) of spawners ranged from 17 to 135 fish/305 m of gillnet. Stock sizes in these areas were used as a gauge against which stocks in other areas were contrasted. We conclude that stock densities of 17-135 fish/305 m of gill net are adequate for natural reproduction, provided that all other requirements are met. No natural reproduction has been detected in seven other areas, where CPEs of spawners ranged from only 3 to 5 fish/305 m. We conclude that spawning stocks of only 3-5 fish/305 m of net are inadequate to develop measurable natural reproduction. Natural reproduction has also not been detected in ten areas where CPEs of spawners ranged from 43 to 195 fish/305 m of net. We conclude that spawning stocks in these ten areas were adequate to sustain natural reproduction, but that some factor other than parental stock size prevented recruitment of wild lake trout.					anderson, david/E-6416-2011	Hansen, Michael/0000-0001-8522-3876													0380-1330						1995	21			1			498	504		10.1016/S0380-1330(95)71121-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(95)71121-2													WOS:A1995UL89400044

The brown trout (Salmo trutta) in the lake, vre Heimdalsvatn: long-term changes in population dynamics due to exploitation and the invasive species, European minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Studies of the brown trout (Salmo trutta) population in the Norwegian subalpine lake, vre Heimdalsvatn, over a 50-year period have revealed major changes in population dynamics. In 1958, the population density was high, with individuals stagnating in growth at lengths below 30 cm. After heavy exploitation during the years 1958-1969, the number of older fish declined substantially, and growth rates increased significantly. Since 1969, the European minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus) have been observed in the lake, with increasing densities from 1977-1978 to 1999-2000. The age structure of the brown trout population has changed markedly from the 1960s to the period 1993-2006. Annual recruitment significantly declined, from an average number of 3746 individuals in age-class 4 during the period 1958-1966 to an average of 1668 during the period 1993-2006. However, due to lower exploitation rates, the number of old fish was significantly higher in the latter period. The summer diet of brown trout has changed substantially from a dominance of the large crustaceans Lepidurus arcticus and Gammarus lacustris to a high occurrence of European minnows, while L. arcticus has become practically absent from the diet. There was a negative relationship between brown trout biomass and annual length increment. However, despite a brown trout biomass at the same level during the years 1993-2006 as in the 1960s, annual individual growth rates have significantly declined. The reduced recruitment and reduced annual growth rates of the brown trout, as well as changes in the diet, are most likely related to the introduction and establishment of the invasive species, the European minnow.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR	2010	642	1					81	91		10.1007/s10750-010-0161-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0161-7													WOS:000275782400008

However, the mechanisms underlying tufa precipitation at a closed salt lake in the arid Badain Jaran Desert (BJD) remain unclear. This study focuses on Lake Cherigele (CRG) as a case study and elucidates the key hydrogeochemical processes involved in tufa deposition along the lakeshores through hydrogeochemical experiments and simulations. The results indicate that (1) tufa was deposited during the middle to Late-Holocene, with U/Th ages ranging from 4216 to 594 a BP. (2) The tufa is primarily composed of calcite and aragonite crystals. (3) The precipitation mechanisms of tufa in the salt lake involve a combination of mixing between lake water and groundwater, spring degassing, and evaporation. (4) The mixing of calcareous groundwater with alkaline lake water is the predominant process for tufa precipitation; when the proportion of lake water reaches approximately 7.5%, the precipitation rate attains its maximum. In the arid climate of the Late-Holocene, the cumulative effects of these hydrogeochemical processes facilitate the continuous deposition of tufa. Our research provides hydrogeochemical evidence for tufa deposition in desert salt lakes, which can inform studies on the interactions between desert groundwater and lakes, as well as the evolution of lakes in the BJD.																			0959-6836	1477-0911				OCT	2025	35	10					1047	1056		10.1177/09596836251350239	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836251350239		JUL 2025											WOS:001521182800001
J	STELZER, RS; BURTON, TM				STELZER, RS; BURTON, TM			GROWTH AND ABUNDANCE OF THE CRAYFISH ORCONECTES-PROPINOUUS IN A HARD WATER AND A SOFT-WATER STREAM	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Two populations of O. propinquus were studied from the hard water Ford River and soft water Baraga Creek in northern Michigan. The streams were physically and chemically similar, except for water hardness, alkalinity, conductivity and pH. Each population was sampled regularly by kick-seining into block nets. Mean abundance of young-of-the-year and year one size classes was higher in the hard water stream than in the soft water stream in 1989 (10.7 young-of-the-year/m2 vs. 1.2/m2, 9.2 year one individuals/m2 vs. 3.0/m2). Total annual net production of O. propinquus was higher in the hard water stream (5.0 g/m2 vs. 3.0 g/m2). Individual growth of both young-of-the-year and year one size classes was greater in the soft water stream. Thus, there was an inverse relationship between individual growth and crayfish density in the two streams. There was considerable year-to-year variation in mean abundance and growth (inferred from mean size) in the Ford River (10.1 year one individuals/m2 and 0.729 g dry weight/individual in 1989 vs 5.6/m2 and 0.472 g dry weight/individual in 1990). A rapid, steady decline in abundance of the Ford River year one population occurred during the summer of 1989. Water hardness may be affecting the abundance and growth of O. propinquus in the two streams, both directly and indirectly, but our results do not allow us to establish causality.																			0270-5060					DEC	1993	8	4					329	340		10.1080/02705060.1993.9664872	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1993.9664872													WOS:A1993MN45900007
J	Moorhead, DL; Wolf, CF; Wharton, RA				Moorhead, DL; Wolf, CF; Wharton, RA			Impact of light regimes on productivity patterns of benthic microbial mats in an Antarctic lake: A modeling study	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Filamentous cyanobacteria often dominate benthic microbial communities of antarctic lakes and usually exhibit saturation of photosynthesis at light intensities similar to 100 mu Einst m(-2) s(-1). Incident light regimes an controlled by ice and snow accumulations overlaying water columns during much of the year. Thus, Light availability to microbial mats is often below saturation intensity and is strongly influenced by modest changes in climatic factors. A model of net primary production for benthic mat communities of the subantarctic Sombre Lake, Signy Island, was developed (1) to evaluate depth-specific productivities of mat communities, (2) to test the relative importances of model parameters to mat production, and (3) to explore the potential impacts of climate change on mat production as manifested through changes in light regime. Simulated rates of net primary production corresponded to observations on a daily basis (similar to 1-4 mu g C fixed mg(-1) ash-free DW of mat d(-1)) but were an order of magnitude lower than estimates of net annual production based on field measurements (less than or equal to vs. 11-45 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively). Close examination suggested that the simulated values were mon plausible. A detailed sensitivity analysis of model behavior revealed that variations in the time of ice and snow melt in spring accounted for 40-60% of the total variation in model behavior, emphasizing the importance of climatic factors to net primary production of mat communities and the sensitivity of mat production to climate change.																			0024-3590					NOV	1997	42	7					1561	1569		10.4319/lo.1997.42.7.1561	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1997.42.7.1561								11541255					WOS:000072822100008

Severe Global Cooling After Volcanic Super-Eruptions? The Answer Hinges on Unknown Aerosol Size	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Volcanic super-eruptions have been theorized to cause severe global cooling, with the 74 kya Toba eruption purported to have driven humanity to near-extinction. However, this eruption left little physical evidence of its severity and models diverge greatly on the magnitude of post-eruption cooling. A key factor controlling the super-eruption climate response is the size of volcanic sulfate aerosol, a quantity that left no physical record and is poorly constrained by models. Here we show that this knowledge gap severely limits confidence in model-based estimates of super-volcanic cooling, and accounts for much of the disagreement among prior studies. By simulating super-eruptions over a range of aerosol sizes, we obtain global mean responses varying from extreme cooling all the way to the previously unexplored scenario of widespread warming. We also use an interactive aerosol model to evaluate the scaling between injected sulfur mass and aerosol size. Combining our model results with the available paleoclimate constraints applicable to large eruptions, we estimate that global volcanic cooling is unlikely to exceed 1.5 degrees C no matter how massive the stratospheric injection. Super-eruptions, we conclude, may be incapable of altering global temperatures substantially more than the largest Common Era eruptions. This lack of exceptional cooling could explain why no single super-eruption event has resulted in firm evidence of widespread catastrophe for humans or ecosystems. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Whether volcanic super-eruptions pose a threat to humanity remains a subject of debate, with climate models disagreeing on the magnitude of global post-eruption cooling. We demonstrate that this disagreement primarily stems from a lack of constraint on the size of volcanic sulfate aerosol particles. By evaluating the range of aerosol size scenarios, we demonstrate that eruptions may be incapable of causing more than 1.5 degrees C cooling no matter how much sulfur they inject into the stratosphere. This could explain why archaeological records provide no evidence of increased human mortality following the Toba super-eruption. Further, we raise the unexplored possibility that the largest super-eruptions could cause global-scale warming.

Browning-Related Decreases in Water Transparency Lead to Long-Term Increases in Surface Water Temperature and Thermal Stratification in Two Small Lakes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Surface water temperatures are warming in many lakes across the globe, and this is widely attributed to warming air temperatures. Yet two lakes in Pennsylvania (USA) have shown long-term increases in surface water temperatures over the past 27 summers during a period with no significant increase in regional air temperature. We examined the relationship between long-term trends in seven metrics of whole-lake thermal structure in two lakes and several potential driver variables. Driver variables included water transparency, lake pH, and meteorological variables. Both lakes exhibited significant surface warming and hypolimnetic cooling, resulting in stronger thermal stratification that further reduced mixing and heat transfer to deep waters. During this time period, there were no long-term trends in solar radiation or in thawing degree days, but annual precipitation and lake pH increased. Water transparency greatly decreased due to increased dissolved organic matter quantity and color, most likely due to increased precipitation and recovery from anthropogenic acidification. In both lakes, the changes in lake thermal structure and heat distribution were strongly related to the decreases in water transparency and increases in dissolved organic matter. This transparency-mediated mechanism may augment the effects of air temperature-driven lake warming in other regions where decreasing transparency is also prevalent, further enhancing increases in surface water temperature and thermal stratification. These results have important ecological and biogeochemical implications, highlighting the need for investigations of multiple drivers to fully understand how lakes will respond to future climate change. Plain Language Summary Lakes provide key services to society ranging from drinking water and food to recreation and increased property value. But lakes are vulnerable to many environmental threats, including climate change. Two study lakes in Pennsylvania have experienced decreases in water clarity as the water has become more brown over the past three decades. As a result, sunlight and heat are more completely absorbed near the surface of the lake, with less light and heat reaching deeper waters. This leads to warmer surface waters and cooler deep waters. We attribute the reduced water clarity and changes in lake temperature to recovery from acid rain following the Clean Air Act amendments in the 1990s, combined with climate change-induced increases in precipitation and storm events in the northeastern United States that increase runoff of organic matter into lakes. These changes are influencing other aspects of the lake ecosystem by accelerating oxygen depletion and altering the abundance of and habitat availability for algae, zooplankton, and fish.

We conducted these studies to obtain information to manage the species in light of threats posed by timber harvest, hydropower development, and a proposed coal mine. we estimated that about half of the adult bull trout in Flathead and Lake embarked on a spawning migration from May through July, swimming 88-250 km to reach tributaries of the North and Middle Forks of the flathead River. Bull trout entered the tributaries when water temperatures dropped below 12.degree.C, and spawned from late August through early October after water temperatures were below 9.degree.C. They spawned in areas of tributaries with low gradient, loosely compacted gravel, groundwater influence, and cover. After spawning, females left the tributaries and returned to the lake sooner than males. Most spawners were six or seven years old and they averaged 628 mm in length. Juveniles were found close to the substrate in streams with summer maximum temperatures less than 15.degree.C. Juveniles migrated out of the tributaries to the river system from June through August, at age I (18%), II (49%), III (32%), and IV (1%). Population status was monitored through redd counts and estimates of juvenile abundance in natal tributaries. The population may be limited by quantity and quality of rearing and spawning habitat, and spawning escapement. Specific requirements for spawning and rearing habitat, and general sensitivity of each life stage, make the bull trout an excellent indicator of environmental disturbance.																			0029-344X	2161-9859				AUG	1989	63	4					133	143																WOS:A1989AT02400001

Weather Research and Forecasting model simulations of a rare springtime bow echo near the Great Salt Lake, USA	METEOROLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												The semiarid climate and rugged terrain in the interior west of the United States do not favour the development of bow echoes, a type of convective storm associated with intense, damaging winds. However, on 21 April 2011, a bow echo associated with a fast-moving midtropospheric perturbation formed across the Great Salt Lake (GSL) in Utah, producing damaging winds along its path. Intrigued by the rarity of this bow echo and the inability of the North American Mesoscale model (NAM) to forecast it, this event was studied by using available observations and conducted simulations with the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Sensitivity to the microphysics schemes (MPSs), horizontal grid spacing, intensity of moisture content, and a physical lake model in the WRF model were examined. It was found that: (a) reduction in grid spacing from 12 and 4km to 1km along with improved depiction of low-level moisture substantially improved the bow echo simulation, (b) the presence of GSL did not impact bow echo development, and (c) the WRF model appeared to inherit a phase error in the passage of the midtropospheric perturbation from the NAM initial and lateral boundary conditions. The phase error resulted in a 1-2h delay in the bow echo passage. These results highlight the difficulties in simulating such a bow echo event, and suggest similar challenges future faced by subsequent regional climate downscaling studies on future extreme weather in the western United States.

J	Miao, XD				Miao, Xiaodong			Major dune construction during the Younger Dryas chronozone within the Kankakee River Valley, Great Lakes region, USA: Visible landscape response to rapid climate change	CATENA												The southern side of the Kankakee River Valley in Illinois and Indiana features an eolain landscape comprising dunes and sand sheets. These dunes are mostly parabolic in shape, ranging in height from 4 to 7 m, occasionally reaching up to 15 m. Due to limited natural exposures and fresh road cuts, three dunes were accessed for sampling through hand auguring for optically stimulated luminescence dating. To enhance our understanding of the subsurface stratigraphy, ground penetrating radar (GPR) surveys were conducted, the results of which revealed that the age variations obtained were consistent with changes from both GPR imagery and field observations. All three sampled sites indicated ages within the Younger Dryas chronozone (YDC, 12.8-11.7 ka). Notably, site KKK1 exhibited about 7 m of eolian sand, with five ages falling within the YDC. This construction of dunes during the YDC coincides with the majority of dune fields in the Great Lakes region, suggesting that the rapid climatic changes during the YDC played a crucial role in the observed dune construction here and the wider Great Lakes region. The regional consistency implies a prevailing dry climate during the YDC. While most previous YDC records are based on proxy data such as fossil pollen and stable isotope data, this study provides a tangible example of visible landscape response, construction of sand dunes, to the rapid climatic change occurring during the YDC.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				APR 15	2024	238								107865	10.1016/j.catena.2024.107865	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2024.107865		FEB 2024											WOS:001183908700001

However, there is still a lack of calibration studies that can quantitatively retrace the driving forces, especially at the Tibetan Plateau. Here, we elaborate the actual influence of environmental parameters such as temperature, evapotranspiration, salinity and biosynthetic fractionation on delta D values of n-alkanes. We measured hydrogen isotope values (delta D) of n-alkanes in recent sediment and plant samples as well as delta D values of different water sources (lake and inflow water, precipitation as well as leaf, root and soil water) from six Tibetan lakes along a 10 degrees-spanning longitudinal transect covering an aridity gradient. As expected, the deuterium record can be used to distinguish two water pools at the Plateau: (I) precipitation water, which supplies water for the lake inflow and terrestrial plants, and (II) enriched lake water having a clear evaporative signal. Based on significant correlations of the source water and delta D values of n-alkanes, delta D of alkane n-C-23 record the lake water isotope composition and track the evaporative enrichment of the lake system. In contrast, delta D of alkane n-C-29 can be used to retrace the isotope composition of the inflow displaying the integrated rainfall signal in the vegetation period modified by soil and leaf water evaporation. While temperature changes are less pronounced across the Tibetan transect, the isotopic difference between C-23 and C-29 could potentially be used as a proxy to reconstruct effective moisture (precipitation minus evaporation). Areas with lower precipitation amounts and higher evaporation rates are characterized by higher Delta delta DC23-C29 values. This relationship is more pronounced in regions with mean annual precipitation below 350 mm. Even in contrasting environments, the application of the delta D proxies is very promising. Combining other Tibetan studies, it is possible to present a comprehensive picture of the usage of compound-specific hydrogen isotopes of n-alkanes on the Tibetan Plateau.

Widespread thiamine deficiency in California salmon linked to an anchovy-dominated marine prey base	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency in marine systems is a globally significant threat to marine life. In 2020, newly hatched Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) fry in California's Central Valley (CCV) hatcheries swam in corkscrew patterns and died at unusually high rates due to a lack of this essential vitamin. We subsequently investigated the impacts and causes of thiamine deficiency in California's anadromous salmonids. Our laboratory studies defined the relationship between thiamine concentrations in Chinook salmon eggs and early life-stage survival in offspring; we used these data to develop a model that estimated 26 to 48% thiamine-dependent fry mortality across consecutive years (2020-2021) for winter-run Chinook salmon. We established an egg surveillance effort that found widespread thiamine deficiency in CCV Chinook salmon in 2020 and 2021, and emerging thiamine deficiency in Klamath River and Trinity River coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in 2021. We determined that thiamine injections into adults raised egg thiamine concentrations above levels found to impact early life-stage survival and swimming behavior. Ocean surveys, prey nutrition, salmon gut contents, and stable isotope data link thiamine deficiency to an ocean diet dominated by a booming population of northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax). This forage fish had low thiamine, high lipid, and high thiaminase activity levels consistent with both a thiaminase and oxidative stress hypothesis for causing thiamine deficiency in California salmon. Our research suggests California's already stressed anadromous salmonids will continue to be impacted by thiamine deficiency as long as their ocean forage base and diet are dominated by northern anchovy.

Because these accidents are difficult for water resource managers to forecast in a timely manner, there is an urgent need to develop optimum models to predict these T&O problems. For this purpose, various biotic and abiotic environmental parameters were monitored monthly for one year at 30 sites across Taihu Lake. This is the first investigation of this huge lake to sample T&O compounds at the whole-lake level. Certain phytoplankton taxa were important variables in the models; for instance, the concentrations of the particle-bound 2-methylisoborneol (p-MIB) were correlated with the presence of Oscillatoria, whereas those of the p-beta-cyclocitral and p-beta-ionone were correlated with Microcystis levels. Abiotic factors such as nitrogen (TN, TDN, NO3-N, and NO2-N), pH, DO, COND, COD and Chl-a also contributed significantly to the T&O predictive models. The dissolved (d) T&O compounds were related to both the algal biomass and to certain abiotic environmental factors, whereas the particle-bound (p) T&O compounds were more strongly related to the algal presence. We also tested the validity of these models using an independent data set that was previously collected from Taihu Lake in 2008. In comparing the concentrations of the T&O compounds observed in 2008 with those concentrations predicted from our models, we found that most of the predicted data points fell within the 90% confidence intervals of the observed values. This result supported the validity of these models in the studied system. These models, basing on easily collected environmental data, will be of practical value to the water resource managers of Taihu Lake for evaluating the probability of T&O accidents.

J	Xue, LH; Yang, LZ				Xue, Lihong; Yang, Linzhang			Recommendations for nitrogen fertiliser topdressing rates in rice using canopy reflectance spectra	BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING												Three site-specific approaches were developed for dry crop fertilisation: a N fertiliser optimisation algorithm (NFOA), a canopy density (LAI), and a nitrogen nutrition index (NNI) were all modified and calibrated using rice data from different agriculture management practices and then used to determine the nitrogen (N) topdressing rate at the panicle initiation stage based on the real-time canopy reflectance spectra. Rice grain yield, N rate, and the economic and the environmental benefits were compared with the standard N recommendation using N production functions (SN) as a reference. The results showed that these three site-specific approaches could be used to develop rice N topdressing recommendations following modification and calibration. The total N rate in site-specific fertilisation ranged from 166 to 233 kg [N] ha(-1), with almost equal N rates for NNI and LAI approaches, but with lower rates for the NFOA approaches. All were lower than the SN approach (250kg[N]ha(-1)). A 33.6% reduction in the total N rate in the treatment of N topdressing was recommended by the NFOA approach without basal N (OBN1, 0-80-133kg[N]ha(-1)). It slightly increased the yield (about 0.4tha(-1)), and improved the nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) around 20% for agronomic efficiency (AE(N)) and 16% for recovery efficiency (REN) compared with the SN treatment (100-50-100 kg [N] ha(-1)). N apparent loss and soil residual N of all the site-specific N fertilisation treatments were lower than SN, while the net benefit of all site-specific N fertilisation treatments was increased, with the highest increase being 1575Yuan ha(-1) (In 2005 1 Yuan=0.12 US$=0.9(sic)). This suggests that reducing the proportion of N applied at basal and during the early vegetative stage and fine-tuning the N topdressing rate according to the crop growth status with remote sensing could be an effective way to increase NUE and reduce environmental risks in the Taihu Lake Region, China.

The Complete Genome and Physiological Analysis of the Eurythermal Firmicute Exiguobacterium chiriqhucha Strain RW2 Isolated From a Freshwater Microbialite, Widely Adaptable to Broad Thermal, pH, and Salinity Ranges	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Members of the genus Exiguobacterium are found in diverse environments from marine, freshwaters, permafrost to hot springs. Exiguobacterium can grow in a wide range of temperature, pH, salinity, and heavy-metal concentrations. We characterized Exiguobacterium chiriqhucha strain RW2 isolated from a permanently cold freshwater microbialite in Pavilion Lake, British Columbia using metabolic assays, genomics, comparative genomics, phylogenetics, and fatty acid composition. Strain RW2 has the most extensive growth range for temperature (4-50 degrees C) and pH (5-11) of known Exiguobacterium isolates. Strain RW2 genome predicts pathways for wide differential thermal, cold and osmotic stress using cold and heat shock cascades (e.g., csp and dnaK), choline and betaine uptake/biosynthesis (e.g., opu and proU), antiporters (e.g., arcD and nhaC Na+/K+), membrane fatty acid unsaturation and saturation. Here, we provide the first complete genome from Exiguobacterium chirighucha strain RW2, which was isolated from a freshwater microbialite. Its genome consists of a single 3,019,018 bp circular chromosome encoding over 3,000 predicted proteins, with a GC% content of 52.1%, and no plasmids. In addition to growing at a wide range of temperatures and salinities, our findings indicate that RW2 is resistant to sulfisoxazole and has the genomic potential for detoxification of heavy metals (via mercuric reductases, arsenic resistance pumps, chromate transporters, and cadmium-cobalt-zinc resistance genes), which may contribute to the metabolic potential of Pavilion Lake microbialites. Strain RW2 could also contribute to microbialite formation, as it is a robust biofilm former and encodes genes involved in the deamination of amino acids to ammonia (i.e., L-asparaginase/urease), which could potentially boost carbonate precipitation by lowering the local pH and increasing alkalinity. We also used comparative genomic analysis to predict the pathway for orange pigmentation that is conserved across the entire Exiguobacterium genus, specifically, a C-30 carotenoid biosynthesis pathway is predicted to yield diaponeurosporene-4-oic acid as its final product. Carotenoids have been found to protect against ultraviolet radiation by quenching reactive oxygen, releasing excessive light energy, radical scavenging, and sunscreening. Together these results provide further insight into the potential of Exiguobacteriurn to exploit a wide range of environmental conditions, its potential roles in ecosystems (e.g., microbialites/microbial mats), and a blueprint model for diverse metabolic processes.

J	Savatenalinton, S; Suttajit, M				Savatenalinton, Sukonthip; Suttajit, Maitree			A checklist of Recent non-marine ostracods (Crustacea: Ostracoda) from Thailand, including descriptions of two new species	ZOOTAXA												A checklist covering a total of 67 Recent non-marine ostracod species from Thailand, belonging to 33 genera and seven families (Cyprididae, Candonidae, Ilyocyprididae, Notodromadidae, Darwinulidae, Limnocytheridae, Loxoconchidae), is presented. Twenty-five of these are considered endemic to the Oriental region, 17 of which are Thai endemics. Two species (Hemicypris exiqua Broodbakker, 1983, and Notodromas sinensis Neal & Zhao, 1991) are new records for the Oriental region, and four species (Cypretta seurati Gauthier, 1929, Chrissia ceylonica (Daday, 1898), Chrissia formosa (Klie, 1938), and Dolerocypris fasciata (O.F. Muller, 1776)) are new record for Thailand. The most diverse subfamily in Thailand is the Cypricercinae, with 22 species. The most diverse genera are Strandesia Stuhlmann, 1888 (eight species), followed by Pseudostrandesia Savatenalinton & Martens, 2009 (seven species) and Stenocypris Sars, 1889 (five species). Other enigmatic groups and new taxa occur in the checklist, but these need to be described elsewhere in the future. For example, several species of Cypridopsinae Kaufmann, 1900, Cyclocypridinae Kaufmann, 1900, Candoninae Kaufmann, 1900 and other groups await description. Considering regional distributions based on frequency of occurrences, rare species constitute a large fraction, whereas very common species are minor elements. Most of the records were reported from the Northern and Northeastern parts of Thailand. Sampled habitat types ranged from ponds, (oxbow) lakes, swamps, reservoirs, springs, canals, rivers, rice fields, waterfalls, and damp leaf litter. Most of the Thai ostracod fauna exists in a wide range of habitats. A brief discussion on the distribution of described species is included with the list. Additionally, in the present contribution, we describe two new species, Dolerocypris sisaketensis n. sp. and Hungarocypris suranareeae n. sp., from the Northeastern part of Thailand. The main character of Dolerocypris sisaketensis n. sp. is the presence of a spine on the postero-ventral part of the right valve; this feature sets it apart from other Dolerocypris species. Hungarocypris suranareeae n. sp. is the second species of this genus in Thailand and the third one in Southeast Asia. It is clearly distinguished from other Hungarocypris species by the serration on both valves. The genera Dolerocypris and Hungarocypris are briefly discussed and a key to the species of Hungarocypris is provided.

Physical and chemical properties	HYDROBIOLOGIA												A baseline study on a temperate, oligotrophic North Patagonian lake (Lake Chapo, Southern Chile) was made prior to the installation of a hydroelectric power station. Throughout one year (September 1986-October 1987) the physical and chemical properties of the lake were investigated monthly from the surface to a depth of 40 m. Lake Chapo is a deep, transparent (Secchi depth: 17-25 m), glacial lake located at 41degrees 27.5' S and 72degrees 30' W. It has a maximum depth of 298 m, mean depth of 183 m, surface area of 45.3 km(2) and water volume of 8.296 km(3). The theoretical residence time of the water was 5.5 years. The temperature regime is monomictic with the mixed temperature between 8.1-8.8 degreesC. Maximum temperature at the surface was 18.7 degreesC during thermal stratification in summer when the epilimnion had a thickness of about 20 m. The conductivity was low (20.3-23.8 muS cm(-1)) as was the buffering capacity of a predominantly CO2-carbonate system. The predominant cations were Ca+2 > Na+>Mg+2>K+. The phosphorous and nitrogen contents were very low (soluble reactive ortophosphate: 0-1.5 mug P 1(-1), total phosphorus: 0.3-4 mug P 1(-1) and nitrate: 0-35 mug N 1(-1)), which is typical of North Patagonian lakes.

Long-term changes in the diet of pike (Esox lucius), the top aquatic predator in a changing Windermere	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Pike (Esox lucius) is a key and flexible piscivore in many fresh waters of the northern temperate zone, but no previous studies have provided a continuous long-term perspective on its diet in response to changing environmental conditions. Here, we describe its winter diet from 1976 to 2009 in the North and South Basins of the lake of Windermere, U.K., where climate change, eutrophication and species introductions have combined to induce fundamental changes in the fish community. 2. A total of 6637 adult pike (fork length 390 to 1090 mm) was examined and found to have consumed a total of 4436 fish prey of which 98% of individuals identifiable to species comprised native Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus), brown trout (Salmo trutta), perch (Perca fluviatilis) and pike and non-native roach (Rutilus rutilus). Over the 34-year study period, the dietary importance of the salmonids Arctic charr and brown trout decreased, while that of the percid perch, the esocid pike and particularly the cyprinid roach increased. These changes were particularly marked in the more eutrophicated South Basin of the lake. 3. The above chronological trends in species-specific contributions to the diet composition of pike had considerable overall impacts. In the 1970s, pike diet composition was dominated by Arctic charr and brown trout which together comprised 94% of the diet. In contrast, in the 2000s, these two species accounted for just 55% of the diet, with perch and roach now comprising 41%. 4. Recent changes observed in the Windermere fish community of a decrease in native salmonids and an increase in cyprinids are consistent with the generally expected effects of climate change in the northern temperature zone. Here, we have shown that they have led to corresponding changes in the diet composition of pike. In turn, this may have implications for lake's food web structure through shortening food chain length from the primary producers to the top aquatic predator.

Childhood lead exposure and uptake in teeth in the Cleveland area during the era of leaded gasoline	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Childhood uptake of lead from exposure to atmospheric leaded gasoline in the United States has been studied using mainly blood lead levels. Since reliable blood lead techniques were used only after the peak use of leaded gasoline, the prior exposure history is unclear. The well-documented decline in blood lead levels after the mid-1970s could represent the continuation of a historic steady decline in exposure from many sources. Alternatively, the post-1970s decline might represent the declining phase of a unimodal rise and fall corresponding closely to usage of leaded gasoline. To assess these possibilities, lead concentration and 207Pb/206Pb isotope ratios were measured in the enamel of permanent molar teeth formed between 1936 and 1993 in mainly African-American donors who grew up in the Cleveland area. Tooth enamel preserves the lead concentration and isotope ratio that prevails during tooth formation. Historical trends in enamel lead concentration were significantly correlated with surrogates of atmospheric lead exposure: lead in sediments of two dated Lake Erie cores, and lead consumed in gasoline. About two-thirds of the total lead uptake into enamel in this period was attributable to leaded gasoline, and the remainder to other sources (e.g. paint). Enamel 207Pb/206Pb isotope ratios were similar to those of one lake sediment. Multivariate analysis revealed significant correlation in neighborhoods with higher levels of traffic, and including lake sediment data, accounted for 53% of the variation in enamel lead levels. Enamel lead concentration was highly correlated with reported African-American childhood blood levels. The extrapolated peak level of 48 mu g/dL (range 40 to 63) is associated with clinical and behavioral impairments, which may have implications for adults who were children during the peak gasoline lead exposure. In sum, leaded gasoline emission was the predominant source of lead exposure of African-American Cleveland children during the latter two-thirds of the 20th century. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

J	Wadleigh, MA; Schwarcz, HP; Kramer, JR				Wadleigh, MA; Schwarcz, HP; Kramer, JR			Areal distribution of sulphur and oxygen isotopes in sulphate of rain over eastern North America	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Three summer rainfall events were sampled simultaneously across a network of 24 stations extending from the Mississippi River to the Atlantic seaboard and from the Gulf of Mexico to subarctic Canada. The chemical and isotopic compositions of the rain and its dissolved sulphate were measured on each sample. Each event was characterized by a different air mass back trajectory, suggesting a different source region for the transported sulphate. Two of the air masses apparently originated in northern Canada, one near Great Slave Lake and the other in arctic Canada. The third air mass originated in the Gulf of Mexico. In spite of this, sulphur isotopic composition was very homogeneous over most of the network, averaging +3.41 +/- 0.95 parts per thousand, indistinguishable from the means of the individual events. This value is similar to that reported for long-range transported sulphate reaching the coastal Atlantic site of Shelburne, Nova Scotia, and supports the existence of a continent-wide, well-mixed atmospheric reservoir of sulphur. No correlation was observed between percent sea spray and sulphur isotopic composition presumably because of the small (less than 10%) calculated sea salt contributions. Sulphate-oxygen isotopic compositions varied very widely from -0.7 to 18 parts per thousand. Two of the events apparently derived their sulphate through scavenging of aged sulphate aerosols. Sulphate-oxygen isotopes for the other event were correlated with those of the associated rainwater, suggesting that sulphate from that event was oxidized within the transporting air mass, implying that sulphur was transported in the atmosphere in an isotopically exchangeable form.																			2169-897X	2169-8996				SEP 27	2001	106	D18					20883	20895		10.1029/2001JD900081	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2001JD900081													WOS:000171216300020

Comparing long-term changes in cladoceran and diatom assemblages from a lake impacted by road salt seepage to a nearby reference lake near Toronto (Ontario, Canada)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Urban and peri-urban lakes experience a wider array of environmental stressors, and often at a higher intensity, than their rural counterparts, including road salt runoff. A paleolimnological approach was used to determine pre-disturbance limnological conditions and to evaluate the impact of environmental stressors (nutrient inputs, climate change, and winter de-icing salt) on the long-term (similar to 150 years) water quality of a small urban kettle lake in the Oak Ridges Moraine near Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Specifically, we examined Cladocera and diatom subfossils in Pb-210-dated sediment cores from a lake with elevated measured chloride concentrations, Haynes Lake (Cl- = 201 mg/l), and a nearby reference lake located in a conservation area (Swan Lake, Cl- = 28 mg/l). In Haynes Lake, Cladocera compositional change is consistent with increasing Cl- concentrations, showing a shift from a Bosmina spp.-dominated cladoceran assemblage to a Daphnia spp.-dominated assemblage. Concurrently, we recorded increases in the relative abundances of the diatom taxon Achnanthidium minutissimum and benthic fragilarioid taxa. These biological changes coincided closely with the onset of road salting in the region (ca. 1940s). The reference site (Swan Lake), located similar to 1 km from our salt-impacted site, displayed only minimal changes in both Cladocera and diatom assemblages, suggesting road development and salting within the Haynes Lake watershed had a larger impact than regional stressors (i.e., climate).					; Smol, John/A-8838-2015	Murray, Kathryn/0009-0006-6306-875X; Valleau, Robin/0000-0001-7440-6298													0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2024	851	16					3841	3854		10.1007/s10750-024-05510-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-024-05510-9		JUL 2024											WOS:001265412300001

This article shares the results of a project to train local stakeholders to collect debris in their communities using scientific methods, then share the results with policymakers. Methods: Workshops were held in Uganda, Indonesia, and the United States in the spring of 2022. This article presents baseline data from collections on the Aturukuku River in Uganda, the Ayung River in Indonesia, and the Connecticut River in the United States as well as survey results measuring participant attitudes, behaviors, and their perceptions around plastic waste and policy. Surveying participants sheds light on the nuances of perception of the problem and policies to combat pollution at each locale. Results: We found deposited debris at each riverbank location: Aturukuku River, 0.45 pieces/m2 of which 89.4% was plastic; Ayung River, 7.62 pieces/m2 of which 91.1% was plastic, and the Connecticut River 0.29 pieces/m2 of which 63% was plastic. Environmental attitudes and behaviors were comparable among countries. Participants in all three countries expect plastic will be the most frequently found material. Discussion: In all cases, perceptions about the kind of debris in their communities corresponds well with collection results. Perceptions around policy solutions included a wide range of solutions, though countries differed in whether solutions addressed the source or the symptoms of the problem; solutions focused more on waste management in Uganda and Indonesia.

J	Twiss, MR; Campbell, PGC				Twiss, MR; Campbell, PGC			Scavenging of 137Cs, 109Cd, 65Zn, and 153Gd by plankton of the microbial food web in pelagic Lake Erie surface waters	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Inorganic dissolved Cs-137, Cd-109, Zn-65 and Gd-153 were added, at concentrations well below their respective solubility limits, to screened water (< 210 mu m) sampled from the pelagic epilimnion of Lake Erie during the summers of 1994 and 1995. The hypotheses tested were that scavenging occurs in all of the ecologically significant size fractions that comprise the microbial food web (picoplankton, 0.2 to 2 mu m; nanoplankton, 2 to 20 mu m; microplankton, 20 to 210 mu m), and that scavenging by plankton is directly related to the respective particle-reactivity of the elements (Gd > Zn > Cd much greater than Cs). Size-selective filtration at intervals over periods of 22 to 30 h established that picoplankton and nanoplankton were th dominant scavenging phases in this environment. Scavenging of Gd-153, Zn-65, and Cd-109 by plankton was more similar than predicted on the basis of their anticipated particle-reactivity and Cs-137 was weakly scavenged. Except for the picoplankton, Zn-65 was the element most readily scavenged by the plankton size fractions. High accumulation of Cd-109 in the picoplankton may reflect the sorption of this element by calcite associated with autotrophic picoplankton. These experiments quantify the partitioning of trace metals within the plankton of the microbial food web (0.2 to 210 mu m), a dynamic community of particles that dominates the seston in the pelagic surface waters of Lake Erie during thermal stratification, and suggest that plankton dynamics should be considered in predictions of the geochemical fate of trace metals in this environment.

The main sources include fallout from atmospheric nuclear weapons tests and weapons complexes and test sites of the Former Soviet Union in or near the Ob watershed. The approach is to measure the accumulation of the radionuclides in undisturbed delta sediments - obtaining a record of their deposition over time. These records were found in sediments of shallow lakes apart from, and connected to, the main channel. Sediment cores were collected in the summer of 1994 using a shallow draft catamaran to reach these lakes from a support ship in the main channel. Measurements are presented on the depth distributions of Cs-137 and Pu isotopes and their inventories in a series of dated sediment cores - including one from a location in the Taz Estuary (which does not receive Ob River sediments). Sediment dating was carried out using the excess Pb-210 technique. The results obtained are compared with known information on the temporal history of releases from the various sources and characteristics of the isotopic composition of the sources. The results show that good records of radionuclide deposition indicate that the major fraction of Cs-137 and Pu isotopes deposited in these delta sediments comes from atmospheric nuclear weapons test fallout - both delivered directly from the atmosphere and from downstream transport of watershed sediments. No more than 25% of the observed inventories could be derived from other sources.

J	Hines, NA; Brezonik, PL				Hines, NA; Brezonik, PL			Mercury dynamics in a small Northern Minnesota lake: water to air exchange and photoreactions of mercury	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Mercury speciation at a small seepage lake in Northern Minnesota was shown to be influenced by photoreduction and photooxidation. Fluxes of Hg-o from water to air were greatest in the warmer, sunnier months in 2001 to 2002; however, correlation with solar radiation was weak. The daytime evasional loss was generally from water to air and was estimated at 5.3 pmol m(-2) h(-1) for 2001 and 6.2 pmol m(-2) h(-1) for 2002 using a two-layer gas transfer model. Losses of Hg-(aq)(o) in the dark over 10 days were observed in lake water (0.02 h(-1)), Milli-Q(TM)water, and HPLC grade water (0.002 h(-1)) and agreed with reported pseudo-first-order loss rates in the dark in other freshwaters. Using a mercury arc lamp, the pseudo-first-order loss rate of Hgo in water from Spring Lake was found to range from 0.39 to 0.76 h(-1). Other sinks for Hgo exist through reaction with ozone hydroxyl radical, and possibly singlet oxygen. A second-order reaction rate constant for Hg-(aq)(o) and OH of 1.0 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1) was estimated based on data from experiments and the literature. Although less reactive, there is a higher steady state concentration of ozone in lake water compared to hydroxyl radical. Consequently, loss of Hg-(aq)(o) by ozone may predominate. Potential oxidation of Hg-(aq)(o) by singlet oxygen using rose bengal as a sensitizer could not distinguish between oxidation by rose bengal and by singlet oxygen itself. Chloride enhanced the oxidation of Hg-(aq)(o) and should be considered in the mercury cycle in the ocean. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Mechanical-Statistical Modeling in Ecology: From Outbreak Detections to Pest Dynamics	BULLETIN OF MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY												Knowledge about large-scale and long-term dynamics of (natural) populations is required to assess the efficiency of control strategies, the potential for long-term persistence, and the adaptability to global changes such as habitat fragmentation and global warming. For most natural populations, such as pest populations, large-scale and long-term surveys cannot be carried out at a high resolution. For instance, for population dynamics characterized by irregular abundance explosions, i.e., outbreaks, it is common to report detected outbreaks rather than measuring the population density at every location and time event. Here, we propose a mechanical-statistical model for analyzing such outbreak occurrence data and making inference about population dynamics. This spatio-temporal model contains the main mechanisms of the dynamics and describes the observation process. This construction enables us to account for the discrepancy between the phenomenon scale and the sampling scale. We propose the Bayesian method to estimate model parameters, pest densities and hidden factors, i.e., variables involved in the dynamics but not observed. The model was specified and used to learn about the dynamics of the European pine sawfly (Neodiprion sertifer Geoffr., an insect causing major defoliation of pines in northern Europe) based on Finnish sawfly data covering the years 1961-1990. In this application, a dynamical Beverton-Holt model including a hidden regime variable was incorporated into the model to deal with large variations in the population densities. Our results gave support to the idea that pine sawfly dynamics should be studied as metapopulations with alternative equilibria. The results confirmed the importance of extreme minimum winter temperatures for the occurrence of European pine sawfly outbreaks. The strong positive connection between the ratio of lake area over total area and outbreaks was quantified for the first time.					; SOUBEYRAND, Samuel/NUQ-5764-2025	Soubeyrand, Samuel/0000-0003-2447-3067; 													0092-8240					FEB	2009	71	2					318	338		10.1007/s11538-008-9363-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11538-008-9363-9								18843520					WOS:000262504000003

We evaluated the relative importance of wetland export in the MeHg budget of a wetland-dominated lake in northern Wisconsin using mass balance. Channelized runoff from a large headwater wetland was the major source of water and total mercury (HgT) to the lake during the study period. The wetland also exported MeHg in high concentrations (0.2-0.8 ng L-1), resulting in an export rate similar to those reported for other northern wetlands (ca. 0.3 mu g MeHg m(-2)y(-1)). Yet, based on intensive sampling during 2002, the mass of MeHg that accumulated in the lake during summer was an order of magnitude greater than the export of MeHg from the wetland to the lake. Hence, a large in-lake source of MeHg is inferred from the mass balance. Most of the accumulated MeHg built-up in anoxic hypolimnetic waters; and the build-up was roughly balanced by losses of inorganic Hg (Hg-(II)) implying a chemical transformation within the anoxic water column. An abundance of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in hypolimnetic waters, established by DNA analysis of the pelagic microbial community, along with a previous report documenting high methylation rates in the hypolimnion of this lake (ca. 10% d(-1)), suggest that this transformation was microbially mediated. These findings indicate that the direct effect of wetland runoff may be outweighed by indirect effects on the lacustrine MeHg cycle, enhancing the load of Hg-(II)), the activity of SRB, and the retention of MeHg, especially in northern lakes with flushing times longer than six months.

We followed the changes with time in dry weight, the dynamics of nutrients, microbial abundances and a range of microbial activities including leucine incorporation rates and activities of hydrolytic enzymes. Because of the low N and P content of thecae (C:N: P atomic ratios >3000:19:1) relative to protoplasts (276:51:I), the microbial utilization of thecae was expected to depend much mon on the availability of external nutrient sources than the utilization of protoplasts. Indeed, decomposition of thecae did not occur in the absence of external nutrients but was rapid (1-2 d to their disappearance) after nutrients were added. In contrast, almost no stimulating effect of nutrient addition was observed for the decomposition of whole cells. The results suggest that intensive regenerative nutrient cycling or external nutrient inputs are a necessary precondition for an efficient trophic transfer of the energy stored in blooms of thecate dinoflagellates. The high nutrient demands of microbial degradation imply furthermore a competition for nutrients between heterotrophic degradative and phototrophic productive processes. Because of the generally assumed stronger competitive ability of heterotrophic bacteria, reduced primary production is expected as an indirect result of dinoflagellate bloom degradation. Indeed, reduced primary production is observed in Lake Kinneret every summer after the decline of the annual Peridinium bloom in June-July.																			0024-3590					JAN	2000	45	1					123	130		10.4319/lo.2000.45.1.0123	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2000.45.1.0123													WOS:000084949600012

Although debated, this climatic shift is a possible scenario in a future warmer climate. One major line of evidence reported for past green periods in the Sahara is the presence of paleo-lakes. Even today, Saharan desert lakes get filled from time to time. However, very little is known about these events due to the lack of available in situ observations. In addition, the hydrometeorological conditions associated with these events have never been systematically investigated. This study proposes filling this knowledge gap by examining the meteorology of lake-filling episodes (LFEs) of Sebkha el Melah - a commonly dry lake in the northwestern Sahara. Heavy-precipitation events (HPEs) and LFEs are identified using a combination of precipitation observations and lake volume estimates derived from satellite remote sensing. Weather reanalysis data are used together with three-dimensional trajectory calculations to investigate the moisture sources and characteristics of weather systems that lead to HPEs and to assess the conditions necessary for producing LFEs. Results show that hundreds of HPEs occurred between 2000 and 2021, but only six LFEs eventuated. The ratio between the increase in lake water volume during LFEs and the precipitation volume during HPEs that triggered the lake filling, known as the runoff coefficient, provides a very useful characteristic to assess storm impacts on water availability. For the six LFEs investigated in this study, the runoff coefficient ranges across 5 orders of magnitude, much lower than the ratios often cited in the literature for the Sahara. We find that LFEs are generated most frequently in autumn by the most intense HPEs, for which the key ingredients are (i) the formation of surface extratropical cyclones to the west of the North African Atlantic coast in interplay with upper-level troughs and lows, (ii) moisture convergence from the tropics and the extratropical North Atlantic, (iii) a pre-moistening of the region upstream of the catchment over the Sahara through a recycling-domino-process, (iv) coupled or sequential lifting processes (e.g. orographic lifting and large-scale forcing), and (v) the stationarity of synoptic systems that result in long-duration (typically 3 d) HPEs. Based on the insights gained into Saharan LFEs in the present-day climate, we suggest that the initial filling and persistence of Saharan lakes may be related to changes in the intensity, frequency, or synoptic pattern of HPEs rather than to a change in mean precipitation alone. Future studies can leverage these insights to better assess the mechanisms involved in the greening of the Sahara in the past and, potentially, in a warmer future.

Age, growth and reproduction of Chondrostoma regium (Heckel, 1843) from the Zayandeh Roud River, Iran	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCES												Age, growth and reproduction were investigated for Chondrostoma regium, collected monthly (November 2007-August 2008) from the Dimeh Spring region, Zayandeh Roud River, Iran. The maximum age of collected female and male fish were estimated based on scale increments as five and four years respectively. Von Bertalanffy growth equations were calculated as L-t = 246[1 - e(-0.206(t-0.034))], W-t = 163.29[1 - e(-0.206(t-0.034))](2.77) for females and L-t = 253.1[1 - e(-0.206(t-0.175))], W-t = 188.25[1 - e(-0.206(t-0.175))](2.99) for males. Size ranges of the male and female specimens were almost similar. The fork length range for females was 10.5-18.0 cm and 10.7-19.7 cm for males; and the weight range was 15.7-85.4 g in females, and 14.5-88.5 g in males. The female-male ratio was 1.8:1 (p<0.05), and for both sexes gonadal development and sexual maturity occurred in the second year of their life. Length-weight relationships revealed isometric growth pattern for males and a negative allometric growth for females. Monthly data of Gonadosomatic Index, and ovary condition suggested that spawning occurred during May and June. The mean absolute and relative fecundity was calculated as 2429 +/- 1512 (eggs/female) and 78.1 +/- 18.7 (egg/g), respectively, and fecundity was significantly correlated with both body weight (r(2)=0.90) and fork length and (r(2)=0.84).

An empirical test in southern Sweden	VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY												In this paper we test the performance of the Regional Estimates of VEgetation Abundance from Large Sites (REVEALS) model using pollen records from multiple small sites. We use Holocene pollen records from large and small sites in southern Sweden to identify what is/are the most significant variable(s) affecting the REVEALS-based reconstructions, i.e. type of site (lakes and/or bogs), number of sites, site size, site location in relation to vegetation zones, and/or distance between small sites and large sites. To achieve this objective we grouped the small sites according to (i) the two major modern vegetation zones of the study region, and (ii) the distance between the small sites and large lakes, i.e. small sites within 50, 100, 150, or 200 km of the large lakes. The REVEALS-based reconstructions were performed using 24 pollen taxa. Redundancy analysis was performed on the results from all REVEALS-model runs using the groups within (i) and (ii) separately, and on the results from all runs using the groups within (ii) together. The explanatory power and significance of the variables were identified using forward selection and Monte Carlo permutation tests. The results show that (a) although the REVEALS model was designed for pollen data from large lakes, it also performs well with pollen data from multiple small sites in reconstructing the percentage cover of groups of plant taxa (e.g. open land taxa, summer-green trees, evergreen trees) or individual plant taxa; however, in the case of this study area, the reconstruction of the percentage cover of Calluna vulgaris, Cyperaceae, and Betula may be problematic when using small bogs; (b) standard errors of multiple small-site REVEALS estimates will generally be larger than those obtained using pollen records from large lakes, and they will decrease with increasing size of pollen counts and increasing number of small sites; (c) small lakes are better to use than small bogs if the total number of small sites is low; and (d) the size of small sites and the distance between them do not play a major role, but the distance between the small sites and landscape/vegetation boundaries is a determinant factor for the accuracy of the vegetation reconstructions.					; Gaillard, Marie-José/ABG-2680-2021	Mazier, Florence/0000-0003-2643-0925; Lageras, Per/0000-0002-2804-8028													0939-6314	1617-6278				MAR	2016	25	2					131	151		10.1007/s00334-015-0536-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00334-015-0536-9													WOS:000373747600003

Merging eruption datasets: building an integrated Holocene eruptive record for Mt Taranaki, New Zealand	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												Acquiring detailed eruption frequency datasets for a volcano system is essential for realistic eruption forecasts. However, accurate datasets are inherently difficult to compile, even if one or more well-dated eruption records are available. A single record typically under-represents the eruption frequency, while combining two or more records may result in an overrepresentation. Although glass compositions have proven to be successful in tephrochronological studies of dominantly rhyolitic tephras; microlitic growth and thin glass shards inhibit their application to andesitic tephras. A method consisting of a combination of two techniques for correlating syn-eruptive deposits is demonstrated on data from the typical andesitic stratovolcano of Mt. Taranaki, New Zealand. Firstly, tentative matches are identified using the radiocarbon age and associated error of each event. Secondly, the compositions of titanomagnetite micro-phenocrysts are used as an independent check, and shown to be a useful correlation tool where age data is available. Using two lake-core records containing tephra layers in an overlapping time-frame, the radiocarbon age-correlation procedure suggested 31 tephra matches. Geochemistry data were available for 15 of these pairs. In three of these cases, the titanomagnetite compositions did not match. Hence, these "paired" tephras were from compositionally distinct magmas and therefore likely represent separate events. An additional three matches were reassigned within the temporal uncertainty limits of the dating procedure, based on better geochemical pairing. The final combined dataset suggests that there have been at least 138 separate ash fall-producing eruptions between 96 and 10 150 years B.P. from Taranaki. Using the combined dataset the mixture of Weibulls renewal model forecasts a probability of 0.52 for an eruption occurring in the next 50 years at this volcano. The present annual eruption probability is estimated at 1.6%. This likelihood is almost double that obtained when relying on a single stratigraphic record.					; Cronin, Shane/AAC-9964-2020	Bebbington, Mark/0000-0003-3504-7418; Cronin, Shane/0000-0001-7499-603X; 													0258-8900	1432-0819				OCT	2009	71	8					903	918		10.1007/s00445-009-0274-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00445-009-0274-x													WOS:000269846000005

The contemporary distribution of grasses in Australia: A process of immigration, dispersal and shifting dominance	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												AimLittle is known about the distribution of grasses throughout Australia. Using endemism as a basis for understanding biogeographical distributions, we hypothesised that contemporary species richness would be the result of environmental factors and dynamic ecological interactions spanning more than 25 Ma. LocationAustralia. TaxonGrasses. MethodsWe mapped the distribution of all Australian grass species and modelled climatic and landscape correlates according to photosynthetic type (C-3 or C-4), endemism, age in Australia, phylogenetic lineage and traits linked to dominance, using height as a proxy. Age classes comprised 'Ancient' (Gondwanan), and three others related to migration during the Sunda-Sahul Interchange (SSI): Early, Mid or Recent. In some analyses, 'Ancient', 'Early SSI' and 'Mid SSI' were combined into 'Pre-Recent SSI'. ResultsOverall, species richness of C-4 grasses increased with warmer mean annual temperatures, while richness of C-3 grasses was higher in cooler areas. Recent SSI species had strong associations with summer rains and were dominant in the continent's northeast, with Pre-Recent SSI species concentrated in the southeast, a pattern largely reflecting photosynthetic type (C-4 and C-3 respectively). Endemic and shared species distribution patterns support a migration sequence in which most C-3 Pooideae and Panicoideae genera arrived in Australia before the Pliocene aridifications, followed by C-4 Chloridoideae as aridification increased, with C-4 Andropogoneae immigrating most recently across Lake Carpentaria's open habitats in the later Pleistocene. Recent SSI shared species were significantly taller than Pre-Recent SSI endemic grasses. Main ConclusionsThe few grasses present in Australia before the Pliocene grew in cooler areas. The influx of taller Recent SSI grasses contributed to dramatic environmental changes-including creation of the northern savannas-with repercussions for resident taxa. Contemporary methods of fuel management could be promoting invasion by grass, thereby jeopardising the conditions suited to ancient taxa and threatening the region's evolutionary history.

Gary			Long-term effects of EPA and DHA enriched diets on digestive enzyme activity, aerobic scope, growth and survival in age-0 Lake Sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens)	AQUACULTURE												Nutritional condition during early life could have long lasting effects on metabolism, growth trajectory and ultimately ecological fitness. We examined effects of Artemia nauplii enriched with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; C20:5n3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; C22:6n3) on fatty acid profile, digestive enzyme activity, energy density, aerobic scope, growth and survival in age-0 Lake Sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens). Four diets were used in the study: 1) control (absence of EPA and DHA): freshly hatched Artemia nauplii, 2) low DHA: Artemia enriched with Chlorella vulgaris, 3) high DHA: Artemia enriched with Red AlgaMac and 4) time-control: Artemia left for the time to match growth that would occur during the enrichment. At 20 days post hatch (dph), fish were fed one of four diets three times a day ad libitum for 29 days after which all fish were fed the same diet of bloodworm twice a day ad libitum until the end of the experiment, which included a simulated overwintering event for 45 days at 3 degrees C. Fish were sampled after 24 days of feeding the aforementioned diets, as well as before and after the simulated overwintering event at 145 and 190 dph, respectively. Fish fed the high DHA diet did not change the measured parameters compared to fish fed the control diet after 24 days of feeding; however, before overwintering fish fed high DHA showed higher lipase activity (p = 0.01) compared to the control group and significantly increased body mass when temperature decreased (p < 0.05). Further, fish fed the high DHA diet showed a substantially lower mortality than fish fed the control diet following the diet transition from Artemia to bloodworm (44%; p < 0.05). Our results suggest the importance of EPA and DHA during early life on growth and survival, which could be used to improve post-release survival rates in conservation aquaculture of Lake Sturgeon, a species at risk or endangered across its natural range.

Day of ascent dosing of acetazolamide for prevention of acute mountain sickness. High Alt Med Biol 00:000-000, 2019. Background: Acetazolamide is the most common medication used for prevention of acute mountain sickness (AMS), usually administered the day or night before ascent. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of day of ascent dosing of acetazolamide for AMS prevention. Methods: Double-blind, randomized, controlled noninferiority trial of acetazolamide 125 mg twice daily beginning either the night before or the morning of ascent. Healthy low altitude adults ascended from 1240 m (4100 ft) to 3810 m (12,570 ft) during summer 2018 on White Mountain, California. Primary outcome was incidence of AMS with the two different dosing patterns, assessed by the 1993 Lake Louise Questionnaire (LLQ) of >= 3 with headache and a minimum of 1 for other symptom. Results: One hundred four participants completed the study, with 54 (52%) randomized to night before acetazolamide and 50 (48%) to day of ascent dosing, without differences in baseline characteristics. There was 9% greater incidence of AMS in the day of ascent acetazolamide group (48.0% vs. 39%, 95% confidence interval [CI] -11.8 to 30, p = 0.46, number needed to treat [NNT] = 5.6 vs. 3.7), with the CI just surpassing the predetermined 26% noninferiority margin. There was a lower incidence of severe AMS (1993 LLQ >5) in the day of ascent group (n = 5, 10%, NNT = 2.3) compared with night before dosing (n = 12, 22%, NNT = 3.1) (95% CI -28 to 3.6), and lower average symptom severity in the day of ascent group (3 vs. 3.5, 95% CI -0.5 to 1.4). Conclusions: Day of ascent acetazolamide demonstrated higher rates of AMS compared with traditional dosing by a small margin. With similar rates of severe AMS and overall symptom severity, the potential for improved convenience and compliance may support day of ascent use.

J	Eklov, P				Eklov, P			Effects of habitat complexity and prey abundance on the spatial and temporal distributions of perch (Perca fluviatilis) and pike (Esox lucius)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Structurally complex environments strongly affect the behaviours and foraging efficiencies of predators and prey. I studied temporal variation in the habitat distribution of perch (Perca fluviatilis) and pike (Esox lucius) in relation to habitat complexity and prey abundance in a lake. The study involved quantitative estimates of different habitat types, estimates of macroinvertebrate prey availability, and distribution and movement patterns of the fish. The numbers of 80-110 mm perch in the littoral zone decreased rapidly in spring, which was a result of either perch moving to the pelagic zone or predation mortality. Predation mortality is the most plausible explanation because piscivorous perch and pike >160 mm aggregated close to these high abundances of 80-110 mm perch, and 80-110 mm perch used only vegetated habitats as a possible protection against predators. Both the biomass and diversity of macroinvertebrates increased with vegetation density, whereas perch abundance was highest in an intermediate vegetation density. Pike size was inversely related to vegetation density as a result of potential cannibalism from the largest pike individuals, which preferred the tree structure habitat. Perch group size decreased with increasing vegetation density, and perch <80 mm always occurred in group sizes larger than three individuals and never occurred in the same groups as perch >160 mm. In contrast, perch >160 mm occurred at decreasing numbers with increasing group size and mainly stayed solitary or in pairs. Perch >160 mm showed no tendencies for homing behaviour and moved actively around the whole lake, whereas pike showed a strong homing behaviour. My study suggests that the structural complexity in the littoral zone can both qualitatively and quantitatively change the interaction between piscivorous predators and their prey.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JUL	1997	54	7					1520	1531		10.1139/cjfas-54-7-1520	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-54-7-1520													WOS:A1997XW70100008
J	Bohanon, A; Crane, K				Bohanon, Allison; Crane, Kelsey			Structural and biological analysis of faults in basalts in Sheepshead Mountains, Oregon as an Earth analogue to Mars	ICARUS												Endoliths and chasmoendoliths, organisms that live in rock fractures, rely on connected open spaces in rocks for fluid and nutrient circulation on Earth and perhaps other planetary bodies. These life forms are not visible from orbit or easily detectable by rover cameras, but the fracture networks and scarp morphologies associated with fracture networks are measurable. We conducted a field analogue study of 92 normal fault scarps in the Sheepshead Mountains, Oregon to examine the correlation between scarp morphology and vegetation growth in the Steens Basalt of the Columbia River Flood Basalts. While vegetation is not expected on Mars or other bodies, the fracture networks that sustain vegetation are the same that would support and protect endoliths. Structural variables measured in the field are: percent of fault scarp that is fault surface and talus surface, scale of columnar jointing, consistency in location of columns, talus size and sorting, fault lengths, distance to hot springs and playa lakes, and strike and dips of fault surfaces, talus surfaces, and flow bedding. Infrared spectra of fault scarps were measured using a handheld multispectral camera and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were calculated from these images in ArcGIS (TM). Statistical analysis of the scarp morphologic parameters indicate that interconnectedness of fractures is key for elevated NDVI and is represented by a range of parameters including bedding strike, talus sorting, and proximity to playas. Results support a model for ideal slopes to investigate for preserved biological activity on Mars.

Recovery of aquatic invertebrate communities as a result of oil decontamination of bottom sediments	UKRAINIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Oil decontamination of water bodies is one of the most complex and time-consuming tasks in the field of liquidation of oil spills. The complexity of cleaning natural water bodies is associated with a dynamic water environment and a variety of oil transformation processes that occur in the water. The most advanced and developed are technologies and methods of collecting oil and oil products from the surface of water bodies. Economically acceptable and well-grounded technologies for oil decontamination of bottom sediments are presented in minimal quantities, and often are not applicable to natural water bodies. The technology for oil decontamination based on flotation has been developed and successfully applied on Lake Shchuch'ye in 2004-2005 and showed a positive result after two summer seasons of work. This article presents the results of aquatic ecosystems recover. as a result of oil decontamination of bottom sediments. The issue of restoration of the aquatic ecosystem as a result of cleaning bottom sediments from oil after a considerable time interval has been studied. A comparison of the quantitative indices and species diversity of the zooplankton of Shchuch'ye Lake from 2004 to 2016 showed a clear tendency of increasing the abundance, biomass and species diversity of total zooplankton and Cladocera in particular. In 2016 the amount of zooplankton species of Shchuch'ye Lake reaches the number of species of the uncontaminated lake, using as a control. It was shown that the macrozoobenthic fauna of Shchuch'ye Lake is poorer in both the number of main ecological groups and in species diversity within certain groups characteristic than in the uncontaminated lake. Some groups were found in both lakes, but the species diversity of Lake Shchuchye was poorer. The exception was a group of leeches, which had a greater variety in Lake Shchuch'ye. The change in the oligochaetene complex to chironomid, both in numbers and in biomass, indicates an improvement in environmental conditions, since chironomids are more sensitive to the quality of the habitat. Chemical analysis of bottom sediments in 2016 revealed that the oil concentration did not exceed 0.9 mg /kg, which indicates the effectiveness of the oil decontamination technology of bottom sediments.

APXS-Derived Compositional Characteristics of Vera Rubin Ridge and Murray Formation, Gale Crater, Mars: Geochemical Implications for the Origin of the Ridge	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS												The resistant similar to 50 m thick Vera Rubin ridge (VRR) situated near the base of Mount Sharp, Gale crater, Mars, has been deemed a high priority science target for the Mars Science Laboratory mission. This is because of (1) its position at the base of the 5 km layered strata of Mount Sharp and (2) the detection of hematite from orbit, indicating that it could be the site of enhanced oxidation. The compositional data acquired by the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) during Curiosity's exploration of VRR help to elucidate questions pertaining to the formation of the ridge. APXS analyses indicate that VRR falls within the compositional range of underlying lacustrine mudstones, consistent with a continuation of that depositional environment and derivation from a similar provenance. Lower Fe concentrations for VRR compared to the underlying strata discounts the addition of large amounts of hematite to the strata, either as cement or as detrital input. Compositional trends are associated with VRR cross-cut stratigraphy, indicating postdepositional processes. Higher Si and Al and lower Ti, Fe, and Mn than the underlying mudstone, particularly within distinct patches of gray/blue bedrock, are consistent with the addition of Si and Al. Lateral and vertical compositional variations suggest enhanced element mobility and fluid flow (possibly via multiple events) through VRR, increasing toward the top of the ridge, consistent with the action of warm (similar to 50-100 degrees C), locally acidic saline fluids as inferred from the mineralogy of drilled samples. Plain Language Summary Curiosity has explored the resistant Vera Rubin ridge (VRR) at the base of Mount Sharp, Gale crater, Mars, owing to (1) its position within the 5 km layered rocks of Mount Sharp, which record changes in Mars environment through time, and (2) the detection of hematite from orbit. The Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) measures the elemental composition of rocks. APXS analyses indicate that VRR has a similar composition to underlying mudstones, consistent with continued deposition in a lake. Lower iron discounts the addition of large amounts of hematite, holding together mineral grains either as cement or as detrital grains. Other elemental trends cut across layering, indicating postdepositional processes. Lateral and vertical compositional variations suggest enhanced element mobility and fluid flow (possibly via multiple events) through VRR, particularly at the top of the ridge and within gray/blue patches of bedrock, consistent with the action of warm (similar to 50-100 degrees C), acidic saline fluids inferred from the mineralogy of drilled samples.

Good quality DMS data with high temporal and spatial resolution are desirable for understanding reduced sulfur biogeochemistry. Here we present a fully automated and novel "microslug" gas-liquid segmented flow-chemiluminescence (MSSF-CL) based method for the continuous in-situ measurement of DMS in natural waters. Samples were collected into a flow tank and DMS transferred from the aqueous phase to the gas phase using a vario-directional coiled flow, in which microvolume liquid and gas slugs were interspersed. The separated DMS was reacted with ozone in a reaction cell for CL detection. The analytical process was automated, with a sample throughput of 6.6 h(-1). Using MSSF for DMS separation was more effective and easily integrated with CL detection compared with the commonly used bubbling approach. Key parameters of the proposed method were investigated. The linear range for the method was 0.05-500 nM (R-2 = 0.9984) and the limit of detection (3 x S/N) was 0.015 nM, which is comparable to the commonly used gas chromatography (GC) method and sensitive enough for direct DMS measurement in typical aquatic environments. Reproducibility and recovery were assessed by spiking natural water samples (river, lake, reservoir and pond) with different concentrations of DMS (10, 20 and 50 nM), giving relative standard deviations (RSDs) <= 1.75% (n = 5) and recoveries of 94.4-107.8%. This fully automated system is reagent free, easy to assemble, simple to use, portable (weight similar to 5.1 kg) and can be left in the field for several hours of unattended operation. The instrumentation can provide high quality DMS data for natural waters with an environmentally relevant temporal resolution of similar to 9 min.

A great number of intra-montane basins formed in the interior of this Late Eocene to Early Oligocene orogen during the Miocene. These basins harbored a suite of long-lived lakes, collectively called the Dinaride Lake System (DLS). Lake Livno, with its 600km(2) of preserved surface, was the second largest of these Dinaride Lakes. At present, its deposits are divided between the Livno and Tomislavgrad basins, which were part of a single basin when Lake Livno first formed. High resolution age constraints for the over 2km basin infill have been lacking up to now, partly due to the endemic nature of its lacustrine fauna. This severely hampered geodynamic as well as paleoenvironmental reconstructions. Here, we present a chronostratigraphy based on radioisotopic and magnetostratigraphic data. 40Ar/39Ar measurements reveal that the Tunica volcanic ash, found in between the Gomphoteriumbearing coal seams at the base of the basin infill, is 17.00 +/- 0.17 Ma old. 40Ar/39Ar dating of the Mandek ash, correlative to the uppermost sedimentary unit, provides an age of 14.68 +/- 0.16 Ma. Correlation of the composite magnetostratigraphy for the main lacustrine depositional phase to the Astronomically Tuned Neogene Time Scale is straightforward and reveals that the majority of the deposits of Lake Livno accumulated between 17 Ma and approximately 13 Ma. The disappearance of Lake Livno is most likely attributable to a change in tectonic regime. Calcarenites and breccias, derived from the basin margins, first entered the lake around 14.8 Ma and subsequently coarsened and thickened upwards. The basin margins were apparently gradually uplifted before subsidence stalled. Comparison with chronostratigraphic data for other constituents of the DLS leads to the conclusion that their lifetimes largely coincide. Finally, we calibrate the most important marker fossils of the various Dinaride basins to the geological time scale and we present a new biochronological scheme for the DLS.					; Hrvatović, Hazim/AAN-8089-2021	Hrvatovic, Hazim/0000-0002-6971-3610; Mandic, Oleg/0000-0003-1955-7514; Krijgsman, Wout/0000-0002-1472-1074													1547-139X	2331-656X					2011	8	1					29	43																WOS:000295566300003
J	Gillon, D; Houssard, C; Joffre, R				Gillon, D; Houssard, C; Joffre, R			Using near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy to predict carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus content in heterogeneous plant material	OECOLOGIA												The aim of this study was to produce calibration equations between near-infrared reflectance (NIR) spectra and the concentrations of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in heterogeneous material: from living needles to litter in Pinus halepensis stands subjected to prescribed burnings. The aim was to determine whether calibrations should be conducted within each stage in the transformation of needles (local calibrations), giving relationships that were accurate but valid only for each particular stage, or whether it was possible to integrate the various forms of variation in needles (global calibrations) while retaining an acceptable accuracy. A principal component analysis calculated from the sample spectral data was used to distinguish three different sets, each sharing spectral characteristics and corresponding to three categories of needle: needles collected on the pines (N), falling needles (F), and litter (L), and each containing samples collected from the burnt sites and a control site. Samples representative of all the forms of variation in spectral properties were selected from within each category and their carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations were measured using standard wet chemistry methods; these constituted the calibration sets n, f, and l. Calibrations were produced between the nutrient concentrations and the NIR spectra of the calibration sets n, f, and 1 and the grouped sets (n + f, f + 1, n + f + 1). The results of local calibrations made from each individual category showed that the carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations were accurately predictable by NIR spectra. The global calibrations made by lumping together several categories were valid for a wider range of concentrations and for spectrally heterogeneous materials and in most cases were just as accurate as the local calibrations produced from each individual category.

Continental arc magmatism along the southeast Hearne Craton margin in Saskatchewan, Canada: Comparison of the 1.92-1.91 Ga Porter Bay Complex and the 1.86-1.85 Ga Wathaman Batholith	PRECAMBRIAN RESEARCH												Detailed mapping, coupled with geochronological and geochemical investigations, has revealed the presence of a 1917-1913 Ma gabbro-monzodiorite-monzonite suite along the southeast margin of the Hearne Craton in northern Saskatchewan, Canada. The predominantly plutonic suite is also characterised by 1915 Ma old trachyandesitic subvolcanic and volcaniclastic inclusions. The rocks are hornblende-epidote-titanite +/- augite bearing and collectively termed the Porter Bay Complex. The plutonic rocks cut the 2569 Ma Lueaza River granitoid suite, a component of the Hearne Craton and are themselves intruded by 1859 Ma pegmatitic diorite, 1856 Ma layered gabbro-anorthosite, and 1853 Ma quartz-diorite belonging to the Wathaman Batholith, one of the world's largest Paleoproterozoic Andeantype continental arcs. Wholerock major element geochemistry characterises the Porter Bay Complex as calc-alkalic to alkali-calcic, metaluminous and variable from ferroan to magnesian. Trace element concentrations are characterised by negative high field strength element anomalies, suggesting emplacement along a destructive plate margin. The geochemical signatures of the Wathaman Batholith and the Porter Bay Complex are largely identical. The geographic location, map relationships, and geochronological, geochemical and petrographic constraints are consistent with the Porter Bay Complex having formed in a subduction-related continental arc setting. The southeastern margin of the Hearne Craton was therefore a long-lived active continental margin with two separate periods of continental arc magmatism between 1.92-1.91 Ga and 1.86-1.85 Ga.

Controlling factors for the spatial variability of soil magnetic susceptibility across England and Wales	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												We review the nature and importance of soil factors implicated in the formation of secondary ferrimagnetic minerals in soils and palaeosols worldwide. The findings are examined with respect to temperate regions through a comprehensive analysis of over 5000 samples of surface soil from England and Wales taken from a 5 x 5 km grid. Over 30 soil and environmental attributes are considered for each sample as proxies for soil forming factors. Measurements of low field magnetic susceptibility (mass specific) and frequency dependent susceptibility (mass specific and percentage) on each sample provide estimates of the concentration and grain size of ferrimagnetic minerals. Maps of soil magnetism across England and Wales show non-random distributions and clusters. One subset of data is clearly linked to contamination from atmospheric pollution, and excluded from subsequent analyses. The concentration of ferrimagnetic minerals in the non-polluted set is broadly proportional to the concentration of minerals falling into the viscous superparamagnetic domain size range (similar to 15-25 nm). This set shows clusters of high magnetic concentrations particularly over specific parent materials such as schists and slates, mudstones and limestones. Bivariate analyses and linear multiple regression models show that the main controlling factors are parent material and drainage, the latter represented by soil drainage classes and particle size. Together these two factors account for similar to 30% of the magnetic variability in the complete dataset. A second group of factors, including climate (mean annual rainfall), relief (slope and altitude), and organisms (land use, organic carbon and pH) have subordinate control. Climate, as represented by mean annual temperature, and also pedogenic time are deemed not relevant at these spatio-temporal scales. The findings are consistent with a largely abiotic system where the role of iron-reducing bacteria appears minor. At coarse spatial and temporal scales, secondary ferrimagnetic mineral formation is controlled by the weathering capacity to supply Fe to the surface soil. At finer scales, soluble Fe precipitates as ferrihydrite before transformation in response to periodically anaerobic conditions into other minerals including nanoscale magnetite.

In accordance with this purpose, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved substance (TDS) and dissolved oxygen (DO) parameters were measured in situ at two-month intervals from the branches feeding the dam lake and the dam lake. Main anions and cations, nutrient parameters (such as nitrate, nitrite), inorganic pollution, bacteriological parameters and trace metals were analyzed in the samples taken from the designated points. It has been determined that the pH value of the waters in the basin is between 6.60 and 8.78 and the EC value is between 42 - 134 mu S/cm. The DO value varies seasonally depending on the water temperature in the side branches. It varies between 8.11-9.36 mg/L in the dam lake. The waters in the basin are in the water class with Ca-HCO3 in terms of main anion cations. Nitrate values vary between 0.7-12.74 mg/L, and nitrite values vary between 0.01-0.07 mg/L. When the analysis results of the samples taken from the side branches and the mainstream in the Atasu Dam reservoir basin were evaluated according to the Water Pollution Control Regulation (2008), it was determined that the waters were of Class I Water Quality in terms of general conditions and oxygenation parameters (DO and COD). According to the NH(4)(+)value, one of the Nutrient Element Parameters, the waters outside the dam lake are class I, and the waters of the dam lake are class II in summer. class is water type. In terms of. NO2-, NO3- and total phosphorus, it is in II. and III. class is water type. It was determined that trace elements were class I in terms of parameters other than Cu and Ni. Trace element concentrations vary between rainy and dry periods. These differences tend to decrease during the rainy season for many elements. Water quality is rated as excellent at every point in the basin, with water quality (WQI) values between 95.45 and 96.56.

However, high-altitude clay mineral indications and long-term and orbital variations have not been fully explored. Herein, we present an 800-ka clay-mineral record from a lacustrine sediment core (ZB13-C2) from the Zoige Basin on the eastern Tibetan Plateau (TP). X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy were used to identify the clay mineral assemblages and their micro-morphological characteristics of core ZB13-C2. The results revealed that the clay minerals in core ZB13-C2 are mainly illite, with small amounts of chlorite, kaolinite, and smectite (including irregular mixed-layers of illite-smectite (I/S) and chlorite-smectite (C/S)). The clay mineral assemblages and proxies exhibit three stages of change, which are mainly controlled by the Zoige watershed range under different climate conditions. The watershed was limited to the southeastern region with altitudes ranging from similar to 3500 to similar to 4200 meters above sea level (m a.s.l.), and glacial-interglacial hydraulic erosion controlled the input of bedrock debris during 800-621 ka BP. It expanded to higher altitudes (similar to 1200 to similar to 4700 m a.s.l.) due to stronger seasonal freeze-thaw weathering without significant glacial-interglacial variations under a cooling and drying climate during 621-100 ka BP. Finally, it expanded to its highest altitudes of similar to 4700 to similar to 5200 m a.s.l. northwest of the watershed after 100 ka BP, and hydraulic erosion increased obviously under a warm climate of the interstadial MIS 3 on the TP. The watershed underwent two major expansions under different climatic conditions at similar to 621 ka and 100 ka BP, with the wet/dry alternation became strong at similar to 621 ka BP. These results reveal that long-term temperature changes and the wet/dry alternation at high altitudes controlled the watershed range and degree of the physical erosion, and that the indications of clay minerals should be carefully clarified before they are used as climate indicators, especially on the TP.

A-5000 year multiproxy record of summer climate in NE Greenland	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The High Arctic plays a vital role in Earth's climate system, and its ecosystems are highly sensitive to global climate change. High Arctic lakes are valuable sentinels of climate change, as their sediments integrate long-term natural climatic fluctuations and anthropogenic influences. Here, we present a high-resolution -5000 yearreconstruction of NE Greenland climate variability from Aucella Lake (74 degrees N, 20 degrees E) based on physical, chemical, and biological properties of lake sediments. We use CT-scans, hyperspectral imaging, organic matter, XRD, and diatom analyses to show that changing air temperatures were controlled by a mix of regional climatic changes and local landscape feedbacks. The latest Mid-Holocene (-5.0-3.8 cal. ka BP) was characterized by relatively warmer conditions, while the onset of the Late-Holocene was marked by abrupt temperature decreases that coincided with the beginning of glacial advances elsewhere (-3.8-3.4 cal. ka BP). From -3.4-2.4 cal. ka BP, the sedimentary record indicated progressive warming, with temperature peaking during the Medieval Climate Anomaly, although temperature rises were punctuated by abrupt, short-lived cold periods. From -1.1-0.05 cal. ka BP, the influence of landscape factors over the system diminished. Sedimentary indicators suggested a transition towards a colder, more humid climate, coinciding with the beginning of the Little Ice Age, that was characterized by a marked decrease in air temperature that reached minimum values at the end of this period. The last 50 years at Aucella Lake were marked by abrupt temperature rises, consistent with recently observed anthropogenic global warming. Our results illustrate the importance of high-resolution multiproxy studies for accurately characterizing lake linkages to their environment and climate.

J	Tremblay, J; Bégin, Y				Tremblay, J; Bégin, Y			The effects of snow packing on tree growth forms on an island in a recently created reservoir in northern Quebec, Canada	ECOSCIENCE												This study aims at determining the dendrochronological indicators of a changing snow accumulation regime on an island of a recently created reservoir in northern Quebec. Reservoir Robert-Bourassa (LG-2) is a vast lake (2,835 km(2)) covered by ice from mid-December to mid-May. Snow drifts across the frozen lake until it is trapped by obstacles on islands and at reservoir margins. Pre-established trees on the islands are negatively affected by the local augmentation of snow accumulation. Changes in tree growth forms of a severely exposed forested island indicate that damage occurred soon after reservoir filling. At the island edges, the decay of trees increases the wind exposure of border trees, causing massive foliage loss, thus reducing tree growth. Beyond the edge, in the island interior, drifted snow accumulates due to the wind breaking effect of the shoreline trees. Since reservoir filling, incidents of stem breakage, shoot bending and tilting, and branch tearing have increased due to snow packing. Such anomalous growth features appeared during the first 3 y after reservoir filling. Tree rings also indicate the trauma of wind and cold exposure stress. Such stress results in the incomplete formation of annual rings and the development of a series of resin ducts. The amount of snow packing damage to trees depends on the abundance of snowfall and on winter levels of the reservoir. The combination of these two factors controls the amount of snow reaching the island forests when drifted by the wind.																			1195-6860	2376-7626					2005	12	4					530	539		10.2980/i1195-6860-12-4-530.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2980/i1195-6860-12-4-530.1													WOS:000234582000010

Oceanic passage of hurricanes across Cay Sal Bank in The Bahamas over the last 530 years	MARINE GEOLOGY												Islands across the Bahamian Archipelago have been devastated by five major hurricanes from 2010 to 2020 CE, including Category 5 Hurricane Dorian in 2019 that inundated parts of Abaco and Grand Bahama with up to 4 m of surge, killing 84 people and leaving >245 others missing. Up to 1 m relative sea-level rise is estimated for The Bahamas by 2100 CE, which could enhance flooding from weaker storms (<Category 3) in low-lying coastal areas. Problematically, Bahamian hurricane activity is highly spatially-heterogenous over the last 170 years, meaning that long-term regional hurricane frequency remains poorly constrained, especially for weaker Category 1-2 events that are less-likely to be detected by most sediment-based paleo-hurricane reconstructions. We present a 530-year record of hurricane passage from Hine's Blue Hole on Cay Sal Bank, The Bahamas. Hine's Hole has an accumulation rate of 2-3.2 cm/yr, making it among the highest-resolution hurricane reconstructions to date. Unlike many paleo-hurricane reconstruction sites, Hine's Hole is not surrounded by coastal landmasses that can dampen currents and waves produced by hurricanes, so it archives most >= Category 1 hurricanes passing within 115 km during the 170-year instrumental record (1850 CE-present) and may also document intense tropical or winter storms. Hine's Hole archives similar to 16 intense storms per century from 1850 to 2016 CE, but documents three periods from 1505 to 1530 CE, 1570 to 1620 CE, and similar to 1710 to 1875 CE with over twice as many intense storms per century. These active periods correspond to other high-resolution reconstructions from the Bahamian Archipelago and Florida Keys, but the magnitude of the increase is much higher given that Hine's Hole archives evidence of weaker and more distal storms. As such, this reconstruction provides unprecedented insight into changes in hurricane activity within the pre-industrial climate system and demonstrates that recurrence intervals based on the 170-year instrumental record can severely underestimate the threat hurricanes pose certain localities.

J	Odland, A				Odland, Arvid			Variation in plant cover and flower production of Carex rostrata and C. vesicaria within a freshwater littoral zone. A 14-year time course	PHYTOCOENOLOGIA												Aims: The main aim has been to quantify long-time variation in plant cover of Phalaris arundinacea, Carex rostrata and C. vesicaria, and number of Carex flowering shoots in plots situated along a littoral elevation gradient. Study area: The study area lies on the outer edge of a freshwater fluvial delta in the northern part of Myrkdalen Lake (229 m a.s.l.), W Norway (60 degrees 40" N, 6 degrees 28" E). The lake summer water level was in 1987 permanently lowered by 1.4 m exposing a stretch of ca. 40 m of the sediments. Methods: A transect was randomly selected on the exposed sediments perpendicular to the new shoreline, and continuous sample plots were permanently marked. Species percentage cover and number of Carex flowering shoots were counted in twenty-six 1 x 0.5 m plots and repeated 14 times from 1993 until 2020. The species data were related to variation in elevation, water level and temperature. Results: Plant percentage cover in the permanent study plots varied strongly during the investigation period. Relationships between species cover and the environmental variables were, however, not statistically significant. C. vesicaria and C. rostrata showed major variation in flower production both in relation to elevation and with time. C. vesicaria flower production increased significantly in years with elevated temperature and decreased in years with high water level. C. rostrata produced less flowers than C. vesicaria, except during the first study years. The variation in C. rostrata flower production was not significantly related to changes in water level or temperature, but the production increased with its cover and was reduced with increased P. arundinacea cover. Mean temperature and water level of the two last years explained the variation in mean number of flowering shoots best.

The Late Cretaceous (86-81 Ma) ignimbrites from the Kholchan and Ola suites were sampled at 19 sites in the Magadan area (60.4 degrees N, 151.0 degrees E). We isolated the characteristic paleomagnetic directions from 16 sampled sites using an alternating field demagnetization procedure. The primary nature of these directions is ascertained by dual polarities and positive fold tests. A tilt-corrected mean direction (D = 42.8 degrees, I = 84.7 degrees, k = 46.0, alpha(95) = 10.0 degrees) yields a paleomagnetic pole of 66.7 degrees N, 168.5 degrees E (A(95) = 18.8 degrees) which appears almost identical to the 90-67 Ma pole reported from the Lake El'gygytgyn area of the Okhotsk-Chukotka Volcanic Belt (Chukotka Terrane). This consistency suggests that the Kolyma-Omolon Composite Terrane and Chukotka Terrane has acted as a single tectonic unit since 80 Ma without any significant internal deformation. Accordingly, we calculate a combined 80 Ma characteristic paleomagnetic pole (Long. = 164.7 degrees E, Lat. = 68.0 degrees, A(95) = 10.9 degrees, N = 12) for the Kolyma-Omolon-Chukotka Block which falls 16.5-17.5 degrees south of the same age poles from Europe and East Asia. We ascribe this discrepancy in pole positions to tectonic activity in the area and infer a southward displacement of 1640 +/- 1380 km for the Kolyma-Omolon-Chukotka Block with respect to the North American and Eurasian blocks since 80 Ma; more than 260 km of it is attributed to tectonic displacement in the Arctic Ocean due to the opening of the Canadian Basin.

Located in the central-western region of Mexico, the basin is bounded by active faulting, subsidence, and hydrothermal activity along its margins. The study describes groundwater flow patterns, water types, water-rock interaction processes, and their relationship with geological faults traversed by the groundwater. Between 2022 and 2023, water quality was analyzed at 44 deep wells and seven springs. In situ measurements of physicochemical parameters were taken, and the concentrations of major and minor ions were plotted on D'Amore, Mifflin, and Piper diagrams. Seven hydrogeological environments were identified through which groundwater flows, promoting the weathering of Ca-Na-Mg silicates. Geological faults are directly related to flow directions, predominantly southwest-northeast. The primary recharge areas are located in the southwestern sector, where basic silicate rocks are dominant, leading to elevated Mg2+ concentrations due to feldspar leaching. The predominant hydrogeochemical processes include silicate rock weathering, ion exchange, carbonation, water mixing, calcite precipitation, and gypsum dissolution. Three groundwater flow systems were identified: 82% of the flow is local, distributed throughout the basin; 16% is intermediate flow, concentrated in the central and northern areas; and 2% is deep circulation flow, found along the southern margin of the lake.

Phthalates in the Snow Cover of the Selenga River Basin: Content, Sources, and Spatial Distribution	DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES												The content and spatial distribution of six priority phthalates in the snow cover of the city of Ulan-Ude were studied for the first time. Ulan-Ude is located in the basin of the Selenga River, the main tributary of Lake Baikal. Snow samples were collected before the spring melting at 17 points located in the floodplains of the Selenga and Uda rivers and in the zones affected by various pollution sources. The snow water was analyzed by the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. The analysis showed that the total content of phthalates varied from 0.76 to 9.09 mu g/L. Dibutyl phthalate, di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, and diethyl phthalate are dominant compounds. The obtained results on the distribution of phthalates in the snow cover within the urban agglomeration showed a slightly different dynamic of the accumulation from the previously studied pollutants. The highest contents were revealed in places with a high transport load in the zones of solid waste landfills characterized by natural depressions in the relief. Although the level of air pollution in Ulan-Ude is assessed as very high, the content of phthalates in the snow cover is significantly lower than that noted in other cities. Analysis of the phthalate content in the snow cover in Ulan-Ude is important for assessing the contribution of atmospheric sources to water pollution.

J	Ohlwein, C; Wahl, ER				Ohlwein, Christian; Wahl, Eugene R.			Review of probabilistic pollen-climate transfer methods	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Pollen-climate transfer methods are reviewed from a Bayesian perspective and with a special focus on the formulation of uncertainties. This approach is motivated by recent developments of spatial multiproxy Bayesian hierarchical models (BHM), which allow synthesizing local reconstructions from different proxies for a spatially complete picture of past climate. In order to enhance the pollen realism in these models we try to bridge the gap between spatial statistics and paleoclimatology and show how far classical pollen-climate transfer concepts such as regression methods, mutual climatic range, modern analogues, plant functional types, and biomes can be understood in novel ways by refining the data models used in BHMs. As a case study, we discuss modeling of uncertainty by introducing a new probabilistic pollen ratio model, which is a simplified variation of the modern analogue technique (MAT) including the concept of response surfaces and designed for later inclusion in a spatial multiproxy BHM. Applications to fossil pollen data from varved sediments in three nearby lakes in west-central Wisconsin, USA and for a Holocene fossil pollen record from southern California, USA provide local climate reconstructions of summer temperature for the past millennium and the Holocene respectively. The performance of the probabilistic model is generally similar in comparison to MAT-derived reconstructions using the same data. Furthermore, the combination of co-location and precise dating for the three fossil sites in Wisconsin allows us to study the issue of site-specific uncertainty and to test the assumption of ergodicity in a real-world example. A multivariate ensemble kernel dressing approach derived from the post-processing of climate simulations reveals that the overall interpretation based on the individual reconstructions remains essentially unchanged, but the single-site reconstructions underestimate the overall uncertainty.

The multi-proxy study (i.e., pollen, macrofossils, mineral magnetic measurements, total carbon, nitrogen and sulphur) is chronologically constrained by AMS C-14 measurements. Lake Nero provided the longest sedimentary record back to ca. 15,000 cal yr BP, while sediment accumulation began around ca. 11,000 cal yr BP in the two other lakes, possibly due to melting of permafrost. Limnic plant macrofossil remains suggest increased lake productivity and higher mean summer temperatures after 14,500 cal yr BP. While the late glacial vegetation was dominated by Betula and Salix shrubs and various herbs, it appears that Betula sect. Albae became established as early as 14,000 cal yr BP. Major hydrological changes in the region led to distinctly lower lake levels, starting 13,000 cal yr BP in Lake Nero and ca. 9000 cal yr BP in lakes Chashnitsy and Zaozer'e, which are situated at higher elevations. These changes resulted in sedimentary hiatuses in all three lakes that lasted 3500-4500 cal yr. Mixed broad-leaved - coniferous forests were widespread in the area between 8200 and 6100 cal yr BP and developed into dense, species-rich forests between 6100 and 2500 cal yr BP, during what was likely the warmest interval of the studied sequences. Agricultural activity is documented since 500 cal yr BP, but probably began earlier, since Rostov was a major capital by 862 A.D. This apparent gap may be caused by additional sedimentary hiatuses around 2500 and 500 cal yr BP.					; Bennike, Ole/G-7070-2018; Tarasov, Pavel/ABG-3993-2020; Subetto, Dmitry/A-4467-2014; Lacourse, Terri/G-5647-2012	Lacourse, Terri/0000-0002-7559-5374; /0000-0002-7219-5009; Bennike, Ole/0000-0002-5486-9946; Subetto, Dmitry/0000-0002-3585-8598; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				APR	2006	35	3					543	569		10.1007/s10933-005-3240-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-005-3240-4													WOS:000236090300007

Haemoparasite prevalence and Theileria parva strain diversity in Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer) in Uganda	VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY												Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer) are considered to be an important reservoir for various tick-borne haemoparasites of veterinary importance. In this study we have compared the haemoparasite carrier prevalence in buffalo from four geographically isolated national parks in Uganda [Lake Mburo National Park (LMNP), Queen Elizabeth National Park (QENP), Murchison Falls National Park (MFNP) and Kidepo Valley National Park (KVNP)]. Differences were seen in haemoparasite prevalence in buffalo from the four national parks. All the buffalo sampled in LMNP were carriers of Theileria parva however, buffalo from MFNP and KVNP, which are both located in the north of Uganda, were negative for T. parva. Interestingly, 95% of buffalo in the northern part of QENP were T. parva positive, however all buffalo sampled in the south of the park were negative. A high multiplicity of infection was recorded in all the buffalo found to be carrying T. parva, with evidence of at least nine parasite genotypes in some animals. Most of the buffalo sampled in all four national parks were carriers of T. mutans and T. velifera, however none were carriers of T. taurotragi, Babesia bovis, Babesia bigemina, Ehrlichia bovis or Ehrlichia ruminantium. All the buffalo sampled from LMNP were positive for T. buffeli and T. sp. (buffalo) however, buffalo from the parks in the north of the country (KVNP and MFNP) were negative for these haemoparasites. Anaplasma centrale and Ana plasma marginale were circulating in buffalo from all four national parks. T. parva gene pools from two geographically separated populations of buffalo in two of the national parks in Uganda (LMNP and QENP) were compared. The T. parva populations in the two national parks were distinct, indicating that there was limited gene flow between the populations. The results presented highlight the complexity of tick-borne pathogen infections in buffalo and the significant role that buffalo may play as reservoir hosts for veterinary haemoparasites that have the potential to cause severe disease in domestic cattle.

DNA analysis of these strains showed an interspecies level of DNA similarity of 96-100%. Strain Z-79820 was selected for further investigations. Cells were Gram-positive, asporogenous, nonmotile short rods with pointed ends. The strain was a true alkaliphile: growth occurred from pH 7.2 to 10.2 with the optimum at pH 9.0. Strain Z-79820 was halotolerant and could grow in medium with up to 10% (w/v) NaCl, with the optimum between 0 and 4% NaCl. The new isolate obligately depended on Na+ ions in the form of carbonates or chlorides. Total Na+ content needed for optimal growth was 0.46 M Na+, with a wide range from 0.023-0.9 M Na+ at which growth also occurred. The isolate was a mesophile and grew at temperatures from 6 to 50degreesC (slow growth at 6 and 15degreesC) with an optimum at 35degreesC. The organotrophic organism fermented ribose, xylose, glucose, mannose, fructose, sucrose, mannitol, and peptone. The products of glucose fermentation were acetate, ethanol, formate, H-2, and CO2. Yeast extract was required for some anabolic needs. The DNA G+C content of the type strain Z-79820 was 42.1 mol%. The new bacterium fell into the 16S rRNA gene cluster XV of the Gram-positive bacteria with low G+C content, where it formed an individual branch. Based on its growth characteristics and genotype traits, we propose the new genus and species named Alkalibacter saccharofermentans with the type strain Z-79820 (=DSM14828), Uniqem-218 (Institute Microbiology, RAS; http://inmi.da.ru).																			1431-0651	1433-4909				AUG	2004	8	4					309	316		10.1007/s00792-004-0390-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00792-004-0390-7								15127306					WOS:000223264300006

These OF/sperm interaction mechanisms are frequently species-specific and/or population-specific and could decrease the risk of genetic introgression of wild populations from introduced or escaped zootechnical individuals. The Mediterranean brown trout (Salmo cettii) is threatened by genetic introgression with strains of domestic brown trout (Salmo trutta) that were introduced for recreational purposes. The aim of our study was to test if native S. cettii females, rather than zootechnical S. trutta, produce OF with a greater ability to upregulate the sperm motility of conspecific males. Thus, we compared the sperm swimming performances of males inhabiting the Biferno River (Molise region-Southern Italy) activated in native S. cettii vs. zootechnical S. trutta female's OFs. In our study, native females' OFs (20% diluted), compared to spring water, has the ability to significantly boost the sperm performance of the autochthonous males, while zootechnical S. trutta fails. These preliminary results suggest that OF-sperm interactions could potentially influence or direct the hybridization mechanisms involving the native Mediterranean trout inhabiting the Biferno River and the domestic lineage of brown trout introduced in the past.

J	WINSPEAR, NR; PYE, K				WINSPEAR, NR; PYE, K			SAND SUPPLY TO THE ALGODONES DUNEFIELD, SOUTH-EASTERN CALIFORNIA, USA	SEDIMENTOLOGY												In an effort to gain a better understanding of the relationship between climate, sand supply and aeolian sand deposition, an investigation was undertaken in the Algodones dunefield of south-eastern California to determine: (1) the source of the sand and (2) the mode of sand supply to the Algodones dunefield. Textural, geochemical and mineralogical analyses show that the dune sands were mainly derived from Colorado River sands during episodes when the Colorado River drained west to the Salton Basin instead of south to the Gulf of California. A model is presented which relates episodic aeolian deposition in the Algodones dunefield to the growth of the resulting lake under a persistent, intense north-westerly wind regime and to subsequent desiccation of the lake following diversion of the Colorado River to the Gulf of California. Late Holocene radiocarbon ages for relict lake shoreline deposits correlate with documented episodes of extreme flooding and increased winter storminess across the south-western United States. These conditions are likely to have been the cause of intensified north-westerly winds which coincided with high stands of Lake Cahuilla. Although diversion of the Colorado River to the Salton Basin occurred at least three times during the late Holocene, it is evident that the river did not change its course in response to the majority of the floods. It appears that the critical control on diversion of the river was the difference in gradient between courses leading to the Salton Basin and Gulf of California, which in turn was influenced by fluvial deposition and tectonic activity. Flooding was able to cause diversion of the Colorado River to the Salton Basin only when the difference in gradient between the two courses was relatively small.																			0037-0746					DEC	1995	42	6					875	891		10.1111/j.1365-3091.1995.tb00415.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3091.1995.tb00415.x													WOS:A1995TJ83100004

ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Antarctic studies have indicated that during summer, ice-free areas experience greater temperatures than those along the glacial boundaries. This allows for the availability of liquid water and thus influences the biogeochemical processes of Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems. In this study we explore whether the patterns of soil phosphorus cycling differ between the glacial boundary and ice-free areas. To do so, we chose two sites on the Fildes Peninsula in Antarctica, one at the boundary of the Collins Glacier and another within an ice-free area close to Lake Uruguay. In each location, we determined soil phosphorus distribution, iron and aluminum fractions, soil mineralogy, alkaline phosphatase activity, and fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis. The results showed that soils of the ice-free area had a greater content of phosphorus sorbed on iron/aluminum oxyhydroxides and occluded forms. An opposite pattern was obtained for the calcium-bound phosphorus pool. Accordingly, soil samples from the ice-free area showed the greatest levels of iron/ aluminum oxyhydroxides and the presence of secondary minerals such as hematite and the intergrade chlorite-vermiculite-montmorillonite Alkaline phosphatase activity and the fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis were also favored at the ice-free area. The overall results suggest that the less extreme microclimatic conditions and the presence of liquid water in the ice-free area promote the biogeochemical cycling of soil phosphorus. In a context of climate warming this study may contribute to the comprehension of how the expansion of the ice-free areas due to glacial retreat influences biogeochemical cycling of essential nutrients in the Antarctic Peninsula.

The different locations of the sampling sites allowed both plume-affected samples (hereafter referred to as "fumigated samples") and samples representative of the local background to be collected. The chemical composition of the local background reflects the peculiar geographic features of the area, being influenced by biomass burning, geogenic dust, and biological activity. Conversely, fumigated samples contain large amounts of volcanogenic elements that can be clearly distinguished from the local background. These elements are released into the atmosphere from the persistently boiling lava lake of the Nyiragongo crater and from the neonate lava lake of Nyamulagira. These emissions result in a volcanic plume that includes solid particles, acidic droplets, and gaseous species. The chemical signature of the volcanic emissions appears in falling raindrops as they interact with the plume. HCl and HBr readily dissolve in water, and so their ratio in rain samples reflects that of the volcanic plume. The transport of HF is mediated by the large amount of silicate particles generated at the magma-air interface. SO2 is partially converted into SO42- that dissolves in water. The refractory elements dissolved in rain samples derive from the dissolution of silicate particles, and most of them (Al, Mg, Ca, and Sr) are present at exactly the same molar ratios as in the rocks. In contrast, elements such as Na, K, Rb, Cu, and Pb are enriched relative to the whole-rock composition, suggesting that they are volatilized during magma degassing. After correcting for the dissolution of silicate particles, we can define that the volatility of the elements decreases in the following order: Pb >> Rb > K > Na. This finding, which is the first for a volcanic plume, is consistent with previous measurements in high-temperature fumaroles at other volcanic areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Frayn, A				Frayn, Andrew			'On the Perimeter and Fringe of War': Norman Nicholson, Rural Modernity and Wartime	MODERNIST CULTURES												The author Norman Nicholson is an exemplary writer of rural modernity, acutely conscious of the need for rural areas to remain 'living and organic communities', as he puts it in his topographic book Greater Lakeland (1969). Here I argue that his position in his lifetime home of Millom, an industrial town on the periphery of the tourist Lake District, gives his writing a unique, revisionary perspective on both modern/ist and war poetry: he is a noncombatant rural poet who focuses not on contested ground overseas, but on the rural and wartime industry on the north-western English coast. Born in 1914, his life was profoundly shaped by war, and while not often considered in these terms, he was inspired by modernist poetry, particularly that of his editor at and fringe of war' ('Waiting for Spring, 1943') during the Second World War, engaging with his editing, periodical contributions, and early poetry up to and including his debut collection Five Rivers (1944), enables us to see the multiple ways that the traces of war in his poetry have previously gone unrecognised, displaced, by the widely-theorised struggle of both combatants and civilians to articulate the experience of war, into dates, locations, events and depictions of the body. I conclude by examining Nicholson's response to war after the Second World War, and commenting on the implications for more general theories of wartime.																			2041-1022	1753-8629				FEB	2024	19	1					128	151		10.3366/mod.2024.0421	http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/mod.2024.0421													WOS:001334581200007

Impacts of Endothall Applications on Largemouth Bass Spawning Behavior and Reproductive Success	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Aquatic herbicides are commonly used to control excessive and nuisance levels of submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV). At times, these applications tend to be more effective at the onset of fish spawning in spring: however, they can cause conflicts between anglers and lake management personnel assigned to control excessive SAV. We evaluated the direct application of an aquatic herbicide (Aquathol K [dipotassium salt of endothall]) on the nest behavior and fidelity of largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides and measured the subsequent reproductive success of these fish. Endothall was applied to achieve a shoreline concentration of 5 mg/L of water volume in 0.1-ha ponds (3 mg/L whole-pond concentration). It was applied directly on nests in three ponds in March 2005, 2006, and 2007 when largemouth bass initiated spawning; spawning activity was monitored over 14-15 d. Using similar techniques, we applied water to another three ponds where largemouth bass were nesting. For all 3 years, endothall did not affect nest guarding by largemouth bass, and nest fidelity was similar to that for ponds treated with water. Endothall concentrations declined about sevenfold over 21 d but persisted in the water during spawning. Electrofishing of young largemouth bass 2-3 months after spawning showed that their relative abundance and size were similar among the ponds treated with endothall and the control ponds. Similarly, the density and biomass of age-0 largemouth bass did not vary between treatments for fish killed with rotenone in late August each year. Managers can use these results to address angler concerns about endothall application during largemouth bass spawning and thereby lessen conflicts over efforts to control excessive SAV.					; Sammons, Steve/KHW-1491-2024	Sammons, Steve/0000-0002-7814-6400; 													0275-5947	1548-8675				DEC	2008	28	6					1812	1817		10.1577/M08-041.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M08-041.1													WOS:000268504700016

A nominal concentration of 0.1 mg/l was used during each application. Compared to single atrazine applications, this multiple treatment was characterized by a more gradual killing of the phytoplankton, a longer period of recovery for the green algal community, and a distinct shift in the taxonomic composition of the affected communities. Thirteen days after the first application significant declines in the populations of Elakatothrix gelatinosa, Sphaerocystis schroeteri, Tetraedron minimum, Oocystis lacustris, and Gymnodinium spp. were observed. Low numbers persisted after the second application and remained lower for 114 days. Populations of Rhodomonas minuta increased significantly on day 13, whereas those of Cryptomonas erosa were not influenced by the herbicide. On average there was a reduction from 22 to 16 prominent phytoplankton taxa after atrazine exposure. The similarity between phytoplankton communities in control and atrazine-exposed enclosures, as measured by the Morisita coefficient of association, was distinctly altered after the second atrazine application. This dissimilarity persisted for 77 days. In the spring of 1984, 323 days after the first atrazine application, the control and atrazine exposed enclosures had returned to similar phytoplankton assemblages. The rotifer community was not significantly affected. Two crustaceans, Bosmina longirostris, and Diaptomus oregonensis had significant short term reductions in numbers after the second application. These reductions were not observed after the first atrazine applications and it is suggested that their decline is a secondary effect caused by changes in other populations within the community.					; Solomon, Keith/AAF-4510-2020	Solomon, Keith R/0000-0002-8496-6413; 													0166-445X	1879-1514				OCT	1988	13	2					123	139		10.1016/0166-445X(88)90038-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0166-445X(88)90038-0													WOS:A1988R424500003

The first instar larva (4.5-6.5 days) is metapneustic and the 2nd instar (6.5-9.5 days) is amphipneustic. The third instar has a pair of Fan-like anterior spiracles with 18-20 digits each and a pair of posterior spiracles with 5-8 pores, each arranged in 2 rows. Pupariation takes place between the 12.5th and 15th day. During sclerotization and melanization firstly blackish "V" shape stripes develop on the ventral puparial side which enlarge later and merge to a wide black spot, but the dorsal side remains usually yellowish and transparent. Pupal moult occurs within the puparial shell 2-3 days after the white pre-puparial phase, After. 4 days, the imaginal transformation lakes place. After a further 5 days, the pharate phase adult with white eyes turns to the orange eye phase. The following day, the red eye phase occurs. The next day bristle formation takes place: wings and bristles are greyish, later turn to black. During the following 1-2 days, the procuticle phase adult emerges. Adults are not attracted to either young; or old spring barley plants, but look for a sheltered, humid place. A very long imaginal aestivation and hibernation period starts, which is a very uncommon overwintering strategy among agromyzid flies.

The cylinder will be forced to oscillate in a certain mode, in response to an incident wave train. If properly "tuned", the cylinder can absorb a considerable fraction of the incident wave energy. Utilization of this concept may provide a number of potential benefits including; I)a no loss to fish habitat; 2) a depth-independent materials cost; 3) a scheme easily adaptable to long term water level changes (such as those which occur naturally in the Great Lakes and those which are anticipated with sea level rise); and 4) the capability of adequately protecting a coastal area while maintaining boat access and water circulation. Knowledge of these devices however, is currently limited to performance in; 1) regular wave trains of narrow frequency bands, 2) zero angle of incidence between the wave crest and the structure, and 3) waves of small amplitude. Research evaluating the performance of submerged active breakwaters was performed in a two-dimensional wave flume in the Queen's University Coastal Engineering Research Laboratory(QUCERL). Both single cylinders and multi-cylinders placed in series were evaluated. Transmission coefficients in the range of 0.3 to 0.7 were measured over a broad range of conditions, indicating the possibility of these devices being used in prototype situations to achieve the benefits described above.																					0-7844-0411-9				1999							2179	2192																WOS:000084505400163

The world's largest habitat for Populus euphratica, which is in the Tarim River basin, significantly shrank. To protect and restore the deteriorated ecosystems along the Tarim River and its associated wetlands, China's government initiated a multimillion dollar river restoration project to release water from upper dams to the dried-up lower reaches of the Tarim River starting in 2000. We monitored the responses of groundwater and vegetation to water recharge in the lower reaches of the river from 2000 to 2006 by establishing nine 1000-m-long transects perpendicular to the river at intervals of 20-45 km along the 320-km river course below the Daxihaizi Reservoir, the source of water conveyance, to Lake Taitema, the terminus of the Tarim River. Water recharges from the Daxihaizi Reservoir to the lower reaches of the Tarim River significantly increased groundwater levels and vegetation coverage at all monitoring sites along the river. The mean canopy size of the endangered plant species P. euphratica doubled after 6 years of water recharge. Some rare migrating birds returned to rest on the restored wetlands in summer along the lower reaches of the Tarim River. The biggest challenge facing decision makers, however, is to balance water allocation and water rights between agricultural and natural ecosystems in a sustainable way. A large number of inhabitants in the Tarim Basin depend on these limited water resources for a living. At the same time, the endangered ecosystems need to be protected. Given the ecological, socioeconomic, and sociopolitical realities in the Tarim Basin, adaptive water policies and strategies are needed for water allocation in these areas of limited water resources.					; chen, yaning/AAN-8170-2020	Xia, Yang/0000-0002-7587-5835; 													0888-8892	1523-1739				JUN	2009	23	3					531	536		10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01238.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01238.x								22748091					WOS:000266071200006

Environmental gradients, fragmented habitats, and microbiota of a northern ice shelf cryoecosystem, Ellesmere Island, Canada	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Over the course of the last century, the 9000-km(2) "Ellesmere Ice Shelf" (82-83 degrees N, 64-90 degrees W) fragmented into six main ice shelves now totaling 1043 km(2). This ensemble of thick ice environments lies along the northern coast of Ellesmere Island in the Canadian High Arctic and provides a cryohabitat for microbial communities that occur in association with eolian and glacially entrained sediments on the ice surface. We undertook a comparative analysis of physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of five of the remnant ice shelves including geographic information system (GIS) mapping of ice types. Each of these remnants is a thick (> 20 m) mass of ice with substantial sediment overburden that promotes the formation of oligotrophic meltwaters in the summer. Microbiota occurred in all sampled a continuum of abundance from sparse to loosely cohesive and pigmented microbial mats. Using digital images from over-flight transects we determined that 8% of the combined ice-shelf area was suitable microbial mat habitat, and contained an estimated 34 Gg of organic matter stocks for the entire system. A gradient of increasing chlorophyll a, organic content, and conductivity was found from west to east. This is likely related to the surface ice type (meteoric versus marine) and to the relative availability of sediment. Our results indicate that differences in phototrophic community structure (microalgae and cyanobacterial morphotypes) were associated with different ice and microbial mat types. In addition, the relative abundance of dominant taxa was significantly associated with environmental gradients of conductivity, soluble reactive phosphorus, and nitrate and ammonium concentrations. There were distinct differences between each ice shelf with regards to ice type and sediment availability but no differences in taxonomic richness or diversity, indicating little effect of habitat fragmentation on these community attributes. However, the ensemble of ice shelves that compose this unique cryoecosystem remains vulnerable to habitat attrition and complete loss with ongoing climate warming.					; Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019	Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938; Mueller, Derek/0000-0003-1974-319X; 													1523-0430					NOV	2006	38	4					593	607		10.1657/1523-0430(2006)38[593:EGFHAM]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1657/1523-0430(2006)38[593:EGFHAM]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000242509200012

As the salinity of these lakes increases, their mass balance changes, and biogeochemical processes may be intensified. In that sense, Petrola Lake (SE Spain) is a terminal lake located in an endorheic basin with elevated anthropic pressure, mainly derived from agricultural inputs and wastewater discharge. The goal of this study was to evaluate the interaction between groundwater and saline water from Petrola Lake to improve our knowledge of groundwater recharge processes by density-driven flow (DDF) in terminal lakes. A combination of hydrochemical (chloride concentration) and stable isotope (delta18O<INF>H<INF>2</INF>O</INF> and delta2H<INF>H<INF>2</INF>O</INF>) data were used. In order to test the conceptual model, a simple numerical experiment was performed using a one-dimensional column that represents the relationship between the lake and the aquifer incorporating the variable density coupling control in solute migration. The isotopic composition of 190 groundwater and surface water samples collected between September 2008 and July 2015 provides a regression line (delta2H<INF>H<INF>2</INF>O</INF> = 5.0 center dot delta18O<INF>H<INF>2</INF>O</INF> - 14.3 parts per thousand, R2 = 0.95) consistent with dominant evaporation processes in the lake. The DDF towards the underlying aquifer showed a strong influence on the mixing processes between the groundwater and surface water. Nevertheless, groundwater chemistry at different depths beneath the lake remains almost constant over time, suggesting an equilibrium between DDF and regional groundwater flow (RGF). Modelling isotope changes allowed inferring the temporal pattern of saline water recharge, coinciding with the summer season when water loss through evaporation is most significant. Consequently, the transport of solutes suitable for chemical reactions is then feasible to deeper zones of the aquifer.

Testing a palaeobotanical hypothesis with a dynamic landscape model	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim Forest communities in the European Central Alps are highly sensitive to climatic change. Palaeobotanical studies have demonstrated that forests rapidly expanded upslope during Holocene warm intervals and contracted when temperatures fell. However, temperature alone cannot account for important changes in tree species abundance. For example, population expansion by Norway spruce (Picea abies), a dominant subalpine species, lagged suitable temperatures by about 3000 years in eastern and by 6000 years in western Switzerland. We hypothesize that spruce expansion was delayed by limited water availability in weakly developed soils and/or by drier-than-present climatic conditions. Location We examine the impact of reduced moisture availability on forest dynamics using a combined dynamic modelling/palaeoecological approach at two high-elevational lakes in the Swiss Central Alps. Methods We simulate Holocene vegetation dynamics with the LandClim model in landscapes surrounding the two lakes and validate the model output by comparison with palaeobotanical reconstructions from the same sites. We evaluate the impact of shallow soils on vegetation dynamics at these sites by varying soil water-holding capacity (i.e. bucket size) and precipitation abundance in model scenarios. Results Simulations with modern soil conditions and precipitation abundance matched reconstructed vegetation dynamics near the tree line, where temperature limits plant growth, but simulated abundant spruce during the entire Holocene. Spruce was absent only in simulations with a maximum bucket size of less than 7 cm, or when precipitation was reduced by at least 60%. In exploratory simulations of future conditions with average temperatures raised by 4 degrees C, the low water-holding capacity of shallow alpine soils, not temperature, determined the upper elevational limit of spruce. Main conclusions Spruce expanded in the Central Alps only after soils developed sufficient water-holding capacity and precipitation neared its modern abundance. Soil development will probably constrain the future response of tree species to warmer conditions (e.g. upslope migrations), as it did in the past.

Do lakes act as traps for river mycoplankton?	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												The aim of the study was to determine the abundance and species diversity of mycoplankton in lotic and lentic waters within the Rospuda river-lake system. Additionally, it aimed to explain the influence of lake waters on the abundance and species diversity of mycoplankton in the riverine sections of the river-lake system. Water samples were collected using a Limnosa sampler during the summer seasons from 2019 to 2023 from surface layers of the entire Rospuda river-lake system, which has a total length of 102 km. Sampling included 10 lakes, of which four are mesotrophic, five are eutrophic, and one is at the boundary between mesotrophy and eutrophy, as well as 11 samples from the riverine sections of the studied system. The mycoplankton abundance in the studied system ranged from 8400 to 16,400 CFU/mL, with the lowest values found in limnic waters and the highest in riverine sections. The lakes Okr & aogon;g & lstrok;e, Bolesty, Sumowo, and Rospuda Augustowska, which are eutrophic, exhibited the lowest species diversity of mycoplankton. The highest species diversity was observed in the river sections connecting D & lstrok;ugie and Garbas<acute accent> Lakes (Rospuda River 4) and G & lstrok;& eogon;bokie and Sumowo Lakes (Rospuda River 6), with 8 and 7 fungal species in the water column, respectively. The most frequently occurring fungal species in the studied system were Penicillium chrysogenum and Penicillium commune, with as much as 43 % of the identified aquatic fungi being potential pathogens, representing mycological micro-contaminants of the water.The results indicate that aquatic fungi can be valuable indicators of pollution levels and the sanitary quality of waters. This study demonstrated that the species diversity and abundance of fungi in lentic waters primarily depend on the concentration of organic matter, phytoplankton biomass indicated by chlorophyll a concentration, and the degree of water pollution. Furthermore, mesotrophic lakes contributed to an increase in mycoplankton abundance in the riverine sections, while eutrophic lakes caused a decrease in the abundance of these microorganisms in flowing waters. Therefore, it can be conclusively stated that eutrophic lakes act as traps for river mycoplankton, whereas mesotrophic lakes are sources of aquatic fungi in rivers.

Conservatively, EMLs exist in 193 of the 290 OWLeS IOP soundings. The distribution of EML base pressure derived from the OWLeS IOP soundings reveals two classes of EML, one that has a relatively low-elevation base (900-750 hPa) and one that has a relatively high-elevation base (750-500 hPa). It is hypothesized that the former class of EML, which is the focus of this research, is, at times, the result of mesoscale pro-cesses related to individual Great Lakes. WRF reanalysis fields from a case study during the OWLeS field project provide evidence of two means by which low-elevation base EMLs can originate from the lake-effect boundary layer convection and associated mesoscale circulations. First, such EMLs can form within the upper-level outflow branches of mesoscale so-lenoidal circulations. Evacuated Great Lakes-modified convective boundary layer air aloft then lies above ambient air of a greater static stability, forming EMLs. Second, such EMLs can form in the absence of a mesoscale solenoidal circulation when Great Lake-modified convective boundary layers overrun ambient air of a greater density. The reanalysis fields show that EMLs and layers of reduced static stability tied to Great Lakes-modified convective boundary layers can extend downwind for hundreds of kilometers from their areas of formation. Operational implications and avenues for future re-search are discussed.																			0027-0644	1520-0493				JAN	2024	152	1					79	95		10.1175/MWR-D-22-0344.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-22-0344.1													WOS:001130093200001

Shashivardhan; Chauhan, Prakash			Unveiling the catastrophic landslide-induced flash flood in Teesta River, Sikkim: insight from South Lhonak Glacial Lake	LANDSLIDES												The Teesta basin within the Sikkim Himalaya encapsulates a number of glacial lakes, prominently featuring the expansive and swiftly evolving South Lhonak Lake. The recent South Lhonak Lake Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) in Sikkim has triggered a major flash flood in the river. Satellite imagery acquired by the National Remote Sensing Centre revealed that a massive landslide caused a sudden surge in the water levels of the glacial lake, eventually leading to the breach of the moraine dam. The catastrophic GLOF event led to the collapse of the Chungthang Dam, located 65.92 km downstream of the glacier lake, resulting in widespread human casualties and substantial infrastructural devastation. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis, simulation, and reconstruction of the entire GLOF process chain. A key innovation of this study is the consideration of cascading failure effects, including the landslide, South Lhonak Lake breach, and subsequent Chungthang Dam breach. Additionally, this study introduces the application of photogrammetric techniques for the first time to accurately calculate the landslide volume and the corresponding volume of displaced water. The GLOF process chain encompasses the volume of debris falling into the lake, impulse-wave initiation, moraine dam overtopping, moraine dam breaching, and flood propagation. Photogrammetric techniques are applied using pre- and post-event high-resolution stereo-satellite images for estimating the landslide volume and the volume of water displaced due to the reduction in water level. Numerical simulations from the study show the generation of a significant impulse wave, leading to the overtopping of the moraine dam with an exceptionally high overtopping discharge of 15,850 m3/s. The estimated peak discharge due to the moraine dam breach is 12,564 m3/s. The findings indicate that the collapse of the Chungthang Dam generated two distinct peak discharges of 14,673 m3/s and 10,282 m3/s, respectively. The results are illustrated across different sites and validated by comparison with high-resolution satellite imagery and field data. The study demonstrates an integrative scientific methodology that includes photogrammetric techniques, sophisticated numerical modeling, and dam break analysis in simulating the landslide-induced GLOF.																			1612-510X	1612-5118				MAR	2025	22	3			SI		837	855		10.1007/s10346-024-02378-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10346-024-02378-7		OCT 2024											WOS:001333378900001

Linking Sediment and Water Column Phosphorus Dynamics to Oxygen, Temperature, and Aeration in Shallow Eutrophic Lakes	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Water quality improvements in shallow eutrophic lakes are commonly delayed due to loading from legacy phosphorus (P)-enriched sediments, even with reduced external nutrient loads. It is critical to understand the drivers of internal P loading to suppress or remove this source of P and meet water quality goals. We contrast the drivers of internal P loading in two shallow eutrophic systems (Lake Carmi and Missisquoi Bay). Legacy P dynamics in the unmanipulated systems were compared to Lake Carmi during aeration. In-situ high frequency water column monitoring along with water and sediment sampling was used to study P dynamics in response to changing lake conditions and aeration. Despite both systems exhibiting P mobility controlled by iron redox cycling, we observed distinct differences in the spatial extent and drivers of internal P loading. Legacy P loading was controlled by seasonal drivers in Lake Carmi, but by spatially variable and highly transient wind driven forcing of hydrodynamics in Missisquoi Bay. Aeration altered the mixing regime of Lake Carmi and shifted loading dynamics to frequent wind-driven pulses of legacy P to surface waters akin to those of Missisquoi Bay. Mean hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen increased with aeration, but greater oxygen demand rates and periods of anoxia under transient stratification still resulted in internal P loading. Surface P concentrations were higher in summer months with aeration compared to previous years. This research illustrates the dynamic nature of legacy P behavior within and between shallow eutrophic lakes and the challenges in addressing this common water resources threat. Shallow lakes with high amounts of nutrients like phosphorus often experience worsening water quality and harmful algae blooms. Even if less phosphorus enters the lake from the watershed, phosphorus already in the lake can cycle between the water and sediment for decades. It is important to understand how phosphorus moves within lakes to make management decisions. We studied what causes the release of phosphorus from sediment in Lake Carmi and Missisquoi Bay, Lake Champlain. These observations were compared to Lake Carmi during 4 years of whole-lake aeration designed to limit phosphorus release. We found that the release of phosphorus at both study sites was tied to chemical reactions of iron. The timing of this release was controlled by seasonal changes in Lake Carmi before aeration, and by frequent wind-driven mixing in Missisquoi Bay. Aeration changed the timing of mixing in Lake Carmi but did not decrease the amount of phosphorus recycled from the sediment. Aeration also increased the rate of oxygen consumption in Lake Carmi which quickly led to phosphorus release during periods of calm wind. This research shows the highly dynamic nature of phosphorus behavior within shallow lakes which is important to understand when making management decisions. Legacy phosphorus mobility was driven by either episodic wind-mediated mixing or seasonal turnover in two proximal shallow eutrophic systemsAeration altered hydrodynamics to change from seasonal to wind-driven internal loading of legacy phosphorus, but it was not suppressedHeterogeneous spatiotemporal controls on internal legacy phosphorus loading present challenges to achieving water quality goals					; Morales, Ana/AAA-1654-2020; Marti, Clelia/H-5371-2014; Kirol, Ashton/MHQ-4103-2025	Schroth, Andrew/0000-0001-5553-3208; Kirol, Ashton/0000-0001-6722-6598; Braun, David/0009-0008-3873-0080													0043-1397	1944-7973				JAN	2024	60	1							e2023WR034813	10.1029/2023WR034813	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023WR034813													WOS:001141006900001

Seems fishy: environmental DNA impacts on sketa22 quality control in salmonidae dominated waterbodies using qPCR and ddPCR	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS												Globally, water resources used for recreation and drinkingwater are threatened by fecal pollution. These pollutants can cause gastrointestinal illness and environmental degradation. Additionally, most sources of fecal pollution are non-point sources stemming from multiple species. Identifying these sources is vital to categorizing the exposure risk fromcontact and improving remediation efforts. Acommontechnique to provide species-specific information for fecal source identification is microbial source tracking (MST). MSTquantifiesDNAof host or host-associated microorganisms through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technologies such as quantitative PCR(qPCR) or droplet digitalPCR(ddPCR). MST techniques have been implemented globally and are used for routinemonitoring. In theUnited States (US), theUS Environmental ProtectionAgency has provided several approved standardPCRmethods forMST and other recreationalwater quality applications. Thesemethods have specified quality controls including sample processing controls (SPC) and assessments for sample inhibition. Astandard SPCused in EPA methods involves spiking sampleswithsalmon testesDNA(nominally originating fromChumSalmon, Oncorhynchus keta and quantifying them using Sketa22, a genus specificTaqMan(TM) assay). Thisquality control (QC) behaves similarly to themicrobial species being monitored. MSTtesting in Fall 2022 indicated elevated Sketa22 recoveries and re-analysis of samples indicated the detection of external SalmonidaeDNAon both qPCRandddPCR platforms. Our research was designed to identify the cause of this interference. Results indicate that the primer probe set may react with wild Salmonidae DNA. Analyzing the Sketa22 sequence using BLAST indicated matcheswithmany species of Salmonidae present in the sampled streamsystem. Consequently, further research is required to identify the effectiveness of Sketa22 as aQCwhen native andmigratory Salmonidae are present. General recommendations are provided to account for excess ambient SalmonidaeDNA.

However, detailed insights into the mechanisms of PA regulation are still limited, especially in the case of acid phosphatases. The novel substrate ELF97 phosphate allows for tagging PA on single cells in an epifluorescence microscope. This fluorescence-labeled enzyme activity (FLEA) assay enables for autecological studies in natural phytoplankton and algal cultures. We combined the FLEA assay with image analysis to measure cell-specific acid PA in two closely related species of the genus Coccomyxa (Trebouxiophyceae, Chlorophyta) isolated from two acidic lakes with distinct P availability. The strains were cultured in a mineral medium supplied with organic (beta-glycerol phosphate) or inorganic (orthophosphate) P at three concentrations. Both strains responded to experimental conditions in a similar way, suggesting that acid extracellular phosphatases were regulated irrespectively of the origin and history of the strains. We found an increase in cell-specific PA at low P concentration and the cultures grown with organic P produced significantly higher (ca. 10-fold) PA than those cultured with the same concentrations of inorganic P. The cell-specific PA measured in the cultures grown with the lowest organic P concentration roughly corresponded to those of the original Coccomyxa population from an acidic lake with impaired P availability. The ability of Coccomyxa strains to produce extracellular phosphatases, together with tolerance for both low pH and metals can be one of the factors enabling the dominance of the genus in extreme conditions of acidic lakes. The analysis of frequency distribution of the single-cell PA documented that simple visual counting of 'active' (labeled) and 'non-active' (non-labeled) cells can lead to biased conclusions regarding algal P status because the actual PA of the 'active' cells can vary from negligible to very high values. The FLEA assay using image cytometry offers a strong tool in plankton ecology for exploring P metabolism.

Cores show that one partial (modern) and two complete depositional cycles (gyttja passing upwards into peat) have formed within the last 4000 years. The contact between cycles (gyttja over peat) is abrupt. These cycles are interpreted as resulting from fluctuations in the level of Lake Ontario about the long-term rising trend. Radiocarbon dates show that relatively low levels prevailed from 4100 to 3300 BP and from 2300 to 1900 BP; rapid rises in water level, which are indicated by the abrupt contact between cycles, occurred at 3300-3100 BP and some time between 2000 and 1500 BP. These water-level changes are synchronous with those shown by other studies in Lake Ontario and with century-scale paleoclimatic events. The high stands correlate with wet perids, and perhaps also with warm periods in the eastern part of the Great Lakes basin, but an inverse relationship between precipitation and temperature in the western Great Lakes suggests that the Great Lakes basin does not respond uniformly to climatic changes.

Mapping of the concentration of carbonaceous gases and fluorescent characteristics in the surface water of Southern Baikal	21ST INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEAN OPTICS: ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS	Proceedings of SPIE				21st International Symposium On Atmospheric and Ocean Optics - Atmospheric Physics	JUN 22-26, 2015	Tomsk, RUSSIA	V E Zuev Inst Atmospher Opt SB RAS, Inst Solar Terrestrial Phys SB RAS, Russian Fdn Basic Res, Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Branch				All our many-year studies of the gas-exchange processes were carried out at one observation site (BALO) in the littoral of Southern Baikal. Thus, the question about applicability of conclusions and estimates based on these data to the entire littoral zone inevitably arises. In 2014, we succeeded for the first time in organizing the combined research campaign for detailed mapping of the spatial variability of water characteristics in general for the littoral of southern Baikal. The spatial partial distribution of biogenic elements and the pressure of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmospheric surface layer and the surface water layer were studied in August 5-11 of 2014 from onboard of I.D. Papanin Research Vessel (RV). These studies covered, in section, the entire water area of the southern Baikal. The fluorescent characteristics, concentration of biogenic elements, partial pressure of carbon dioxide and methane in the surface water layer and the atmospheric surface layer were determined there. The continuous measurements of carbon dioxide and methane in the surface water and in the atmosphere in the course of the vessel were conducted by a mobile shipborne system, which was complemented with the flow-through fluorimeter. It has been found that the main features of fluxes and the value of dP(g), as well as fluorescent characteristics are in a good agreement with the results of many-year measurements obtained in the BALO Observatory for the summer period.

J	Wang, Z; Liu, H; Cao, YN				Wang, Zheng; Liu, Hu; Cao, Yunning			Choosing a suitable εw-p by distinguishing the dominant plant sources in sediment records using a new Pta index and estimating the paleo-δDp spatial distribution in China	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												The hydrogen isotopic composition of plant wax (delta D-wax) inherits the isotopic values of the source water and isotopic fractionation that take place in lipid biosynthesis. The delta D-wax values of n-alkanes or n-acids in sediment records are considered to be effective paleo-delta D for precipitation proxies for different timescales. However, the vegetation effect also contributes substantially to the apparent fractionation values (epsilon(w-p)) between the precipitation and plant. Therefore, a method for evaluating the dominant plant source in the sediment records is key for reconstructing a reliable paleo-delta D-p record. In this study, based on field data from the extremely arid Qaidam Basin and the semi-arid central Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP), a plant type index (Pta), based on the traditional P-aq and n-alkane C-31/C-29 index, was used to evaluate the dominant plant type that contributed to the sediments. In the arid and semi-arid region, the Pta values of the aquatic plants were <90, while the shrub Pta ranged from 90 to 180 and the grass Pta was >180. A test on contemporary soils and surface lake sediments also showed that the Pta index could estimate the regional vegetation distribution in modern environments. We also evaluated the dominant n-alkane source for four sediment records in China during the last millennium and reconstructed a regional paleo-delta D-p by choosing a different epsilon(w-p). The estimated paleo-delta D-p values showed a good correlation with the modern regional summer delta D-p. We suggest that a large number of field studies are needed to improve the Pta index for quantitatively calculating the precise ratios for various plant sources. Such data would play a key role in improving hydrogen isotopic hydroclimatic research. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Nitrogen oxides in the atmosphere of coastal areas of Lake Baikal. Sources and possible impact on the ecosystem of the lake	24TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEAN OPTICS: ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS	Proceedings of SPIE				24th International Symposium on Atmospheric and Ocean Optics - Atmospheric Physics	JUL 02-05, 2018	Tomsk, RUSSIA	Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Branch, V E Zuev Inst Atmospher Opt, Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Branch, Inst Solar Terrestrial Phys, Russian Fdn Basic Res, Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Branch				The research is focused on the distribution of nitrogen oxide concentrations in the atmosphere above Lake Baikal, the determination of the largest sources of emission, and a quantitative assessment of their possible contribution to the content of nitrates in the near shore waters of the lake. The paper presents the results of measurements of nitrogen oxide concentrations above the water area of the Baikal in the summer. In general, low background concentrations of nitrogen oxides prevailed, the excess was recorded in the northern part of the lake. An analysis and a calculation of emissions into the atmosphere from power facilities in the near-shore areas of the lake were carried out. In the northern part of Lake Baikal, the central coal-fired boiler plant in the town of Severobaikalsk could become a source of nitrogen oxides emission. The plume from the boiler was visually observed above the near shore waters. This boiler plant is the largest energy facility and the main source of emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere. Deposition of nitrogen oxides from such plumes can temporarily and locally cause an increase in nitrate concentrations in the near shore waters by 3-5% per day. In turn, the high content of nitrates in the water contributes to the growth of biomass of some algae species and thus affects the entire ecosystem of the lake. Water transport can also be a significant source of nitrogen oxides above the water area of the lake, but its contribution to the pollution of Lake Baikal is not sufficiently investigated.

J	Yan, DD; Wünnemann, B; Andersen, N				Yan, Dada; Wunnemann, Bernd; Andersen, Nils			A review of Ostracoda stable isotopes in palaeoclimate reconstruction on the Tibetan Plateau	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Ostracods in Tibetan Plateau (TP) waters have well-constrained ecological preferences, pronounced with favourable moult season and last-instar shell calcification in summer, their shell (biogenic carbonates) stable isotopes, therefore, have a great potential use as a palaeoclimate indicator, notably on seasonal basis. However, our understanding of the isotopic fractionations in a long record remains elusive, particularly as biocarbonates frequently precipitate out of thermodynamics-based isotopic equilibrium with ambient waters. The knowledge gap arises from the different roles of metabolic and kinetic effects in disequilibrium fractionations, in addition to the impacts of various surface processes in the lake catchment on the input and output of isotopic flux of a lake basin. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview on multiple factors for value variation of biological carbonate isotopes in terms of ostracods from different lakes over the Tibetan Plateau, to reduce the knowledge gap for future study. We address (1) the ecological preferences of ostracod species used for stable isotope analysis on the TP and the analytical reproducibility error of an individual measurement on several genus/species; (2) multiple factors for different shell isotope values of modern ostracods including metabolic and kinetic effects in disequilibrium fractionations as well as the impacts of in-lake and catchment processes on isotopic signal change in ambient waters; (3) the differences and related indications of stable isotope values of nature and culture modern and fossil ostracods from the same species (Eucypris mareotica); (4) the spatial stable isotope distribution patterns of the reported ostracod populations and their controlling factors in one lake and/or between several lakes through time and (5) different temporal distribution patterns of stable isotopes and their relevant triggers in four selected TP lakes with comparable or incomparable hydrological conditions during a long period of the last 15,000 to 32,000 years. The successful use of difference transformation of stable isotope data from Nam Co Lake for further reconstruction of palaeotemperature anomaly in terms of various seasonal anomalies show a great potential of this tool in palaeoclimate reconstruction at interannual scale in the future.																			0012-8252	1872-6828				DEC	2025	271								105279	10.1016/j.earscirev.2025.105279	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2025.105279													WOS:001585588100002

Adult Sockeye Salmon Responses to Transplanting Upstream of an Impassable Dam	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												The Yakama Nation manages a program for reintroducing Sockeye Salmon Oncorhynchus nerka upstream of Cle Elum Dam in the Yakima River basin. The program involves transplanting of a mix of adult Sockeye Salmon from two middle Columbia River donor stocks, Lake Wenatchee (WEN) and Osoyoos Lake (OSO), with the goal of establishing a self-sustaining population in the basin. In 2017, a subset of the transplanted population was radio-tagged and monitored to assess stock-specific responses to transplanting, including downstream entrainment at Cle Elum Dam ("fallback") and prespawn mortality. Tagged fish were active during the first 2 weeks after release. Some fish moved upstream into the Cle Elum River and then returned to the reservoir; other fish moved downstream and passed Cle Elum Dam. Movement within the study area diminished during August but increased in September when fish began migrating up the Cle Elum River for spawning. A greater proportion of WEN fish (76.3%) was detected entering the river compared to OSO fish (53.9%). The hazard ratio from a multistate analysis of fish behavior indicated that WEN fish were nine times more likely to enter the river than OSO fish. The WEN fish also initiated upstream movement 3 weeks earlier than OSO fish. We found that 27.0% of all tagged fish were lost to the spawning population through fallback (20.7%) and prespawn mortality (6.3%). Fallback and prespawn mortality occurred for a greater percentage of OSO fish (26.9% and 7.7%) than WEN fish (15.3% and 5.1%), but these differences were not statistically different. These results provide foundational information from the early phase of a reintroduction effort. Continued monitoring will be required as Sockeye Salmon evolve to conditions upstream of Cle Elum Dam, and results from these efforts will provide valuable insights for this reintroduction effort and others in river systems with similar characteristics.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				DEC	2021	41	6					1640	1651		10.1002/nafm.10675	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10675		SEP 2021											WOS:000692940300001
J	Healey, J				Healey, Jonathan			Agrarian social structure in the central lake district, c. 1574-1830:: The fall of the mountain republic'?	NORTHERN HISTORY												WHEN THOMAS GRAY arrived in Grasmere in 1769, the first thing that impressed him was the landscape. In front of him was Helm Crag, with the 'the strange broken outline of its top like some gigantic building demolish'd, & the stones that composed it, flung across each other in wild confusion', while beyond lay 'one of the sweetest landscapes, that art ever attempted to imitate'. As much a part of this pleasant scene as the hills and lake was the village itself. 'with the parish church rising in the midst of it, hanging enclosures, corn fields, & meadows as green as an emerald with their trees & hedges & cattle 'Not a single red tile', Gray recorded approvingly, 'no flaring Gentleman's house, or garden-walls, break in upon the repose of this little unsuspecting paradise, but all is peace, rusticity, & happy poverty in its neatest most becoming attire.' Thus the artistically satisfying arrangement of buildings, fields and lake also conformed to a social ideal: that of the simple Arcadian paradise, untainted by association with a corrupt and pretentious aristocratic culture.(1) Gray's eulogy was to be echoed by those who followed his footsteps into the Lake District. Thomas West, writing in 1778, agreed with Gray's description of Grasmere ('this peaceful happy vale') and with his wider sentiments about Lakeland life. 'The inhabitants', he enthused, 'partake nothing of the ferocity of the country they live in; for they are hospitable, civil, and communicative.' Indeed, 'no villainous banditti haunt the mountains; innocent people live in the dells. Every cottager is a narrative of all he knows; and mountain virtue, and pastoral hospitality are found at every farm.' Mountain virtue was contrasted with the stylized falseness of current aristocratic and metropolitan fashion.																			0078-172X	1745-8706				SEP	2007	44	2					73	+		10.1179/174587007X208227	http://dx.doi.org/10.1179/174587007X208227													WOS:000249094200003

Pollution of the groundwater with SO42- causes a higher availability of o-PO43-, eutrophication and loss in biodiversity in groundwater fed fens with stagnating surface water. Under natural conditions, fens along the river Meuse are continuously fed by groundwater that besides SO42- mostly also contains high concentrations of NO3- and bivalent cations (Ca2+ and mg(2+)). During summer groundwater input is restricted resulting in periodic drought. Under these conditions no SO42- induced o-PO43- eutrophication occurs. Periodic drought and a high discharge of NO3-, have a strong effect on S and P biogeochemistry in sulphate-rich fens. NO3- inhibits SO42- reduction and concomitant o-PO43- mobilisation in fen sediments by being an energetically more favourable electron acceptor. In addition, NO3- is capable of oxidising reduced Fe compounds, including FeSx, increasing the amount of oxidised Fe in the sediment capable of binding o-PO43- Periodic drought is important in reincreasing the concentration of oxidised Fe in the top layer of S-rich sediments preventing o-PO43- mobilisation and an undesirable vegetation development. Damming of surface water, in order te restore desiccated sulphate-rich fens, prevents periodic drought and decreases groundwater input. This leads to NO3- depletion, stimulation of SO42- reduction, Fe depletion, o-PO43- mobilisation and, in contrast to what was hoped for, in massive growth of algae, lemnids and fast growing wetland grasses. Therefore discharge of NO3--rich groundwater and the fluctuation of the water table are vital for successful restoration of desiccated sulphate-rich fens. Successful rewetting of these type of fens, without causing stagnation of surface water and without preventing periodic drought, can be achieved by raising the water table to levels below the potential groundwater table using a controllable dam.

J	La Mantia, C				La Mantia, Clelia			Maredolce-La Favara Park in Palermo: the Conservation Project of an Arab-Norman Landscape Area	ARCHISTOR-ARCHITECTURE HISTORY RESTORATION												In the south of Palermo, among the residual agricultural areas of the rich cultivated plain called Conca d'Oro, there is the Arab-Norman complex of Maredolce-La Favara with its park, characterized by a large lake once fed by the "Fawara" spring, from which the toponym itself derives. Nowadays, the site is located in the industrial suburb of Brancaccio, but still preserves the memory of the original landscape, for the survival of the isle and of the system of hydraulic artifacts for the irrigation of the citrus grove. Today the Soprintendenza Beni Culturali e Ambientali of Palermo, owner of the property, has granted the private management of the park's agricultural areas. The interest in Maredolce was born from the recognition of these values. The research work, begun in 2016 with the participation in the Workshop of the Benetton Studies and Research Foundation which in 2015 had awarded on the park the "Carlo Scarpa International Prize for the garden" (XXVI edition), was later concretized in the thesis for the Specialization in Architectural and Landscape Heritage (Politecnico di Milano). A project for the conservation and enhancement of the Maredoke landscape complex has been drawn up. In particular, the aim was to make more readable the traces of the layering of the park and of the entire historicized cultural landscape of the Conca d'Oro, to preserve the witnesses and also to upgrade a periurban deteriorated area.

J	Dexter, DJ; Schliep, DV				Dexter, Daniel J.; Schliep, Donald V.			Design of a compound inclined screen trap for anadromous salmonid smolts	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												In the late 1980s, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources fish managers became compelled to address the decline of wild steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss in Lake Superior Requisite to the development of stock-recruitment models, permanent smolt traps were designed and constructed on two Lake Superior tributaries. The design was engineered to function in a broad range of discharges with complete structural integrity, to keep itself free of debris, and to sample a large portion of the emigrating salmonid population. The first of these traps was built on the French River (discharge, from 3 to > 1,840 ft(3)/s [cfs]) and began operation in 1994. After several years of very successful operation a second trap was built on the Knife River (discharge. from 5 to >9,000 cfs) that began operation in 1997. These structures employ fixed stainless steel dewatering screens permanently fixed at opposed compound inclines on each side of a channel that carries water to a catch-retention box. which is also fixed and above the level of the stream. Fish falling onto the screen are directed by gravity to the center channel. where they travel with the flowing water to the catch box. A stainless steel, overshot, rotating drum screen in the catch box has effectively retained fish with low mortality while expelling water-borne debris. Both traps have operated continuously during open-water periods since 1997 to sample emigrating salmonid smolts (primarily wild steelhead). Smolt capture efficiency has been estimated to be 94% with the French River trap and 85% with the Knife River trap. Fish managers may wish to examine and consider this design as a possibility for addressing their smolt monitoring needs.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				AUG	2007	27	3					885	890		10.1577/M06-218.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M06-218.1													WOS:000249158900017
J	Kunkel, KE; Westcott, NE; Kristovich, DAR				Kunkel, KE; Westcott, NE; Kristovich, DAR			Assessment of potential effects of climate change on heavy lake-effect snowstorms near Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The potential effects of future climate change on the frequency of heavy lake-effect snowstorms in the Lake Erie snowbelt were assessed using recent transient simulations from two General Circulation Models (GCMs): the second-generation Hadley Centre (HadCM2) and the first generation Canadian Climate Centre (CGCM1) coupled ocean-atmosphere models. An analysis of historical heavy lake-effect snowstorms identified six weather conditions to be closely related to heavy lake-effect snowstorm occurrence: surface wind speed > 6 m/s, surface wind direction of south southwest to west northwest, surface air temperature in the range of -10degreesC to 0degreesC, lake surface to air temperature difference > 7degreesC, lower tropospheric stability (T (lake) - 850 > 15degreesC), and a highly amplified middle tropospheric wave train. These criteria were applied to daily grid point data from the GCMs for two periods, the late 20(th) Century and the late 21(st) Century, to determine the relative frequency with which heavy lake-effect conditions were predicted. Surface conditions favorable for heavy lake-effect snow decreased infrequency by 50% and 90% for the HadCM2 and CGCM1, respectively, by the late 21(st) Century. This reduction was due almost entirely to a decrease in the number of occurrences of surface air temperature in the range of -10 to 0degreesC, which in turn was the result of an increase in average winter air temperatures. Other surface conditions favorable for lake-effect snow occurred at about the same frequency in the late 21(st) Century as in the late 20(th) Century, suggesting that lake-effect rain events may replace lake-effect snow events. Changes in the middle tropospheric wave train were also noted in both models. However, there were sizable biases in the simulation of the present-day climate, raising questions about the validity of the future projections.

Gas chemistry of the Dallol region of the Danakil Depression in the Afar region of the northern-most East African Rift	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												A combination of noble and major gas composition and isotope geochemistry provides a window into the source of volatiles and the mechanisms of transport associated with a series of hot springs located near the Dallol volcano within the Danakil Depression along the Red Sea arm of the Afar triple junction. The helium isotopic composition of these gases range up to 11.9 times the atmospheric ratio (11.9 R/Ra), which suggests that the Afar plume interacts with the Afar depression across at least the 300 km transect from Tendaho-Gabo basin to Dallol within the Danakil Depression. The He-4/Ar-40* of similar to 14 in the mantle-rich end-member at Dallol indicates significant degassing prior to emplacement at Dallol either during basaltic dyke intrusions beneath the Danakil Depression or during the release and transport of fluids from a degassed subsolidus source in the upper mantle along high permeability fracture zones. The CO2/He-3 of the magmatic end-member is similar to 2x higher (7.7 x 10(9)) and more positive delta C-13 (CO2) (-2.1 parts per thousand) than other archetypal plumes (e.g. Hawaii, Iceland, etc.). The Dallol composition is consistent with a hypothetical model that assumes a plume-type starting composition and experiences similar to 92% degassing (where helium is preferentially degassed with respect to CO2) and the addition of CO2 from the thermal degradation of carbonate. Non-atmospheric excess N-2 with a delta N-15 (N-2) of +3.5 to +4 parts per thousand dominates the Dallol volatiles and suggests interaction between mantle fluids and Proterozoic meta-sediments. By comparing and modeling the range in atmospherically (e.g. Ne-20, Ar-36, Kr-84) and mantle-derived (e.g. He-4/Ar-40* and CO2/He-3) components in Dallol volatiles, we propose that the coherent variations in these gases result from mixing of magmatic volatiles with extremely degassed remnant fluids present within the hydrothermal reservoir.

J	Lydersen, E; Fjeld, E; Gjessing, ET				Lydersen, E; Fjeld, E; Gjessing, ET			The humic lake acidification experiment (HUMEX): Main physico-chemical results after five years of artificial acidification	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL					5th Nordic Symposium on Humic Substances in Soil and Water / HUMEX/HUMOR Project Seminar	JUN 06-08, 1995	UNIV LUND, LUND, SWEDEN		UNIV LUND			The HUMEX-project is a whole catchment manipulation experiment where the effects of the addition of H2SO4 and NH4NO3 to a humic-rich lake, Lake Skjervatjern, and its catchment were studied. The lake was physically divided into an experimental lake (Basin A) and a control lake (Basin B). Two years after the division, Basin A and its catchment were artificially acidified. Hydrological data, meteorology, precipitation, and runoff chemistry collected during a 2-y pre-acidification period and during 5 y of acidification were evaluated. Randomized intervention analysis (RIA) was used to evaluate statistical significant differences between runoff chemistry from the two basins before and after the acidification. RIA showed significantly higher concentrations of SO42- H+, NH4+, NO3-, Al-n+, Ca2+, Mg2+, total reactive Al (RAL), and labile Al (LAL) in Basin A after treatment compared with the control basin. After the treatment, the acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) in Basin A was significantly lower than in Basin B. However, the average ANC is substantially higher in the control basin after acidification compared with the two years before acidification, while unchanged in the manipulated catchment. The main reason for this is the long lasting effect of Na leakage after seasalt-episodes. No significant changes were observed regarding the amount of total organic carbon (TOC), water color, or UV-absorbency after the treatment, but the anion deficiency (A(-)) was significantly lower in the treated basin. This indicates that the organic acids are more protonated in the treated basin compared with the control basin. After a cold winter in 1993/94, an extreme NH4+ increase was observed in runoff water from Basin A. This increase was accompanied by increases in water color and UV-absorbency, but without any increase in TOC.

Three diurnal studies were carried out, on July 12(th)-13(th), 1994; on June 25(th)-26(th), 1995 and on July 17(th) 18(th), 1995 with a sampling interval of 3-4 hours. Diel variations in bacterial number, biomass and productivity, in phytoplankton primary production and extracellular release of photosynthetic products, in ciliate number and biomass were followed. Phytoplankton was dominated by filamentous species: Limnothrix redekci, Oscillatoria sp., Aulacoseira (Melosira) ambigua and Planktolyngbya limnetica. The abundance of bacteria ranged from 4.1 to 14.6.10(12) cells m(-2) (median 9.88). The production of heterotrophic bacteria varied from 0.6 to 11 mgC m-2 h(-1) (median 3.65), the variation during diel cycle was high. Depth integrated values of particulate (PPpart) and extracellular primary production (PPdiss) ranged from 6 to 55 and from 17 to 90 mgC m(-2) h(-1), respectively. About 50 ciliate taxa were identified among them more abundant were bacterivores, bacterivores-herbivores and omnivores. Biomass of bacterivorous ciliates (TCbact) varied from 8 to 427 mgC m(-2). Bacterioplankton production constituted not more than 20% of total primary production (particulate + released), dynamics of bacterial production was related to the primary production, the correlation was negative with PPpart and positive with PPdiss. Different types of potential controlling factors of bacterioplankton (N and P nutrient control, bottom-up control by food and top-down control) are discussed.

ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE URAL RIVER BASIN IN THE CASPIAN LOWER AREA	SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT												Aim. The aim is to study the modern and ancient basin of the Ural River and establish the cause of its shallowing, as well as the disappearance of small rivers and tributaries of the Ural River. Methods. The research method consists in the generalization and reduction to a single scale of all cartographic and space-survey documents, as well as the identification of elements of hydrography and relief created by ancient watercourses. Results. At present, many countries experience a shortage of fresh water. A person uses a huge amount of fresh water to meet his daily needs. In addition, contaminated waste technical waters are discharged into rivers and lakes. The Republic of Kazakhstan occupies most of the Caspian lowland, with the only full-flowing river, Ural (the Kazakh name is Zhayik). However, this river is becoming shallow, its level and spring floods are becoming lower. Cut-off lakes are also drying and disappearing. Small rivers that flew into the Ural river have almost disappeared and water level increases only during the melting of snow and after heavy rains. The studied territory is located in the arid climate zone, where there is little snow, and rains are rare. Conclusions. However, studying the cartographic and space imagery, we can say that there are many dry channels in the Caspian lowland. It must be assumed that this region was sufficiently moist, with a large number of rivers and lakes.																			1992-1098	2413-0958					2018	13	2					123	131		10.18470/1992-1098-2018-2-123-131	http://dx.doi.org/10.18470/1992-1098-2018-2-123-131													WOS:000459109700011

Status of Mysis diluviana in Lake Ontario in 2013: Lower abundance but higher fecundity than in the 1990s	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Mysis diluviana is a major component of prey fish diets in the Great Lakes, so annual production of M. diluviana is important for understanding and modeling energy flow through Great Lakes food webs. However, only three lake-wide measurements of M. diluviana annual production in Lake Ontario are currently available (1971, 1990, 1995). During 2013, lake-wide coverage of Lake Ontario was achieved during four periods from April to November. Annual mean density and biomass of M. diluviana in 2013 were 99 #/m(2) (SE: 8) and 318 mg dw/m(2) (SE: 28) - approximately half of values observed in 1990s. M. diluviana comprised 13-30% of offshore zooplankton biomass in each period. Reproduction peaked in fall, with mean brood size of 32 embryos (range: 11-49), at least 10% larger than in 1990s. Generation time was two years from embryo to initial reproduction. Growth rates were 0.052 mm/d for the age-0 cohort and 0.027 mm/d for the age-1 cohort. Age-0 growth rate was significantly higher than in 1980s-90s (0.035 mm/d). Annual production in 2013 was 0.85 g dw/m(2)/yr (SE: 0.03) which was 30-40% of values observed in 1990 and 1995 (2.23 and 2.53 g/m(2)/yr). Annual production to biomass ratio (P/B) in 2013 was 2.65/yr which was 80-85% of values observed in 1990 and 1995 (324 and 3.11 /yr), but this difference was not statistically significant. Our results suggest that changes in annual production over time can be estimated using changes in biomass over time and a mean P/B ratio. (C) 2019 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

J	Huntley, B; Baxter, R; Lewthwaite, KJ; Willis, SG; Adamson, JK				Huntley, B; Baxter, R; Lewthwaite, KJ; Willis, SG; Adamson, JK			Vegetation responses to local climatic changes induced by a water-storage reservoir	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY LETTERS												In this paper we compare results from two vegetation surveys carried out immediately before (1969-72) and c. 25 years after the controversial impoundment of a water-storage reservoir within the Upper Teesdale National Nature Reserve (NNR) in northern England. The comparison reveals significant changes in grassland composition on a hill adjacent to the reservoir. Several environmental changes may have occurred at Widdybank Fell during the last c. 25 yr and caused these vegetation changes. We have identified five environmental factors that are likely to have changed over this period: grazing pressure, acid deposition, atmospheric deposition of major nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), regional climate and local climate as a result of a 'lake effect' of the reservoir. We hale examined the evidence available in each case. The records of change for these various factors leads us to conclude that, whereas factors other than local climate may account for changes in bryophyte components of the grasslands, none of the other factors can account for observed changes amongst the vascular plants. A major component of the vegetation changes observed can only readily be accounted for by an alteration in local climate as a consequence of the influence of the reservoir. This has important implications for future assessments of the environmental impacts of planned reservoirs. The impact of such local climate changes also calls into question assertions about global climate changes and the extent of their likely impacts, and provides insight into the conservation problems that arise from such changes.

Wind wave spectral observations in Currituck Sound, North Carolina	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												[1] We examine a set of 1626 high-resolution frequency-direction wind wave spectra and collocated winds collected during a 7-month period at a site in Currituck Sound, North Carolina, in terms of one-dimensional spectral structure and directional distribution functions. The data set includes cases of shore-normal winds in broad-fetch conditions as well as winds oblique to the basin geometry, with all fetches of order 10 km or less. Using equilibrium-range scaling, all one-dimensional spectra have a spectral peak region, an equilibrium range of finite bandwidth following an f(-4) slope at slightly higher frequencies, and a high-frequency tail that falls off more rapidly than f(-4). For shore-normal winds, spectral peakedness appears to be high and approximately constant for young waves, low and approximately constant for old waves, and steeply graded for intermediate inverse wave ages in the range 1.0 < u(10)/ c(p) < 1.7. Equilibrium-range bandwidth seems to be narrow for young waves and increases with increasing wave age. Directional distribution functions in shore-normal winds are symmetric about the wind direction, narrow at spectral peaks, and broad at high frequencies with distinct directionally bimodal peaks, consistent with other observations. In oblique-wind cases, directional distribution functions are asymmetric and directionally sheared in spectral peak regions, with peak directions aligned with longer fetch directions. At high frequencies, directional distributions are more nearly symmetric about the wind direction. One-dimensional spectra tend to have reduced spectral peakedness and highly variable equilibrium-range bandwidths in oblique-wind conditions, clearly indicating a more complex balance of source terms in these cases than in the more elementary situation of shore-normal winds. These complications are not without consequence in wave modeling, as any bounded or semibounded lake or estuary will be subject to oblique winds, and current operational models do not deal well with conditions like those we find here.																			2169-9275	2169-9291				MAY 1	2007	112	C5							C05001	10.1029/2006JC003835	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2006JC003835													WOS:000246307400006

Rokan Hulu is a regency in Riau Province, with population livelihoods in agriculture 52.42%, industry 11.49%, trade 7.14% and other sectors 28.95%. Ecotourism is not yet the economic backbone of this area. But this area has potential in that direction. This study aimed to analyse the prospect of some natural ecotourism objects located within reach of the iconic Great Mosque Islamic Centre (GMIC) Rokan Hulu. Using the survey method, the respondents were selected through a purposive sampling method. Respondents were local community, tourists, tourism businesses and other stakeholders. The data obtained was associated with the concept of 4A (attraction, amenity, accessibility, and ancillary service). Followed by a SWOT analysis, WTA (willing to accept) and WTP (willing to pay), and a descriptive analysis of economic potential. At least there were 3 ecotourism objects within the reach of GMIC of Rokan Hulu, namely Sipogas Lake Ecotourism, Hapanasan Hot Spring and Huta Sikapir Cave Ecotourism. Based on SWOT, WTA and WTP analysis, it was concluded that the objects have the economic potential to be developed as a natural ecotourism. It is recommended that the GMIC be the main icon tourism in this regency and while some other supporting tourism objects will naturally be developed.

J.; Hang, Chaoxun			An Overview of the MATERHORN Fog Project: Observations and Predictability	PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS												A field campaign design to study fog processes in complex terrain was a component of the Mountain Terrain Atmospheric Modeling and Observations (MATERHORN) Program. The experiment was conducted in the Wasatch Mountains during January 5-February 15, 2015. Fog and in particular, Ice fog (IF), defined as fog composed of only ice crystals, was studied during a part of the campaign, and this component of the program was dubbed MATERHORN-Fog. Ice fog often occurs in mountainous regions due do rapid cooling, such as radiative cooling, advective cooling, and cooling associated with mountain circulations (e.g., slope and valley winds). A variety of major instrument platforms were deployed, which included meteorological towers, a SODAR, a LiDAR, ceilometers, and a tethersonde profiler. In addition, in situ measurements took place at several locations surrounding Salt Lake City and Heber City. During the campaign, ice fog occurred at temperatures below -5 A degrees C down to -13 A degrees C and lasted for several hours until radiative heating became significant. The visibility (Vis) during ice fog events ranged from 100 m up to 10 km. At the Heber City site an array of sensors for measuring microphysical, radiative, and dynamical characteristics of IF events were deployed. Some local effects such as upslope advection were observed to affect the IF conditions. As expected during these events, ice water content (IWC) varied from 0.01 up to 0.2 g m(-3), with radiative cooling fluxes as strong as 200 W m(-2); turbulent heat and moisture fluxes were significantly lower during fog events than those of fog dissipation. At times, the measured ice crystal number concentration was as high as 100 cm(-3) during periods of saturation with respect to ice. N (i) was not a constant as usually assumed in forecasting simulations, but rather changed with increasing IWC. Measurement based statistics suggested that the occurrence of IF events in the region was up to 30 % during the study period in the winter of 2015. Temperature profiles suggested that an inversion layer contributed significantly to IF formation at Heber. Ice fog forecasts via Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model indicated the limitations of IF predictability. Results suggest that IF predictions need to be improved based on ice microphysical parameterizations and ice nucleation processes.					; Pu, Zhaoxia/ABN-0177-2022; Leo, Laura S/J-9529-2013	gultepe, ismail/0000-0002-8433-5953; Pu, Zhaoxia/0000-0003-4461-1789; Pardyjak, Eric/0000-0002-0180-0857													0033-4553	1420-9136				SEP	2016	173	9					2983	3010		10.1007/s00024-016-1374-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00024-016-1374-0													WOS:000382941400002

Cysts of P. bipes were formed throughout the blooms. Encystment flux of P. bipes in the pelagic zone was usually lower than those at shallow sites, and the density of P. bipes cysts in lake sediment was higher in the shallow region than in the pelagic zone. However, in the shallower region, the concentration of P. bipes cysts varied widely, possibly due to high rates of encystment and excystment. Peridinium bipes encystment occurred between 15-degrees and 25-degrees-C in the laboratory, with very little cyst formation below 10-degrees-C. Though cyst formation was observed in continuous darkness, the rate increased with irradiance. Under continuous darkness, no excystment was observed at any temperature from 5-degrees to 25-degrees-C. Eighty-one percent of the cysts illuminated at 105 muE.m-2.s-1 excysted after 13 days incubation at 15-degrees-C, and lower irradiances decreased germination success. Results from laboratory experiments suggest that light is a critical factor in the germination of P. bipes cysts. Bottom depth thus can have a significant effect on germination because cysts only can excyst from depths where light is sufficient. The shallow region of the lake is thus very important as a seed bed for P. bipes during early spring. Cysts deposited in deeper waters may not ever germinate unless they are resuspended and transported to shallow areas where light reaches the bottom.																			0022-3646					AUG	1993	29	4					435	441		10.1111/j.1529-8817.1993.tb00144.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1529-8817.1993.tb00144.x													WOS:A1993LU69500006

Both birds were fitted with transmitters (PTTs) in February 1994 and tracked, the immature for six months and three weeks, the subadult for eight months and two weeks, over distances of 10 084 and 16 773 km, respectively. During their time in Namibia both birds' movements were in response to good local rainfall. The immature eagle left Namibia at the end of February, the subadult at the end of March. They flew to their respective summer quarters in Hungary and the Ukraine, arriving there 2.5 and 1.5 months later than the breeding adults. The immature eagle took over two months longer on the homeward journey than a breeding male followed by telemetry in a previous study. On returning, the immature eagle followed the narrow flightpath through Africa used by other Lesser Spotted Eagles on their outward migration. It reached this corridor, which runs roughly between longitudes 31 degrees and 36 degrees East from Suez to Lake Tanganyika, veering from the shortest route in a direction east-northeast through Angola and Zambia to the southern end of Lake Tanganyika. The route taken by the subadult bird on its return migration differed markedly from that of all Lesser Spotted Eagles tracked to date, running further west through the Democratic Republic of Congo where, level with the equator, it flew over the eastern rainforest of that country. The outward migration, however, followed the same corridor and coincided in time with the migration of adults.

The present study provides the first dendrochronologically-based and calendar-dated Neoglacial glacier chronology for the Mont Blanc massif, French Alps. It is based on the analysis of over 240 glacially buried Pirtus cembra subfossil logs and wood remains found either embedded-in-till or as detrital material in the Mer de Glace right lateral moraine. Only a few of the samples were found to be 'formally in situ' but we show that some logs were Virtually in situ' (not rooted but showing little or no evidence of reworking) and could be used to accurately reconstruct past glacier margin behavior in space and time. Uncertainties regarding the other samples may relate to original growth location and/or to outer wood decay. The resulting dates (followed by a '+') were therefore considered maximum-limiting ages for glacier advances. The main burial events interpreted as glacier advances occurred between ca 1655+ and 1544+ BC, between ca 1230+ and 1105+ BC, between ca 1013+ and 962+/937+ BC, at ca 802-777 BC, after 608+ BC, between 312 and 337 AD, between ca 485+ AD and 606+ AD, between 1120 and 1178 AD, between ca 1248 and 1278+/1296 AD, and after 1352+ AD. These advances predate the late LIA maxima known from historical sources. The magnitude of the advances gradually increased to culminate in three nearNeoglacial maxima during the 7th, 12th and 13th centuries AD, followed by a first LIA/Neoglacial maximum in the second half of the 14th century AD. The pattern of Neoglacial events described here is coherent with Central and Eastern Alpine glacier chronologies. This indicates marked synchronicity of late Holocene glacier variability and forcing at a regional scale, although occasional differences could be detected between 'Western' and 'Eastern' records. The Mer de Glace record also confirms the link between the timing of sediment erosion in a high-elevation glaciated Alpine catchment and subsequent deposition in the sub-alpine Lake Bourget.

Viability of side-scan sonar to enumerate Paddlefish, a large pelagic freshwater fish, in rivers and reservoirs	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Recreational-grade side-scan sonar (SSS) has become an invaluable tool for inland fisheries, particularly when characterizing underwater habitat, but it is being increasingly used for enumerating large-bodied (> 1 m total length [TL]) aquatic fauna. We used SSS in river and reservoir environments to evaluate methods for identifying and counting Paddlefish Polyodon spathula, a large pelagic planktivore of recreational and economic importance that can exceed 2 m in length and weigh over 70 kg. We assessed accuracy and precision among readers to identify Paddlefish by assigning confidence scores (1-3; with 3 being more confident) to sonar images of a ballistics-gel filled fiberglass replica Paddlefish. Readers varied in their confidence scores for the replica Pad-dlefish and no reader could identify the target beyond 25 m from the transducer. Afterwards, we used SSS to survey several kilometers of a reservoir during summer residency and a large river during springtime spawning migrations. Two readers counted Paddlefish images in the SSS recordings and we estimated population size in the surveyed area with distance sampling. In the reservoir, the number of Paddlefish counted ranged from 172 to 184. In the river, the number of Paddlefish counted ranged from 165 to 617. The exponential model of distance was most-supported for detection in both environments, except there was support for a half-norm distribution for one reader in the river. In the reservoir, abundance estimates were statistically similar between readers at approximately 1500 (7/ha) in the total scanned area. In the river, similar abundance estimates were obtained with the half-norm model from one reader compared to the exponential model of the other reader, resulting in approximately 1500 individuals (30/ha) in the surveyed area. The application of SSS to count Paddlefish has some clear advantages to traditional methods, such as gill netting, and can be done at multiple times of the year. Distance sampling methods compensated for differences in counts among readers, indicating distance sampling can produce similar abundance estimates even when variation in counts exists among readers.

Field surveys have shown reduced species richness of submerged and floating-leaved plant communities in shallow lakes as winter nitrate concentrations, a surrogate for nitrate loading, have risen above 1-2 mg NO(3)-N L(-1). Experimental tank mesocosms, containing about 3 m(3) of water and sediment from Hickling Broad, Norfolk, UK were initially planted with eleven submerged plant species from the lake and its connected waterway. Constant phosphorus loadings (designed to give added concentrations of 50 mu g P L(-1)) were given to all tanks. Four nitrate loadings were given in a randomised block design with twelve-fold replication. Loadings were designed to increase the concentration in the water by 1, 2, 5 adn 10 mg NO(3)-N L(-1) (N1, N2, N5 and N10, respectively) Nitrate loading increased phytoplankton and periphyton chlorophyll a in the N2, N5 and N10 treatments compared with N1. It complementarily decreased total plant volume and had varied effects on different species, with most species indifferent, a few (mostly charophytes) declining above the N1 treatment, and one (Elodea canadensis) performing best in N2 and N5 compared with N1 and N10. Species richness of submerged macrphytes declined with time in all treatments and with increasing nitrogen load in the first year. In the second year, species richness did not further decline in the N1 treatment but declined at increasing rates with increasing nitrogen load in others. The rate of decline in the second year, plotted against nitrate load, fitted an exponential relationship, allowing calculation in inflow water, or of an empirically determined equivalent TN concentration in the lake water of about 1.50 mg N L(-1). This value broadly corresponds with estimates from field data for concentrations associated with declining species richness and is much lower than values currently often found in lowland agricultural areas in Europe.																			1863-9135						2008	173	2					89	100		10.1127/1863-9135/2008/0173-0089	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/1863-9135/2008/0173-0089													WOS:000262356500001
J	Brancato, M; Wolek, A				Brancato, Michael; Wolek, Artur			Adaptive Sampling of a Stationary Gaussian Spatial Process by a Team of Robots With Heterogeneous Dynamics and Measurement Noise Variance	IEEE ACCESS												This paper presents an algorithm for a team of heterogeneous mobile robots to estimate and adaptively sample a stationary, isotropic, Gaussian process. An estimation framework is proposed to assimilate measurements from robots with differing sensing capabilities (i.e., measurement noise variance). To improve computational efficiency of the Gaussian process regression, the survey area is divided into regions that each use a common semivariogram matrix constructed with a truncated measurement set determined by an adaptive selector. As the mission proceeds, a Voronoi-based algorithm periodically partitions a density function-representing time-varying sampling priority-to identify high-value sampling locations. The path for each robot is modeled as an mechanical system: a sequence of masses (waypoints) are interconnected by springs and dampers and pulled towards Voronoi cell centroids. At each path planning cycle the robots are iteratively simulated with heterogeneous dynamics (e.g., speed, turn radius) following their respective waypoint paths as stiffness/damping parameters are adjusted to satisfy mission time constraints. Numerical simulations show that the proposed approach reduces mapping error when compared to non-adaptive lawnmower coverage of a survey area. The algorithm is demonstrated experimentally using two cooperating autonomous surface vessels to map the bathymetry in a section of Lake Norman near Charlotte, NC.																			2169-3536						2024	12						94407	94423		10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3425430	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3425430													WOS:001272139800001
J	Adams, KD				Adams, Kenneth D.			Response of the Truckee River to lowering base level at Pyramid Lake, Nevada, based on historical air photos and LiDAR data	GEOSPHERE												The Truckee River in western Nevada has severely incised in response to a net 20 m of lake-level lowering of Pyramid Lake over the past 120 yr, leaving a suite of cut terraces that extend similar to 15 km upstream from the lake where incision was arrested by bedrock in the channel. Channel planform changes and terrace development were mapped over a 70 yr period using rectified aerial imagery and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data in ArcGIS. Discrete point elevations were extracted from the LiDAR data for channel remnants on each of the different-aged terraces and combined with channel distance measurements derived from the appropriate aerial imagery to derive true channel gradients for each of the photo years. These same point elevation measurements were also resolved to a common valley distance (CVD), as is often done when studying prehistorical terrace sequences. Comparison of the true channel distance (TCD) profiles to the CVD profiles demonstrates that the TCD profiles are longer and less steep than the CVD profiles. These differences exist because resolving terrace elevations to a CVD does not account for decreasing sinuosities and straighter channel planforms through time. As base level fell to its historical low elevation, the channel became steeper, straighter, and smoother, which increased the rate of sediment transport and delivery to Pyramid Lake. Over the past 120 yr, similar to 60,000,000 m(3) of sediment have been removed from the bed and banks of the lower river and redeposited in the lake, temporarily increasing the sedimentation rate. Larger trenches through deltaic and lacustrine deposits occupied by rivers and streams flowing into Pyramid Lake and other closed basins may reflect similar rapid responses to lowering base levels at times in the past. Therefore, lowering lake levels at Pyramid Lake and elsewhere during relatively dry times may be at least partly responsible for transient increases in sedimentation rates in lacustrine archives.																			1553-040X					JUN	2012	8	3					607	627		10.1130/GES00698.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/GES00698.1													WOS:000308940300006
J	Purdy, CW; Straus, DC; Harp, JA; Mock, R				Purdy, CW; Straus, DC; Harp, JA; Mock, R			Microbial pathogen survival study in a high plains feedyard playa	TEXAS JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												-Sixteen microbes and one enteric protozoal parasite were secured in screw-cap vials (CV) and dialysis tubes (DT) and placed in a feedyard shallow lake (playa) in the West Texas High Plains, USA. They were removed weekly or monthly depending on their susceptibility to the water environment. There were two overlapping studies; one started in September 1996 and was terminated 390 days later. The second study started in May 1997 and was terminated 188 days later. These controlled studies were used to determine the decrease in titers of 10 bacteria (Pasteurella haemolytica A1, Pasteurella multocida A:3, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Actinomyces pyogenes, Salmonella enterica serovar dublin, Bacillus thuringiensis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa); two fungi (Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus niger); four viruses (Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheaitis (IBR), Bovine Virus:Diarrhea Virus (BVD), Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus (BRSV), Bovine Parvovirus (BPV) and one protozoal parasite (Cryptosporidium parvum), over time. The Pasteurella isolates died in both studies within seven to 35 days. Actinomyces pyogenes died within 84 days in the 1996 study and survived for 188 days in the 1997 study. The remaining bacterial isolates in 1996 survived for 390 days with low titers, except for P. aeruginosa. Both fungal isolates died by 390 days in the 1996 study. All bacteria and fungi survived the 188 day study in 1997, except for the Pasteurella isolates. The titers of the viruses decreased rapidly over 42 days, except for BPV in the 1996 study, and all viruses were inactivated by day 42 in the 1997 study. Cryptosporidium parvum survived the 1996 winter but lost it's ability to infect infant mice during the month of May, 1997. Microbial survival decreased more rapidly in DT samples compared to CV samples.																			0040-4403					AUG	2001	53	3					247	266																WOS:000171174400005
J	LATHROP, RC				LATHROP, RC			DECLINE IN ZOOBENTHOS DENSITIES IN THE PROFUNDAL SEDIMENTS OF LAKE MENDOTA (WISCONSIN, USA)	HYDROBIOLOGIA					5TH INTERNATIONAL SYMP ON SEDIMENT / WATER INTERACTIONS	AUG 06-09, 1990	UPPSALA, SWEDEN	INT ASSOC SEDIMENT WATER SCI, NATL SWEDISH ENVIRONM PROTECT BOARD, UPPSALA UNIV, UPPSALA WATER CTR				High densities of zoobenthos inhabited Lake Mendota's profundal zone in the early 1900s through the mid-1940s. Chaoborus punctipennis was the most abundant organism during the winter, along with moderate densities of Chironomus spp., Pisidium sp., oligochaetes, and Procladius sp. By the early 1950s, Chaoborus punctipennis densities had declined to 10 % of former levels, while Chironomus increased significantly. However, by the mid-1960s, Chaoborus, Chironomus, and Pisidium densities had decreased to very low population levels. By 1987-89, Pisidium was no longer found. Zoobenthos that had not decreased from earlier surveys were oligochaetes and Procladius, although further sampling of oligochaetes is needed to confirm current densities. These organisms are the most tolerant of severe anoxia. Four possible reasons for this decline were evaluated: (a) decline in food availability, (b) increase in fish predation, (c) use of toxic insecticides in the drainage basin, and (d) changes in the profundal sediment environment. Based on literature information and long-term data for Lake Mendota, a change in the profundal sediment environment is the most likely explanation for the decline in the less-tolerant zoobenthos species. Although the duration and extent of anoxia in the hypolimnion have not changed since the early 1900s, hypolimnetic ammonia and hydrogen sulfide concentrations apparently have increased as Mendota became more eutrophic after the mid-1940s. However, further study is needed to determine if these higher concentrations or other factors were responsible for the dramatic decline in lake Mendota's profundal zoobenthos.																			0018-8158					JUL 17	1992	235						353	361		10.1007/BF00026225	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00026225													WOS:A1992JM30800031

Northeastern mountain ponds as sentinels of change: Current and emerging research and monitoring in the context of shifting chemistry and climate interactions	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Mountain ponds in the northeastern US have undergone acidification and subsequent recovery due to changes in atmospheric deposition, and also reflect physical and biological responses to climate change. These ponds are distinct from other lakes and ponds in the region as they are higher in elevation, relatively small, and have little direct impact from human land use in their watersheds. They are vulnerable to the increases in extreme weather events, overall warming, and shortening of winter that are occurring throughout the northeastern US. We compiled data collected from 1978 to 2019 for mountain ponds >500 m elevation and <60 ha surface area across the northeastern US (Northern Appalachians and Adirondack Mountains). The full dataset includes 257 ponds; 36% of the sites were sampled at sufficient frequency to conduct trend analyses from the 1980s through 2010s. We found widespread, significant declines in sulfate concentrations (95% of sites, similar to 44% decline) and significantly increasing ANC at 53% of sites (46% of sites-no trend; 1%-significant decrease). Significant declining conductivity at 97% of sites (33% decline) suggested dilution (14.0 mu S/cm by the 2010s), and also reflected low chloride concentrations at these sites compared to others in the region affected by road salt contamination. DOC increased significantly in 54% of ponds (45% of sites-no trend; 1%-significant decrease). Increasing DOC has been attributed to both changing sulfate and climate related to increases in precipitation and air temperature. Other changes are occurring in these ponds alongside trends in water chemistry, such as thermal structures shifting as air temperature warms. Zooplankton communities are sensitive to water chemistry parameters associated with acidification recovery, such as DOC, but climate change may complicate transitions back to pre-acidification community composition. Based on this synthesis and a case study that integrates chemical, physical, and biological research, we developed a conceptual model and framework for research and monitoring to support measurements of change in these ecosystems. The findings indicate the importance of eastern mountain ponds in understanding combined impacts of atmospheric deposition and climate change on lake ecosystems and highlight future research directions.					; McDowell, William/E-9767-2010	McDowell, William/0000-0002-8739-9047; 													1352-2310	1873-2844				NOV 1	2021	264								118694	10.1016/j.atmosenv.2021.118694	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2021.118694		SEP 2021											WOS:000734471700004

The lake had hosted a vibrant brown trout population in the first half of the 20th century, which then became extinct around the 1960s due to strong atmospheric acidification, peaking in the 1980s. However, since the 1990s, a gradual reversibility in acidification has occurred. This positive trend was delayed after tree dieback in the lake catchment in the 2000s. The following detailed monitoring showed recurrent critical periods of low pH and ANC, and elevated concentrations of ionic Al. This was especially in spring, lasting until the late 2010s. Electrofishing from 2020 to 2022 indicated suitable conditions for permanent fish populations. In comparison to previous electrofishing (2005-2010), brown trout colonised Lake Laka and formed a stable population in the lake outflow. Downstream of the lake, the fish abundance remained similar to those some ten years earlier. In contrast to the brown trout, the bullhead was only found in the stream below the lake, as it was unable to migrate to the upper areas due to natural barriers. The recovery of the brown trout population in Lake Laka after the acidification phase is an example of the successful restoration of a disturbed aquatic ecosystem under pristine conditions.					; Peterka, Jiří/C-7218-2014; Blabolil, Petr/K-9548-2015; Draštík, Vladislav/G-2222-2014; Muska, Milan/A-7978-2014; Juza, Tomas/G-3159-2014; Kopacek, Jiri/A-7373-2014; Vrba, Jaroslav/M-3780-2013	Drastik, Vladislav/0000-0002-9419-6977; Muska, Milan/0000-0001-6659-986X; Blabolil, Petr/0000-0003-1344-9627; Peterka, Jiri/0000-0001-5935-4311; Vrba, Jaroslav/0000-0003-2145-9024													0049-6979	1573-2932				NOV	2024	235	11							723	10.1007/s11270-024-07537-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-024-07537-z													WOS:001327012000002

Many buildings lie above the tunnel, the buried depth of which is among 130-150 m; 13 m away from the tunnel on the south side there is a lake about 0.033 km(2) in area and water capacity of approximately 2 x 105 m(3), which mainly accepts replenishment of rainfall and karst water. The geological environment of the site is very fragile and easily affected by the construction of tunnel. Tunnel construction will inevitably cause inrush water and have an effect on groundwater system in the karst valley, which will cause the dropping of groundwater and lake water level, drying up of wells and springs, even karst collapse within the affected area. The key to solve these problems is controlling water drainage during tunnel construction. In this paper, the establishment of a fullscale range of three-dimensional finite element model is based on the analysis of hydrogeological conditions of the karst valley, combined with the supplementary geological survey during tunnel construction, the test of the amount of inrush water, and the research of monitoring data about lake water level. By controlling the permeability coefficient of the rocks surrounding the tunnel, the effect of tunnel drainage control to the karst valley groundwater system is studied, providing reference basis for the tunnel site geological environment protection and tunnel supporting design.

J	Pulley, S; Foster, I				Pulley, Simon; Foster, Ian			Can channel banks be the dominant source of fine sediment in a UK river?: an example using 137Cs to interpret sediment yield and sediment source	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Cultivated fields have been shown to be the dominant sources of sediment in almost all investigated UK catchments, typically contributing 85 to 95% of sediment inputs. As a result, most catchment management strategies are directed towards mitigating these sediment inputs. However, in many regions of the UK such as the Nene basin there is a paucity of sediment provenance data. This study used the caesium-137 (Cs-137) inventories of lake and floodplain cores as well as the Cs-137 activities of present day sediment to determine sediment provenance. Sediment yields were also reconstructed in a small lake catchment. Low Cs-137 inventories were present in the lake and floodplain cores in comparison to the reference inventory and inventories in cores from other UK catchments. Caesium-137 activities in the present day sediments were low; falling close to those found in the channel bank catchment samples. It was estimated that 60 to 100% of the sediment in the Nene originated from channel banks. Pre-1963 sediment yields were approximately 11.2 t km(-2) yr(-1) and post-1963 was approximately 11.9 t km(-2) yr(-1). The lack of increased sediment yield post-1963 and low sediment yield is unusual for a UK catchment (where a yield of 28 to 51 t km(-2) yr(-1) is typical for a lowland agricultural catchment), but is explained by the low predicted contribution of sediment from agricultural topsoils. The high channel bank contribution is likely caused by the river being starved of sediment from topsoils, increasing its capacity to entrain bank material. The good agreement between the results derived using cores and recently transported sediments, highlight the reliability of Cs-137 when tracing sediment sources. However, care should be taken to assess the potential impacts of sediment particle size, sediment focusing in lakes and the possible remobilization of 137Cs from sedimentary deposits.

The Round Loch is situated on granite bedrock and is likely to have been sensitive to acidification throughout the post-glacial period. (2) About 9000 years B.P. the open habitats of the late and early post-glacial were replaced by birch/hazel woodland, then oak/elm/pine woodland, and oak/hazel/alder woodland by about 5400 years B.P. After 5700 years B.P., blanket mires increasingly replaced woodland. The present vegetation on the blanket peat is a Molinia/Calluna heathland. (3) The lake was acid in the late-glacial period (pH 5.3-5.7). No evidence of long-term acidification in the early post-glacial period was found, and from 9000-4150 years B.P. the pH of the loch was probably between 5.3 and 5.6. In th mid post-glacial no indication of lake acidification that might be associated with peat development in the catchment was identified, and from 4100 years B.P. there is evidence that a slight increase in pH or nutrient availability or both occurred. (4) Despite a clear change from mineral to acid organic soils in the catchment in the mid post-glacial, feedback mechanisms operated to maintain a lake with pH stable at 5 and above for most of the post-glacial period. With the introduction of strong acid anions associated with acid deposition after A.D. 1800 the pH fell to its present value of 4.7.

Malacological survey and geographical distribution of vector snails for schistosomiasis within informal settlements of Kisumu City, western Kenya	PARASITES & VECTORS												Background: Although schistosomiasis is generally considered a rural phenomenon, infections have been reported within urban settings. Based on observations of high prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni infection in schools within the informal settlements of Kisumu City, a follow-up malacological survey incorporating 81 sites within 6 informal settlements of the City was conducted to determine the presence of intermediate host snails and ascertain whether active transmission was occurring within these areas. Methods: Surveyed sites were mapped using a geographical information system. Cercaria shedding was determined from snails and species of snails identified based on shell morphology. Vegetation cover and presence of algal mass at the sites was recorded, and the physico-chemical characteristics of the water including pH and temperature were determined using a pH meter with a glass electrode and a temperature probe. Results: Out of 1,059 snails collected, 407 (38.4%) were putatively identified as Biomphalaria sudanica, 425 (40.1%) as Biomphalaria pfeifferi and 227 (21.5%) as Bulinus globosus. The spatial distribution of snails was clustered, with few sites accounting for most of the snails. The highest snail abundance was recorded in Nyamasaria (543 snails) followed by Nyalenda B (313 snails). As expected, the mean snail abundance was higher along the lakeshore (18 +/- 12 snails) compared to inland sites (dams, rivers and springs) (11 +/- 32 snails) (Gamma(1, 79) = 38.8, P < 0.0001). Overall, 19 (1.8%) of the snails collected shed schistosome cercariae. Interestingly, the proportion of infected Biomphalaria snails was higher in the inland (2.7%) compared to the lakeshore sites (0.3%) (P = 0.0109). B. sudanica was more abundant in sites along the lakeshore whereas B. pfeifferi and B. globosus were more abundant in the inland sites. Biomphalaria and Bulinus snails were found at 16 and 11 out of the 56 inland sites, respectively. Conclusions: The high abundance of Biomphalaria and Bulinus spp. as well as observation of field-caught snails shedding cercariae confirmed that besides Lake Victoria, the local risk for schistosomiasis transmission exists within the informal settlements of Kisumu City. Prospective control interventions in these areas need to incorporate focal snail control to complement chemotherapy in reducing transmission.

Ammonia emissions from a beef feedlot: Comparison of inverse modeling techniques using long-path and point measurements of fenceline NH3	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Nitrogen (N) deposition in Rocky Mountain National Park, USA (RMNP) and adjacent alpine ecosystems has led to increased focus on ammonia (NH3) emissions from livestock operations in this region. A study was conducted at a commercial beef feedlot in Northern Colorado, USA to quantify NH3 fluxes, estimate emission factors (EFs), and evaluate measurement methodologies. Point and line-integrated fenceline NH3 measurements were taken over a 78-day study at a large feedlot east of RMNP focusing on transport towards the park. Ammonia fluxes were estimated using two inverse models, a backward Lagrangian stochastic approach (WindTrax) and a simpler inverse dispersion approach (FIDES) using input data from both NH3 datasets. Line-integrated NH3 concentrations were obtained from a long-path laser and single-point concentrations were collected with a cavity ring-down analyzer, both positioned on the downwind fenceline. Mean feedlot NH3 concentration (+/- 1 standard deviation, sigma) was 601 +/- 246 mu g m(-3) (1013 +/- 421 ppbv), where peak values often exceeded several ppmv. Concentrations from the long-path sensor were slightly higher than the point sensor when winds were from the feedlot (p = 0.0005), but 2.5 times less data were collected with the long-path instrument due to dust or laser-reflector alignment issues. Regardless of the model used, fluxes showed a diel pattern peaking in the afternoon with early morning minimums. Emissions varied more by inverse model than by sensor, with WindTrax emissions 25% higher than FIDES. Composite 24-h mean emissions (+/- 1 sigma) from FIDES were 48 +/- 24 mu g m-2 s-1 (EF = 71 +/- 35 g hd(-1) d(-1)), while WindTrax averaged 60 +/- 30 mu g m(-2) s(-1 )(EF = 89 +/- 44 g hd(-1) d(-1)) (p <<0.0001). Overall 24-h mean EF for the summer (across both models) was 80 +/- 39 g hd(-1) d(-1). When dietary N was considered (13.25% crude protein), based on 24-h composites FIDES estimated NH3-N released to the atmosphere to be 35.6% of fed-N, while WindTrax showed 44.6% fed-N. The overall mean across models was 40.0% fed-N.

J	Anesio, AM; Granéli, W				Anesio, AM; Granéli, W			Increased photoreactivity of DOC by acidification:: Implications for the carbon cycle in humic lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Effects of ultraviolet (UV)-B radiation and acidification on pelagic carbon flux in a humic lake (dissolved organic carbon [DOC] similar to15 mg C L-1) were studied in a mesocosm experiment during the summer of 2000. Triplicate tanks (107 liters volume, 1 m high) were exposed to natural solar radiation, a daily extra dose of UV-B radiation, or kept dark. One set of tanks was submitted to a decrease in pH (from 5.7 to 4.7), and one set was kept at the natural pH level. During 70 d, water samples were taken regularly from the mesocosms for measurements of DOC, absorbance, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and pH. Additionally, we regularly incubated samples to measure photooxidation rates, primary production, and community respiration. We found an increase in the photooxidation rates in the acidified mesocosms relative to ambient pH. The greater abiotic production of DIC (i.e., photooxidation) in acidified conditions could explain similar to27% of the decline in DOC in the same conditions. Laboratory experiments were done to test the effects of pH on the dissolved organic matter (DOM) photoreactivity. At lower pH values, we found both higher abiotic DIC production and specific absorbance fading, relative to neutral pH values in water from a humic lake. In a separate experiment, samples were exposed to prolonged irradiation under laboratory conditions, resulting in complete loss of absorptivity in the wavelengths between 290 and 400 nm. Decreases in DOC in the long-term exposure caused by photochemical mineralization were similar to45 and 55% of the initial pool for natural pH and acidified samples, respectively, at the end of the experiment. An increase in the dissolved organic matter photoreactivity by acidification could be an important mechanism to explain the increased water transparency and in-lake DOC removal in acid lakes found in several previous studies.					; Anesio, Alexandre/A-7597-2008	Anesio, Alexandre/0000-0003-2990-4014; 													0024-3590					MAR	2003	48	2					735	744		10.4319/lo.2003.48.2.0735	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2003.48.2.0735													WOS:000181758700013
J	Anderson, DM; Archer, RB				Anderson, DM; Archer, RB			Preliminary evidence of early deglaciation in southern Chile	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The end of the last ice age in the channels of southern Chile is recorded by resumed sedimentation in formerly ice-filled basins. To identify the timing of initial ice retreat in Southern Chile, we examined ice-proximal sediments from a proglacial lake along the eastern margin of the Magallanes ice sheet, an environment thought to be sensitive to initial melting (Porter, S.C,, Clapperton, C.M., Sugden, D.E., 1992. Chronology and dynamics of deglaciation along and near the Strait of Magellan, southernmost South America. Sver. Geol. Unders. 81, 233-239). AMS-radiocarbon dates of the supra-till deposits in two cores indicate that sedimentation resumed 18 radiocarbon kyr. Deposition in kettle-holes and bogs on the adjacent land surfaces began at the same time or earlier (17-25 radiocarbon kyr) (Clapperton, C.M., Sugden, D.E., Kaufman, D.S., McCulloch, R.D., 1995. The last glaciation in central Magellan Strait, Southernmost Chile. Quat. Res. 44, 133-148). Our preliminary interpretation is that these events indicate initial deglaciation in the region and the formation of a large proglacial lake, followed several thousand years later by the invasion of salt water as sea level rose. Deglaciation in southers Chile occurred too early to be forced by the resumption of North Atlantic Deep Water formation, sea level rise, or northern hemisphere summer insolation, and we suggest instead that southern insolation played a role. The time of initial deglaciation in southern Chile (21-27 calendar kyr) occurred as southern hemisphere annual insolation increased from a minimum at 29 calendar kyr (6 W/m(2) less than today at 80 degrees S).

A massive landslide damming event has been reported in the Jishixia Gorge on the upper Yellow River as it emerges from the NE Tibetan Plateau. It was speculated that a breach of the dammed lake might have resulted in a super flood disaster that ruined the major Neolithic settlement at Lajia (4.20-3.95ka BP) within the Guanting Basin that is located in the downstream. However, our detailed investigations along the Jishixia Gorge and Guanting Basin indicate that the dammed lake became shallower and desiccated gradually rather than breaching suddenly. The Yellow River has cut into the dammed lake deposits forming well-exposed profiles on the riverbanks. The dammed lake deposits are considered to provide an accurate natural record of the life-span of the dammed lake. Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating was carried out on a series of eight samples taken from the profile. The OSL ages of the dammed lake deposits fall within the range of 8.25 +/- 0.39 to 5.65 +/- 0.21ka at the Yisiri site about 2.5km upstream of the landslide dam. These results indicate that the massive landslide damming event and the corresponding dammed lake occurred at 8.25ka in the early Holocene. The dammed lake existed for about 2600years and desiccated gradually and disappeared at 5.65ka because the landslide dam was dissected slowly by the Yellow River. This means that the landslide dammed lake on the Yellow River disappeared about 1700years before the Neolithic settlement at Lajia became ruins. The landslide damming event in the Jishixia Gorge is not related to the prehistorical catastrophic disasters that overcame the Lajia settlement within the Guanting Basin.

Before ca. 13 ka BP, the surface of the lake was lower, indicating a deficiency of effective precipitation and dry climate, the result of relatively decreased monsoon precipitation. During ca. 13 11 ka BP the lake surface ascended to a relatively higher level, marking a significant increase of effective precipitation. The climate became humid, indicating strengthened monsoon rainfall. Then, the lake surface experienced a sharp decline ca. 11-10 ka BP, this could suggest a severe reduction of effective monsoon precipitation and drier climate. Ca. 10-9.0 ka BP, the lake surface area expanded temporarily as the level rose, denoting the amelioration of monsoon-related effective precipitation and a relatively humid climate. Subsequently, the lake surface declined at ca. 9.0-7.3 ka BP, reflecting the prevalence of dry climate and relatively decreased monsoon precipitation. Higher lake level and larger lake depth indicated large scale expansion of the lake surface at ca.7.3-3.2 kit BP, despite some secondary fluctuations, This implied plentiful monsoon-related effective precipitation and more humid climate in the lake basin. Since ca. 3.2 ka BP, the lake surface has experienced a severe fall, except for a minor rise around 2.0 ka BP, indicating dry climate as a whole from waning monsoon precipitation and relatively increased evaporation. The effective precipitation variations revealed by lake surface fluctuations in Lake Daihai since the late glaciation are not only related to forcing factors such as insolation and temperature-driven air masses from the continent and the ocean, but are also influenced by regional feedback from topography, vegetation coverage and hydrological status.

The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, known as the Third Pole of the world, contains numerous lakes. Compared with some information, such as the area, water level, and ice phenology of its lakes, the ice thickness of these lakes remains poorly understood. In this study, we used an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with a 400/900 MHz ice-penetrating radar to detect the ice thickness of Qinghai Lake and Gahai Lake. Two observation fields were established on the western side of Qinghai Lake and Gahai Lake in January 2019 and January 2021, respectively. Based on the in situ ice thickness and the propagation time of the radar, the accuracy of the ice thickness measurements of these two non-freshwater lakes was comprehensively assessed. The results indicate that pre-processed echo images from the UAV-borne ice-penetrating radar identified non-freshwater lake ice, and we were thus able to accurately calculate the propagation time of radar waves through the ice. The average dielectric constants of Qinghai Lake and Gahai Lake were 4.3 and 4.6, respectively. This means that the speed of the radar waves that propagated through the ice of the non-freshwater lake was lower than that of the radio waves that propagated through the freshwater lake. The antenna frequency of the radar also had an impact on the accuracy of ice thickness modeling. The RMSEs were 0.034 m using the 400 MHz radar and 0.010 m using the 900 MHz radar. The radar with a higher antenna frequency was shown to provide greater accuracy in ice thickness monitoring, but the control of the UAV's altitude and speed should be addressed.						zhou, sugang/0009-0009-6669-3798; Xiaojun, Yao/0000-0003-3127-9473														2072-4292				MAR	2024	16	6							959	10.3390/rs16060959	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs16060959													WOS:001192870900001

At Lake Cerknica, long-term data on water levels and temperatures, combined with four decades of Landsat satellite imagery, allowed for a comprehensive analysis of reed stand dynamics of three different reed stands using the modified soil adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI2) and an index differentiating technique. Decision tree-based data mining using the M5P algorithm effectively identified significant changes in MSAVI2. Previous MSAVI2 values were key predictors for detecting increases in the following year, while water level data, particularly high summer water levels, were critical for identifying significant decreases. Smaller changes were less reliably predicted, but temperature data emerged as a more influential predictor in such cases. Long-term field measurements of common reed biomass confirmed the accuracy of remotely sensed data. Yearly dynamics of reed stands showed a consistent alternation between significant changes in MSAVI2 with short periods of smaller changes. The largest amplitude of change occurred at the reed stand most affected by disturbances. Despite these annual fluctuations, reed stands maintained long-term equilibrium but require continued monitoring to identify years where a decrease in reed vitality is expected. Consequently, mowing events in such years should be minimised. The findings highlight the utility of combining remote sensing with environmental data to develop predictive models that recognize changes of reed stand vitality, providing crucial information for effective reed management.

Fish-habitat relationships in rivers are also influenced by human impacts. In this study, we describe patterns of abundance and distribution of fish species in a group of natural lowland river lakes along spatial anthropogenic and abiotic gradients when four hydrologically different summers are compared. We also describe the proportion of the total variances in fish species abundances that can be accounted for by selected abiotic (water conductivity), hydrological (water residence time) and human activity-derived (total phosphorus (TP) concentration and NO3:NH4) variables. Consequently, our main purpose is to explore how abiotic and anthropogenic factors interact to affect fish abundance and distribution together with consistent results across different hydrological conditions. We conclude with a briefly discussion of some management implications. The anthropogenic impacts on water quality, the extreme hydrological variability and the fluctuating abiotic environment affected fish abundance and distribution. Pampa inland silverside Odontesthes bonariensis was benefited from a less human disturbed environment with higher water residence time and total salinity, whereas species as Cyphocharax voga,. Parapimelodus valenciennis and Cyprinus carpio found these conditions largely disadvantages. On the other hand, while most species showed stronger-either negative or positive-response to anthropogenic, hydrological or abiotic factors Oligosarcus jenynsii was only slightly affected. This paper identified the ecological function of a lowland river under its natural flow regime. There are not many opportunities to study unmodified rivers worldwide. Therefore, our findings may help in assessment programmes of fish communities in flow altered and human disturbed aquatic ecosystems. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J.; Karaguler, Nevin Gul			Exploring extreme environments in Türkiye for novel P450s through metagenomic analysis	PLOS ONE												Cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s), particularly those of microbial origin, are highly versatile biocatalysts capable of catalyzing a broad range of regio- and stere-oselective reactions. P450s derived from extremophiles are of particular interest due to their potential tolerance to high temperature, salinity, and acidity. This study aimed to identify and classify novel microbial P450 enzymes from extreme environments across T & uuml;rkiye, including hydrothermal springs, hypersaline lakes, and an acid-mine drainage site. The focus of this study was on classifying the sequence diversity of P450 enzymes in these sites. To that end, shotgun metagenomic analysis of six sites, using de novo binning, phylogenetic analysis, and functional gene annotation, was used to discover 311 putative P450 sequences, assigned to 87 families and 158 subfamilies, including 8 novel families and 49 new subfamilies. Of these, 237 were in 138 metagenomic bins, including 45 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes. The distribution of P450 families varied across sites, reflecting distinct environmental conditions and microbial community compositions. These findings highlight the untapped potential of T & uuml;rkiye's extreme habitats as a source of novel biocatalysts. Beyond their industrial relevance, extremophile-derived P450s may also play key roles in enabling microbial adaptation to harsh environmental conditions, through their involvement in stress-responsive metabolic pathways and structurally resilient enzyme forms. This work provides a foundation for future studies into both their biotechnological applications and ecological functions.

J	McCracken, KG; Afton, AD; Peters, MS				McCracken, KG; Afton, AD; Peters, MS			Condition bias of hunter-shot ring-necked ducks exposed to lead	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												We evaluated the condition bias hypothesis for ring-necked ducks (Aythya collaris) exposed to lead by testing the null hypothesis that ducks shot by hunters do not differ in physiological condition from those collected randomly from the same location. After adjusting for structural body size and log(e) concentration of blood lead, we found that overall body condition differed significantly between collection types and age classes, and marginally between sexes. Ingesta-free body mass of ring-necked ducks sampled randomly; averaged 8.8% greater than those shot over decoys, and 99% of this difference was accounted for by lipid reserves. Ingesta, ash, and protein did not differ between collection types; however; after-hatching-year (AHY) birds had 5.1% more ash and 4.8% more protein than did hatching-year (HY) birds. The only sex difference was that males had 4.1% more protein than did females. Ingesta-free body mass, lipids, and protein were negatively related to concentration of blood lead. Collection type by-concentration of blood lead and age-by-sex-by-concentration of blood lead interactions were not significant. To the extent that lead pellets persist as a cause of disease or mortality, waterfowl biologists should account for lead exposure as a possible source of condition bias when estimating population parameters and modeling survival of ring-necked ducks and other waterfowl species prone to ingest lead. These findings further underscore the problem that ingested lead shotgun pellets pose for waterfowl.																			0022-541X	1937-2817				APR	2000	64	2					584	590		10.2307/3803256	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3803256													WOS:000086543100027

Along with lyric poetry, letters will play a central role in her experience as a writer, as evidence of a way of life in a pre-technological society. These are pages, some of which are still unpublished, on which this contribution intends to dwell, registering first of all the character of a female narrative, on which movements and encounters affect, highlighting the spirit of a woman who is free and lively, melancholic and tormented, inclined to introject feelings and ideals on which her soul will be nourished. It is also to be noted that the years spent in Umbria, since the dawn of the new century, will constitute a happy part of her existence, witnessed by her falling in love with that land and the landscape, particularly the muffled landscape of Lake Trasimeno, which she will be able to capture with the sensitivity and refinement of an uncommon humanistic education. Traits that still emerge from the correspondences entertained with prominent figures in early 20th-century literary-worldly society, in which Aganoor occupies a non-secondary role, thanks to her aristocratic origins and her subsequent marriage to Perugian deputy Guido Pompilj.

Improvements to the Water Quality of the Acidic Berkeley Pit Lake due to Copper Recovery and Sludge Disposal	MINE WATER AND THE ENVIRONMENT												The chemistry and limnology of the Berkeley Pit lake, located in Butte, Montana, have substantially changed during the past 15 years. These changes are due to: (1) a large-scale Cu recovery project in which deep water was pumped to a Cu precipitation plant and returned to the surface of the lake; and (2) in-pit disposal of lime-treatment sludge. As a consequence, the lake has shifted from a meromictic to a holomictic state, over 99% of the dissolved Fe has precipitated as schwertmannite and other ferric solids, the total acidity of the water column has dropped by roughly 35%, and the pH has risen from about 2.5 to near 4.1. Whereas most of the lake was anoxic prior to 2013, the water column now contains > 6 mg/L dissolved oxygen from the lake surface to the deepest levels sampled (> 150 m). Concentrations of several other solutes, including As, P, Cr, and V, have fallen sharply due to adsorption or co-precipitation with Fe, while other species, such as Al, Mg, and Mn, have increased due to dissolution of solids in the sludge. Although the Cu recovery circuit was discontinued in 2013, in-pit disposal of sludge is expected to continue. The pit water is now close to saturation with basaluminite, and the pH should remain poised in the range of 4.1-4.5 for many years as Al precipitates out of the water column. Pumping and treating of pit water is set to commence in 2019, and will continue for the foreseeable future. Continued in-pit disposal of sludge should translate into long term water-quality improvement and a decrease in annual lime-consumption costs. Although the Berkeley Pit still has a long ways to go before it will meet water quality standards, it is heartening to mine-water specialists that the pit lake may not be a problem that is "too big to fix".

Landscape variability of vegetation change across the forest to tundra transition of central Canada	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Widespread increases in the productivity of tundra ecosystems and static trends or even declines in boreal ecosystems have been detected since the early 1980s using coarse-scale remote sensing. However, intermediate scale Landsat studies have shown that these changes are heterogeneous and may be related to landscape and regional variability in climate, land cover, topography and moisture availability. In this study, a Landsat Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series (1984-2016) was examined for an area spanning the transition from sub-Arctic boreal forest to Low Arctic tundra in central Canada. This was supplemented by analyses of relationships with a suite of environmental variables and in situ measurements of bulk vegetation volume. Results show that NDVI trends were generally positive (i.e. increasing) across the study area but were smallest in the forest zone and largest in the northern tundra zone. More than one-quarter (27%) of un-masked pixels exhibited a significant (p < 0.05) trend and virtually all (99.3%) of those pixels exhibited an increasing, or "greening", trend. Greening pixels were most common in the northern tundra zone and the southern ecotone zone. Random Forest modeling of the relationship between NDVI and environmental variables indicated that the magnitude and direction of trends varied across the forest to tundra transition. Areas that experienced larger increases in NDVI include: (i) areas where summer temperatures increased; (ii) areas exhibiting predominantly shrub and forest cover; and (iii) locations closer to major drainage systems, further from major lakes, and at lower elevations. Ground validation in the central portion of the study area reveals a strong relationship (R-2 = 0.79) between vegetation volume and NDVI for non-tree functional groups and that alder (Alnus crispa) shrublands and open spruce (Picea mariana and P. glauca) woodland with shrubby understories were most likely to exhibit greening. These findings indicate that the largest positive and more significant NDVI trends were associated with increased productivity in shrub-dominated environments, especially at, and north of the treeline in localities with favorable growing conditions. Smaller and less significant NDVI trends in boreal forest environments south of the treeline were likely associated with long-term successional change following disturbance rather than the variables analyzed here.

J	Locke, CA; Johnson, SA; Cassidy, J; Mauk, JL				Locke, CA; Johnson, SA; Cassidy, J; Mauk, JL			Geophysical exploration of the Puhipuhi epithermal area, Northland, New Zealand	JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION												The Puhipuhi epithermal area, which occurs in a region of graywacke basement partially covered by basalt and lake-bed deposits, is characterized by both large-scale and small-scale geophysical anomalies. Known occurrences of locally intense alteration or silicification are typically associated with strong gravity, resistivity or LP anomalies. Gravity data define a complex negative residual anomaly (up to -50 gu) which has been used to identify and delineate a large area (about 20 km(2)) of low-density presumably clay-altered, graywacke basement rocks. This zone, modeled as extending to a few kilometers depth, encompasses, but is more extensive than, the known areas of alteration and has a close spatial association with the basalt cover rocks. Short-wavelength gravity minima and maxima, which indicate that the most intense alteration of the basement rocks occurs below the basalt, correlate, in part, with the inferred location of hydrothermal upflow zones. The control on the location of these zones and their relationship to the location of the basalts is not well known; however, if the basalts acted as a cap rock to the geothermal system, then these areas merit further exploration. High (greater than or equal to 100 ohm-m) and low (less than or equal to 10 ohm-m) resistivity and high (greater than or equal to 30 mS) IP anomalies occur in association with known silicification, clay alteration and sulfide mineralisation, respectively. In addition, magnetic data help constrain the relative timing of hydrothermal alteration and basaltic volcanism and indicate that mineralisation was broadly synchronous with volcanism.

J	Sutter, TJ; Newman, RM				Sutter, TJ; Newman, RM			Is predation by sunfish (Lepomis spp.) an important source of mortality for the Eurasian watermilfoil biocontrol agent Euhrychiopsis lecontei?	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												The aquatic weevil Euhrychiopsis Lecontei is a potential control agent for Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum). Predation by fishes may influence populations of this beneficial insect. To determine if fish predation is an important source of mortality for E. Lecontei, fish stomachs from two Minnesota lakes, Lake Auburn and Cedar Lake, were sampled monthly during the summer of 1994. None of the black crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus) or yellow perch (Perca flavescens) stomachs from either lake contained E. lecontei. The frequency of occurrence of E. lecontei larvae and adults in sunfish (bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus)) stomachs from Lake Auburn ranged from 10.3% in September to 28.6% in August. The mean number of E. lecontei adults per sunfish stomach from Lake Auburn ranged from 0.18 +/- 0.13 (+/- 2 S.E.) in May and July to 2.14 +/- 2.90 in August. Larvae of E. lecontei were found only in stomachs collected in August (mean = 0.21 +/- 0.31) and September (mean = 0.33 +/- 0.41). Euhrychiopsis lecontei pupae were not found in fish stomachs from either lake. Euhrychiopsis lecontei was rarely represented in the diet of sunfish from Cedar Lake. Larvae and adults were found in sunfish. stomachs from Cedar Lake only during September (3.7% of stomachs; mean = 0.037 +/- 0.052 per stomach). Densities of E, lecontei were much higher in Lake Auburn than Cedar Lake, however, within lakes there was no correlation between E, lecontei density and either mean number or percent occurrence in sunfish stomachs. These data suggest that sunfish predation may be important and that with low E, lecontei population densities and high sunfish densities, E. lecontei populations could be limited by sunfish predation.

All populations contained diploid male and female A. laterale as well as a potential mixture of diploid, triploid, and tetraploid female hybrids, which occurred at variable frequencies. Triploid males, pentaploid females and possible polyploid A. laterale (3n and 4n) were found in one extensively sampled population. Initial separation of A. laterale from hybrids based on morphological criteria was tested for accuracy by comparison with the cytometric results and found to be exceptionally high (99.6%). Sex ratios in all populations were biased overwhelmingly towards females, primarily because female hybrids accounted for up to 84% of a breeding aggregate; however, diploid female A. laterale outnumbered males in several populations and in two instances, near the northern limit of hybrid biotypes, these account for much of the biased sex ratio. Timing of breeding, always triggered by precipitation (rain or snow), varied between sites and was correlated with altitude/latitude. Initial immigrations at all sites contained biotypes indicative of local primary composition with respect to both ploidy and hybridity. The breeding dynamics of one population were investigated by daily sampling throughout the breeding period. Migration occurred in distinct waves. In A. laterale, frequency of immigrating males declined over the breeding period while frequency of females increased, a pattern conforming to the typical Ambystoma breeding dynamic. Within hybrids, the percentage of tetraploids increased over the breeding period. Within waves, there was a general increase in hybrids over time.

Using nocturnal water level fluctuations for estimating seepage from stormwater detention systems	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												A simple method, modified from White's method, was developed and verified for estimating seepage from two stormwater detention areas (SDAs) for 2 years, using night-time changes in surface water levels. The SDAs were located in warm sub-tropical Florida where the assumption of negligible night-time evaporation for White's method does not hold true. Daily seepage was estimated using the nocturnal water level fluctuations on no flow days during winter when evaporation losses were insignificant. Specific yield, rather than the composite specific yield, provided accurate seepage estimates. The average annual seepage from the two SDAs was 2.03 m/year. At almost 70% of surface flows, seepage is a significant contributor to regional surface and sub-surface flows. Comparison of seepage estimates from the night-time method (NM) and the water balance (WB) method showed that the NM-based estimates were within the range of the estimates from the WB method. At SDA1, the differences between the NM and WB estimates were 1% and 11%, for the 2 years. The discrepancy between the two estimates became higher (27% and 23%) at SDA2. Larger differences at SDA2 were because of higher error in quantifying pumped inflows for the WB method. Successful performance of NM combined with its low resource (single well monitoring) requirements will help quantify seepage from detention areas and other similar features (e.g. ponds, constructed wetlands) in warmer climates. A scale-up for the Caloosahatchee River basin showed that seepage from SDA's accounted for 15% of annual river flows indicating the importance of seepage in evaluating water and chemical balances.

J	ARROWSMITH, JR; RHODES, DD				ARROWSMITH, JR; RHODES, DD			ORIGINAL FORMS AND INITIAL MODIFICATIONS OF THE GALWAY LAKE ROAD SCARP FORMED ALONG THE EMERSON FAULT DURING THE 28 JUNE 1992 LANDERS, CALIFORNIA, EARTHQUAKE	BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												A remarkable scarp formed southeast of the Galway Lake Road during the M(w) 7.3 Landers, California earthquake. Over the first 11 months following the earthquake, we repeated topographic surveys and ground stereoscopic photography, and interpreted the observations of original forms and initial modifications of the faulted landforms. The complexity of the surface rupture influenced the geomorphic responses. The principal shear zone consisted of en-echelon right- and left-lateral, generally left-stepping, fault segments with cumulative offsets of 5 m right-lateral and 2.5 m vertical. Typical fault scarp profiles have different slope angles above and below the surface rupture and a small free face. The surface rupture formed steep, irregular knickpoints in channels crossing the scarp. The original channel surfaces were warped as they stepped down over tilted and rotated fracture-bounded blocks. The landforms were modified measurably by the above-average winter 1992-1993 rainfall. Over surfaces controlled by hillslope processes only, fault scarp erosion was controlled by rainsplash and slumping. Originally sharp comers were rounded and loose sediment collected in colluvial wedges. Surface flows over simple ramp steps in channel profiles caused incision that drove knick-points back by as much as 50 cm. Over more complex portions of the principal shear zone, flow was diverted into open fractures and little modification of the scarp occurred. The pre-earthquake topography at the site provided no clear evidence of the last similar slip event. Simple diffusion erosion models of the time required to bring the new scarp to its pre-Landers event configuration indicate that the last major rupture may have been several thousand years ago.																			0037-1106	1943-3573				JUN	1994	84	3					511	527																WOS:A1994NQ99300003

Lateglacial summer temperatures in the Northwest European lowlands: a chironomid record from Hijkermeer, the Netherlands	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Lateglacial environments at Hijkermeer, northwest Netherlands, were reconstructed by means of chironomid, diatom and pollen analyses. Diatom assemblages indicate that Hijkermeer was a shallow, oligo- to mesotrophic lake during this period. Pollen assemblages reflect the typical northwest European Lateglacial vegetation development and provide an age assessment for the record from the beginning of the Older Dryas (ca 14 000 calibrated C-14 yr BP) into the early Holocene (to ca 10 700 calibrated C-14 yr BP). The chironomid record is characterized by several abrupt shifts between assemblages typically found in mid-latitude subalpine to alpine lakes and assemblages typical for lowland environments. Based on the chironomid record, July air temperatures were reconstructed using a chironomid-temperature transfer-function from central Europe. Mean July air temperatures of ca 14.0-16.0 degrees C are inferred before the Older Dryas, of ca 16.0-16.5 degrees C during most of the Allerod, of ca 13.5-14.0 degrees C during the Younger Dryas, and of ca 15.5-16.0 degrees C during the early Holocene. Two centennial-scale decreases in July air temperature were reconstructed during the Lateglacial interstadial which are correlated with Greenland Interstadial events (GI)-1d and -1b. The results suggest that vegetation changes in the Netherlands may have been promoted by the cooler climate during GI-1d, immediately preceding the Older Dryas biozone, and GI-1b. The Hijkermeer chironomid-inferred temperature record shows a similar temperature development as the Greenland ice core oxygen isotope records for most of the Lateglacial and a good agreement with other temperature reconstructions available from the Netherlands. This suggests that chironomid-based temperature reconstruction can be successfully implemented in the Northwest European lowlands and that chironomids may provide a useful alternative to oxygen isotopes for correlating European lake sediment records during the Lateglacial.

Landsat-derived bathymetry of lakes on the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska	EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA												The Pleistocene sand sea on the Arctic Coastal Plain (ACP) of northern Alaska is underlain by an ancient sand dune field, a geological feature that affects regional lake characteristics. Many of these lakes, which cover approximately 20% of the Pleistocene sand sea, are relatively deep (up to 25 m). In addition to the natural importance of ACP sand sea lakes for water storage, energy balance, and ecological habitat, the need for winter water for industrial development and exploration activities makes lakes in this region a valuable resource. However, ACP sand sea lakes have received little prior study. Here, we collect in situ bathymetric data to test 12 model variants for predicting sand sea lake depth based on analysis of Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. Lake depth gradients were measured at 17 lakes in midsummer 2017 using a Humminbird 798ci HD SI Combo automatic sonar system. The field-measured data points were compared to red-green-blue (RGB) bands of a Landsat-8 OLI image acquired on 8 August 2016 to select and calibrate the most accurate spectral-depth model for each study lake and map bathymetry. Exponential functions using a simple band ratio (with bands selected based on lake turbidity and bed substrate) yielded the most successful model variants. For each lake, the most accurate model explained 81.8% of the variation in depth, on average. Modeled lake bathymetries were integrated with remotely sensed lake surface area to quantify lake water storage volumes, which ranged from 1.056 x 10(-3) to 57.416 x 10(-3) km(3). Due to variations in depth maxima, substrate, and turbidity between lakes, a regional model is currently infeasible, rendering necessary the acquisition of additional in situ data with which to develop a regional model solution. Estimating lake water volumes using remote sensing will facilitate better management of expanding development activities and serve as a baseline by which to evaluate future responses to ongoing and rapid climate change in the Arctic.

The Klina River is the left tributary of the White Drin River Basin, with a length of 69 km. The study assessed the level of surface water quality in the Klina River using 12 diatomic indices calculated with the Omnidia program. For this purpose, three stations monitored the river Klina in the autumn of 2021 to conform to international standards. A total of 88 diatom taxa were identified, with the dominant species being Rhoicosphenia abbreviata (C. Agardh) Lange-Bertalot, Gyrosigma acuminatum (K & uuml;tzing) Rabenhorst, Cocconeis placenula Ehrenberg, Gomphonema minutum (Ag.) Agardh f. minutum, Gomphonema clavatum Ehr, Meridion circulare (Greville) C.A. Agardh, Cocconeis pediculus Ehrenberg, Diatoma vulgaris Bory, and Nitzschia dissipata (K & uuml;tzing) Grunow ssp. dissipata etc. This study assessed the surface water quality in the Klina River using diatom indices, indicating that the river is in good to moderate ecological condition. Environmental variables such as hydrogen ion concentration (pH) and dissolved oxygen (DO) had significant positive correlations (<0.01) with the biological diatom index (IBD), Descy's pollution metric (Descy), Slade & ccaron;ek's pollution metric (SLA), the European index (CEE), and Watanabe's Index (WAT), while the total suspended solids (TSS) also showed a strong negative significant correlation (<0.01) with the generic diatom index (IDG), Indice Diatomique Artois Picardie (IDAP), the eutrophication pollution index (EPI-D), the trophic diatom index (TDI), the Pampean diatom index (IDP), and Steinberg and Schiefele's index (SHE). Total phosphorus (TP), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) presented a significant negative correlation (<0.05) with the IBD, Descy, SLA, CEE, and WAT indices. Our findings provide insights for organizations dealing with the state of the environment and water protection in Kosovo, and these results can be used as a starting point for assessing the ecological quality of water and monitoring environmental pollution in the Kosovo region.					; Đurin, Bojan/AAW-6282-2021; Dogančić, Dragana/AAT-5486-2020; Bytyci, Pajtim/AAX-8702-2020; NUHA, DEMOKRAT/HHD-1606-2022; Rathnayake, Upaka/S-2435-2019; Sallaku, Fatbardh/GRY-7237-2022; Durin, Bojan/W-1782-2017	Rathnayake, Upaka/0000-0002-7341-9078; Durin, Bojan/0000-0002-2361-8036; Bytyci, Pajtim/0000-0002-1521-3370														2673-4133				FEB 8	2025	6	1							15	10.3390/ecologies6010015	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ecologies6010015													WOS:001454481600001

The program involved collaboration between federal and provincial levels of government and was coordinated by the Canadian Cooperative Wildlife Health Centre. The surveillance plan targeted young-of-the-year Mallards along with other duck species at six sampling locations along the major migratory flyways across Canada. Beginning in early August, cloacal swabs were taken from 704 ducks on two lakes adjacent to one another near Kamloops, British Columbia. The swabs were screened for the presence of influenza A RNA using a real-time reverse trans cription-polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) assay that targets the M1 gene. Swab samples that gave positive results underwent further testing using H5- and H7-specific RRT-PCR assays. One hundred and seventy-four cloacal swab specimens gave positive or suspicious results for the presence of an H5 virus. A portion of these (28/35) were confirmed using an H5-specific conventional reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay and an H5 virus was eventually isolated from 24/127 swab specimens. Neuraminidase typing revealed the presence of H5N2 and H5N9 viruses. In mid-November of 2005 an H5N2 virus was detected in a commercial duck operation in the lower mainland of British Columbia, approximately 120 kin from where the H5N2-positive wild ducks were sampled. Molecular genetic analysis of the H5N2 viruses isolated from wild and domestic ducks was carried out to determine their kinship.																			0005-2086						2007	51	1		S			429	431		10.1637/7570-033106R.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1637/7570-033106R.1								17494600					WOS:000245474100056

The lakes of North Tyrol ( A) and South Tyrol ( I) were sampled in 2000 as part of the EU project EMERGE (EVK1-CT- 1999- 00032). The lakes of Trentino ( I) were investigated in other research projects during 1996 and 1997 (Adamello mountain range) and 2000 ( catchment of the River Avisio), respectively. The objectives of this paper are: ( 1) to study taxonomy and biodiversity of Chrysophyceae, Dinophyceae and Cryptophyceae in high altitude lakes of the Eastern Alps; (2) to identify functional flagellate groups characterising lakes with similar habitat properties, ( 3) to identify the environmental variables driving abundance and distribution of the three selected algal groups, thus contributing to the selection of sensitive bioindicator taxa. The lakes investigated show rather wide morphological, chemical and trophic state gradients. Flagellate algae account for a median relative abundance (R.A.) of 68%. Chrysophyceae are the most important group in terms of biodiversity and R. A.. Special flagellate associations could be related to lake features, like catchment geology, mineralization level and nutrient concentrations. However, the distribution of flagellate algae did not allow a complete geographical separation of the lakes studied in the different districts. Multivariate canonical analyses indicate that the distribution of Chrysophyceae is mainly driven by NO3-N concentration and thermal conditions, while Dinophyceae are driven by a combination of alkalinity, altitude, thermal condition and, less importantly, nutrient concentration. Physical properties of the lakes, such as thermal condition and lake depth, represent the principal driving variables for Cryptophyceae. The responses to the different environmental variables suggest that the three flagellate groups analysed might be used as indicators for environmental changes in high mountain lakes of the Eastern Alps.					; Tolotti, Monica/D-4441-2018; Cantonati, Marco/G-4278-2018	Thies, Hansjoerg/0000-0001-8153-2428; Tolotti, Monica/0000-0003-2674-8597; Cantonati, Marco/0000-0003-0179-3842; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL	2003	502	1-3					331	348		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000004291.03882.f7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000004291.03882.f7													WOS:000186636900026

We investigated the impact of threshold relationships on our ability to project ecological change outside the observational record (e.g., the 21st century), using the challenge of predicting late-Holocene fire regimes in boreal forest and tundra ecosystems. Location Boreal forest and tundra ecosystems of Alaska. Time period 850-2100 CE. Major taxa studied Not applicable. Methods We informed a set of published statistical models, designed to predict the 30-year probability of fire occurrence based on climatological normals, with downscaled global climate model data for 850-1850 CE. To evaluate model performance outside the observational record and the implications of threshold relationships, we compared modelled estimates with mean fire return intervals estimated from 29 published lake-sediment palaeofire reconstructions. To place our results in the context of future change, we evaluate changes in the location of threshold to burning under 21st-century climate projections. Results Model-palaeodata comparisons highlight spatially varying accuracy across boreal forest and tundra regions, with variability strongly related to the summer temperature threshold to burning: sites closer to this threshold exhibited larger prediction errors than sites further away from this threshold. Modifying the modern (i.e., 1950-2009) fire-climate relationship also resulted in significant changes in modelled estimates. Under 21st-century climate projections, increasing proportions of Alaskan tundra and boreal forest will approach and surpass the temperature threshold to burning, with > 50% exceeding this threshold by > 2 degrees C by 2070-2099. Main conclusions Our results highlight a high sensitivity of statistical projections to changing threshold relationships and data uncertainty, implying that projections of future ecosystem change in threshold-governed ecosystems will be accompanied by notable uncertainty. This work also suggests that ecological responses to climate change will exhibit high spatio-temporal variability as different regions approach and surpass climatic thresholds over the 21st century.

J	Kincaid, TR				Kincaid, TR			River water intrusion to the unconfined Floridan aquifer	ENVIRONMENTAL & ENGINEERING GEOSCIENCE												Rapid infiltration of river water into unconfined parts of the Floridan aquifer represents a significant component of subsequent ground-water discharge in regions where the aquifer is dissected by surface streams. A two-year investigation of the Devil's Ear cave system, an extensive saturated conduit network in the Floridan aquifer which underlies a 1.5-km reach of the Santa Fe River in north-central Florida, revealed that there is an appreciable and rapid exchange of water between the river and the underlying Floridan aquifer, Natural tracers Radon-222 (Rn-222) and delta(18)O were used to quantify these exchanges. Cave diving was employed to collect 50 water samples which were analyzed for tracer content and to observe water clarity conditions within the saturated karst conduits as far as 1.2 km from the cave entrance. Rn-222 concentrations measured in the cave system revealed three distinct zones where river water is rapidly intruded into the Floridan aquifer, A two-component mixing model was used to quantify the intruded river water that was found to account for as much as 62 percent of the discharge at Devil's Ear spring. Observations of diminished water clarity in the cave system following large precipitation events in the highland provinces of the Santa Fe River basin indicate that river water intrusion to the aquifer can occur in as little as one or two days, The results of this investigation imply that, in regions such as the western Santa Fe River basin, there can be no clear distinction between ground and surface waters and intruded river water provides a significant vehicle for contamination of the unconfined Floridan aquifer.																			1078-7275					FAL	1998	4	3					361	374																WOS:000081612400006

Chytridiomycosis, Ranaviruses and the red-leg syndrome have been identified in unusual mortality events. However, these infections do not account for all causes of declining amphibian populations. Moreover, several cases of amphibian mortality are difficult to solve without resorting to an interdisciplinary approach. Two cases of unusual mortality in Rana temporaria occurred at two high-mountain ponds (northwest Italy) in April and May 2021. Water and frog samples were analysed to understand the possible causes responsible for the unusual mortalities. Results of the main physi-cochemical (pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, chemical and biochemical oxygen demand) and nutrient (ammonia/ammonium, nitrite, nitrate, total phosphorus) parameters revealed a good condition of the water quality, with the absence of the main cyanotoxins (microcystins/nodularins). However, unseasonably high spring water temperatures were recorded in both ponds (12.73 degrees C and 14.21 degrees C for Frog Pond and Selleries Pond, respectively). Frogs (n = 50; snout-vent length: 7.0-9.8 cm; body mass: 85-123 g) collected from Frog Pond mainly presented bumps on the ventral cavity and dermal ulceration associated with the isolation of Carno-bacterium maltaromaticum. On the other hand, frogs (n = 5; snout-vent length: 8.0-9.1 cm; body mass: 87-92 g) from Selleries Pond presented petechiae and dermal ulcerations on the rear limbs associated with the isolation of Aeromonas salmonicida and A. sobria. In both mortality events, the interdisciplinary approach revealed an as-sociation between frog mortalities and the isolation of bacteria. Isolated bacteria are considered opportunistic pathogens, and the high values of the water temperature has certainly led a stress on the frogs, favouring the spread of bacteria and the death of the frogs. Further studies are needed to assess the pathophysiological effects of the opportunistic bacteria here isolated, clarifying the interactions between emerging pathogens and climate change.					; Begovoeva, Mattia/HJA-7058-2022; Di Blasio, Alessia/N-7653-2019; Prearo, Marino/AAF-3369-2021; PEANO, Andrea/AAT-2593-2020; Renzi, Monia/AAM-8333-2020; BARCELO, DAMIA/O-4558-2016; Peano, Andrea/AAT-2593-2020; Acutis, Pier/G-4802-2013; Meletiadis, Arianna/HLP-6445-2023; Pastorino, Paolo/T-5288-2019	Di Blasio, Alessia/0000-0003-4763-6404; Begovoeva, Mattia/0000-0002-5626-6495; Pastorino, Paolo/0000-0002-0585-1168; PEANO, Andrea/0000-0002-6783-4742; Rossi, Luca/0000-0001-6829-5229; Meletiadis, Arianna/0000-0002-7537-1274; 													0013-9351	1096-0953				APR 1	2023	222								115411	10.1016/j.envres.2023.115411	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2023.115411		FEB 2023						36736753					WOS:000929489600001

Despite extensive study of the diversity and evolutionary implications of the biota, the palaeoenvironmental setting and taphonomy of the fossils remain poorly understood. We reconstruct both the palaeoenvironment of the Daohugou area (one of the most famous Yanliao fossil areas), and the biostratinomy of the fossils. We use high-resolution stratigraphic data from field investigation and excavations to document in detail the stratigraphic succession, lithofacies, facies associations, and biostratinomic features of the Lagerstatte. Our results show that frequent volcanic eruptions generated an extensive volcaniclastic apron and lake(s) in the studied area. The frequent alternation of thin lacustrine deposits and thick volcaniclastic apron deposits indicates either that the studied area was located in the marginal regions of a single lake, where the frequent influx of volcaniclastic apron material caused substantial fluctuations in lake area and thus the frequent lateral alternation of the two facies, or that many short-lived lakes developed on the volcaniclastic apron. Most terrestrial insects were preserved in the laminated, normally graded siltstone, claystone and tuff facies that form many thin intervals with deposits of graded sandstone, siltstone and tuff in between. Within each interval the terrestrial insects occur in many laminae associated with abundant aquatic organisms, but are particularly abundant in some laminae that directly underlie tuff of fallout origin. Most of these terrestrial insects are interpreted to have been killed in the area adjacent to the studied palaeolake(s) during volcanic eruptions. Their carcasses were transported by influxes of fresh volcaniclastic material, primarily meteoric runoff and possibly minor distal pyroclastic flow into the palaeolake(s), and were buried in palaeolake deposits prior to extended decay probably due to a combination of rapid vertical settling, ash fall and water turbulence.

To better evaluate these hazards, we have reconstructed a high resolution eruption history, the most detailed to date for a volcano in Chile, from detailed field observations and geochemical analyses. Mocho-Choshuenco has experienced ca. 75 post-glacial (<18 ka) explosive eruptions, including three large (volume >= 1 km(3)) Plinian eruptions (Neltume, Pirehueico and Hullo) and a large pyroclastic density current and associated sub-Plinian event (Enco). Poor preservation and lack of exposure made it difficult to distinguish between medial to distal deposits solely on field observations. Instead, deposits have been correlated using a combination of glass chemistry and Fe-Ti oxide compositions. New radiocarbon dates were obtained and integrated with existing dates in a Bayesian age model (OxCal) to constrain the tempo of the volcanism. Based on preserved deposits, we derive a post-glacial eruptive frequency of one explosive eruption every similar to 220 years with the youngest, confirmed eruption from Mocho-Choshuenco in 1864. The total post-glacial volume of tephra erupted is estimated at >= 20 km(3) (ca. 50% with a dacitic or rhyolitic glass composition) with >= 4 km(3) erupted from the monogenetic cones on the flanks, making Mocho-Choshuenco one of the most productive (ca. 1 km(3)/kyr) and active volcanoes in the SVZ during post-glacial times. Many tephra deposits from Mocho-Choshuenco could be preserved in one or more lakes in the region, and have the potential to form regional tephra markers. In particular the Neltume deposits, which are dispersed to the NNE, are found interbedded with tephra deposits from the Villarrica-Quetrupillan-Lanin chain and should be preserved around Sollipulli and Llaima (similar to 140 km NNE of Mocho-Choshuenco). This study highlights how a multi-technique approach enables a complicated tephrostratigraphy to be unravelled so more robust estimates of the past eruptive frequency and size can be determined.

Analysis of remote sensing imagery has documented regional changes in the number and area of ponds and lakes as well as expanding cover of shrubs and small trees in uplands. To better understand long-term changes across the edaphic gradient, we compared the number and area of water bodies and dry barrens (>100 m(2)) between 1956 (aerial photographs) and 2008-2011 (high-resolution satellite images) for eight similar to 25 km(2) sites near Nejanilini Lake, Manitoba (59.559 degrees N, 97.715 degrees W). In the modern landscape, the number of water bodies and barrens were similar (1162 versus 1297, respectively), but water bodies were larger (mean 3.1 x 10(4) versus 681 m(2), respectively) and represented 17% of surface area compared with 0.4% for barrens. Over the past 60 years, total surface area of water did not change significantly (16.7%-17.1%) despite a similar to 30% decrease in numbers of small (<1000 m(2)) water bodies. However, the number and area of barrens decreased (55% and 67%, respectively) across all size classes. These changes are consistent with Arctic greening in response to increasing temperature and precipitation. Loss of small water bodies suggests that wet tundra areas may be drying, which, if true, may have important implications for carbon balance. Our observations may be the result of changes in winter conditions in combination with low permafrost ice content in the region, in part explaining regional variations in responses to climate change.

Benthic communities of saline rivers in the arid zone of south Russia: saliny tolerance, production, trophic conditions	AQUATIC SCIENCES												The article presents the results of long-term studies (2008-2014 and 2017-2019, 2023) of macrozoobenthos communities and the trophic conditions for their development in six saline rivers of the Lake Elton basin, characterized by important stopovers sites of migrating waterfowl in Europe. The aim of the work was to study the salinity tolerance of macrozoobenthos species, identify their quantitative indicators in a wide salinity gradient and establish the long-term production dynamics of benthic invertebrates. During the studied period, within a wide range of river salinity, from 4 g l-1 to 114 g l-1, a decrease in macrozoobenthos species richness was established, from 87 species in mesohaline rivers to 30 species in polyhaline rivers and to 10 species in a hyperhaline river. The abundance, biomass and production of macrozoobenthos varied widely, mainly determined by the development cycles of common salinity-tolerant dipterans species. The production of macrozoobenthos in mesohaline and polyhaline rivers was comparable or higher than observed in brackish water lagoons in Europe. With increasing water salinity, a decrease in the average long-term macrozoobenthos production values during the summer period was observed. The production of macrozoobenthos increased from the middle reaches of the rivers towards their mouth reaches, which is explained by an increase in the production of hydrobionts of lower trophic levels. At the same time, an analysis of the variability of macrozoobenthos production in rivers with different salinity levels did not reveal a pronounced trend in the long-term series of observations.

In this study, we examined delta D compositions of n-alkanes in aquatic plants and lake water from 58 lakes (containing 18 brackish/saline lakes) across diverse regions of China (including the Tibetan Plateau, Inner Mongolia Plateau, Chinese Loess Plateau, Tarim Basin, and Yangtze Plain). Subsequently, we examined the correlations between salinity and n-alkane delta D values in aquatic plants. Our findings indicate that delta D values of n-alkanes from aquatic plants record variations in lake water delta D (R-2 = 0.53, p < 0.01). Furthermore, delta D values of lake water in brackish/saline lakes exhibit a positive correlation with salinity (R-2 = 0.74, p < 0.01). Thus, a positive correlation (R-2 = 0.68, p < 0.01) is observed between delta D values of n-alkanes from aquatic plants and lake salinity, whose changes both co-vary with lake water delta D variations. Therefore, n-alkane delta D values of aquatic plants can serve as indirect indicators of salinity for reconstructing paleosalinity in brackish/saline lakes. It is important to note that paleosalinity reconstruction in lakes using n-alkane delta D values is generally more effective when lake salinity experiences large variations, whereas caution should be exercised when lake salinity changes are more subtle.

J	Pellatt, MG; Hebda, RJ; Mathewes, RW				Pellatt, MG; Hebda, RJ; Mathewes, RW			High-resolution Holocene vegetation history and climate from Hole 1034B, ODP leg 169S, Saanich Inlet, Canada	MARINE GEOLOGY												High-resolution pollen analysis of laminated marine sediments from ODP Hole 1034B in Saanich Inlet, British Columbia reveals changes in vegetation and inferred climate during the Holocene, Four main pollen zones are discerned using constrained cluster analysis. Although the timing of major vegetation changes at the Saanich Inlet is similar to other study sites in the Pacific Northwest, the composition of pollen assemblage zones is different from the mainland sites. Vegetation assemblages reconstructed from the pollen and spore record include a Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) parkland with abundant grass (Poaceae) and bracken (Pteridium) between 11,450 and 8300 BP (all ages are calibrated calendar years), oak (Quercus) savanna or parkland with high grass and bracken (8300-7040 BP), a mixed deciduous/coniferous forest with oak, western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) and Douglas-fir (7040-5750 BP), and the development of modem coastal temperate forest with the marked expansion of cedar (Cupressaceae), western hemlock, spruce (Picea) and Douglas-fir (5750-1050 BP). Climatic periods inferred from the cores include an early Holocene warm/dry interval (11,450-8300 BP), a warm period with mild winters (8300-7040 BP), a period of transitional mid-Holocene climate (7040-5750 BP), and the advent of a relatively cool/ wet neoglacial climate after 5750 BP, Modern conifer forests and oak savannas became established by about 3800 BP. The Saanich Inlet pollen record indicates that vegetation and inferred climate change was particularly rapid between 8700 and 8300 BP when grass and bracken abruptly decrease and oak becomes a significant component of the paleovegetation. Because neoglacial conditions have prevailed from 3800 years to present in the Pacific Northwest, factors other than climate, such as anthropogenic modification of the landscape, may be responsible for the persistence of oak savannas.

Although deglaciation commenced similar to 15,500 cal yr B.P., the area around the Laguna Verde Alta (LVA) remained a periglacial desert, practically unvegetated, until about 11,000 cal yr B.P. At this time, a lycopod assemblage bearing no modern analog colonized the superparamo. Although this community persisted until 6000 cal yr B.P., it began to decline somewhat earlier, in synchrony with cooling following the Holocene thermal maximum of the Northern Hemisphere. At this time, the pioneer assemblage was replaced by a low-diversity superparamo community that became established similar to 9000 cal yr B.P. This replacement coincides with regional declines in temperature and/or available moisture. Modern, more diverse superparamo assemblages were not established until 4600 cal yr B.P., and were accompanied by a dramatic decline in Alnus, probably the result of factors associated with climate, humans, or both. Pollen influx from upper Andean forests is remarkably higher than expected during the Late Glacial and early to middle Holocene, especially between 14,000 and 12,600 cal yr B.P., when unparalleled high values are recorded. We propose that intensification of upslope orographic winds transported lower elevation forest pollen to the superparamo, causing the apparent increase in tree pollen at high altitude.

J	Kalin, M; Smith, MP				Kalin, Margarete; Smith, Martin P.			Germination of Chara vulgaris and Nitella flexilis oospores:: What are the relevant factors triggering germination?	AQUATIC BOTANY												Factors governing the germination of Chara vulgaris L. and Nitella flexilis L. were investigated in a series of three experiments. Temperature, light regimes, drying, and changes in oxidation-reduction potential are postulated to be possible triggers working in isolation or in combination on dormant oospores originating in sediments with different physical/chemical characteristics. In Experiment 1, none of the N. flexilis oospores inoculated into Petri plates and culture tubes containing either agar or water and then exposed to 'normal' 12 h daylight 12 It dark germinated when the redox of the media remained relatively constant over the 20-day observation period, while all of the oospores in a tube in which the redox of the agar declined to below 200 mV, germinated. Similarly no germination occurred in the dark without a decrease in redox. When redox fell to below 200 mV, 11% of the inoculated oospores germinated. In Experiment 2, N.flexilis and C vulgaris oospores were subjected to cold pre-treatments and inoculated into either water or agar in both plates and tubes. Of the N. flexilis oospores 53% germinated in the dark, and 31% under normal lighting. Of the C vulgaris, 3% germinated in the dark and 53% under normal lighting. The stimulation of germination with the decrease in redox in the media did not re-occur. Experiment 3 compared the germination of C vulgaris oospores from four ponds contaminated by mining wastes and from a comparatively clean wetland. The oospores were again subjected (or not) to cold pre-treatments, and were drawn from both freshly concentrated sediments and air-dried sediments that had been held in storage for either 97 or 376 days. Notably, a consistent reduction in oospore viability occurred in oospores from a particular mine pond, contaminated by nickel tailings. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

J	BJORCK, S; DIGERFELDT, G				BJORCK, S; DIGERFELDT, G			ALLEROD-YOUNGER DRYAS SEA-LEVEL CHANGES IN SOUTHWESTERN SWEDEN AND THEIR RELATION TO THE BALTIC ICE LAKE DEVELOPMENT	BOREAS												Mt. Kroppefjall is situated just south of the Middle Swedish (Younger Dryas) ice-marginal zone. Its abundance of lake basins makes it very suitable for detailed shore displacement studies close to the Younger Dryas ice margin. Altogether 12 lakes at altitudes between 157 and 78 m were studied and all but one situated above the marine limit contained marine sediments. The dating of their isolation from the sea resulted in a shore displacement curve from c. 11,200 to c. 9800 BP. The relative uplift almost ceased between 10,900 and 10,300 BP, which is mainly related to an ice readvance in the Lake Vanern basin. This period of balance between uplift and sea level rise was preceded by a relative uplift rate of 5 m/100 yr and followed by as high rates as 7-8 m/100 yr, possibly caused by a delayed uplift effect and perhaps also a local fall in sea level caused by the rapidly receding ice margin. The time difference between the formation of two delta surfaces at Odskolts Moar is estimated at 600-800 years. Shoreline diagrams along the Swedish west and east coasts, mainly based on a number of shore displacement curves, reveal large anomalies that are believed to have been caused by dammings and drainages of the Baltic basin. The southwards extrapolated shorelines indicate that the bedrock threshold in the Oresund Strait, between Denmark and Sweden, functioned as the outlet threshold for the Baltic Ice Lake during its dammed stages, while the erosion of the Store Balt and Darss Sill straits began at the culmination of the Ancylus transgression and continued during the rapid 15-20 m Ancylus regression.																			0300-9483						1991	20	2					115	133																WOS:A1991FV57900003

Especially in cases where hazardous facilities are located next to them (nuclear power plants, production using radioactive components, storage facilities, etc.). For various reasons, small radioactive releases occur from these facilities. The radioactive substances fall into the water and are deposited in bottom sediments. Gradually, the expositional irradiation dose in the bottom sediment increases. Sea, lake or river inhabitants begin to get sick. It is extremely difficult to establish a high level of radiation in the bottom sediment by measuring the exposure dose over the water surface. The bottom sediments may be washed ashore during water movement or various cyclones. Further, then are dispersed by wind. This can lead to radioactive damage to people, animals and territory. The methodology for the radioactive state research of the water areas deep parts and bottom sediments using an autonomous deep-sea apparatus is presented. The apparatus is equipped with sensors for measuring the expositional irradiation dose, a video camera for monitoring the bottom, a depth sensor and an echo probe to determine its coordinates under water. The using an autonomous apparatus allows to determine the presence of radioactive contamination in bottom sediments and determine the configuration of their location. This allows to plan and effectively carry out work on the cleaning of rivers, lakes and coastal zones of the seas from radioactive bottom sediments.					; Мешалкин, Валерий/T-6913-2017	Dmitrieva, Diana/0000-0002-2561-6245; Pilipova, Valeria/0000-0001-9220-1552; Gryaznova, Katya/0000-0001-6761-251X; 													1755-1307						2020	578								012050	10.1088/1755-1315/578/1/012050	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/578/1/012050													WOS:000656400600050

Holocene proxy time-series are increasingly used to put this amplified response in perspective by understanding Arctic climate processes beyond the instrumental period. However, available datasets are scarce, unevenly distributed and often of coarse resolution. Glaciers are sensitive recorders of climate shifts and variations in rock-flour production transfer this signal to the lacustrine sediment archives of downstream lakes. Here, we present the first full Holocene record of continuous glacier variability on Svalbard from glacier-fed Lake Hajeren. This reconstruction is based on an undisturbed lake sediment core that covers the entire Holocene and resolves variability on centennial scales owing to 26 dating points. A toolbox of physical, geochemical (XRF) and magnetic proxies in combination with multivariate statistics has allowed us to fingerprint glacier activity in addition to other processes affecting the sediment record. Evidence from variations in sediment density, validated by changes in Ti concentrations, reveal glaciers remained present in the catchment following deglaciation prior to 11,300 cal BP, culminating in a Holocene maximum between 9.6 and 9.5 ka cal BP. Correspondence with freshwater pulses from Hudson Strait suggests that Early Holocene glacier advances were driven by the melting Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS). We find that glaciers disappeared from the catchment between 7.4 and 6.7 ka cal BP, following a late Hypsithermal. Glacier reformation around 4250 cal BP marks the onset of the Neoglacial, supporting previous findings. Between 3380 and 3230 cal BP, we find evidence for a previously unreported centennial-scale glacier advance. Both events are concurrent with well-documented episodes of North Atlantic cooling. We argue that this brief forcing created suitable conditions for glaciers to reform in the catchment against a background of gradual orbital cooling. These findings highlight the climate-sensitivity of the small glaciers studied, which rapidly responded to climate shifts. The start of prolonged Neoglacial glacier activity commenced during the Little Ice Age (LIA) around 700 cal BP, in agreement with reported advances from other glaciers on Svalbard. In conclusion, this study proposes a three-stage Holocene climate history of Svalbard, successively driven by LIS meltwater pulses, episodic Atlantic cooling and declining summer insolation.

J	MORRIS, PJ; QUENSEN, JF; TIEDJE, JM; BOYD, SA				MORRIS, PJ; QUENSEN, JF; TIEDJE, JM; BOYD, SA			REDUCTIVE DEBROMINATION OF THE COMMERCIAL POLYBROMINATED BIPHENYL MIXTURE FIREMASTER BP6 BY ANAEROBIC MICROORGANISMS FROM SEDIMENTS	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Anaerobic microorganisms eluted from three sediments, one contaminated with polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) and two contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls, were compared for their ability to debrominate the commercial PBB mixture Firemaster. These microorganisms were incubated with reduced anaerobic mineral medium and noncontaminated sediment amended with Firemaster. Firemaster averages six bromines per biphenyl molecule; four of the bromines are substituted in the meta or para position. The inocula from all three sources were able to debrominate the meta and para positions. Microorganisms from the Pine River (St. Louis, Mich.) contaminated with Firemaster, the Hudson River (Hudson Falls, N.Y.) contaminated with Aroclor 1242, and Silver Lake (Pittsfield, Mass.) contaminated with Aroclor 1260 removed 32, 12, and 3% of the meta plus para bromines, respectively, after 32 weeks of incubation. This suggests that previous environmental exposure to PBBs enhances the debromination capability of the sediment microbial community through selection for different strains of microorganisms. The Pine River inoculum removed an average of 1.25 bromines per biphenyl molecule during a 32-week incubation period, resulting in a mixture potentially more accessible to aerobic degradation processes. No ortho bromine removal was observed. However, when Firemaster was incubated with Hudson River microorganisms that had been repeatedly transferred on a pyruvate medium amended with Aroclor 1242, 17% of the meta and para bromines were removed after 16 weeks of incubation and additional debromination products, including 2-bromobiphenyl and biphenyl, were detected. This suggests the possibility for ortho debromination, since all components of the Firemaster mixture have at least one ortho-substituted bromine. These results demonstrate that microorganisms found in the PBB-contaminated Pine River sediments have the capability to debrominate the PBB congeners in Firemaster.

The techniques include quantitative clay mineralogy analysis combined with determination of Nd, Pb, and Sr isotopes from clay fraction. The clay mineral assemblage and the isotope signatures depict distinct changes during the Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 4-3 transition corresponding to the Middle Weichselian deglaciation. This transition is characterised by a homogenous, 48 cm thick, dark grey, silty clay layer with a distinctive IRD concentration, forming a prominent marker bed for the central Arctic Ocean sediments. The elevated smectite and kaolinite contents in the transitional interval are possible weathering products of the Siberian basaltic rocks, such as the Putorana Plateau, feeding the shelves of the Kara Sea and the western Laptev Sea. The Nd and Sr isotope values are compatible with input from the basaltic rocks and fall within the isotopic range of sediments from these shelves. The abrupt changes in the Nd, Pb and Sr isotopic data from the distinct grey layer attributed to the MIS 4-3 transition likely mark a pronounced deglaciation event. An increase in coarse debris in the grey layer indicates a change in the sedimentation regime with a strong iceberg rafting component. This change may also be related to a sudden release of meltwater from a large ice-dammed lake in the northern Siberia.

However, it is lacking data from the other waterbodies of Antarctic continent. This study investigated in situ CO2 and CH4 fluxes in different waterbodies, including coastal seawater of the Terra Nova Bay (TNB) polynya, Ross Sea, snow/meltwater Nansen Ice Shelf, and lakes of Inexpressible Island, East Antarctica during summer, 2022-2023. The results indicate that the TNB polynya is a significant atmospheric CO2 sink (- 133.7--8.0 mmol m-2 d) and a weak CH4 source (- 2.5-13.5 mu mol m-2 day- 1). In contrast, lakes are weak sinks of atmospheric CO2 and CH4 because their low biomass mass. However, one exception was observed in the lagoon and ponds of Ade<acute accent>lie penguin colony around Seaview Bay, Inexpressible Island, where penguin guano significantly increased carbon emissions. The largest CO2 emission (29.8-114.7 mmol m- 2 day- 1) was observed in ponds, while the largest CH4 emission (29-50.9 mu mol m- 2 day- 1) was observed in the lagoon, potentially affecting regional carbon emissions. Ponds derived from the meltwater of the Nansen Shelf are weak sinks of atmospheric CO2 and CH4, ranged from- 4.9-2.9 mmol m- 2 day- 1 and-1.3 -0.6 mu mol m- 2 day- 1, with averages of-1.6 mmol m-2 day- 1-0.5 mu mol m- 2 day- 1, respectively. Considering the extensive occurrence of meltwater in west Antarctica, it is essential to further strengthen observations of carbon the ice sheet-ocean interface to understand carbon dynamics in the SO.

Bioavailability of P substantially differed among the lakes due to differences in their P loading, as well as in concentrations of aluminum (Al) and its species, and was accompanied by species-specific responses of phytoplankton. We combined the fluorescently labeled enzyme activity (FLEA) assay with image cytometry to measure cell-specific PA in natural populations of three dinophyte species, occurring in all the lakes throughout May-September 2007. The mean cell-specific PA varied among the lakes within one order of magnitude: 188-1,831 fmol center dot cell-1 center dot h-1 for Gymnodinium uberrimum (G. F. Allman) Kof. et Swezy, 21-150 fmol center dot cell-1 center dot h-1 for Gymnodinium sp., and 22-365 fmol center dot cell-1 center dot h-1 for Peridinium umbonatum F. Stein. To better compare cell-specific PA among the species of different size, the values were normalized per unit of cell biovolume (amol center dot mu m-3 center dot h-1) for further statistical analysis. A step-forward selection identified concentrations of total and ionic Al together with pH as significant factors (P < 0.05, Monte Carlo permutation test), explaining cumulatively 57% of the total variability in cell-specific PA. However, this cell-specific PA showed an unexpected reverse trend compared to an overall gradient in P deficiency of the lake plankton. The autecological insight into dinophyte cell-specific PA therefore suggested other factors, such as light availability, mixotrophy, and/or zooplankton grazing, causing further PA variations among the acidified lakes.

The interview method was used to gather opinions concerning sustainable tourism development and the effect of tourism on sustainable development. Residents involved in sustainability issues were interviewed. Tourism's impact on the micro region's economy as a whole can be traced to the founding of societies for hiking (1874) and mountain climbing (1912) in Croatia. The development of catering was fostered until the 1980s, while more-intricate tourism activities were neglected, presumably due to a lack of tourism professionals. With the construction of the Bjelolasica tourism complex for winter sports (1979), the focus of development shifted to tourism. The most recent development of tourism in the micro region is greatly influenced by the Adriatic Motorway and the modernised Rudolf's Road. The paper focuses on ecosystems (karst ecosystems, wetland habitats - including waterways, woodland ecosystems, pastures and plowland) identified as key factors of tourism development, and on their sustainability. While Bijele and Samarske Stijene (strict reserve) and Plitvice Lakes (national park), border areas of the micro region, are appropriately protected from irrational use, this is not the case with the Microregion's remaining parts. The socio-cultural landscape focuses on the reconstruction and development of villages affected by the Homeland War, and on the conservation of the local value system. The paper's final part presents a development vision of tourism based on sustainable development.																			1848-4050						2011	1						187	203																WOS:000309734300016

While it is true that statistical algorithms can do large-scale analyses on diverse data with little support from metadata, using such methods on widely dispersed, extremely diverse, and dynamic data may not necessarily produce trustworthy findings. One such task is identifying the impact of indicators for various Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). One of the methods to analyze impact is by developing a Bayesian network for the policymaker to make informed decisions under uncertainty. It is of key interest to policy-makers worldwide to rely on such models to decide the new policies of a state or a country (https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda). The accuracy of the models can be improved by considering enriched data - often done by incorporating pertinent data from multiple sources. However, due to the challenges associated with volume, variety, veracity, and the structure of the data, traditional data lake systems fall short of identifying information that is syntactically diverse yet semantically connected. In this paper, we propose a Data Lake (DL) framework that targets ingesting & processing of data like any traditional DL, and in addition, is capable of performing data retrieval for applications such as Policy Support Systems (where the selection of data greatly affect the output interpretations) by using ontologies as the intermediary. We discuss the proof of concept for the proposed system and the preliminary results (IIITB Data Lake project Website link: http://cads.iiitb.ac.in/wordpress/) based on the data collected from the agriculture department of the Government of Karnataka (GoK).

Occurrence of a single-species cyanobacterial bloom in a lake in Cyprus: monitoring and treatment with hydrogen peroxide-releasing granules	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE												Background Excess loads of nutrients finding their way into waterbodies can cause rapid and excessive growth of phytoplankton species and lead to the formation of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyano-HABs). Toxic cyanobacteria produce a broad range of bioactive metabolites, some of which are known as cyanotoxins. These metabolites can negatively impact the ecosystem, and human and animal health, thus their presence needs to be closely monitored and mitigated. This study aimed to monitor St. George Lake (Athalassa National Forest Park, Cyprus) for its water quality characteristics, and initiate a new methodology to control the bloom that occurred in the lake during summer 2019, by comparing hydrogen peroxide treatment with novel metallic peroxide granules as source of hydrogen peroxide. Results Lake monitoring showed that pH, salinity, total dissolved solids and conductivity varied throughout the year, and nutrients concentration was high, indicating a eutrophic lake. The cyanobacterium Merismopedia sp. bloomed in the lake between June and September 2019, comprising up to 99% of the phytoplankton biovolume. The presence of microcystin synthase encoding gene (mcyB, mcyE) was documented, however microcystins were not detected by tandem mass spectroscopy. Treatment with liquid hydrogen peroxide in concentrations 1 to 5 mg L-1 had no effect on the phycocyanin fluorescence (Ft) and quantum yield of PSII (Fv/Fm) indicating an ineffective treatment for the dense Merismopedia bloom (1 million cells mL(-1) +/- 20%). Metallic peroxide granules tested for their H2O2 releasing capacity in St. George Lake water, showing that CaO2 released higher H2O2 concentration and therefore have better mitigation efficiency than MgO2 granules. Conclusion The present study highlights the importance of monitoring several water parameters to conclude on the different actions to be taken to limit eutrophication in the catchment area. The findings demonstrated that testing for the presence of genes involved in cyanotoxin production may not be sufficient to follow cyanotoxins in the water, therefore it should be accompanied with analytical confirmation. Treatment experiments indicated that slow release of H2O2 from peroxide granules may be an alternative to liquid hydrogen peroxide when applied in appropriate doses, but further investigation is needed before it is applied at the field.

The UVB radiation levels, attenuation, shading and scattering were comparable to those in Dutch shallow freshwater systems. Physical, chemical and biological variables were monitored weekly. 2. The WE treatment did not affect the abundance, species composition or biovolume of the phytoplankton or zooplankton communities, nor did it affect the periphyton or the macroinvertebrate community. A few species showed a significant response on some of the sampling dates, but there was no negative UVB effect at the community level. Overall, the ecosystems in the microcosms were not affected by the UVB treatment. 3. In a bio-assay, a laboratory clone of Daphnia pulex, not subjected to UVB radiation, was fed with seston from the microcosms. Daphnia pulex feeding on seston from the control microcosms grew faster, had better survival and better reproduction than D. pulex feeding on seston from the UVB treated microcosms. The phytoplankton-zooplankton interaction may have been influenced by the UVB treatment. 4. The dissolved oxygen content (DOC) concentrations in the microcosms were around 5 mg L-1. The DOC levels in Dutch systems rarely fall below 10 mg L-1. This might provide sufficient protection against the detrimental effects of increased UVB radiation.					van Donk, Ellen/B-7272-2008; Verschoor, Anthony/D-8446-2011	van Donk, Ellen/0000-0003-3279-4936; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				NOV	1999	42	3					545	560		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1999.00478.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1999.00478.x													WOS:000083843900013

Empirical studies, however, show that conspecific sexuals and parthenogens can differ in ecological preferences and geographical distribution, which complicates the investigation of the costs and benefits of sex. The freshwater planarian Schmidtea polychroa exists in a sexual and a sperm-dependent, parthenogenetic form. The latter produce fertile sperm and mate, but received sperm is used only to induce parthenogenetic embryo development. We compared the spatial and ecological distribution between forms within a lake from which both had been reported. Forty samples showed large differences in the relative frequencies of sexuals and parthenogens. Nineteen samples contained both biotypes. All but one of the 13 ecological parameters that we measured, could not explain a significant part of the variance in relative abundance of each type. Only leech abundance had a significant, negative effect on the presence of sexual individuals. The causes of this effect remained unclear. We also estimated the amount of genetic isolation between sites and between reproductive modes, using body coloration as a genetic marker. Large differences were found between sites, suggesting isolation of local populations by migration barriers. There were smaller differences between sexuals and parthenogens within sites, suggesting that genetic exchange between biotypes may be limited. We conclude that there appears to be weak niche differentiation between sexuals and parthenogens in Lago di Caldonazzo in late summer. Fluctuations in relative frequency appears to be a consequence of low dispersal between local populations and stochastic effects within them.

J	JAMISON, VC				JAMISON, VC			DIVISION I - SOIL PHYSICS - THE SIGNIFICANCE OF AIR ADSORPTION BY SOIL COLLOIDS IN PICNOMETRIC MEASUREMENTS	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA PROCEEDINGS												Pressure deficits from calculated values in picnometric measurements on dry soils have been observed. The explanation given is gas adsorption by dry soil colloids. The magnitude of this source of error in picnometric soil porosity measurements and its relationship to soil moisture was studied. A dual chamber picnometer adapted to measuring gas adsorption over a wide range of pressures was used. For the soils used the results were essentially the same for air and oxygen. At room temperatures (23[degree]C) and atmospheric pressure, oven-dried Hurricane clay adsorbed approximately 15.3 cc (one atm., 0[degree]C) per 100 g, while oven-dried Lloyd clay adsorbed only 3.7 cc per 100 g. However, adsorption fell to near zero at about 10% moisture (100 atm. moisture tension) for the Hurricane clay but did not approach zero for the Lloyd clay until at about 20% (15 atm. moisture tension). Quartz sand, Lakeland sand, and the organic colloid separated from Lakeland sand showed no measurable adsorptive capacity for oxygen or air. The adsorption found at ordinary temperatures does not approach the surface saturation values measured at very low temperatures by Emmett, Brunauer, and Love (Soil Sci. 45 57. 1938) but are consistent with their measurements at 0[degree]C. The air picnometer cannot be used to estimate porosity or moisture content of soils near or below air dryness unless a method based on direct calibration of fixed fresh soil weights is used.																									1953	17	1					17	19		10.2136/sssaj1953.03615995001700010003x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1953.03615995001700010003x													WOS:A1953YB67300003
J	Niwa, H				Niwa, Hideyuki			Estimation of potential seed dispersal regions based on floating and ballochory of Euphorbia adenochlora capsules	ECOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS AND EVIDENCE												The ability to disperse individuals and seeds among subpopulations is required for the sustainability of plant metapopulations. Understanding the mechanism of seed dispersal is essential for the conservation and restoration of plant diversity. In this study, Euphorbia adenochlora growing on floodplains was used as a research target to obtain new knowledge about hydrochory and ballochory and estimate potential dispersal range related to hydrological regimes. A wetland spreading around the Omi Maiko Inner Lake in Minami-Komatsu, Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture, Japan, was the study site. Euphorbia adenochlora bear capsules, which have a three-chambered hollow structure and which float on water up to 14 days, they can be dispersed by hydrochory. The capsule of E. adenochlora splits open when it dries, and ejects the seeds at a maximum distance of 4.1 m, indicating that the drifting capsule is capable for secondary dispersal by ballochory. At the study site, 2% of E. adenochlora subpopulations were within the range where fallen capsules could be dispersed by hydrochory, and 33% of E. adenochlora subpopulations could have been formed by ballochory from the drift line. Practical implications. These subpopulations are crucial for the conservation of E. adenochlora population at the study site. Furthermore, the fluctuating and maximum water levels from late May to mid-June for E. adenochlora were considered important to the formation of new subpopulations.					; NIWA, Hideyuki/ABK-6316-2022	Niwa, Hideyuki/0000-0002-8199-3248; 														2688-8319				OCT	2024	5	4							e70000	10.1002/2688-8319.70000	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2688-8319.70000													WOS:001375302200001

In the 2013-2015 period, randomly were taken eleven samples from four small artificial lakes located in the Bucharest-Ilfov area. From the computed basic statistic on 77 values were obtained both perfect positive correlation and perfect negative correlation for the Pearson's correlation coefficient (r). Strong positive correlation was found between the pair pH -SO42+ and between SO42+ -N-NO2- a low positive correlation. From the cluster analysis of six indicators, five clusters were achieved. The high level of similarity was obtained between CBO5 and SO42+ with a percent of 87.7%. For the analyzed water samples, the obtained value of 3.05 indicates a low degree of contamination for the monitored small artificial lakes. The Ptot values ranged from 0.02 mg/L to 0.23 mg/L and led to the establishment of the eutrophication status of the lakes water, from eutrophic status to hypereutrophic status, according to Romanian Order no. 161 of 2006. According to the same legislative act, the water of the monitored lakes falls within second class of water quality.					; Ecaterina, Marcu/AAV-9871-2021; ILIE, MIHAELA/E-7343-2010; Anghel, Ana-Maria/F-7618-2016; Tociu, Carmen/AAB-8136-2019; Diacu, Elena/ABG-2108-2020; Marinescu, Florica/O-5097-2017	Tociu, Carmen/0000-0002-4137-6456; MIHAELA, ILIE/0000-0001-7004-682X													2069-5837					JUN 15	2017	7	3					2048	2052																WOS:000411240800004
J	Wilcox, WM; Solo-Gabriele, HM; Sternberg, LOR				Wilcox, WM; Solo-Gabriele, HM; Sternberg, LOR			Use of stable isotopes to quantify flows between the Everglades and urban areas in Miami-Dade County Florida	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												An isotopic study was performed to assess the movement of groundwater for a site located in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The site encompasses portions of a protected wetland environment (northeast Everglades National Park) and suburban residential Miami, incorporating municipal pumping wells and lakes formed by rock mining. Samples of ground, surface, and rainwater were analyzed for their isotopic composition (oxygen-18 and deuterium). Various analytical and graphical techniques were used to analyze this data and two conceptual box models were developed to quantify flows between different regions within the site. Results from this study indicate that the aquifer underlying the study site (the Biscayne aquifer) is highly transmissive with the exception of two semi-confining layers of reduced hydraulic conductivity. Everglades surface water infiltrates into the aquifer and migrates east toward residential areas. In these urban areas, 'shallow' groundwater (above the deeper semi-confining layer) is substantially affected by urban rainfall while 'deep' groundwater (below the deeper semi-confining layer) maintains a composition similar to that of Everglades water. Rock mining lakes in the area provide 'breaks' in the semi-confining layers that allow for mixing of shallow and deep groundwater. As water travels eastward, municipal well intakes, screened to a depth below the deeper semi-confining layer, draw upon not only shallow urban water (predominantly comprised of urban rainfall) and lake water (having influences from both urban rainfall and Everglades water) but also deep water that originated in the Everglades. Results from one of the box models estimate that over 60% of the water being removed by municipal pumping originated in the Everglades. These conclusions suggest that Everglades water, both directly through deep groundwater flow and indirectly through mixing with rock-mining lakes, is being drawn into the operating municipal wellfield.

J	Anderson, RL; Foster, DR; Motzkin, G				Anderson, RL; Foster, DR; Motzkin, G			Integrating lateral expansion into models of peatland development in temperate New England	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 As peatlands form they create a temporal archive of community development, allowing the reconstruction of vegetation dynamics through the analysis of sediments and the development of detailed chronologies of successional change. Peatland formation occurs through two mechanisms: (i) terrestrialization, when a water body fills with sediments and peat; and (ii) paludification, the conversion of dry land to peatland. In temperate regions, where high summer temperatures may limit peat accumulation, general models of peatland development suggest that allogenic factors such as climate change control peatland development and that terrestrialization is the primary mechanism of formation. 2 This study evaluates this widely accepted model by comparing the developmental histories of three peatlands within the same climate region in New England in order to: (i) describe the development and timing of successional events among peatlands; (ii) document the roles of paludification and terrestrialization as developmental mechanisms; and (iii) evaluate the importance of climate change vs. autogenic factors in peatland development in this temperate region. 3 Basin morphometry, sediment stratigraphies, and chronologies of community change determined through radiocarbon dating indicate that peatland development at each site involved terrestrialization followed by paludification, with no apparent influence of broad-scale climate change on the timing of these processes. Paludification was consistently initiated coincident with the consolidation of a shrub mat across each lake-basin, and was controlled in extent and rate by the topography of the adjoining uplands. The timing of stratigraphic changes varied among sites, suggesting that autogenic factors associated with the accumulation of peat rather than regional climate change controlled development. These results provide the foundation for a model of temperate peatland development driven by autogenic factors and caution against the use of temperate peatland development as a proxy for climatic reconstruction.

J	Zuo, SH; Xie, ZD				Zuo, Shuhao; Xie, Zhidong			Iron-Rich Spherules of Taihu Lake: Origin Hypothesis of Taihu Lake Basin in China	MINERALS												In this paper, a detailed mineralogical study on iron-rich spherules in Taihu Lake was carried out, and we present a proposed impact-related origin for these iron-rich spherules. The iron-rich spherical concretions in Taihu Lake occur in a specific silty layer formed around similar to 7 ka B.P., sandwiched between an upper lacustrine deposit layer and a lower hard loess layer, and they are widely distributed and are the most abundant iron-rich concretions in that specific layer in the vicinity of Taihu Lake. The spherules are typically similar to 0.5 to 3 mm in diameter with a shape very similar to a spherical shape but not exactly rounded and have various apparent aerodynamic shapes, such as spherical, cone, spindle, ellipsoidal, elongated and pear-shaped morphologies. SEM imaging shows that there is no central core and no concentric layers in the spherules. Iron-rich spherical concretions are similar to accretionary lapilli and have a typical colloidal structure with abundant angular quartz grains and trace fragments of clays wrapped in fine cements that are mainly goethite with minor clays and carbon particles. The typical nodule-forming mechanism in aqueous sediments does not sufficiently explain the morphology and internal features of the iron-rich spherules of Taihu Lake, whereas the aerosol formation mechanism under the airburst impact origin hypothesis of the Taihu Lake basin may be a better explanation of the unique mineralogy of the spherules. Specifically, airburst impact plumes could be the reaction chambers of the aerosol to form the accretionary lapilli with a colloidal texture for the interior, while a dense shell and semi-plastic morphological features can form in the falling processes from higher altitudes in the plume.

J	MARSDEN, JE				MARSDEN, JE			SPAWNING BY STOCKED LAKE TROUT ON SHALLOW, NEAR-SHORE REEFS IN SOUTHWESTERN LAKE-MICHIGAN	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Restoration of self-sustaining populations of lake trout in the Great Lakes has been a goal of state, provincial, and federal agencies for over three decades. Juvenile lake trout have been stocked into Lake Michigan since 1965, but to date there has been limited evidence of spawning by adult feral fish on natural reefs. Although the restoration effort has focused on historically-used offshore spawning reefs in the last decade, the only study of spawning on a deep reef in Lake Michigan failed to find any evidence of egg deposition. Working on the hypothesis that stocked lake trout may be spawning on shallow reefs, the nearshore area of southwestern Lake Michigan was surveyed to locate areas of cobble substrate. The few areas of cobble substrate which were found appeared to provide marginal habitat for overwinter egg incubation, due to the lack of interstitial depth. Egg nets and traps were set on several reefs in the fall; eggs were recovered from four of six sites in 1991 and from three of four sites in 1992. The highest numbers of eggs were collected on a breakwall in Indiana (1 egg/net/day). All sites where eggs were found were less than 12 m deep and within 4 km of shore. Despite the recent focus of stocking and management efforts on deep, offshore reefs in Lake Michigan, lake trout spawn in shallow water. Imprinting to spawning sites does not explain this behavior. Spawning on the breakwall suggests that there is a paucity of good substrate in southern Lake Michigan.

J	MATVEEV, V				MATVEEV, V			EXPLOITATIVE AND INTERFERENCE COMPETITION AMONG PLANKTONIC CRUSTACEANS IN A SUBTROPICAL LAKE	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Competition among planktonic crustaceans was studied in a subtropical Argentinian lake. The community, dominated by Daphnia laevis, also comprised Diaphanosoma birgei, Notodiaptomus carteri, and Thermocyclops minutus. High niche overlap in terms of food and space, correlations between animal fecundities and nannoplankton density, as well as experiments on nutrient additions to bottles with lake water and Cladocera, suggested that there was competition in zooplankton. Strong Daphnia performance in the lake was associated with its wide niche and long population time lags. In summer, total biomass of crustaceans was a delayed function of nannoplankton concentration, while the latter was predicted well by the preceding crustacean biomass. This suggested exploitative regulation at the community level. However, when Daphnia was abundant in December-January, nannoplankton concentration failed to predict the rates of population increase of individual species. On the other hand, during the same period Daphnia biomass per se explained about 50% of the variance of these rates. When Daphnia became scarcer in February-March, the rates of population increase of Diaphanosoma and Thermocyclops became correlated to nannoplankton concentration. Each of the other two population parameters of crustaceans - fecundity and death rate - could simultaneously depend on nannoplankton and Daphnia density, but usually the Daphnia influence predominated, as indicated by multiple regression analysis. For all species, population parameters, and months pooled. Daphnia density effect significantly exceeded the effect of nannoplankton (P < 0.005). These results suggest that besides exploitation, interference may be an important regulator of crustacean abundance in warm lakes.

They have become crucial indicators for water quality assessment of inland water bodies. The support vector regression model (SVR) is suitable for small samples, has excellent generalization ability, and has high prediction accuracy. Still, it has the problem of difficult selection of model parameters and quickly falling into local extremes. To solve this problem, a hybrid Differential Evolution-Grey Wolf Optimizer (DE-GWO) algorithm is introduced into the parameter selection process of the support vector regression model, and an improved SVR algorithm (DE-GWO-SVR) is proposed for the remote sensing inversion of chlorophyll a concentration and suspended sediment concentration in water bodies. In this paper, the spectral reflectance of the water surface and the chlorophyll a and broken matter concentration values were obtained by field measurements in the Tangdao Bay waters of Qingdao, Shandong Province. The inverse model between the concentration values of the two water quality parameters and the corresponding sensitive factors was established by first determining the sensitive factors based on the response of the spectral reflectance to the two water quality parameters and introducing the DE-GWO optimization algorithm into the parameter selection process of the SVR model. Finally, the accuracy of the model was verified using Sentinel II satellite remote sensing spectral data, and then the inverse accuracy of the two water quality parameters was obtained. The mean relative error (MRE) of the chlorophyll a prediction model built by the DE-GWO algorithm optimizing the SVR is 25.1%, and the mean relative error (MRE) of the suspended matter prediction model is 32.5%. The inversion results were all better than the other models (linear regression, SVR, and GWO-SVR model). When the best model, built from the measured water surface spectral data, was applied to the Sentinel II satellite data, the improved SVR model outperformed the other models in terms of mean relative error. The experimental results confirm that the DE-GWO-SVR algorithm is an effective method for remote sensing inversion of chlorophyll a and suspended matter concentrations in water bodies, which can provide a reference for remote sensing inversion of chlorophyll a and suspended matter concentrations in Chinese offshore waters and subsequent scientific management of waters.					; Li（李）, Si-Jia（思佳）/X-4559-2018	Xu, Mingming/0000-0002-6758-9863; 														2072-4292				APR	2023	15	8							2104	10.3390/rs15082104	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15082104													WOS:000977249600001

Assessing the Long-Term Reproductive Contribution of Stocked Fish to Largemouth Bass Populations	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We evaluated the reproductive contribution of stocked Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides relative to resident populations. The reproductive contribution of stocked fish was determined using the MDH-B2* allele as a genetic tag for fingerlings stocked into five study lakes. We first determined the relative survival of stocked fish by calculating the proportion of adults (which were clipped at stocking) in the population and compared it with initial survival the first fall after stocking. Stocked fish relative survival to adulthood varied among the five study lakes and was lower than initial survival after stocking. Once these stocked fish were mature, it was possible to assess their reproductive contribution to each population by comparing the prestocking frequencies of the MDH-B2* allele with poststocking frequencies. Reproductive contribution of stocked fish was high in small lakes but relatively low in larger ones. Neither adult Largemouth Bass density nor prey density affected reproductive contribution of stocked fish. Based on the proportion of stocked adults in the populations, reproductive contribution of stocked fish was similar to that of wild fish. Our results indicate that reproductive contribution of stocked fish will depend on survival of stocked fish to maturity. The influence of stocked fish will likely persist in successive generations, and potential genetic effects on wild populations of Largemouth Bass should be taken into account when making stocking decisions.

Drift occurs for each equipment. So drift has got a lot of disadvantages in agriculture. Spray drift is harmful for wildlife and water supplies in environment. If we research the behaviour of drift, we may lake precautions for minimum environment pollution. Generally we want the spray to fall directly on a specific target area, but sometimes we want the material to spread widely to seek out target pests. If spray is applied to kill larvae in still water, it is desirable to be "right on target." However, when combating a heavy adult mosquito infestation, it Is advantageous to have the material drift into every nook and cranny, remaining airborne over a large area, in this case "drift is good." Spray drift is defined as the movement of chemical off-target area. Drift occurs in two ways. These are vapor and particle drift. Vapor drift is movement of spray as a vapour. Particle drift is the movement of spray as particles or droplets. Drift is affected by several factors. These factors are related to pesticide specification, droplet size, equipment, application methods and meteorological conditions. Drift can not be completely eliminated, but it can be greatly reduced, ii drift is reduced, environment pollution, phitotoxity and residue problems will be minimized in off-target areas. In this paper, affected factors on drift are investigated and recommendations related to minimum drift are presented for pesticide applications.

J	Zeighami, A; Kurylyk, BL				Zeighami, Aida; Kurylyk, Barret L.			Modelled Water Temperature Patterns and Energy Balance of a Threatened Coastal Lagoon Ecosystem	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Coastal water temperatures control physical, chemical, and biological processes and are expected to rise due to future changes in freshwater temperature and flow rates, heat exchange with the warming atmosphere, and thermal interactions with a changing ocean. However, the thermal sensitivity of transitional, coastal water bodies to climate change remains poorly understood, due partly to a lack of knowledge on present-day thermal controls in these settings. Accordingly, we applied a coastal hydrodynamic model (MIKE 3 FM), with a coupled thermal module to simulate hydrodynamics and water temperature variability in the Basin Head lagoon, a federally protected coastal ecosystem in the Canadian province of Prince Edward Island. Field data from the lagoon were used to calibrate and assess the numerical model, while atmospheric, oceanic, and hydrologic data were used to form the thermal and hydrodynamic boundary conditions. The model successfully reproduced tidal water level oscillations as well as diurnal and semi-diurnal (tidal) temperature fluctuations. Model results show longitudinal, cross-shore, and vertical thermal variability within the lagoon, including pronounced thermal variability near the bed and near the inlet due to tidal pumping. Model results and field data highlight the thermal sensitivity of the lagoon during heat waves; however, distinct cold-water plumes at freshwater inputs (springs and groundwater-dominated streams) persisted, with temporally averaged temperatures in these zones up to 18 degrees C colder than the ambient lagoon. Although, these freshwater inflows can dominate local energy budgets, the surface heat fluxes, especially shortwave radiation, exert the dominant control on the lagoon-wide energy budget. Collectively, the model findings emphasise the interacting effects of atmospheric, hydrologic, and oceanic forcing on the spatiotemporal patterns of water temperatures in this threatened coastal ecosystem.

Holocene aeolian sedimentation and episodic mass-wasting events recorded in lacustrine sediments on Langoya in Vesteralen, northern Norway	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												In this study, the frequency of mass-wasting events and past storminess has been reconstructed throughout the Holocene (11,500 cal yr BP to present) from lacustrine sediments in lake Trehynnvatnet (33 m which is located in a glacially carved valley at Nylcvdg on the outmost coast of western Langoya, Vesteralen, northern Norway. Sediment cores. (similar to 2-5 m long) have been examined by use of high-resolution magnetic susceptibility and XRF-scanning as well as grain size and loss-on-ignition analysis. In total 35 episodic event layers have been identified throughout the Holocene. The majority of these events are characterized as discrete coarse-grained sediment layers followed by normal grading, and are related to past mass-wasting activity within the catchment. Periods with high mass-wasting activity are dated to 11,000-10,500, 5500-4500, 4000-3500, 3000-2500, 2000-1000 and 500 -0 cal yr BP. The continuous input of sand grains (>250 mu m) has been systematically investigated throughout the sediment cores. The sand grains are related to catchment samples from the sandy beach deposits in Sandvikbulcta c. 750 m away in SW direction, and are suggested to indicate (niveo-) aeolian influx to the lake. The content of sand grains varies greatly throughout the record, although there is a clear increase in influx of sand during the last 2800 years. Periods with high aeolian influx are proposed to indicate increased storminess, which occurred between 1600 and 1550 (350-400 CE), 1400-1300 (450-550 CE), 750-550 (1200-1400 CE) and 250-20 cal yr BP (1700-1930 CE), which to some degree coincides with periods of increased storminess and winter precipitation recorded in other studies around the North Eastern Atlantic region.

The Bias and Signal Attenuation Present in Conventional Pollen-Based Climate Reconstructions as Assessed by Early Climate Data from Minnesota, USA	PLOS ONE												The inference of past temperatures from a sedimentary pollen record depends upon the stationarity of the pollen-climate relationship. However, humans have altered vegetation independent of changes to climate, and consequently modern pollen deposition is a product of landscape disturbance and climate, which is different from the dominance of climate-derived processes in the past. This problem could cause serious signal distortion in pollen-based reconstructions. In the north-central United States, direct human impacts have strongly altered the modern vegetation and hence the pollen rain since Euro-American settlement in the mid-19th century. Using instrumental temperature data from the early 1800s from Fort Snelling (Minnesota), we assessed the signal distortion and bias introduced by using the conventional method of inferring temperature from pollen assemblages in comparison to a calibration set from pre-settlement pollen assemblages and the earliest instrumental climate data. The early post-settlement calibration set provides more accurate reconstructions of the 19th century instrumental record, with less bias, than the modern set does. When both modern and pre-industrial calibration sets are used to reconstruct past temperatures since AD 1116 from pollen counts from a varve-dated record from Lake Mina, Minnesota, the conventional inference method produces significant low-frequency (centennial-scale) signal attenuation and positive bias of 0.8-1.7 degrees C, resulting in an overestimation of Little Ice Age temperature and likely an underestimation of the extent and rate of anthropogenic warming in this region. However, high-frequency (annual-scale) signal attenuation exists with both methods. Hence, we conclude that any past pollen spectra from before Euro-American settlement in this region should be interpreted using a pre-Euro-American settlement pollen set, paired to the earliest instrumental climate records. It remains to be explored how widespread this problem is when conventional pollen-based inference methods are used, and consequently how seriously regional manifestations of global warming have been underestimated with traditional pollen-based techniques.

The disease was observed in an intensive farm in 1987, summer, causing 35 to 40% mortality in the brood population and 8 to 10% mortality in the growing population. Yersinia ruckeri, belonging to the family of Enterobacteriaceae, was isolated from the spleen and kidneys of affected and died fish on bloodagar, as well as on Shotts-Waltman differential medium and was identified by the usual bacteriological methods. Its biochemical characteristics are summarized in a Table. The most characteristic clinical features (Figs 1, 2 and 7) and pathological changes (Figs 3, 4 and 6), as well as the bacteria in a kidney smear (Fig. 5) have been presented. The bacterium could not be isolated up to now from the trout population of the Hungarian fish farms, from eels, carps, breams, originating from the Lake Balaton, from eels kept on intensive farms or from carps of fish pounds, indicating that the bacterium was introduced by imported trouts. Of the factors helping in the development of the disease, an important role is attributed to the T-2 fusariotoxin content (2.015 mg/kg) of trout feed. This statement can be rendered probable that Y. ruckeri was also isolated from some of the trouts living on the same farm in 1988, however, mass incidence of the disease was not observed because they consumed a trout feed free of mycotoxins.																			0025-004X					JUL	1991	46	7					395	401																WOS:A1991GC55000002
J	Adhikari, DP; Koshimizu, S				Adhikari, DP; Koshimizu, S			Debris flow disaster at Larcha, upper Bhotekoshi Valley, central Nepal	ISLAND ARC					19th Himalaya-Karakoram-Tibet Workshop	2004	Niseko, JAPAN					Damage, destruction and casualties related to landslide and debris flow are common phenomena in the Himalaya, especially during the summer monsoon. This fact was tragically illustrated on 22 July 1996, when Larcha, situated at the 109-km mark of the Arniko Highway, upper Bhotekoshi Valley, central Nepal, experienced a catastrophic debris flow powered by the Bhairab Kunda Stream. Of the 22 houses in Larcha, 16 were swept away, two were partially damaged and 54 people were killed in a matter of a few minutes. The event attracted attention when media linked it to a glacial lake outburst flood as a result of the fact that the source of the stream is a glacial lake. To understand the cause, initiation mechanism and deposition process, the basin area was studied from geological, geomorphologic and engineering geological points of view and the role of precipitation was evaluated. A combination of rainfall, runoff from cliff faces and stream undercutting triggered failure of the bedrock and colluvium, both on the dip and counterdip slopes, 500 m upstream from the highway. The landslide debris dammed the channel, which was eventually breached, and deposited approximately 104 000 m(3) of coarse debris, dominated by the metasediments of the Lesser Himalayan origin, and overwhelmed the village of Larcha. The debris deposit was studied for clast size, composition, texture and dimensions. Lack of sorting and the presence of abundant silt and clay in the source area helped in the initiation of debris flow. The abundance of the Lesser Himalayan metasediment clasts together with the absence of debris traces upstream from the landslide site ruled out the possibility of a glacial lake outburst flood. The disaster was a result of landslide damming triggered by precipitation and stream undercutting and sudden bursting.																			1038-4871					DEC	2005	14	4					410	423		10.1111/j.1440-1738.2005.00495.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-1738.2005.00495.x													WOS:000234088300011

This study investigates the long-term effects of microcystins (MCs), potent cyanotoxins, on cattle at Lake des Oiseaux, a Ramsar-listed wetland in Algeria. Aligning with the "One Health" framework, the research evaluates the biochemical, histological, and oxidative stress impacts of MCs on livestock as environmental sentinels. Materials and Methods: A herd of 40 cattle (20 exposed and 20 non-exposed) was studied during the summer bloom period of 2019. Blood and liver samples were analyzed to assess biochemical markers (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, etc.), histopathological changes, and oxidative stress parameters (GPx, CAT, SOD, LPO and GSH). Results: Exposed cattle exhibited significant elevations in liver enzymes and oxidative stress markers, indicating hepatic inflammation and redox imbalance. Histological analysis revealed macrovacuolar steatosis, fibrosis, and bile duct dilatation. Antioxidant enzyme activities (GPx, CAT and SOD) were reduced, with notable depletion of GSH levels and increased lipid peroxidation. These findings reflect the cumulative cytotoxic effects of MC exposure. Non-exposed cattle showed no such changes. Conclusion: Long-term MC exposure disrupts liver function and induces oxidative stress in cattle, implicating significant risks for both animal and human health. The bioaccumulation of cyanotoxins in livestock emphasizes the urgent need for preventive measures, including water monitoring, restricted livestock access to contaminated sites, and farmer education. These strategies are vital to mitigate risks under the "One Health" approach, ensuring sustainable livestock and public health.

J	Joshi, M; Jalal, P				Joshi, Moulishree; Jalal, Poonam			Sedimentological evidence of climate-tectonic interaction in the upper Satluj catchment of NW Himalaya	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE												Quaternary valley fill deposits in the Upper Satluj Valley of NW Himalaya act as archives of changing climate-tectonic dynamics in a region. Quaternary landforms help in decoding the relationship between climate and tectonics. Kinnaur region is traversed by several active faults and thrusts such as the Kaurik-Chango Fault (KCF) and Sangla Detachment (SD), thereby making upper Satluj Valley tectonically active. Morphotectonic parameters such as width of valley floor (Vfw), Normalized Steepness Index (KSn) and geomorphological evidences such as the presence of huge strath terraces, narrowing of the river valley and palaeolake deposits point towards the tectonically active nature of the terrain. This arid, high elevation region is also climatically sensitive as it falls in a transient climatic zone which receives rainfall only during abnormal monsoon months. Excessive rainfall causes outburst floods, a common phenomenon in the area due to the blocking of headwater in the upper reaches of the Satluj valley. As a result, the Quaternary sequence is modified from time to time. The transition from hypo concentrated deposits to channel deposits and ponding events are prominent in the depositional sequence, resulting from a response to climate. The studied Quaternary sediments reveal that the Trans-Himalayan region of the upper Satluj valley is affected by tectonic-climate variability, making it vulnerable to geohazards.																			1672-6316	1993-0321				JUN	2024	21	6					1978	1991		10.1007/s11629-023-8371-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-023-8371-4													WOS:001249123300018

Eco-Heart considers six parameters, resulting in a pictorial output in the shape of a heart. A full heart indicates excellent water quality, whereas a broken heart indicates poor water quality. This investigation used six parameters, namely, pH, dissolved oxygen, phosphate, nitrate, turbidity, and faecal coliforms, for determining the status of a water body. Four water bodies in the city of Vadodara, India, were monitored using the index to see where they fell on a scale of pollution severity. Based on an Eco-Heart dataset of 3 years, it was found that the lakes in which broken hearts occurred ranged from a shrinking heart (moderately polluted) to a deformed heart (severely polluted). The obtained results were compared with the widely used National Sanitation Foundation Water Quality Index to validate the data, which showed a moderately positive correlation. Survey documentation for the applicability of the index on ground level was also carried out using Cronbach Alpha showing a positive response of people for use of the Eco-Heart Index, indicating that the Eco-Heart Index can be used as an alternative, easy, and sustainable tool for assessing water bodies.					; Samnani, Prakash/V-9036-2019	Parmar, Himakshi/0000-0002-0733-1035; Samnani, Prakash/0000-0001-6144-8755; 													2366-3340	2364-5687				DEC	2023	8	1							27	10.1007/s41101-023-00202-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s41101-023-00202-2													WOS:001018804400001
J	Laird, NF; Walsh, JE; Kristovich, DAR				Laird, NF; Walsh, JE; Kristovich, DAR			Model simulations examining the relationship of lake-effect morphology to lake shape, wind direction, and wind speed	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												Idealized model simulations with an isolated elliptical lake and prescribed winter lake-effect environmental conditions were used to examine the influences of lake shape, wind speed, and wind direction on the mesoscale morphology. This study presents the first systematic examination of variations in lake shape and the interplay between these three parameters. The array of 21 model simulations produced cases containing each of the three classic lake-effect morphologies (i.e., vortices, shoreline bands, and widespread coverage), and, in some instances, the mesoscale circulations were composed of coexisting morphologies located over the lake, near the downwind shoreline, or inland from the downwind shore. As with lake-effect circulations simulated over circular lakes, the ratio of wind speed ( U) to maximum fetch distance ( L) was found to be a valuable parameter for determining the morphology of a lake-effect circulation when variations of lake shape, wind speed, and wind direction were introduced. For a given elliptical lake and strong winds, a morphological transform from shoreline band toward widespread coverage accompanied changes in ambient flow direction from along to across the major lake axis. For simulations with weak winds over a lake with a large axis ratio, the morphology of the lake-effect circulation changed from vortex toward shoreline band with a change in wind direction from along to across the major lake axis. Weak winds across lakes with smaller axis ratios (i.e., 1: 1 or 3: 1) produced mesoscale vortices for each wind direction. Across the array of simulations, a shift in mesoscale lake-effect morphology from vortices to bands and bands toward widespread coverage was attended by an increase in U/L. Last, the elliptical-lake results suggest that the widths of the lake-effect morphological transition zones in U/L parameter space, conditions favorable for the coexistence of multiple morphologies, were greater than for circular lakes.

J	Hata, S; Kawamata, M; Doi, K				Hata, Shuntaro; Kawamata, Moto; Doi, Koichiro			Outbursts from an ice-marginal lake in Antarctica in 1969-1971 and 2017, revealed by aerial photographs and satellite data	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The liquid water around the Antarctic Ice Sheet plays a key role in modulating both the vulnerability of ice shelves to hydrofracturing and ice discharge from outlet glaciers. Therefore, it needs to be adequately constrained for precise future projections of ice-mass loss and global sea-level rise. Although glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) pose one of the greatest risks in glacierized mountainous regions, any long-term monitoring of Antarctic ice-marginal lakes and their associated potential for GLOFs has been neglected until recently owing to the limited number of such events reported in Antarctica. Here we present direct evidence of repeated GLOFs from Lake Kaminotani-Ike, an ice-sheet-dammed lake in East Antarctica, via an analysis of historical aerial photographs and recent satellite data. Two GLOFs occurred in 1969-1971 and 2017, with discharge volumes of (8.6 +/- 1.5)x10(7) and (7.1 +/- 0.4)x10(7) m(3), respectively, making them two of the largest GLOFs in Antarctica. A southerly oceanward pathway beneath the ice sheet is the most likely drainage route of these GLOF events based on the available surface- and bed-elevation datasets. Furthermore, the 2017 event occurred during the austral winter, thereby implying the possibility of year-round active subglacial networks in Antarctica. Our results highlight that studies on Antarctic ice-marginal lakes provide an opportunity to better understand Antarctic hydrological processes and emphasize the need for both detailed monitoring of ice-marginal lakes and detailed surveying of the subglacial environments of the Antarctic Ice Sheet.					; Hata, Shuntaro/HPG-8098-2023	Hata, Shuntaro/0000-0002-7221-808X; 													2045-2322					NOV 27	2023	13	1							20619	10.1038/s41598-023-47522-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-47522-w								38012284					WOS:001144297500037

In 1997, we validated the SST in coastal regions of the Gulf of Mexico, Southeast US and Northeast US and the lake surface temperatures in the Great Lakes every other month. The in situ temperatures measured by 24 NOAA moored buoys were used as ground data. The non-linear SST (NLSST) algorithm was used for all AVHRR SST estimations except during the day in the Great Lakes where the linear multichannel SST (MCSST) algorithm was used. The buoy-satellite matchups were made within one image pixel in space (1.1 km at nadir) and +/-1 h in time. For the NOAA-12 satellite, the validation results for the three coastal regions (Gulf of Mexico, Southeast US and Northeast US) showed that the mean temperature difference between satellite and buoy surface temperature (bias) was about 0.4 degreesC during the day and 0.2 degreesC at night. The standard deviation was about 1.0 degreesC. Great Lakes validation results showed a bias less than 0.3 degreesC during the day. However, due to the early morning fog situation in the summer months in the Great Lakes region, the NLSST night algorithm yielded a fairly large bias of about 1.5 degreesC. The same statistics were computed for the NOAA-14 satellite measurements. For the coastal regions, the bias was less than 0.2 degreesC with a standard deviation about 1.0 degreesC. For the Great Lakes region, the bias was about 0.4 degreesC for both day and night with a standard deviation about 1.0 degreesC. Our study also showed that the NLSST algorithm provides the same order of SST accuracy over all study regions and under a wide range of environmental conditions.

B	Ahrens, JF; Newton, M		LeBaron, HM; McFarland, JE; Burnside, OC		Ahrens, John F.; Newton, Michael			Benefits of Triazine Herbicides in the Production of Ornamentals and Conifer Trees	TRIAZINE HERBICIDES: 50 YEARS REVOLUTIONIZING AGRICULTURE												Ornamental plants contribute immensely to quality of life. Wood and wood fibers are important to human survival and comfort. The production of ornamentals and conifer trees is limited in unique ways by competition from both native and introduced wild vegetation. Over the course of more than four decades the triazine herbicides have provided safe, effective, and economical weed management in ornamental plants and forest conifers. This has greatly improved the efficient production and quality of these crops by: reducing labor requirements; improving plant growth, survival, vigor, and aesthetic value; and shortening crop rotation times. Triazine herbicides have been largely responsible for the abundant supply of high-quality Christmas trees in the United States, as well as the success and improvement of reforestation in Westem coniferous forests. Triazine herbicides have revolutionized reforestation practices on many forested areas. Plantation tree survival has risen dramatically, resulting from the combination of better weed control and improved seedling production technology. Neither component alone would have provided for the degree of success forest managers enjoy today. Whether the weed problem is exacerbated by summer drought as in the West, by rank overtopping by herbs as in the South and Northeast, or by persistent competing trees such as oaks in the South and aspens in the Lake States, triazine herbicides have proven effective and economical in bringing tree survival and growth to levels thought unachievable in 1960. They have not only improved reforestation practice, but also have permitted establishment of conifers on many sites considered too poor for either agriculture or forestry. Now many of those sites have grown up to timber and, having had little competition in their juvenile years, are proving to be highly productive forests.																					978-0-08-055963-6				2008							225	234		10.1016/B978-044451167-6.50021-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-044451167-6.50021-0													WOS:000317601100019
J	Pontén, A; Plink-Björklund, P				Ponten, Anna; Plink-Bjorklund, Piret			Depositional environments in an extensive tide-influenced delta plain, Middle Devonian Gauja Formation, Devonian Baltic Basin	SEDIMENTOLOGY												The Middle Devonian Gauja Formation in the Devonian Baltic Basin preserves tide-influenced delta plain and delta front deposits associated with a large southward prograding delta complex. The outcrops extend over 250 km from southern Estonia to southern Lithuania. The succession can be divided into 10 facies associations recording distributary channel belts that became progressively more tide influenced when traced southwards towards the palaeo-shoreline, separated by muddy intra-channel areas where deposition was characterized by crevasse splays, delta plain lakes, abandoned channel deposits and tidal gullies. Tidal currents influenced deposition over the entire delta plain, extending up to 250 km from the contemporary shoreline. Tidal facies on the upper delta plain differ from those on the lower delta plain and delta front. In the former case, deposition from river currents was only occasionally interrupted by tidal currents, e.g. during spring tides, resulting in mica and mudstone drapes, and distinctive graded cross-stratification. The lower delta plain was dominated by tidal facies and tidal currents regularly influenced deposition. There was a change from progradation to aggradation from the lower to the upper part of the Gauja Formation coupled with a vertical decrease in tidal influence and a decrease in coarse-grained sediment input. The Gauja Formation contrasts with established models for tide-influenced deltas as the active delta plain was not restricted by topography. The shape of the delta plain, the predominant southward (basinward)-directed palaeocurrents, and the thick sandstone succession, show that although tidal currents strongly influenced deposition at bed scale, rivers still controlled the overall morphology of the delta and the larger-scale bedforms. In addition, there are no signs of wave influence, indicating very low wave energy in the basin. The widespread tidal influence in the Devonian Baltic Basin is explained by changes in the wider basin geometry and by local bathymetrical differences in the basin during progradation and aggradation of the delta plain, with changes in tidal efficiency accompanying the change in basin geometry produced by shoreline progradation.					; Plink-Bjorklund, Piret/AAF-2936-2019	Ponten, Anna/0000-0003-1326-2280; 													0037-0746	1365-3091				OCT	2007	54	5					969	1006		10.1111/j.1365-3091.2007.00869.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3091.2007.00869.x													WOS:000249664200001

How non-native species in Lake Erie influence trophic transfer of mercury and lead to top predators	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake Erie's food web has been dramatically modified by exotic species. Both exotic dreissenid mussels and the round goby Neogobius melanastomus have shifted the food web from a pelagic-based to a benthic-based one, potentially creating a new pathway for contaminant transfer to top predators. Before the invasion of round gobies, few predators of dreissenids occurred in Lake Erie, allowing contaminants to be confined to these benthic organisms. The invasion of the round goby has produced a new pathway through which these contaminants can enter the food web. To characterize heavy-metal transfer through this new food web and to assess risk to humans, water, surficial sediment, dreissenid, round goby, and smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieui samples were collected at three sites during summers, 2002 and 2003, and analyzed for total lead (Pb), total mercury (Hg), and methyl mercury (MeHg). In addition, we compared smallmouth bass Pb and Hg concentrations to those measured in 1993/1994, before round gobies were prevalent. Pb biodiminished and MeHg biomagnified through the food web to smallmouth bass; patterns were similar among our three sites. Total Pb concentrations in smallmouth bass were higher before the incorporation of round gobies into their diet. We attributed this decline to changes in food web structure, changes in contaminant burdens in prey, or declines in sediment Pb concentrations in Lake Erie. By comparison, Hg concentrations in smallmouth bass changed little, before and after the round goby invasion, possibly due to a shift in diet that increased growth. Despite a decline in sediment Hg concentrations in Lake Erie, smallmouth bass continued to accumulate Hg at historical rates possibly because of their high consumption rates of benthivorous round gobies. As smallmouth bass continue to consume round gobies during their lives, their Hg concentrations may well continue to increase, potentially increasing the risk of Hg contamination to humans.

J	Hoff, MH				Hoff, MH			Discrimination among spawning aggregations of lake herring from Lake Superior using whole-body morphometric characters	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The lake herring (Coregonus artedi) was one of the most commercially and ecologically valuable Lake Superior fishes, but declined in the second half of the 20th century as the result of overharvest of putatively discrete stocks. No tools were previously available that described lake herring stock structure and accurately classified lake herring to their spawning stocks. The accuracy of discriminating among spawning aggregations was evaluated using whole-body morphometrics based on a truss network. Lake herring were collected from 11 spawning aggregations in Lake Superior and two inland Wisconsin lakes to evaluate morphometrics as a stock discrimination tool. Discriminant function analysis correctly classified 53% of all fish from all spawning aggregations, and fish from all but one aggregation were classified at greater rates than were possible by chance. Discriminant analysis also correctly classified 66% of fish to nearest neighbor groups, which were groups that accounted for the possibility of mixing among the aggregations. Stepwise discriminant analysis showed that posterior body length and depth measurements were among the best discriminators of spawning aggregations. These findings support other evidence that discrete stocks of lake herring exist in Lake Superior, and fishery managers should consider all but one of the spawning aggregations as discrete stocks. Abundance, annual harvest, total annual mortality rate, and exploitation data should be collected from each stock, and surplus production of each stock should be estimated. Prudent management of stock surplus production and exploitation rates will aid in restoration of stocks and will prevent a repeat of the stock collapses that occurred in the middle of the 20th century, when the species was nearly extirpated from the lake.																			0380-1330						2004	30			1			385	394		10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70399-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70399-8													WOS:000227991500027
J	Gainsford, MP				Gainsford, M. P.			Fishing traps in western Sweden, location, type and frequency: underwater survey and investigation from Lake Gardsken, Alingsas, Sweden	UNDERWATER TECHNOLOGY												Fishing traps are perhaps one of the least studied categories of archaeological remains in Sweden. Since at least the Mesolithic (10 000-5 000 BP), use of systematic fishing structures to harvest the sea of its resources is evidenced in the archaeological record. Such structures are often found in lakes, rivers and estuaries. Relatively often, Bohuslans Museum has, during underwater archaeological surveys, discovered previously unrecorded fishing traps that often fall within the time frame of Middle Ages (11th to 16th centuries) to the modern day (19th to 20th centuries). Such structures, therefore, are not just a peculiarity but more a regularity - in that they have had a widespread use in Swedish culture and livelihood. One such example of this is from Lake Gardsken, Alingsas. Alingsas is mentioned in the written record from at least the 1300s although it not implausible to assume that the area had been settled previous to this. In Sweden, fishing has not only constituted a pastime or a profession, but has served as a complement to the household. Farmers for example, would often fish to support their meagre income or diet. Although fishing traps have a widespread use, form and geography, all have the same function - to catch fish. This article includes the case study of Lake Gardsken, Alingsas. Bohuslans Museum (the provincial museum of the county of Bohuslan) has undertaken several archaeological investigations in the lake since 2009.																			1756-0543	1756-0551				NOV	2016	34	1					21	30		10.3723/ut.34.021	http://dx.doi.org/10.3723/ut.34.021													WOS:000412468000004

Simulation and Evaluation of Control Methods for Thermal Stratification Reduction in Large Artificial Lakes	JOURNAL OF VIBRATION ENGINEERING & TECHNOLOGIES												Thermal stratification can cause serious aquatic environmental problems in natural and artificial lakes, which motivates the need to develop suitable engineering methods for controlling or eliminating the notorious problem. In this study, we perform a series of numerical experiments to quantify the effectiveness of specific vibration-based control methods for reducing thermal stratification in deep waters, through the case study of Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), China. An unsteady two-dimensional longitudinal-vertical model is first applied to simulate the hydrodynamics and thermal dynamics in the deep, long and narrow reservoir. The model is validated against the field data for a whole year under a wide range of hydrological and meteorological conditions; the development of stratification and water temperature profiles are successfully reproduced. By comparing alternative scenario simulations, we further investigate the effects of turbulence-induced vibration on the water temperature profiles. It is shown that, due to the vertical forced vibration by frequently rising and falling water levels, the steep temperature gradient at the middle water layers near the dam can be locally improved under the constraint of withdrawal thickness. The results also indicate that control of thermal stratification of TGR relies significantly on the upstream discharge regulation, suggesting the possibility of using a combination of the vibration-based control method and the multiple-reservoir operation for water temperature management.																			2321-3558					FEB	2015	3	1					1	12																WOS:000350488800001

The number of pixels within one of five color zones was counted for statistical color analyses. A total of 163 samples were collected for the core depth of 2.10-59.49 m. Twelve images were investigated for each sample. The number of colored pixels (analogous to the emission intensity) varied along the core depth. The amount of HCl-soluble-material, i.e., calcium carbonates, shows similar fluctuations, and the colored pixel points on the CIE chromaticity diagram fell in the same region with those for calcium carbonates from the catchment area. These results indicate that the major source of luminescence is calcium carbonate. When TLCIs are investigated after grain size separation, a small number of pixels are found in the blue-purple region, separate from the main cluster of pixels in the CIE diagrams for only fine particles. Because aeolian dust is expected to be in fine-grained fractions, these distinctive luminescence emitters are possibly of aeolian origin. TLCI has a potential to extract information for aeolian dust in lake sediments. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The 16 episodes of fountaining persisted intermittently (with repose periods of between 7h and 4days) for 36days. They produced tephra deposits that were dispersed several kilometers downwind of the vent, and a much larger volume of clastogenic lava which drained into the Klauea Iki crater to form a >100m deep lava lake. Field data from 211 tephra sample pits downwind of the vent reflect imperfectly the episodic nature of the fountaining behavior: only five composite stratigraphic subunits from the total of 16 fountaining episodes can be mapped in the field. However, isopach maps of these subunits were generated and, by the application of empirical deposit thinning relationships, volumes of each subunit were estimated. In combination with detailed observations made in 1959, our field data allow us to assign stratigraphic subunits to either single or aggregates of several fountaining episodes. The most voluminous subunits are linked with the highest fountaining, not with the longest in duration. In fact, significant downwind dispersal was possible only if the top part of the fountains reached above the crater rim, which was located about 100m above the vent. The end of high fountaining episodes produced ash-rich partings, which are found on top of the lapilli-sized products of some episodes. However, the ash-rich intervals are strongly attenuated by wind advection and so are only present along the dispersal axes. The subunits follow slightly different dispersal axes. The maximum spread of 28 degrees between various dispersal axes is predominantly controlled by changing wind directions and spatter cone collapse into the vent, which modified its geometry. This study outlines the dependency of tephra dispersal on fountain height and emphasizes the capability of an episodic Hawaiian fountaining eruption to generate a seemingly monotonous downwind tephra deposit.

One locality was at a lake outlet, one further down in the same river and one in a nearby small forest stream. The 3 dominant species at the outlet [Metacnephia tredecimatum, Schonbaueria annulitarsis, Simulium truncatum] were virtually absent from the other localities where, conversely, most larvae belonged to species not present at the outlet. Total larval abundance was very much higher at the outlet, where larvae were present for a shorter period than elsewhere. Even within a few hundred meters from the outlet the relative growth rate of larvae was slower than at the outlet, and only a little further downstream the species prevailing at the outlet were replaced by other species. Large particles, such as phytoplankton and coarse detritus, occurred in similar numbers everywhere and at all times, and therefore did not seem to control the abundance of blackfly larvae. After examining the role of temperature and substrate it is concluded that food, i.e., small particles possibly down to colloidal size, provide the resource maintaining the hugh larval aggregations immediately below the lake outlet. These particles, produced on the lake bottom by decomposition processes during the winter, are washed out into the river at ice-melt. Changes in their availability and/or nutritive value limit their usefulness as food to the section of the river immediately downstream from the lake. Additional benefits may accrue to larvae growing in these areas of extreme population density.																			0030-1299	1600-0706					1977	29	2					229	238		10.2307/3543607	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3543607													WOS:A1977EG23200005
J	Borgeraas, J; Hessen, DO				Borgeraas, J; Hessen, DO			Variations of antioxidant enzymes in Daphnia species and populations as related to ambient UV exposure	HYDROBIOLOGIA												To assess their role in photoprotection in the crustacean zooplankton Daphnia spp., activities of the antioxidants catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione transferase (GST) and content of carotenoids (CAR) were studied in 4 Daphnia species from a total of 50 populations. Included in the survey were alpine and lowland populations of both pigmented and non-pigmented D. longispina, rock-pool and laboratory clones of D. magna and Arctic populations of the D. pulex/D. middendorffiana complex. Most of the surveyed populations inhabit shallow ponds, and are thus highly exposed to UV-radiation during the summer. The results are primarily discussed in relation to antioxidants as possible protection against UV-radiation. D. pulex, D. middendorffiana and D. longispina occurred both as hyaline and pigmented (carapace melanization) morphs. The most notable interspecies differences were the high activity of CAT in the D. magna lab-clone, the low activity of GST in melanic animals from the D. pulex group and the high activity of SOD in D. longispina from a lowland humic pond. Contrary to expectations, we found no differences in antioxidant capacity between melanic and non-pigmented alpine D. longispina. Intraspecies variation in antioxidant activities was studied in relation to pond characteristics. Among the alpine populations of D. longispina there was a significant positive correlation between absorbance (300 nm) of the pond water and CAT activity, which could be related to ambient levels of photoinduced hydrogen peroxide production in these small water bodies. The data from this comparative study provide insight in photo-protective mechanisms in cladocera, and constitute a valuable basis for future research on pro-oxidant and antioxidant processes in alpine and arctic freshwater zooplankton.

J	Yoshida, Y; Nakahara, H; Kuwae, A				Yoshida, Y; Nakahara, H; Kuwae, A			Mechanisms on the occurrence of Microcystis bloom at harbors in the north basin of Lake Biwa	NIPPON SUISAN GAKKAISHI												Late summer in 1994, Microcystis bloom (dominant species: Microcystis aeruginosa) occurred for the first fime at two harbors in the north basin of Lake Biwa. The limit values of TN (total nitrogen) and TP (total phosphorus) for the occurrence of Microcystis bloom were ca 30 and 3 mu g at/l, respectively. By comparing with the water quality factors of the harbors where Microcystis bloom occurred and the factors of harbors where Melosira bloom (dominant species: Melosila granulata) did, it was showed that TN, TP, DIP (dissolved inorganic phosphorus) and TN: DIN (dissolved inorganic nitrogen) tended to be higher and TN: TP and DIN: DIP ratios tended to be lower in the harbors where Microcystis bloom occurred. As the cause of the bloom of Microcystis in the north basin of the Lake Biwa, it was suggested that the suitable environment conditions for the quick growth of Microcystis was brought by the continuation of hot and clear weather in 1994. The increase of DIP exudation from bottom sediments, the intense consumption of DIN by phytoplankton, the disappearance of DIN due to nitrification and denitrification near the surface of bottom sediments might cause the increase of DIP and TN: DIN ratio. Further, the relative increase of DON (dissolved organic nitrogen) and the inorganization of DON by the symbiotic bacteria might supplied DIN to Microcystis, as many bacteria with same form were found at the middle layer of mucilage slim of colonies of Microcystis.																			0021-5392					MAR	1996	62	2					230	235																WOS:A1996UH08200008

Various constituents dissolved in principal Japanese rivers and lakes, and major and minor metallic elements in suspended solids were analyzed by emission spectrography. Higher concentrations of the minor elements (Pb, Zn, Cu, Ni, Mn and Co) were found in suspended solids than in unpolluted soils or in the continental crust. Concentrations of Mn, Cu, Ni, Pb and Sn were high in the northeastern provinces [Japan]. This was due to the higher concentrations of these metals distributed in geologic formations and to the influence of many Cu and other mines. Distribution of Be divided Japan into 2 halves. It was lower in the eastern half. Positive correlations were observed between concentrations of Be, Al and Ti. Owing to the acid nature (pH 2.0) of the Yu River in the Tone river system, caused by the Kusatsu hot sulfur springs, the concentrations of all metals except Si showed the lowest values, while had the highest value. Other inorganic acid rivers, distributed mostly in the northeastern provinces, the Agatsuma River (pH 4.3) of the same system and the Ara River (pH 3.6), and acid lakes, Lake Tazawa (pB 4.4) and Lake Inawashiro (pB 4.5) showed approximately the same tendency.																			0016-7002	1880-5973					1980	14	5					203	225		10.2343/geochemj.14.203	http://dx.doi.org/10.2343/geochemj.14.203													WOS:A1980LH67100001

The main caldera truncates a cone constructed predominantly of potassic lavas of the HK Series. The initial collapse of this caldera may have been associated with one of the ignimbritic eruptions of the Brown Leucitic Tuff (BLT) around 385000 yr BP. The Campagnola Tuff, the youngest ignimbrite of the BLT, however, drapes the caldera margin and must postdate at least the initial stages of collapse. During the subsequent history of the caldera there were several major explosive eruptions. The largest of these was that of the Galluccio Tuff at about 300000 yr BP. It is likely that there was further collapse within the main caldera associated with these eruptions. It is of note that despite these subsequent major explosive eruptions later collapse occurred within the confines of the main caldera. Between eruptions caldera lakes developed producing numerous lacustrine beds within the caldera fill. Extensive phases of phreatomagmatic activity generated thick sequences of pyroclastic surge and fall deposits. Activity within the main caldera ended with the growth of a large complex of basaltic trachyandesite lava domes around 150000 yr BP. Early in the history of Roccamonfina sector collapse on the northern flank of the volcano formed the northern caldera. One of the youngest major events on Roccamonfina occurred at the head of this northern caldera with explosive activity producing the Conca Ignimbrite and associated caldera. There is no evidence that there was any linkage in the plumbing systems that fed eruptions in the main and northern calderas.

This column contains vegetation remnants and bone fragments, including a well preserved jaw of a gomphothere, which was recovered from a volcanic lahar deposit intercalated with fluvial deposits and a pyroclastic succession associated to the basaltic monogenetic volcanism of the Cerro Catio. On the basis of dental morphology, the gomphothere has been classified as Cuvieronius hyodon. The stratigraphic description indicates that the deposit of this lahar was associated to a volcanic succession with a predominant pyroclastic fall, scarce pyroclastic flows and a basal basaltic lava flow with olivine +/- ortopyroxene. The complete volcanic sequence was emplaced within a fluvial endorreic basin restricted to the northern portion of the Patzcuaro lake. Isotopic C-14 analysis of a woody fragment found in a horizon underlying the fossil fragments, provided an age of 26 ky +/- 190 BP This late Pleistocene age Can be assigned to the gomphothere as well as to the basaltic volcanic event of the Cerro Catio. Petrographic and pollinic studies of the sediments and basaltic tephra show dun the volcanic activity was characterized by variable intensity, With recurrent waning periods,followed by volcanic quiescence. Moist climatic conditions favored the devitrification process of the volcanic ash and the weathering of other minerals, which provided good conditions for recovering of the mesophillic vegetation: Fraxinus. Acer Corylus, Ulmus, Betula, and Juglans. In agreement with other authors. we conclude that the preponderant paleoenvironment of the Patzcuaro lake during late Pleistocene was similar although colder to present-day climate. In this paleoenvironment, the presence idle terrestrial mammals was favored by the availability of relatively abundant mesophytic vegetation, which was seemingly perturbed by the volcanic exhalations associated to the monogenetic volcanism of the Michoacan-Guanajuato volcanic field.

The elevation of the site ranges from 1650 to 2420 in, at which the high frequency of fog occurrence throughout the year has been thought to be of benefit to the establishment of the primary Taiwan yellow cypress forest [Chamaecyparis obtusa var. formosana (Hayata) Rehder] and to the extensive growth of the epiphytic bryophytes. A weather station including a visibility sensor and an active fog collector was installed for fog meteorological and chemical study. The fog deposition rate on epiphytic bryophytes was estimated by measuring the increase rate in plant weight when exposed to fog. Average fog duration of 4.7 and 11.0 h per day was measured in summer months (June to August) and the rest of the year, respectively. November 2000 was the foggiest month in which the average fog duration reached 14.9 h per day. The ionic composition of fog water revealed that the area was less polluted than expected from literature data. The in situ exposure experiments done with the dominant epiphytic bryophytes showed an average fog deposition rate of 0.63 g H2O g(-1) d. w. h(-1), which approximated 0.17 min h(-1) at the stand scale. The nutrient fluxes estimated for February 2001 showed that for all ions, more than 50% of the ecosystem input was through fog deposition. These results demonstrate the importance of epiphytic bryophytes and fog deposition in nutrient cycling of this subtropical montane forest ecosystem. The incorporation of fog study in the long-term ecosystem research projects is necessary in this area. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this study, we employed a content analysis to extensively review printed and online newspaper articles reporting on the use of destructive fishing gears and methods and their impacts over the past decade (2014-2024). To validate the gathered data, direct observations, key informant interviews, and focus group discussions were applied. The findings revealed the widespread use of five common destructive fishing methods (different types of nets, electric fishing, and application of chemicals) across the country. A total of 60 fish species and 6 crustaceans were documented as being caught by destructive methods. Among the fish species captured using destructive methods, approximately 26 % are classified as threatened, falling into categories such as vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered. Destructive fishing gears not only endanger target fish species but also disrupt fish eggs, fry and juveniles, as well as several non-target species, including mammals, waterfowl and various vertebrates, and they may also pose health risks to humans. Addressing these impacts necessitates a strategic roadmap that includes enforcement of existing regulations, a robust policy framework, implementation of science-based management practices, and active engagement of stakeholders to raise awareness and promote sustainable alternatives.					; Haque, Mohammad/LDG-2866-2024	Haque, Mohammad Mahfujul/0000-0001-5279-7371; 													0308-597X	1872-9460				NOV	2025	181								106818	10.1016/j.marpol.2025.106818	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2025.106818													WOS:001533046900001

THE INFLUENCE OF EMERGENT MACROPHYTES ON THE ABUNDANCE AND COMMUNITY COMPOSITION OF AMMONIA OXIDIZERS	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												Ammonia oxidation which is both the first and a significant step in nitrogen cycling can be catalyzed by ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). In this study, the abundance and community composition of AOA and AOB in the rhizosphere sediments of two emergent macrophytes (Zizania caduciflora and Phragmites australis) were investigated in January and August in Lake Taihu to elucidate the relationship between emergent macrophytes and the abundance and diversity of AOA and AOB. The abundance of archaeal amoA gene ranged from 3.13x10(6) to 2.61x10(8) copies per gram of dry sediment, whereas the abundance of bacterial amoA gene ranged from 9.62x10(5) to 3.14x10(7) copies per gram of dry sediment. The abundance of the bacterial amoA gene was significantly positively correlated with NO3--N (P<0.05), and OM concentrations exhibited a positive correlation between the abundance of archaeal amoA gene and bacterial amoA gene (P<0.05). 94.81% of archaeal amoA sequences fell into Nitrosopumilus and Nitrosotalea clusters. For the bacterial amoA sequences, Nitrosospira lineage predominated in the sediment sample of Zizania caduciflora in January, whereas the other samples were predominant with N.oligotropha lineage. The data obtained in this study may be useful to support studies in researching the effect of emergent macrophytes on the nitrification process of lake ecosystems.

However, the leaching process remains challenged by acidic wastewater generation from inorganic acids or the inefficiency of organic acids, and a single extractant often falls short in achieving optimal extraction efficiency. This study investigates chemical behavior of diisobutyl ketone (DIBK) in the FeCl3-tributyl phosphate (TBP)-kerosene lithium extraction system from spent lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4, LFP) powder. The isomorphic substitution method has emerged as an efficient and cost-effective technology for leaching process, avoiding the generation of acid wastewater. Moreover, results indicate that the first lithium extraction efficiency increases to 84%, representing a 9.4% improvement compared to extractions without DIBK. After two extractions, the overall efficiency reaches 98.9%. DIBK is beneficial to prevent the formation of a third phase by enhancing the solubility of the extracted complex, thereby improving lithium recovery from organic phases. Subsequently, the extracted complex structure is confirmed to be LiFeCl4<middle dot>1.50TBP<middle dot>0.27DIBK using the fitting slope method in conjunction with FTIR and UV spectroscopy. Additionally, LiFePO4/C is re-synthesized to achieve closed-loop processes. This research offers valuable insights and references for the valuable elements recycling.																			2365-6549					JUN	2025	10	21							e00887	10.1002/slct.202500887	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/slct.202500887													WOS:001498958800001

Timothy		Misfits Flat Meteorite Consortium	Meteorites found on Misfits Flat dry lake, Nevada	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE												Meteorites have been found on the small Misfits Flat dry lakebed near Stagecoach, Nevada (119.382W, +39.348N). Since the first find on Sept. 22, 2013, a total of 58 stones of weathering stage W2/3 with a combined mass of 339g have been collected in 19 visits to the area. This small (3.3x3.6km) lakebed is now a newly designated dense collection area (DCA). Most meteorites were found in a small 350x180m area along the north shore and most are fragments of several broken individual stones. Three of these fragments were classified as an LL4/5 of shock stage S2, now named Misfits Flat 001, one of which (stone MF33) fell 8.1 +/- 1.3ka ago based on the C-14 terrestrial age, assuming it came from a 20-80cm diameter meteoroid. In addition, a small darkly crusted meteorite MF34, now named Misfits Flat 002, was found 820m WSW from the main mass. This meteorite is classified as an LL5 ordinary chondrite with shock stage S4/5. The meteorite is saturated in C-14 at 63dpmkg(-1), suggesting it originated from the center of a 0.5 m diameter meteoroid, or deep inside a similar to 1.0 m meteoroid, less than 300yr ago. Accounts exist of a fireball seen at 13:15 UT on March 2, 1895, that are consistent with the find location of Misfits Flat 002.					; Rowland, Douglas/F-3104-2014; Yin, Qing-Zhu/B-8198-2009	Zolensky, Michael/0000-0002-3181-1303; Rowland, Douglas/0000-0001-8059-6905; Sanborn, Matthew/0000-0003-3218-1195													1086-9379	1945-5100				APR	2016	51	4					757	772		10.1111/maps.12619	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/maps.12619													WOS:000374050800008
J	KILHAM, P; KILHAM, SS				KILHAM, P; KILHAM, SS			ENDLESS SUMMER - INTERNAL LOADING PROCESSES DOMINATE NUTRIENT CYCLING IN TROPICAL LAKES	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Fossil diatom assemblages deposited in more than a dozen African lakes roughly 9500 years BP were dominated by a single planktonic species, Stephanodiscus astraea (Ehrenb.) Grun. (although realistically this is likely to be a species complex). These diatoms flourished when lake-levels were maximal. Data are included from many of the large African lakes, and others extending from Lake Abhe, Ethiopia, to Lake Cheshi, Zambia. Because the ecological physiology of Stephanodiscus species is well known one can predict the nutrient regime that must have existed when Stephanodiscus bloomed. Owing to competition for resources Stephanodiscus species dominate when the supply ratio of silicon to phosphorus (in moles) in the epilimnion is relatively low (Si:P.apprx.1). Consequently, lakes dominated by S. astraea are often hypereutrophic. We propose a series of hypotheses to explain why tropical lakes have decreasing Si:P ratios as lake-levels increase, primarily owing to internal P-loading processes in the epilimnia. These observations appear to contradict present conceptions of the fundamental relationships governing nutrient loadings to and within lakes. Tropical lakes appear to have had increasing epilimnetic phosphorus loading as lake-levels increased. In contrast, large, deep lakes in the temperate zone are usually oligotrophic, with high Si:P ratios. Our major conclusion is that regeneration rates are greater than removal rates for phosphorus in tropical lakes as compared to temperate lakes, especially where epilimnetic mixing exceeds 50 m. Biological control of the elemental cycles dominate in tropical lakes, whereas nutrient cycles in temperate lakes are dominated by physical processes for a large part of the year. This results in major differences in the fundamental mechanisms of nutrient regeneration and their relationships to morphometric features of lakes in the two regions.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				APR	1990	23	2					379	389		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1990.tb00280.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1990.tb00280.x													WOS:A1990DA17800020

DNA barcodes for Great Salt Lake brine flies establish a baseline for monitoring changes in biodiversity	INLAND WATERS												Great Salt Lake (GSL) is the center of a valuable wetland ecosystem in the Great Basin of North America. The lake is an important site for millions of migratory birds that feed on 2 principal invertebrates, brine shrimp and brine flies (Diptera: Ephydridae). Despite their ecological and economic importance, no genetic studies have been published for either resident GSL invertebrate. The family Ephydridae (shore flies and brine flies) is one of the largest in the order Diptera, with nearly 2000 described species. Members of this family are prominent in a variety of aquatic environments and are particularly interesting because of their adaptation to several marginal habitats, including hot springs, oil ponds, highly saline lakes, and inland alkaline pools and marshes. This report provides cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) DNA barcodes for 5 species of GSL shore flies, distributed among 5 genera and 3 subfamilies. The phylogenetic content of these DNA sequences is explored by comparing a molecular phylogeny to those based on morphological features. Over the past decade, urbanization and inflow diversion have reduced the surface area of GSL by nearly 50%, with unknown consequences for the ecosystem. This study establishes a genetic framework to assess changes in GSL invertebrate diversity important in monitoring the effects of anthropogenic and climate pressures on this important natural resource.						, Sabrina Haney/0009-0009-4991-6363													2044-2041	2044-205X				JAN 2	2023	13	1					101	110		10.1080/20442041.2022.2144084	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2022.2144084		JAN 2023											WOS:000924876200001

Thus the Autonomic Computing can be used for automating irrigation processes, enabling the use of self-manageable systems where the behavior occurs in parallel with the environment, that is, their analysis and actions are adaptable and flexible according to the needs and characteristics of the environment. In this paper we propose a model for autonomic irrigation control that aims to provide a service to producers, seeking for a better performance in the food irrigation process. The proposed model uses the characteristics of autonomic computing, being able to identify and analyze the environmental parameters such as ambient temperature, humidity and soil moisture, determining the right time to irrigation and the volume of water that the plant and soil will need. This can allow a reduction in water consumption and a better utilization of the plant. A new parameter is expected to be reached through the water use system in agricultural production, minimizing any waste of water resources such as springs, rivers, lakes, reservoirs and dams; besides, providing the optimization for plant development and the maintenance of soil. The aim of the prototype is to provide a resource to the small, medium and large producers, given the specificities of each. It can be accessible and of easy installation field, as well as being autonomous, controlling all the steps necessary to irrigate the crop.																			1738-7906					APR 30	2015	15	4					31	39																WOS:000360802500005

Stratiform kerogens, originated from cyanobacteria, have deltaC-13 values from -15 to -25 parts per thousand. One exception with deltaC-13 = -31.8 parts per thousand may have originated from methanogenic source biota; thus two genetically distinct populations of kerogen are tentatively recognized in Elliot Lake metasediments. Globular bitumens, remobilized by hydrous pyrolysis from kerogen, exhibit deltaC-13 values ranging from -25 to -33 parts per thousand. The overall isotopic bimodality among Elliot Lake organic material is explained by analogy to petroleum generation from particulate kerogen that matured under conditions of catagenesis to metagenesis and was subjected to radiation over a long time. Barium, U, Th, Au, Pt, Pd and REE contents of Elliot Lake stratiform kerogen greatly exceed those of average black shales. Except for As, Pt, Pd and Au, all metals (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, Se, Rb, Sr, Ag, Sb, Cs, Ba, Hf, Ta, W, Hg, Th and U) are more concentrated in stratiform kerogens than in the derivative bitumen. This signals a significant role for a low-temperature transfer of noble metals to migrating bitumen.																			0301-9268	1872-7433				MAR	1993	61	3-4					279	293		10.1016/0301-9268(93)90117-K	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0301-9268(93)90117-K													WOS:A1993KT86300008
J	Attermeyer, K; Premke, K; Hornick, T; Hilt, S; Grossart, HP				Attermeyer, Katrin; Premke, Katrin; Hornick, Thomas; Hilt, Sabine; Grossart, Hans-Peter			Ecosystem-level studies of terrestrial carbon reveal contrasting bacterial metabolism in different aquatic habitats	ECOLOGY												In aquatic systems, terrestrial dissolved organic matter (t-DOM) is known to stimulate bacterial activities in the water column, but simultaneous effects of autumnal leaf input on water column and sediment microbial dynamics in littoral zones of lakes remain largely unknown. The study's objective was to determine the effects of leaf litter on bacterial metabolism in the littoral water and sediment, and subsequently, the consequences for carbon cycling and food web dynamics. Therefore, in late fall, we simultaneously measured water and sediment bacterial metabolism in the littoral zone of a temperate shallow lake after adding terrestrial particulate organic matter (t-POM), namely, maize leaves. To better evaluate bacterial production (BP) and community respiration (CR) in sediments, we incubated sediment cores with maize leaves of different quality (nonleached and leached) under controlled laboratory conditions. Additionally, to quantify the incorporated leaf carbon into microbial biomass, we determined carbon isotopic ratios of fatty acids from sediment and leaf-associated microbes from a laboratory experiment using C-13-enriched beech leaves. The concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) increased significantly in the lake after the addition of maize leaves, accompanied by a significant increase in water BP. In contrast, sediment BP declined after an initial peak, showing no positive response to t-POM addition. Sediment BP and CR were also not stimulated by t-POM in the laboratory experiment, either in short-term or in long-term incubations, except for a short increase in CR after 18 hours. However, this increase might have reflected the metabolism of leaf-associated microorganisms. We conclude that the leached t-DOM is actively incorporated into microbial biomass in the water column but that the settling leached t-POM (t-POML) does not enter the food web via sediment bacteria. Consequently, t-POML is either buried in the sediment or introduced into the aquatic food web via microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) directly associated with t-POML and via benthic macroinvertebrates by shredding of t-POML. The latter pathway represents a benthic shortcut which efficiently transfers t-POML to higher trophic levels.					; Hilt, Sabine/IUQ-1586-2023; Grossart, Hans-Peter/E-6705-2017	Hornick, Thomas/0000-0003-0280-9260; Premke, Katrin/0000-0001-6216-5386; Attermeyer, Katrin/0000-0002-6503-9497; 													0012-9658	1939-9170				DEC	2013	94	12					2754	2766		10.1890/13-0420.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/13-0420.1								24597222					WOS:000328928300010
J	COTTINGHAM, KL; CARPENTER, SR				COTTINGHAM, KL; CARPENTER, SR			PREDICTIVE INDEXES OF ECOSYSTEM RESILIENCE IN MODELS OF NORTH TEMPERATE LAKES	ECOLOGY												Predictive indicators of the rate of ecosystem recovery after a perturbation (resilience) could be valuable tools for ecological studies that need to anticipate system response to perturbation. We used a simulation model of summer phosphorus cycling in north temperate lakes to (1) evaluate whether resilience decreases with increasing food web length and increases with increasing nutrient loading and (2) test the correspondence between two potential indicators of resilience (nutrient turnover rate, NTR, and the dominant eigenvalue, lambda(max)) and postperturbation measurements of recovery rate. We determined lambda(max) and NTR for reference simulations of planktivore- and piscivore-dominated food webs at three baseline phosphorus loading rates (0.1, 1.0, and 2.0 mu g.L(-1).d(-1)), then measured recovery rates from simulated pulses of available phosphorus. The planktivore-dominated (short) food web was more resilient at baseline phosphorus loading rates of 0.1 and 1.0 mu g.L(-1).d(-1). However, the piscivore-dominated (long) food web was more resilient at the highest baseline phosphorus loading rate (2.0 mu g.L(-1).d(-1)), apparently because the additional nutrients were incorporated into biota more rapidly. Recovery rates predicted from NTR (but not from lambda(max)) were consistent with measured recovery rates. NTR appears to be a useful predictor of lake ecosystem recovery from nutrient pulses, particularly because it can be estimated relatively easily. Field tests comparing preperturbation estimates of NTR and postperturbation recovery rates are necessary to further validate this approach.

Scott; Kaufman, Darrell S.; Berg, Edward; Schiff, Caleb; Daigle, Thomas			Holocene biogeography of Tsuga mertensiana and other conifers in the Kenai Mountains and Prince William Sound, south-central Alaska	HOLOCENE												Several important North American coastal conifers - having immigrated during the Holocene from the southeast - reach their northern and upper elevation limits in south-central Alaska. However, our understanding of the specific timing of migration has been incomplete. Here, we use two new pollen profiles from a coastal and a high-elevation site in the Eastern Kenai Peninsula-Prince William Sound region, along with other published pollen records, to investigate the Holocene biogeography and development history of the modern coastal Picea (spruce)-Tsuga (hemlock) forest. Tsuga mertensiana became established at Mica Lake (100m elevation, near Prince William Sound) by 6000 cal. BP and at Goat Lake (550m elevation in the Kenai Mountains) sometime after 3000years ago. Tsuga heterophylla was the last major conifer to arrive in the region. Although driven partially by climate change, major vegetation changes during much of the Holocene are difficult to interpret exclusively in terms of climate, with periods of slow migration alternating with more rapid movement. T. mertensiana expanded slowly northeastward in the early Holocene, compared with Picea sitchensis or T. heterophylla. Difficulty of invading an already established conifer forest may account for this. We suggest that during the early Holocene, non-climatic factors as well as proximity to refugia, influenced rates of migration. Climate may have been more important after similar to 2600 cal. BP. Continued expansion of T. mertensiana at Goat Lake at the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA)-Little Ice Age' (LIA') transition suggests warm and wet winters. But expansion of T. mertensiana at both sites was arrested during the colder climate of the LIA'. The decline was more extensive at Goat Lake, where climatic conditions may have been severe enough to reduce or eliminate the T. mertensiana population. T. mertensiana continued its expansion around Goat Lake after the LIA'.

Adult tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor) survival on the polychlorinated biphenyl-contaminated Housatonic River, Massachusetts, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) were captured and banded at six sites that differed in polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination levels in the Housatonic River watershed, western Massachusetts, USA, from 2000 through 2004 to test the prediction that apparent survival rates of females in more contaminated areas were lower than those from less contaminated areas. We also tested whether plumage coloration affected over-winter survival and whether concentrations of PCBs in eggs differed between birds that did and that did not return the following year. Apparent survival rates were calculated using mark-recapture methods and compared using Akaike's Information Criterion. Model-adjusted survival rates ranged from 0.365 to 0.467 for PCB-contaminated females and between 0.404 and 0.476 for reference females. Models with either survival or capture probability modeled as functions of treatment (degree of PCB contamination), year, and age received some support. The model-averaged parameter estimate reflecting a treatment effect for high-PCB birds was negative ((beta) over cap = -0.046, SE((beta) over cap) = 0.0939). Fifty-four percent of the total model weights involved models in which survival was a function of PCB treatment. Eggs were collected for contaminant analyses from a random sample of females that did and that did not return the following year. Concentrations of total PCBs were the same or higher in the eggs of females that returned compared to the eggs of those that did not return at both the highly and the moderately contaminated PCB sites. This may have resulted from higher-quality females with higher lipid reserves being more likely than lower-quality females to return the following year. Percentage lipid was positively correlated with total PCBs in eggs. Survival rates were similar among swallows with brown versus blue plumage.					; Custer, Christine/H-4871-2014; Nichols, James/AAF-7336-2020	Custer, Thomas/0000-0003-3170-6519; 													0730-7268					MAY	2007	26	5					1056	1065		10.1897/06-337R.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1897/06-337R.1								17521155					WOS:000245749500031
J	Cey, EE; Rudolph, DL; Parkin, GW; Aravena, R				Cey, EE; Rudolph, DL; Parkin, GW; Aravena, R			Quantifying groundwater discharge to a small perennial stream in southern Ontario, Canada	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												A study of the interaction between groundwater and surface water was undertaken within a small agricultural watershed in southern Ontario, Canada. Groundwater contributions to streamflow were measured along a section of stream during baseflow conditions and during rainfall events. Four techniques were used to estimate the contribution of groundwater to the stream along a 450 m reach (three during baseflow and one during stormflow conditions). Under baseflow conditions, streamflow measurements using the velocity-area technique indicated that the net groundwater flux to the stream during the summer months was similar to 10 mi s(-1) m(-1). Hydrometric measurements (i.e. hydraulic gradient and hydraulic conductivity) taken using mini-piezometers installed in the sediments beneath the stream resulted in net groundwater flux estimates that were four to five times lower. Seepage meters failed to provide any measurements of water flux into or out of the stream, Therefore, based on these results, the velocity-area technique gives the best estimate of groundwater discharge. Hydrograph separations were conducted using O-18/O-16 isotopic ratios and electrical conductivity on two large rainfall events with different antecedent moisture conditions in the catchment. Both events showed that pre-event water (generally considered groundwater) dominated streamflow and the drain flow with 64%-80% of the total discharge contributed by pre-event water. High water table conditions within the catchment resulted in greater stream discharge and a greater contribution of event water in the streamflow than that observed under low water table conditions for similar intensity storm events. The results also showed that differences in riparian zone width, vegetation and surface saturation conditions between the upper and lower catchment can influence the relative magnitude of streamflow response from the two catchment areas.

A Mass Balance Mercury Budget for a Mine-Dominated Lake: Clear Lake, California	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												The Sulphur Bank Mercury Mine (SBMM), active intermittently from 1873-1957 and now a USEPA Superfund site, was previously estimated to have contributed at least 100 metric tons (10(5) kg) of mercury (Hg) into the Clear Lake aquatic ecosystem. We have confirmed this minimum estimate. To better quantify the contribution of the mine in relation to other sources of Hg loading into Clear Lake and provide data that might help reduce that loading, we analyzed Inputs and Outputs of Hg to Clear Lake and Storage of Hg in lakebed sediments using a mass balance approach. We evaluated Inputs from (1) wet and dry atmospheric deposition from both global/regional and local sources, (2) watershed tributaries, (3) groundwater inflows, (4) lakebed springs and (5) the mine. Outputs were quantified from (1) efflux (volatilization) of Hg from the lake surface to the atmosphere, (2) municipal and agricultural water diversions, (3) losses from out-flowing drainage of Cache Creek that feeds into the California Central Valley and (4) biotic Hg removal by humans and wildlife. Storage estimates include (1) sediment burial from historic and prehistoric periods (over the past 150-3,000 years) from sediment cores to ca. 2.5m depth dated using dichloro diphenyl dichloroethane (DDD), (210)Pb and (14)C and (2) recent Hg deposition in surficial sediments. Surficial sediments collected in October 2003 (11 years after mine site remediation) indicate no reduction (but a possible increase) in sediment Hg concentrations over that time and suggest that remediation has not significantly reduced overall Hg loading to the lake. Currently, the mine is believed to contribute ca. 322-331 kg of Hg annually to Clear Lake, which represents ca. 86-99% of the total Hg loading to the lake. We estimate that natural sedimentation would cover the existing contaminated sediments within ca. 150-300 years.					; Eagles-Smith, Collin/T-8580-2019	Eagles-Smith, Collin/0000-0003-1329-5285; Keller, Kaylene/0000-0003-3009-9606													0049-6979					JAN	2009	196	1-4					51	73		10.1007/s11270-008-9757-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-008-9757-1													WOS:000262931300006

The hypothesis was examined whether carcinogens in water play a role in the development of cutaneous melanoma. In a case-control study, 128 melanoma patients and 168 patients with other types of malignancy completed a detailed questionnaire on aquatic leisure time activities. All relative risk estimates were adjusted for age, gender, educational level, pigmentation characteristics, and exposure to sun habits. Regular swimming during the summer months in swimming pools and in open waters such as rivers and seas before the age of 15 years, was associated with odds ratios of 2.20 (95% confidence interval (Cl), 1.05-4.62) and 2.41 (95% Cl, 1.04-5.58), respectively, compared with no swimming at all or swimming in relatively unpolluted waters, such as lakes and fens. Melanoma patients learned to swim at a younger age; compared with those who never learned to swim or who learned to swim after the age of 12 years, the odds ratio was 1.87 (95% Cl, 0.91-3.78) for those who learned to swim at ages 9-12 years, and 2.22 (95% Cl, 1.16-4.26) for those who learned to swim before 9 years of age. Compared with persons who had no swimming certificates, an odds ratio of 1.25 (95% Cl, 0.71-2.23) was found for persons with one or two certificates, and an odds ratio of 2.96 (95% Cl, 1.25-6.96) for persons with three or more certificates. The positive association between a history of swimming and melanoma risk suggests that carcinogenic agents in water, possibly chlorination by products, play a role in melanoma aetiology.

The extent and impact of water fluoride outside these regions therefore remain unclear. The current study evaluated fluoride levels in household water sources in Bondo-Rarieda Area in the Kenyan part of the Lake Victoria Basin (LVB) and highlighted the risk posed by water fluoride to the resident communities. The results, it was anticipated, will contribute to in-depth understanding of the fluoride problem in the region. Methods: A total of 128 water samples were collected from different water sources from the entire study area and analyzed for fluoride content using ion-selective electrodes. Results: Lake Victoria was the main water source in the area but dams and open pans (39.5%), boreholes and shallow wells (23.5%), and streams (18.5%) were the principal water sources outside walking distances from the lake. The overall mean fluoride content of the water exceeded recommended limits for drinking water. The mean water fluoride was highest in Uyoma (1.39 +/- 0.84 ppm), Nyang'oma (1.00 +/- 0.59 ppm) and Asembo (0.92 +/- 0.46 ppm) and lowest in Maranda Division (0.69 +/- 0.42 ppm). Ponds (1.41 +/- 0.82 ppm), springs (1.25 +/- 0.43 ppm), dams and open pans (0.96 +/- 0.79 ppm), and streams (0.95 +/- 0.41 ppm) had highest fluoride levels but lake and river water did not have elevated fluoride levels. Groundwater fluoride decreased with increasing distance from the lake indicating that water fluoride may have hydro-geologically been translocated into the region from geochemical sources outside the area. Conclusions: Lake Victoria was the main water source for the residents of Bondo-Rarieda Area. Majority of in-land residents however used water from dams, open pans, boreholes, shallow wells, ponds and streams, which was generally saline and fluoridated. It was estimated that 36% of children living in this area, who consume water from ground sources from the area could be at the risk of dental fluorosis.					; Agong, Stephen/LEM-1027-2024; Wambu, Enos/AFL-8774-2022	Wambu, Enos/0000-0002-9311-6744; 														1471-2458				MAY 17	2014	14								462	10.1186/1471-2458-14-462	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-14-462								24884434					WOS:000336864900001

Effects of Anthropogenic Influences on the Trophic State, Land Uses and Aquatic Vegetation in a Shallow Mediterranean Lake: Implications for Restoration	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Lake Pamvotis, NW Greece is a shallow Mediterranean eutrophic lake that has changed drastically over the past 50 years. Strong effects, resulted mainly from anthropogenic causes, in the hydrological regime are shown for this area using long term hydrological data and a GIS system for extracting land cover/use changes. A set of aerial imagery acquired in 1945 through 2002 were used to monitor and assess the spatial and temporal changes in land cover/use, focused mainly on the lake's surface area and its surrounding ecosystem (Natura 2000 area). The significance of the changes in land cover/use distribution within Pamvotis wetland is further discussed depicting the role of the anthropogenic influence on the fragile ecosystem that resulted in the shrinkage of lake's habitats extent. The purpose of this analysis was to examine the long-term changes on macrophyte community composition, species occurrence and relative abundance with water quality and water level changes over the past century, using historical data, aerial photos and GIS techniques. The results showed that for the last 25 years annual water level fluctuation ranged from 70 to 159 cm. Water level starts decreasing in mid June and increasing again gradually from November until March-April. Intra annual water level fluctuation seems to be affected by land use for agricultural purpose through intensive irrigation and the summer drought as well. A dramatic decline of the submerged vegetation is apparent mainly attributed to anthropogenic pressures. Regarding the land cover/use changes, the most notable and significant alterations are concerning the urban development around the lake, the disappearance of wet meadows and the extension of reed beds. Finally it seems that water budget data as well as the response of the key eutrophication parameters are affected from both hydrological alterations and point/non-point pollution sources.

J	Arnott, SE; Yan, ND				Arnott, SE; Yan, ND			The influence of drought and re-acidification on zooplankton emergence from resting stages	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												The recovery of biota in lakes damaged by cultural acidification may be influenced by a number of factors, including El Nino-related droughts. Long-term zooplankton records from Swan Lake, Sudbury, Canada, indicated that crustacean species richness temporarily increased from an annual mean of 10 species to 18 species in the year following a two-year drought and subsequent re-acidification of the lake. We hypothesized that this unexpected increase in richness was the result of an emergence of zooplankton from resting stages that were historically deposited in the lake sediments. The drought and re-acidification event resulted in several changes in the lake that may have triggered the emergence of zooplankton, including desiccation of littoral sediments (and the Zooplankton resting stages residing there), increased water clarity, increased profundal temperature, and increased oxygen concentration in the bottom waters. Using in situ emergence traps, we investigated the influence of desiccation, light, temperature, and oxygen concentration on the emergence of crustacean zooplankton from resting stages. Responses were species-specific; four taxa had higher emergence when sediments were dried over the winter, the emergence of six taxa was influenced by temperature, and the emergence of three taxa was influenced by light. This suggests that climatic events, such as droughts, that alter the physical and chemical properties of lakes may alter zooplankton communities by triggering the emergence of resting stages residing in the lake sediments. This is particularly significant if, as in Swan Lake, emerging zooplankton are faced with inhospitable water quality. Under this scenario, emergence may act to deplete the egg bank, reducing the number of potential colonists available to repopulate the lake when environmental conditions improve.

Conventional monitoring methods often fall short due to a lack of surface indicators of underlying geological structures. Thus, accurately identifying subsurface discontinuities-such as faults, cavities, and weakened zones is essential for effective environmental risk assessment and sustainable land-use planning. Previously, these challenges were approached using traditional surveying methods, which often lacked precision and were time-consuming. In this study, we introduce an innovative methodology utilizing MOVE software for comprehensive 3D geological modelling and UAV multispectral surveys to acquire detailed surface data. The process is complemented by rigorous field validation, involving the integration of geological, tectonic, and mining maps with borehole logs and seismic profiles. Our results confirm the presence of persistent subsurface discontinuities in historically mined areas, often aligned with tectonic structures, subsidence lakes, and vegetation stress zones. This enhanced mapping of geological discontinuities and the comprehensive stability analysis of embankments demonstrate the methodology's potential to improve geomonitoring accuracy. Furthermore, our framework supports the development of dynamic digital twin models for predictive modelling and environmental risk management. Overall, this integrated approach offers a robust and transferable methodology for addressing subsurface challenges in post-mining and similar environments, ultimately enabling more informed decision-making and long-term planning in areas affected by legacy mining activities.

Design Modification for Control of the "Hydraulique" Phenomenon Downstream of Low-Head Dam: Case Study-Salmon River Dam	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF CIVIL ENGINEERING												Among the various solutions proposed for these structures are stepped dams, which despite effectively reducing the flow pattern, weaken the vortex and dramatically lower the risk of vortex formation by reducing the size of the deadly roller. At high tailwater depths, however, the dimensions and submerged roller current strength can still be dangerous. Using triangular wedges as a complementing structure topping the step to change the vortex flow pattern is one method that has been addressed in previous studies. The present study investigates the effectiveness of these wedges on the proposed stepped design in reducing drowning risk at the Salmon Dam, the most dangerous dam in a pest management system that controls the immigrant sea lamprey population in the Great Lake of Ontario, Canada. It is shown that installing wedges on the steps, despite falling short of eliminating vertical vortex flow entirely, by changing the pattern and flow direction from vertical vortex to horizontal vortex, poses a risk of drowning in a wide range of tailwater depth. This study found that optimal wedge placement reduces the dangerous vertical roller area from 27 to 83% of the tailwater depth area. Moreover, using wedges on continuous steps retains the positive effect of wedges but also expands the range. The distance between the wedges wields significant influence on the flow pattern, but reducing the distance between them does not necessarily reduce the viewing range of this vertical roller.

J	Slinski, KM; Hogue, TS; McCray, JE				Slinski, Kimberly M.; Hogue, Terri S.; McCray, John E.			Active-Passive Surface Water Classification: A New Method for high-Resolution monitoring of Surface Water Dynamics	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												This study develops a new, highly efficient method to produce accurate, high-resolution surface water maps. The "active-passive surface water classification" method leverages cloud-based computing resources and machine learning techniques to merge Sentinel 1 synthetic aperture radar and Landsat observations and generate monthly 10-m-resolution water body maps. The skill of the active-passive surface water classification method is demonstrated by mapping surface water change over the Awash River basin in Ethiopia during the 2015 East African regional drought and 2016 localized flood events. Errors of omission (water incorrectly classified as nonwater) and commission (nonwater incorrectly classified as water) in the case study area are 7.16% and 1.91%, respectively. The case study demonstrates the method's ability to generate accurate, high-resolution water body maps depicting surface water dynamics in data-sparse regions. The developed technique will facilitate better monitoring and understanding of the impact of environmental change and climate extremes on global freshwater ecosystems. Plain Language Summary Freshwater is one of the world's most important natural resources. However, data scarcity in many parts of the world is a substantial barrier to understanding and predicting the impact of environmental changes on freshwater ecosystems. Satellites provide data on water resources in data-poor regions. The "active-passive surface water classification" method merges observations from two types of sensors, passive sensors from National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Landsat satellites and radar sensors from Sentinel 1 satellites, to generate accurate, high-resolution water body maps. The technique is demonstrated by mapping surface water over the Awash River basin, Ethiopia, during the 2015 East African drought and 2016 flood events. Our results show the severe impact of the drought on basin water bodies, basin recovery to predrought conditions after the 2016 summer rains, and localized flooding from these rains. Our study is one of the first to generate water body maps by merging Landsat and Sentinel 1 data and use them to analyze spatial and temporal water body changes for monthly periods at a 10-m resolution. High-resolution maps of temporal surface water change will help water managers better target humanitarian response efforts, inform water policy decisions, and improve understanding of the impact of environmental change and climate extremes on freshwater ecosystems.					; McCray, John/OLP-8732-2025	McCray, John/0000-0001-7481-9965; Hogue, Terri/0000-0003-1524-8896; 													0094-8276	1944-8007				MAY 16	2019	46	9					4694	4704		10.1029/2019GL082562	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019GL082562													WOS:000468869500017

Phytoplankton dynamics in the Congo River	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. We report a dataset of phytoplankton in the Congo River, acquired along a 1700-km stretch in the mainstem during high water (HW, December 2013) and falling water (FW, June 2014). Samples for phytoplankton analysis were collected in the main river, in tributaries and one lake, and various relevant environmental variables were measured. Phytoplankton biomass and composition were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of chlorophyll a (Chl a) and marker pigments and by microscopy. Primary production measurements were made using the C-13 incubation technique. In addition, data are also reported from a 19-month regular sampling (bi-monthly) at a fixed station in the mainstem of the upper Congo (at the city of Kisangani). 2. Chl a concentrations differed between the two periods studied: in the mainstem, they varied between 0.07 and 1.77 mu g L-1 in HW conditions and between 1.13 and 7.68 mu g L-1 in FW conditions. The relative contribution to phytoplankton biomass from tributaries (mostly black waters) and from a few permanent lakes was low, and the main confluences resulted in phytoplankton dilution. Based on marker pigment concentration, green algae (both chlorophytes and streptophytes) dominated in the mainstem in HW, whereas diatoms dominated in FW; cryptophytes and cyanobacteria were more abundant but still relatively low in the FW period, both in the tributaries and in the main channel. 3. Daily integrated production measured in the mainstem (n = 15) varied between 64.3 and 434.1 mg C m(-2) day(-1) in FW conditions and between 51.5 and 247.6 mg C m(-2) day(-1) in HW. Phytoplankton biomass in the Congo River mainstem was likely constrained by hydrological factors (accumulation due to increased retention time during FW, dilution by increased discharge during HW), even though increased nutrient availability in the FW period might have also stimulated phytoplankton production. 4. In contrast to other tropical river systems where connectivity with the floodplain and the presence of natural lakes and man-made reservoirs play a prominent role in the recruitment of phytoplankton to the main river, our results show that phytoplankton growth in the Congo River can take place in the main channel, with hydrological processes allowing maintenance of phytoplankton biomass even during HW.

The lake faces multiple pressures from the unplanned urbanization, high population growth, nutrient load from intensive agriculture and tourism. The data showed that the lake has shrunk from 31 km(2) in 1859-24 km(2) in 2013. Significant changes were observed in the land use and land cover (LULC) within the lake (1859-2013) and in the vicinity of the lake (1962-2013). Analysis of the"demographic data indicates that the human population within the lake has shown more than double the national growth rate. Additionally, 7 important water quality parameters from 82 well distributed sites across the lake were analyzed and compared with the past data to determine the historical changes in the water quality from 1971 to 2014. The changes in the LULC and demography have adversely affected the pollution status of this pristine lake. Ortho-phosphate phosphorous concentration has increased from 16.75 mu g L-1 in 1977-45.78. g L-1 in 2014 and that of the nitrate-nitrogen from 36511g L-1 to 557 pg L-1, indicating nutrient enrichment of the lake over the years. Built-up area within the lake has increased 40 times since 1859, which, together with the changes in the population and settlements, have led to the high discharge of untreated nutrient-rich sewage into the lake. Similarly the expansion of floating gardens within the lake and agriculture lands in the catchment has contributed to the increased nutrient load into the lake due to the increasing use of fertilizers. The information about the existing land cover, demography and water quality was integrated and analyzed in GIS environment to identify the trophic status of the lake. The analysis indicated that 32% of the lake falls under sever degradation, 48% under medium degradation while as 20% of the lake waters are relatively clean. It is believed that the results provide improved knowledge and insights about the lake health and causal factors of its degradation necessary for effectively restoring its ecological and hydrological functionality.

Macrozooplankton and the persistence of the deep chlorophyll maximum in a stratified lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Deep chlorophyll maxima (DCM) are common in deep, oligotrophic stratified lakes. The DCM refer to the maximal chlorophyll a concentration found at depth, and not at the lake surface. While control of the DCM is thought to be via physicochemical factors in many lakes, a role for zooplankton grazing in epilimnetic waters remains a possibility. The occurrence and dynamics of DCM are poorly documented in smaller lakes, where zooplankton grazing is likely to have a stronger structuring effect. In small, shallow stratified lakes, biological control by grazing may be magnified by the short vertical gradient and overall higher water temperature. The respective contributions of several physical, chemical and biological parameters to the vertical distribution of phytoplankton biomass in a small stratified lake were examined. Associations between phytoplankton depth distribution and vertical gradients in temperature, light and nutrients and the density of herbivorous zooplankton were established through regressions and generalised linear models. Colimitation of the DCM by light from above and nutrients from below was detected. A threshold was detected at 3% incident light (100mol photon m(-2) s(-1)), below which the DCM disappeared. Epilimnetic biomass was related to nutrient availability, with a threshold concentration at 4gPL(-1), below which the DCM dominated. Greater stability of the water mass and more zooplankton were associated with higher phytoplankton biomass in the DCM. Stability is likely to have controlled vertical nutrient fluxes, which were intercepted by the metalimnetic phytoplankton. Zooplankton grazing of epilimnetic biomass could have increased incident light reaching the top of the metalimnion, thereby favouring proliferation of photosynthetic biomass in the DCM. Wind mixing events, as detected by a reduction in Lake number (L-N, a measure of the influence of wind forcing on vertical structure), induced vertical intrusions of metalimnetic water, rich in nutrients and phytoplankton, into the epilimnion. We can infer that dominance of phytoplankton in the epilimnion would have occurred earlier during the summer if grazing by zooplankton had not removed epilimnetic phytoplankton. Our results suggest that, while stable stratification is necessary for initial DCM formation, zooplankton grazing may promote the persistence of a DCM.					; Beisner, Beatrix/ABG-7855-2020	Pannard, Alexandrine/0000-0003-2997-5744; Beisner, Beatrix/0000-0001-6972-6887; Planas, Dolors/0000-0003-0901-2887													0046-5070	1365-2427				AUG	2015	60	8					1717	1733		10.1111/fwb.12604	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12604													WOS:000358017100021
J	Offenberg, JH; Baker, JE				Offenberg, JH; Baker, JE			Aerosol size distributions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in urban and over water atmospheres	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Aerosol mass size distributions of 41 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)were measured during 20 different 12-h periods in urban Chicago and over Lake Michigan during July 1994 and January 1995. Geometric mean aerodynamic equivalent diameters (GMDs) range from 0.72 to 2.39 mu m for particulate matter and from 0.33 to 9.85 pm for individual PAHs. GMDs of the less volatile PAHs are larger in the urban atmosphere than over the water during the summer. Geometric standard deviations of the particle size distributions, however, are larger at the urban location for many PAHs, indicating a broader mass size distributions. GMDs of unsubstituted PAHs (except perylone) are well correlated with their log subcooled liquid vapor pressures (p(l)(o) Pa), following the form: GMD = m(g) log p + b(g). Values for m(g) and b(g) range from 0.03 to 0.88 and from 0.83 to 8.80, respectively. Higher molecular weight PAHs are sorbed to the finest sized aerosols, but more volatile PAHs are associated with larger particles. The slope (m(g)) and intercept (b(g)) of these regressions are interdependent in these field data and follow the model: b(g) = m(h)m(g) + b(h), where m(h) = 9.55, b(h) = 0.61, and r(2) = 0.98, suggesting that all GMD vs log p regressions for a class of semivolatile compounds tend to intersect at the same point (-m(h), b(h)). This may allow the size distributions of the entire class of PAHs to be estimated by measuring the distribution of one PAH that is sufficiently removed from this intersection point. PAH size distributions change downwind of urban emission sources due to selective deposition of larger aerosols during atmospheric transport.

Late glacial lake and marine strandlines in the Ontario, St. Lawrence, and Champlain Lowlands, USA and Canada record steadily decreasing water levels interrupted by breakout floods	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												We report new interpretation of >19,500 beach strandlines from waterbodies in the western St. Lawrence and Champlain Lowlands in northern New York and adjacent areas of Vermont, Quebec, and Ontario from <= 2-m-resolution digital elevation models. Strandline evidence supports a deglaciation model in which proglacial lake and marine shoreline deposits adjusted continuously in response to steady shoreline regression linked to outlet incision, differential isostatic adjustments, and postglacial relative sea-level rise. Gaps in strandline preservation reflect times of rapid water-level decline associated with breakout floods and abrupt shifts in drainage to new outlets. Water levels returned to slower, steady decline and renewed beach sedimentation during the later stages of a breakout as water levels in the source and receiving waterbodies equilibrated. Our conclusions contrast with previous models that infer discrete lake stages were controlled by stable outlets then fell abruptly as lower outlets were exhumed from beneath the Laurentide Ice Sheet during deglaciation. We present a new deglacial chronology and lake nomenclature that reflects this paradigm and redefines the spatial and temporal distributions of proglacial lake and marine water in the region.																			0033-5894	1096-0287				2025 AUG 20	2025										10.1017/qua.2025.15	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/qua.2025.15		AUG 2025											WOS:001553838600001

Soil microbes weaken the positive effect of an aquatic-terrestrial subsidy on plant performance	JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY												Aims Linkages formed through aquatic-terrestrial subsidies can play an important role in structuring communities and mediating ecosystem functions. Aquatic-terrestrial subsidies may be especially important in nutrient-poor ecosystems, such as the freshwater sand dunes surrounding Lake Michigan. Adult midges emerge from Lake Michigan in the spring, swarm to mate and die. Their carcasses form mounds at the base of plants, where they may increase plant productivity through their nutrient inputs. However, the effect of aquatic-terrestrial subsidies on plant productivity could depend on other biotic interactions. In particular, soil microbes might play a key role in facilitating the conversion of nutrients to plant-available forms or competing for the nutrients with plants. Methods In a greenhouse experiment, we tested how carcasses from lake emergent midges (Chironomidae) and soil microbes independently and interactively influenced the performance of a common dune grass, Calamovilfa longifolia. To determine whether midges influenced abiotic soil properties, we measured how midge additions influenced soil nutrients and soil moisture. Important Findings Midges greatly increased plant biomass, while soil microbes influenced the magnitude of this effect. In the absence of soil microbes plant biomass was seven times greater with midges than without midges. However, in the presence of soil microbes, plant biomass was only three times greater. The effect of midges might be driven by their nutrient inputs into the soil, as midges contained 100 times more N, 10 times more P and 150 times more K than dune soils did. Our results suggest that soil microbes may be competing with plants for these nutrients. In sum, we found that midges can be an important aquatic-terrestrial subsidy that produces strong, positive effects on plant productivity along the shorelines of Lake Michigan, but that the impact of aquatic-terrestrial subsidies must be considered within the context of the complex interactions that take place within ecological communities.

The sensitivity of East African rift lakes to climate fluctuations	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Sequences of paleo-shorelines and the deposits of rift lakes are used to reconstruct past climate changes in East Africa. These recorders of hydrological changes in the Rift Valley indicate extreme lake-level variations on the order of tens to hundreds of meters during the last 20,000 years. Lake-balance and climate modeling results, on the other hand, suggest relatively moderate changes in the precipitation-evaporation balance during that time interval. What could cause such a disparity? We investigated the physical characteristics and hydrology of lake basins to resolve this difference. Nine closed-basin lakes, Ziway-Shalla, Awassa, Turkana, Suguta, Baringo-Bogoria, Nakuru-Elmenteita, Naivasha, Magadi-Natron, Manyara, and open-basin Lake Victoria in the eastern branch of the East African Rift System (EARS) were used for this study. We created a classification scheme of lake response to climate based on empirical measures of topography (hypsometric integral) and climate (aridity index). With reference to early Holocene lake levels, we found that lakes in the crest of the Ethiopian and Kenyan domes were most sensitive to recording regional climatic shifts. Their hypsometric values fall between 0.23-0.29, in a graben-shaped basin, and their aridity index is above unity (humid). Of the ten lakes, three lakes in the EARS are sensitive lakes: Naivasha (HI = 0.23, AI = 1.20) in the Kenya Rift, Awassa (HI = 0.23, AI = 1.03) and Ziway-Shalla (HI = 0.23, AI = 1.33) in the Main Ethiopian Rift (Main Ethiopian Rift). Two lakes have the graben shape, but lower aridity indices, and thus Lakes Suguta (HI = 0.29, AI = 0.43) and Nakuru-Elmenteita (HI = 0.30, AI = 0.85) are most sensitive to local climate changes. Though relatively shallow and slightly alkaline today, they fluctuated by four to ten times the modern water depth during the last 20,000 years. Five of the study lakes are pan-shaped and experienced lower magnitudes of lake level change during the same time period. Understanding the sensitivity of these lakes is critical in establishing the timing or synchronicity of regional-scale events or trends and predicting future hydrological variations in the wake of global climate changes.

Fifty-three boys and 38 girls 8 to 15 yr of age participated in the study on at least 7 days; 37 children were in residence for 4 wk, 34 for the first 2 wk only; and 20 for the last 20 wk. There were 72 whites, 15 blacks, 3 Asians, and 1 Hispanic in the study group. Multiple regression analyses indicated that the O3 concentration in the previous hour, the cumulative daily O3 exposure during the hours between 9 A.M. and the function measurement, ambient temperature, and humidity were the most explanatory environmental variables for daily variations in function, with the 1- h O3 concentration having the strongest influence. Linear regression were performed for each child between O3 concentration and function, and all average slopes were significantly negative (p < 0.05) for FVC, FEV1, PEFR, and FEF25-75 for all children, and for boys and girls separately. Comparable results were obtained in data subsets (i.e., children studied during the first or second 2 wk only, and for data sets truncated at O3 < 80 and O3 < 60 ppb). The average regression slopes (.+-. SE) for FVC and FEV1, respectively, were -1.03 .+-. 0.24 and -1.42 .+-. 0.17 ml/ppb, whereas for PEFR and FEF25-75 they were -6.78 .+-. 0.73 and -2.48 .+-. 0.26 ml/s/ppb. These predict average decrements of 4.9, 7.7, 17, and 11%, respectively, for O3 at the current ambient standard of 120 ppb. The implications of these short-term effects are unknown. However, the results in these free-living children are comparable to those found in chamber studies with comparable exposures.

J	Poirier, MC; Fugard, K; Cvetkovska, M				Poirier, Mackenzie C.; Fugard, Kassandra; Cvetkovska, Marina			Light quality affects chlorophyll biosynthesis and photosynthetic performance in Antarctic Chlamydomonas	PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH												The perennially ice-covered Lake Bonney in Antarctica has been deemed a natural laboratory for studying life at the extreme. Photosynthetic algae dominate the lake food webs and are adapted to a multitude of extreme conditions including perpetual shading even at the height of the austral summer. Here we examine how the unique light environment in Lake Bonney influences the physiology of two Chlamydomonas species. Chlamydomonas priscui is found exclusively in the deep photic zone where it receives very low light levels biased in the blue part of the spectrum (400-500 nm). In contrast, Chlamydomonas sp. ICE-MDV is represented at various depths within the water column (including the bright surface waters), and it receives a broad range of light levels and spectral wavelengths. The psychrophilic character of both species makes them an ideal system to study the effects of light quality and quantity on chlorophyll biosynthesis and photosynthetic performance in extreme conditions. We show that the shade-adapted C. priscui exhibits a decreased ability to accumulate chlorophyll and severe photoinhibition when grown under red light compared to blue light. These effects are particularly pronounced under red light of higher intensity, suggesting a loss of capability to acclimate to varied light conditions. In contrast, ICE-MDV has retained the ability to synthesize chlorophyll and maintain photosynthetic efficiency under a broader range of light conditions. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms of photosynthesis under extreme conditions and have implications on algal survival in changing conditions of Antarctic ice-covered lakes.						, Kassandra/0009-0007-0965-9142													0166-8595	1573-5079				FEB	2025	163	1							9	10.1007/s11120-024-01127-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11120-024-01127-0								39832016					WOS:001400442500001

This study identified two pigments of chlorophyll (Chl), two pigments of photosynthetic carotenoids (PSC), and seven pigments of photoprotective carotenoids (PPC) in the samples. Our results show that (1) the amount of pigments in phytoplankton in Qinghai Lake can be sorted as Chl > PPC > PSC. Specifically, the phytoplankton mainly contains Chla and Zea which belong to Chl and PPC, and account for 64.72% and 21.84% in the total pigment, respectively. (2) The total pigment absorption of phytoplankton is largely determined by Chla and Zea, and therefore shows similar spectral characteristics (e.g., shape, peak position) among different samples with only slight variation(between 0.02 m(-1) and 0.06 m(-1) at 440nm) in the absorption. Moreover, the difference becomes insignificant when specific absorption (pigment absorption normalized by its concentration) is considered, i.e., spectral shape and peak position. This may suggest phytoplankton species change little across the lake. (3) Mean ratio of pigment absorption coefficient measured by the Quantitative Filter technique (QFT) to that by the High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) were also examined. The ratio is 60.27% and 51.44% at around 440nm and 675nm, respectively, which suggests the package effect in the blue is much more obvious than that in the red. This also indicates existence of significant package effect from accessory pigments (e.g., carotenoids).

Przewalski's gazelle is a critically endangered species that lives in the Qinghai Lake watershed of western China. To learn the impacts of traffic on activity patterns of Przewalski's gazelle, we investigated the relationship between traffic flow and diurnal behaviours of the gazelle on the eastern shore of Qinghai Lake, where a highway was built in 2002. During the summers of 2005 and 2006, we collected traffic data on the highway and observed the activity of the Przewalski's gazelle population in the area. The results of statistical analysis showed the following: (1) frequency of behaviours such as standing, locomotion, foraging and resting differed among the 15 1-h sampling periods (daytime); (2) numbers of total vehicles, heavy vehicles and light vehicles were significantly different among the daytime hours; (3) there was a positive correlation between the frequency of resting of the gazelles and the number of passing vehicles, and a negative correlation between the frequencies of foraging and alert responses and the number of passing vehicles; (4) by comparing our results with those of a previous study on the gazelles at this site, before the construction of the highway, we found that the diurnal rhythms of foraging, standing and resting have changed markedly (e. g. the three peaks of foraging at 1300, 1600 and 1800 hours in 1996 changed to two peaks of foraging at 0600 and 2000 hours). Our results suggest that the highway traffic may have caused a change in diurnal activity of Przewalski's gazelle, with the animals tending to keep away from the highway when the traffic flow is high. We suggest traffic-control measures to reduce disturbance to, and thus enhance conservation of, this highly threatened species.

J	BENSON, L				BENSON, L			CARBONATE DEPOSITION, PYRAMID LAKE SUBBASIN, NEVADA .1. SEQUENCE OF FORMATION AND ELEVATIONAL DISTRIBUTION OF CARBONATE DEPOSITS (TUFAS)	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												During the late Quaternary, the elevation of terrace cutting and carbonate deposition in the Pyramid Lake subbasin were controlled by constancy of lake level imposed by spill to adjoining subbasins. Sill elevations are 1177-1183 m (Mud Lake Slough Sill), 1207 m (Emerson Pass Sill), and 1265 m (Darwin Pass Sill). Carbonate deposition was favored by: (1) hydrologic closure, (2) proximity to a source of calcium, (3) elevated water temperature, and (4) a solid substrate. The thickness and aspect of tufa are a function of lake-level dynamics. Relatively thin sheets and pendant sheets were deposited during a rising or falling lake. The upper parts of thick reef-form tufas have a horizontal aspect and were deposited in a lake which was stabilized by spill to the Carson Desert subbasin. The lower parts of the reef-form tufas are thinner and their outer surface has a vertical aspect, indicating that the lower part formed in a receding lake. The thickest and most complete sequences of tufa are mounds that border the Pyramid Lake shore. The tops of the tallest mounds reach the elevation of the Darwin Pass Sill and many mounds have been eroded to the elevations of the Mud Lake Slough Sill or the Emerson Pass Sill. The sequence of tufa formation (from oldest to youngest) displayed in these mounds is: (1) a beachrock containing carbonate-cemented volcanic cobbles, (2) broken and eroded old spheroids that contain thinolitic tufa and an outer rind of dense laminated tufa, (3) large cylindrical (tubular) tufas capped by (4) coatings of old dense tufas, and (5) several generations of old branching tufa commonly associated with thin, platy tufas and coatings of thinolitic tufa, (6) young spheroids that contain poorly oriented young thinolitic tufa in the center and several generations of radially oriented young thinolitic tufas near the outer edge, (7) a transitional thinolite-to-branching tufa, (8) two or more layers of young branching tufa, (9) a 0.5-cm-thick layer of fine-grained dolomite, (10) a 2-cm-thick layer of young dense laminated tufa, (11) a 0.1-cm-thick layer of encrusting tufa that was covered by a beach deposit and (12) a 1.0-cm-thick layer of porous encrusting tufa that coated the beach deposit and the sides of tufa mounds. The elevational ranges of the principal varieties of tufa are not related to terrace or spill elevations. It seems likely that the distribution of tufa varieties is related to variation in the thermal structure or chemistry of Lake Lahontan. It is hypothesized that the thinolitic tufa (ikaite) formed in the near freezing hypolimnion and the branching tufa (calcite) formed in the seasonally warmer epiliminion of the lake.																			0031-0182					MAY	1994	109	1					55	87		10.1016/0031-0182(94)90118-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0031-0182(94)90118-X													WOS:A1994NX25600002
J	Sekeryapan, C				Sekeryapan, Ceran			Freshwater ostracods from an alpine wetland in south-central Anatolia, Turkey	LIMNOLOGICA												Alpine lakes and wetlands in Turkey remain largely untapped sources of information in terms of both neo- and paleolimnological studies. Such ecosystems experience harsh climate conditions during almost half the year. They are characterized mainly by oligotrophic, freshwater conditions in the absence of direct anthropogenic impacts. This study tracked the distribution of ostracods at a very shallow wetland that is hydrologically connected to the Lake Karagol (altitude: 2600 m asl) through its outlet, in the Bolkar Mountains, south central Anatolia, Turkey. Four podocopid ostracod species were recorded: Potamocypris fallax Fox, 1967, Stenocypria fischeri (Lilljeborg, 1883), Heterocypris incongruens (Ramdohr, 1808), and Neglecandona sp. Krstic, 2006 throughout a short core from the alpine wetland. Ostracods were especially abundant in the uppermost 4.5 cm of the short core, with Neglecandona sp. most abundant in the uppermost 1 cm. This study shows that populations of H. incongruens and Neglecandona sp. develop at around 15-17 degrees C mean temperature for the warmest month (August) in the alpine wetland, which is totally frozen during the winter. Potamocypris fallax and Stenocypria fischeri also tolerate these same conditions. Trace metals (Pb, Zn, Cd, Cu, and Ni) were measured, and displayed low concentrations, with only slight fluctuations in Pb and Cu concentrations. Atmospheric contamination does not yet appear to be an environmental threat at this remote site.																			0075-9511	1873-5851				MAR	2022	93								125963	10.1016/j.limno.2022.125963	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2022.125963													WOS:000783137500003

C at DO of 4 mg/L or more, but fell to zero at 1 mg/L. The percentage of normal fry produced decreased noticeably below 4 mg/l DO. The optimum temperature for highest percentage survival of normal fry decreased directly with the level of DO.

Identifying suitable habitats and associated environmental conditions for wild rice viability is a critical step toward guiding ongoing restoration efforts statewide. To this end, we used maximum entropy (Maxent), a presence-only species distribution model, to characterize habitat preferences of wild rice in Michigan and identify suitable habitats for restoration. Extant wild rice occurrences were mapped alongside 11 environmental variables using Maxent to determine probabilities of occurrence throughout the state. The Maxent model (AUC > 0.9) predicted the highest probabilities of wild rice occurrence in the western and southwestern regions of the state. Climatic variables, biotic interactions, and anthropogenic disturbances were all found to influence wild rice occurrence, with land cover, lower May precipitation, and minimum winter temperatures having the highest contributions to model predictions. The results of this study suggest that statewide restoration of wild rice in Michigan may be possible, although localized differences in environmental conditions should be accounted for when selecting restoration sites. With further refinement and the inclusion of more key environmental predictors of wild rice viability, habitat suitability models such as the one created in this study may be powerful and effective tools in guiding wild rice restoration efforts nationally.

In this paper, we examine the chlorophyll-a concentrations in a shallow lake using high-frequency data from an in situ buoy. Also, we used monthly data of phytoplankton to relation high and low-frequency data. This is the first study about chlorophyll-a in high-frequency from a buoy in situ in South America. Significant minimums of chlorophyll-a concentration were detected, associated with episodic weather events in La Salada shallow lake. We present the data obtained from October 2012 to April 2015, and as an example analyzed some occasions in which these events of a significant minimum of Chlorophyll-a were detected. Extreme minimum values prevailed during winter months. We can conclude, the predominance of western winds registered, which (given the small size of the predominant species) could generate a spatial displacement (patches) of phytoplankton. Also, the high transparency conditions could affect phytoplankton by photo-inhibition. Chlorophyll-a concentrations returned to previous conditions after two days. This study suggests that the duration of western wind events and photo-inhibition with high water transparency could explain the spatial changes of phytoplankton communities. These results emphasize the importance of the analysis of high-frequency measurements in conjunction with meteorological variables to understand phytoplankton dynamics and sampling planning.					; Alfonso, Maria/JNS-2767-2023	Piccolo, Maria Cintia/0000-0002-5184-9149; Alfonso, Maria Belen/0000-0003-0543-8098													0097-8078	1608-344X				JUL	2021	48	4					614	623		10.1134/S0097807821040060	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0097807821040060													WOS:000678071900015

William			Stratigraphic and sedimentologic investigation of collapse features in the Mount Baldy Dune in the Indiana Dunes National Park	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Mount Baldy dune is one of the largest active eolian dunes along the southern shore of Lake Michigan and a famous tourist attraction within the Indiana Dunes National Park. It is an anthropogenically disturbed landform where restoration efforts include native beach-grass plantings and restricted foot traffic. In July 2013, a 6-year-old boy was buried more than 3 m below the dune stoss surface after falling into a hole, or "collapse feature." While previous work indicated that holes formed through the decay of buried oak trees (Quercus spp.), neither the origin of this hole in relation to the dune's stratigraphy nor its significance as a potential geological hazard were understood. Groundpenetrating radar, sediment cores, and radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence dates were collected to define sedimentary packages and facies, and interpret the dune's depositional history. The data show that an alongshore migrating coastal dune field stabilized 3000 ya atop backbarrier lagoonal deposits. Modern Mount Baldy evolved as sands were mobilized and transported onshore over the relict dune field, triggered by ongoing downdrift coastal erosion related to the development of the Michigan City Harbor. The internal architecture of the dune reveals how the topography of the forested landscape, now buried beneath the modern dune form, contributes to variations in the thickness of the upper dune package, controlling the relation of buried and decayed trees to the surface of the stoss slope. The data on sand thicknesses, were used with maps and aerial photographs to create a geohazard map of the dune. (c) 2021 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Pink salmon populations in Lake Superior have declined since the early 1980s. In Lake Huron, populations began increasing in 1983 and have leveled off at relatively high numbers. Lake Michigan populations have increased. Male spawners were significantly longer than females in all lakes. Lake Michigan fish were significantly longer than Lake Huron and Lake Superior fish, but no significant difference was observed between the latter two groups. Male spawners averaged 482 mm (1,045 g) in Lake Michigan, 418 mm (574 g) in Lake Huron, and 410 mm (567 g) in Lake Superior. Females averaged 449 mm (840 g) in Lake Michigan, 389 mm (450 g) in Lake Huron, and 388 mm (466 g) in Lake Superior. No significant length differences were observed in outmigrating fry from tributaries of the three lakes. Fry from individual tributaries averaged 31.94 mm (0.138 g) in Lake Huron, 32.64 mm (0.132 g) in Lake Michigan, and 31.96 mm (0.117 g) in Lake Superior. Fry recruitment was variable among years and dependent upon spawner abundance and over-winter flow conditions. Survival estimates from egg deposition to fry outmigration were poor (0.15% to 0.45%), which demonstrates the importance of riverine environments to Great Lakes pink salmon abundance.

Here, branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs), total organic carbon (TOC), and total nitrogen (TN) proxies from a well-preserved Dahutang (DHT) peat core were used to reconstruct local paleotemperature and effective moisture. Our results indicated that changes in mean annual air temperature (MAAT) and effective moisture around the peat DHT were broadly synchronous since 200 CE, and had a colder and drier period during 200-750 CE, followed by a warmest and wettest stage during 750-1450 CE coincident with the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and a coldest and driest period during 1450-1900 CE corresponding to the Little Ice Age (LIA). The regional biomarkers results suggested that there was a decrease in MAAT of 1-3 degree celsius on the East Asian continent from the MWP to the LIA. A regional collection of hydrology-sensitive paleorecords showed that there was a tripole mode of precipitation variations in the East China (north of 25 degrees N) during the LIA. A cooler and more variable hydroclimate during the LIA in East China could be an important trigger for the collapse of Ming Dynasty by increasing the frequency of epidemics and wars. The unfavorable climate condition was probably triggered by low solar irradiance, and aggravated by sea surface temperature (SST) changes.

Swing.], `Lakeland' limequat hybrid [C. aurantifolia x Fortunella japonica (Thumb.) Swing.], Palestine sweet lime (C. limettioides Tan.), `Etrog' citron (C. medica L.), and seven lemon [C. limon (L.) Burm. F.] varieties as female progenitors and five allotetraploid somatic hybrids {`Hamlin' sweet orange [C. sinensis (L.) Osbeck] x `Femminello' lemon (C. limon]; `Key' lime x `Valencia' sweet orange (C. sinensis); `Valencia' sweet orange x rough lemon (C. jambhiri Lush); Milam lemon (purported C. jambhiri hybrid) x `Femminello' lemon (C. limon); and `Valencia' sweet orange x Femminello' lemon} and two autotetraploids [`Giant Key' lime (C. aurantifolia) and `Femminello' lemon] as pollen progenitors. A few tetraploid x diploid crosses were also performed. Thirty-five parental cross combinations were accomplished in 2000, 2001, and 2002. The breeding targets were seedlessness, cold-tolerance, and disease resistance. Triploid hybrids were recovered through embryo culture. Generation of triploid citrus hybrids was affected by several factors including sexual compatibility, cross direction, embryo developmental stage, pollen viability, as well as horticultural practices and climatic conditions. Efficiency of triploid hybrid production was higher in diploid x tetraploid crosses than the reciprocal. Many more triploid hybrids were generated from lemon seed progenitors compared to the other acid citrus fruit progenitors. `Todo el A (n) over tildeo', `Lisbon', and `Limonero Fino 49' showed the highest sexual compatibility. Embryo germination rate and normal plant recovery were also higher in lemons as compared to the other seed progenitors. Low winter temperatures might have affected the hybrid production efficiency from tropical acid fruit progenitors. A total of 650 hybrids (mostly triploid) were transferred to soil. The novel genetic combinations of these progenies should be valuable for the genetic improvement of acid citrus fruit (lemons and limes).																			0003-1062	2327-9788				MAY	2005	130	3					392	402		10.21273/JASHS.130.3.392	http://dx.doi.org/10.21273/JASHS.130.3.392													WOS:000228848800015
J	DESLOGES, JR; GILBERT, R				DESLOGES, JR; GILBERT, R			THE SEDIMENTARY RECORD OF MOOSE LAKE - IMPLICATIONS FOR GLACIER ACTIVITY IN THE MOUNT-ROBSON AREA, BRITISH-COLUMBIA	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												The postglacial sedimentary environment of Moose Lake was investigated using 3.5 kHz subbottom profiles and cores from the sediment surface. A late phase in the deglaciation of the upper Fraser River valley involved a valley glacier that flowed east to west and that terminated near the present-day outlet of Moose Lake. The overdeepened Fraser valley was infilled with ice-contact sediments, including terminal and recessional moraines, thereby damming westward drainage and forming Moose Lake. Eastward glacier retreat resulted in the deposition of ice blocks in the shallow west zone of the lake, where subsequent melting disturbed conformable glaciolacustrine deposits. The main Moose Lake basin records a transition from proximal to distal proglacial environments. However, late glacial and postglacial sediments are dominated by settling from suspension. Coarse, but localized, sediment inputs are derived from the Thunder Creek fan-delta and avalanche activity on the north-facing slope of the south shore. Depths to major acoustic reflectors and known modern accumulation rates of 2.7 mm . a-1 indicate that the upper 15.5 m of sediment fill represents deposition during the Holocene and accounts for less than one third of the total late glacial and postglacial sediment yield. Sedimentary structures visible in cores and C-14 dating confirm the varved nature of the upper 3 m of sediment. Extreme positive departures in varve thickness are related to above-average discharge to Moose Lake following persistent, glacier-melt-augmented summer flows. The Moose Lake varve chronology confirms the general pattern inferred from other regional evidence of climate deterioration after 1600 AD, which led to glacier advance and moraine emplacement in the Canadian Rocky Mountains.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				JAN	1995	32	1					65	78		10.1139/e95-007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/e95-007													WOS:A1995QM34400007

This creates problems, e.g. in regard to the Water Framework Directive of the European Union, which demands evaluation of the quality and status of fish stocks in lakes. We compared fish sampling by means of Nordic multimesh gillnets, seining, trawling and hydroacoustics in two Finnish lakes in summer 2007 and 2008. Sampling methods were used 'as such', i.e. no special design was implemented for method comparison. In the shallow eutrophicated lake the species' composition of gillnet sampling and seining were very different. The biomass-% of percids dropped from gillnet (61%) to seining (9%) and that of cyprinids grew from 39 to 90%, respectively. In the deep pelagic area of the oligotrophic lake, vendace and smelt predominated in trawl catches. The number of fish caught by gillnetting in that area was too small to make any conclusions about the species composition. In the eutrophicated lake, the combined length distribution for all fish species differed significantly between gillnetting and seining. In the oligotrophic lake, the gillnet catches were too small for any comparison of fish size. The difference in the length distribution of fish between trawl and echosounding was significant in most analysed depth layers. In upper depth layers acoustics sampled larger fish than trawling, and in deeper layers smaller fish. Using a combined acoustic-trawl method, the pelagic fish biomass was estimated to be approx. 17 kg ha(-1) in the deep and oligotrophic lake. We conclude that in large and deep-water areas, the use of active gear is enough in fish sampling to evaluate the quality and status of fish stocks. Gillnetting together with seining is an appropriate method to work out the quality and status of fish stocks in shallow and littoral areas of large lakes. Variation in the catch selectivity of fish sampling gear requires a discrete ecological classification for each type of gear.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2011	660	1					29	36		10.1007/s10750-010-0385-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0385-6													WOS:000285064600004

The study presents the variations in the concentration of glucose pools and their combination to the actual rates of incorporation in the photic zone and in the entire water column of the lake. In the photic zone of the lake, pools of glucose varied strongly from 126 to 726 nmol/liter-1. The largest pools of glucose were observed during spring phytoplankton mass development and after its breakdown, and indicated that algal release of metabolites and decomposition of sestonic carbohydrates were the major processes of glucose flux. The dilution of [14C]glucose by unlabelled glucose present in the water, both in the photic zone and in the water column of the lake, caused a large discrepancy between estimates of actual and apparent rates of incorporation. Estimated glucose carbon contributed between 0.08 and 0.42% to the DOC pool. Actual incorporation rates, but not apparent rates, of glucose correlated well (r = 0.9457, P < 0.05) with bacterial DNA. The demonstration of such large variations in size of glucose pools, which dilute the radioisotope, means that any comparative study of bacterial heterotrophy in aquatic environments must take these pools into account. Otherwise, only the dilution of [14C]glucose rather than a difference in a activity of bacteria may be measured. The study has indicated, that the isotope dilution approach provides a useful information on the size of glucose pools present in the water.																			0001-6195						1989	38	1					75	89																WOS:A1989AP22100009
J	Grigg, NS				Grigg, Neil S.			Colorado River Basin: conflict management under hydrologic stress and institutional gridlock	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT												In the Colorado River, hydrologic and legal conditions create difficulty in sharing water effectively and equitably during a deep 22-year drought. Demand outstrips supply, water entitlements are over-appropriated, and institutional arrangements are nearly gridlocked. The crisis poses challenges not experienced before, and these may worsen with climate change and warming. It threatens the water supplies of major cities like Los Angeles and Las Vegas, as well as critical agricultural regions in the U.S. The background began to unfold more than 100 years ago, prior to signing of the Colorado River Compact in 1922. The decade prior to 1922 was relatively wet, and the Compact made water allocations that are not sustainable. Institutional challenges are caused by the rigidity of the rules governing river operations and the complex array of stakeholder organizations and management authorities. Although a wet 2022-3 winter provided temporary and only incremental relief, without a hydrologic reversal and/or effective regulatory controls, water levels in Lakes Powell and Mead will decline further and no storage water will be available to satisfy downstream interests. To avoid that scenario, it is likely that drastic curtailments will occur but forecasting them involves uncertainties and speculation. Achieving effective river basin management during the drought will likely require involuntary cuts, voluntary cuts, and possibly litigation, which will be expensive and long-lasting. Federal funding may help on a temporary basis. Involuntary cuts will require a forceful mechanism to push ahead with solutions despite lack of consensus. Lessons include the challenges in creating equity and sustainable conditions in the dry regions with water right systems based on prior appropriation and how to manage transboundary water conflicts within a federal system of government.																			1571-5124	1814-2060				JAN 2	2025	23	1					45	53		10.1080/15715124.2023.2229802	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15715124.2023.2229802		JUL 2023											WOS:001021427700001

Testing the reliable proxies to understand the mid-Holocene climate variability records from Chandratal lake, Western Himalayas	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Chandratal lake (32 degrees 28'30.65 '' N 77 degrees 37'1.42 '' E) located at the junction of Indian Summer Monsoon and Westerlies in the Northwestern Himalaya give an opportunity to reconstruct climate variability over the last similar to 6300 cal yr BP. Here, we used multi-proxy (Amino acids, Biogenic silica, grain size and total organic carbon) to link climate change and organic burial during the mid-Holocene period. The proxy records captured the changes in monsoon patterns, linking with Holocene climate optimum (HCO) during the similar to 6344-5821 cal BP. The sediment profile begins with a wetter and moist climate mostly from the terrestrial environment inputs, corresponding to the warm Holocene Climate Optimum (HCO) period (similar to 6344 - 5821 cal yr BP). A stable condition of the geochemical proxies during similar to 5821-3780 cal yr BP reveals a shifting of a moisture source, catchment stability and cold/dry climate in correspondence with reduced precipitation. The period from similar to 3780 to 2129 cal yr BP, follows a gradual increase of organic matter deposition and supported with an elevated atomic C/N ratio of 13.1 (mean value). Further association of organic matter with the coarser grain particles, suggesting a wetter climate from increasing runoff which is in correlation with the reinforcement of the precipitation during this time interval. From similar to 2129 to 696 cal yr BP, reduced precipitation/dry condition was observed with a shift in the autochthonous production of organic matter (C/N ratio of 8.91). Increase in BSi content suggests an ameliorated climate at this interval; however, the lower organic matter content (mean, 1.79%) and shift in the correlation of organic matter from coarse grains to finer grain size, suggesting little contributions from the terrestrial activities favouring the dry environment and abundant diatoms growth. The paleoenvironmental variations illustrate in the study is comparable to other findings recorded in the Himalayan region.

J	Pitman, AJ; Hesse, PP				Pitman, A. J.; Hesse, P. P.			The significance of large-scale land cover change on the Australian palaeomonsoon	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												We use the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System at a 50 km spatial resolution to explore the impact of large-scale vegetation changes on the Australian monsoon. We simulate multiple Januaries using vegetation cover representative of the present day, the last interglacial (LIG) (125,000 BP) and the last glacial maximum (20,000 BP), interpreted from palaeoecological data, to determine whether changes in vegetation can affect the Australian monsoon. We find that the large-scale replacement of current vegetation, to vegetation representing the LIG and the last glacial maximum has a substantial impact on the simulated latent heat flux and surface air temperature. Precipitation is affected, but only by approximately 5%. We show that the impact of vegetation change on precipitation is due to changes in the surface roughness length that affects the surface frictional drag, wind velocities and moisture convergence. The impact of large-scale vegetation changes on all quantities is restricted to the regions of land cover change. The perturbation induced by vegetation change interacts with the monsoon system by changing the local intensity of the atmospheric circulation causing relatively small intensification/moderation of the wind velocities. There is little evidence that the vegetation change induces a change in the large-scale structure of the meteorological system and there is no evidence that the vegetation changes induce a southward extension of the monsoon. We therefore find no evidence to support a hypothesis that vegetation feedbacks explain observed changes in lake levels in the Australian arid interior. We highlight some strengths and weaknesses of our approach and emphasise that the limitations implicit in our analytical methods means we cannot conclusively demonstrate that biospheric feedbacks can be ignored. Substantial additional work is therefore required to finally assess the role of biospheric feedbacks on the Australian palaeomonsoon. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Lyons, RP; Kroll, CN; Scholz, CA				Lyons, Robert P.; Kroll, Charles N.; Scholz, Christopher A.			An energy-balance hydrologic model for the Lake Malawi Rift Basin, East Africa	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												An energy-balanced hydrologic model is used to quantitatively assess atmosphere-water budget relationships across the Lake Malawi catchment, a hydrologically-open lake within the East African Rift System. The model first simulates the historical lake-level record over the last 100 years using climate station and vegetation data as inputs. Atmospheric conditions required to sustain equilibrium water balance are then estimated at known critical lake-levels: modern (700 m maximum water depth), basin closure (696 m maximum water depth), 500 m, 350 m, 200 m, and 150 m maximum water depth. The critical low lake stages were determined from analysis of seismic-reflection and deep lake drill-core data. The model predicts modern precipitation rate to be 955 mm/yr, which is consistent with observed climate station precipitation records. The minimum lowstand observed in geophysical records is 150 m water depth (550 m below present lake-level), and occurred about 95,000 years before present The precipitation rate required to sustain equilibrium conditions at this low lake stage is 557 mm/yr, assuming modern Lake Malawi temperature and vegetation, and 374 mm/yr using modern temperature and vegetation data from the Little Karoo Basin, an analogue for the Malawi paleo-environment during severe arid intervals that resulted in major lake lowstands. The latter result is consistent with the range of precipitation measured from the Little Karoo Basin (100 to 500 mm/yr), and from interpretations of drill-core data sets (Cohen et al., 2007). The time required to drop lake-level from its modern maximum to the most severe low lake stage determined from paleoclimate data sets (from 700 m to 150 m maximum water depth) is less than 2500 years, even when accounting for additional water volume loss stored as groundwater. A lake-level fall of this magnitude reduces the lake surface area by 94% and reduces the total lake volume by 99%. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The highest bacterial and algal densities and biomasses were recorded in the anoxic hypolimnion. The bacterial biomass in the hypolimnion was composed mainly of photosynthetic green sulphur bacteria (Chlorobium) which occurred at very low light intensity (< 1.5-mu-mol m-2 s-1). The numbers and biomasses of bacteria, both in the epilimnion and hypolimnion, were mostly higher at night than during the day, indicating possible asynchrony between the production and loss of bacteria. Because of vertical migration, the diurnal vertical distribution of algae was more variable than that of bacteria. Particularly in July and August, when cryptomonads were abundant, the biomass of algae was much higher in the epilimnion during the day than at night. The flagellated chlorophytes, Chlamydomonas spp. and Scourfieldia cordiformis, stayed mainly in the upper hypolimnion close to the oxic-anoxic boundary zone where only a small proportion of Daphnia longispina was continuously present. Unpalatable Mallomonas chrysophytes with silicified plates and bristles, and small, presumably heterotrophic, flagellates stayed in the oxic epilimnion together with a dense (up to 300 ind l-1) population of D. longispina. The results indicated that, besides the physical and chemical properties of the water column, grazing pressure by Daphnia longispina strongly affected the vertical distribution of microorganisms in this polyhumic lake.

Taiga biome dominated regional landscapes, although significant compositional turnover occurred due to the expansion of eurythermic and drought resistant Scots pine. Climate during the mid-Holocene was wetter than the present, and Lake Khali was fresh, with abundant molluscs. By 4.4 cal ka BP, sedimentary geochemistry indicated a gradual change in lake water chemistry with an increase in lake salinity up to the present day, most likely controlled by groundwater influences. Vegetation turnover rate was highest between 2.75 and 2.48 cal ka BP, with the onset of drier, more continental climate, which resulted in an influx of aeolian particles to the lake. This abrupt shift was coincident with ice rafted debris event (IRD-2) in North Atlantic sediments and an attenuation of the East Asian summer monsoon. A second arid period occurred shortly afterwards (2.12-1.87 cal ka BP) which resulted in the decline in ostracod numbers, especially Candona sp. A rather more quiescent, warmer period followed, between 1.9 and 0.7 cal ka BP, with very little change in vegetation composition, and low amounts of detrital transfer from catchment to the lake. Peak reconstructed temperatures (and low amounts of annual precipitation) were concurrent with the Medieval Climate Anomaly. Between 0.77 and 0.45 cal ka BP, climate in the Ol'khon region became colder and wetter, although Lake Khali did not become fresher. Cold, wet conditions are seen at other sites around Lake Baikal, and therefore represent a regional response to the period concurrent with the Little Ice Age and IRD-0. After AD 1845 the region warms, and Pediastrum appears in the lake in high abundances for the first time. This increase is ascribed to nutrient enrichment in the lake, linked to the rapid increase in regional pastoral farming. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

Biomass, production, growth and grazing of pico- and nanoplankton assemblages were estimated, and a carbon budget for the microbial loop during the experiment was constructed. The microbial food web was a highly dynamic system. Varying perturbations due to nutrient loading and the top predator provoked eutrophication in the enclosures, but they affected the microbial loop only slightly. The amplitudes of oscillation in abundance of coupled communities were amplified, but the frequencies of oscillations in the microbial loop were not affected by the perturbations. Changes in the route of carbon flow through the microbial food web occurred in relatively short time scales. These changes seemed to be dependent on the phasing of the coupled oscillations between the communities, and the structure within the different communities. Ciliates were only loosely connected to the microbial loop: although ciliates and heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) showed predator-prey-like coupled oscillations, the ciliates gained most of their carbon from other sources, and most of the HNF carbon loss was due to factors other than ciliates. HNF were the most important consumers of picoplankton during the HNF maximum, but they were also dependent on other sources of nutrition.

Obi Island has a large potential for water resources that can be used optimally by the local communities. This hydrological analysis purposed to calculate the water availability in Karo Lake. Water availability is the amount of water that is estimated to continue to exist in a location with a certain amount and within a certain period of time. Water availability is calculated by dependable discharge using the Mock method. The basis for the calculation of the Mock method is to calculate the rain that falls on the water catchment area, some will be lost as evapotranspiration, some will immediately become surface runoff and some will absorb into the ground (infiltration). The analysis used climate data, topography, and the area of the water catchment area in the watershed. In order to obtain an accurate dependable discharge calculation, it is necessary to have long-term rainfall monitoring data. The data used in the calculation of the Mock method is monthly rainfall data for the last 20 years from Rainfall Station data around the study location.

For such a proof, both a meteorite impact and its definite effects on an archaeological site would have to be evidenced. This review article reports on geoarchaeological investigations, involving mineralogy, petrography, and geophysics, which established evidence that two prehistoric human settlements have been affected by the Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age (ca. 900-600 BC) Chiemgau meteorite impact in southeastern Germany. One site, the Muhlbach area, was affected by the ejecta from the 600 m o-Tuttensee crater, one of the largest craters in a crater strewn field measuring about 60 x 30 km. At the other site, Stottham close to Lake Chiemsee, the catastrophic layer of the impact was found embedded in the archaeological stratigraphy of a settlement, which had been repeatedly occupated from the Neolithic to the Roman era. At both sites, artifacts have become components of impact rocks, establishing a hitherto unknown form of an impact rock, an artifact-in-impactite. The immediate coexistence of rocks, which exhibit impact-diagnostic shock metamorphism, with relicts of metallic artifacts, as encountered in finds from Stottham, are unprecedented evidence of human experience of a meteorite impact.																			1108-9628	2241-8121					2023	23	1					209	234		10.5281/zenodo.7775799	http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7775799													WOS:001023959800001

However, human behavioral responses to this climatic episode has only recently begun to be documented in different areas of the world. Southern China is one region where these human behavioral responses have yet to be clearly identified. Here, we present a recent discovery of stone artifacts from the Zhongshandong (ZSD) Cave Site, which is located in Bubing Basin, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, southern China. The cultural deposits within ZSD have been tentatively dated to the 8.2 ka BP cooling event. The ZSD Cave is a narrow, low ceiling cave about 60 m in length. Sixty-one stone artifacts were surface collected in the extremely dark terminal chamber in the back of the cave. One stone artifact was found in situ in the same area of the cave. The overlying stalagmite was U-series dated to 8130 +/- 430 years BP and charcoal found below the artifact was AMS dated to 8242 +/- 54 years BP. The stone artifact assemblage is comprised of cores, flakes, choppers, and scrapers produced on locally available river cobbles, an artifact col-lection normally assigned to the eastern Asian Early Paleolithic. Charcoal fragments are abundant in the cultural layer, implying that fire was possibly used for lighting and/or warmth. Interestingly, given the dimensions of the inner chamber and the fact that the cultural deposits sit about 60 m inside the cave, this would not be considered a typical area that would be suitable for long term human occupation. Although other possibilities may exist, one possible explanation may be that, due to the cold winter and/or harsh environment during the 8.2 ka BP climatic event, these hunter-gatherers were forced deeper inside the cave to set up their temporary campsite. This is a hypothesis that needs further testing.

Although similar trends might be expected in Canada, mussels (and in fact invertebrates in general) have received little attention to date. This imbalance was first addressed in 1991 when the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) expanded its mandate to include invertebrates. A Mollusc Working Group (MWG) was formed in 1995 to determine the status of Canadian mollusc species at risk. The first task of the MWG was to prepare a preliminary list of candidate species to be considered for national status designation by COSEWIC. In this paper, a risk fatter analysis approach was used to identify the most imperiled species of freshwater mussels in the Canadian waters of the lower Great Lakes drainage basin. This region was chosen because it historically supported the most diverse and unique mussel fauna in Canada. Species were evaluated on the basis of their current conservation status ranks, distribution patterns, vulnerability to Zebra Mussels, host specificity and evidence of decline over time in the study area. A database of over 4100 occurrence records for 40 species collected between 1860 and 1996 was compiled for this purpose. Results showed that nearly 40% of these species would likely fall into the Extirpated, Endangered or Threatened risk categories as defined by COSEWIC. A prioritized list of nine species was proposed for national status designation by COSEWIC.																			0008-3550					JUL-SEP	1998	112	3					425	440																WOS:000077739600006

The white sucker, Catostomus commersoni, has been proposed as a sentinel species to monitor environmental health in these systems. The prevalence of skin neoplasia is elevated in white suckers and other fish taken from chemically polluted sites or from lake regions adjacent to heavy industry. Lip papillomas regress and proliferate spontaneously in captive wild suckers. It is important to investigate the relevance of these observations to papilloma etiology to determine whether the prevalence of this disease is a suitable biomarker for environmental health. White suckers were captured in the spring of 1992 and 1993 during annual spawning runs (mid to late April) at the Ganaraska River, which discharges into Lake Ontario at Port Hope, Ontario. Under crowded laboratory conditions, there was either proliferation of existing papillomas or development of new papillomas. However, in uncrowded conditions, existing papillomas either regressed completely or there was no development of new papillomas. Protein Kinase C (PKC), a proposed marker enzyme for hyperplasia and neoplasia, was used to determine if regressing and proliferating papillomas could be differentiated on the basis of biochemical activity. PKC activity was lower in proliferating papillomas, but not significantly different from papillomas sampled initially from Ganaraska River suckers. Regressing papillomatous tissue displayed a significantly higher level of enzyme activity than either proliferating or unchanged papillomas, but the PKC activity of regressing papillomas was not significantly different from that of normal lip epidermis.																			0378-1909					JUL	1994	40	3					263	269		10.1007/BF00002515	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00002515													WOS:A1994PE95500008

Seismicity Migration Induced by the Acu Reservoir, Northeast Brazil, and Implications for Fault Hydraulic Variability	BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												Seismic activity beneath the Acu reservoir, northeast Brazil, is considered a classic, clear example of reservoir-induced seismicity (RIS) and has been investigated during the last two decades. After a quiescent period from April 1997 to June 2012, recent seismic activity was recorded by a seismic network deployed in the area during the seismic sequence, which lasted from July 2012 to April 2013. We located 50 seismic events from this recent sequence with M-w ranging from 0.1 to 1.4 and obtained well constrained relative locations and a composite focal mechanism for 35 of these events. The earthquakes occurred mainly beneath the lake at a depth of 3.5 km in a subvertical east-northeast-striking fault composed of two clusters similar to 250 m apart, defining a fault zone 150 m wide and similar to 1.5 km long, and were associated with the reactivation of the basement on a new fault cross cutting the main northeast-southwest-striking mylonitic structure. We estimate hydraulic transport properties within seismogenic faults. Depth-averaged and within-fault-plane permeabilities are 10(-15) and 10(-16) m(2), respectively, near the lower bounds of values found in the literature. We observe the seismicity at 3-4 km depth in the 2012-2013 sequence period; this was likely related to the long-term decrease in the water level. As the water level fell steadily because of drought in the region since 2011, the pore pressure due to diffusion (and the undrained response at a fraction of the water load) decreased, and the average load pressure decreased even more, leading to failure. Thus, the east-northeast-striking fault remained active until the pore pressure became less than the average load. This interplay between water level variation and pore pressure could explain the episodic behavior of the seismicity in a different active fault region in the 2012-2013 period.

Thus, deciphering the possible mechanism driving the variability of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) during the Holocene Epoch has been critical to understand the hydroclimatic changes of the low latitudes. Despite several efforts, the teleconnection of ISM with the global climate dynamics remains under-represented and poorly understood. The present study aims to delineate the ISM variability and its possible forcing mechanism from western India (Gujarat). In this study, a sediment core (similar to 65 cm long) was raised from the Jaffrabad mudflat (MIT) in western Gujarat. The sediment samples were subjected to geochemical analysis to investigate paleomonsoon, paleo-sediment source and paleoweathering changes. The results show that, with the addition of intermediate sources, the sediments were principally derived from the hinterland's Deccan basalts. Further, the study suggested a warm and wet climate due to strong ISM during 10,650-5500 cal yr BP associated with the solar as well as orbital forcings. The weak monsoon during 5500-2700 cal yr BP has been linked with southward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) along with the increased El Nino-like conditions. Further, the wavelet analysis revealed that a combined influence of solar, orbital and North Atlantic forcings led to monsoon variability along western India, during the Holocene Epoch. By reconciling the geochemical proxies, the present study has implications in the reconstruction of paleomonsoon and establishing the possible teleconnection with the global climate system.

J	Curry, M; Hanesiak, J; Sills, D				Curry, Michelle; Hanesiak, John; Sills, David			A Radar-Based Investigation of Lake Breezes in Southern Manitoba, Canada	ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN												Lake breezes are thermally direct circulations that form as a result of the differential heating of land and water and are important in modifying local climate and triggering convection; they have also been linked to tornadogenesis. Although lake breezes are generally well understood, studies of smaller lakes have been relatively scarce, and none have examined lake-breeze circulations in southern Manitoba even though they are seemingly apparent on weather radar. The objectives of this paper are to provide a radar-based analysis of lake-breeze frequency and characteristics in southern Manitoba, determine the detectability of lake-breeze fronts using the radar analysis with data collected in 2013, assess the types of lake-breeze circulations that occur, and examine the meteorological conditions in which they occur. Between 2008 and 2013, lake-breeze fronts were noted on 205 days using radar over the summer months, accounting for 37% of study days, with an average of 11-12 days with lake-breeze fronts each month. These findings agree fairly well with, and are only slightly less than, frequencies reported for Lake Michigan but are lower than the most recent findings for southern Ontario. In an effort to validate the results, a broad comparison between the radar analysis and a more complete analysis using satellite and surface stations is provided for 2013 demonstrating that radar is more useful for detecting lake breezes around Lake Manitoba than around Lake Winnipeg. Lake-breeze circulations originating on Lake Manitoba and the Shoal lakes were classified into three types. The distribution of types for the Shoal lakes was similar to previous findings by other authors with "moderate deformation" circulations being the most frequent. Finally, a brief meteorological analysis was completed for each month of this study. The results of the analysis were inconclusive with no single meteorological factor being consistently well correlated to higher or lower lake-breeze frequency.

J	Enache, MD; Cumming, BF				Enache, Mihaela D.; Cumming, Brian F.			Extreme fires under warmer and drier conditions inferred from sedimentary charcoal morphotypes from Opatcho Lake, central British Columbia, Canada	HOLOCENE												Predictions of the extent of forest fires under warmer and drier conditions in boreal regions require knowledge of long-term relationships between fire and climate. However, many long-term studies that utilize the remains of total charcoal in lacustrine sediments fail to demonstrate a relationship between climate change and fire activity. A new approach to reconstruct the relative-area burned based on specific types of charcoal particles (the charcoal-morphotype (CM) fire index) has shown significant correlations to recorded forest fires. Here we assess the utility of the CM derived from an analysis of charcoal morphotypes in sediment cores from Opatcho Lake (British Columbia, Canada) using two independent paleoclimate proxies over the last 400 years, and since the mid Holocene. Over the past 400 years, significant correlations between the CM fire index and independent climate reconstructions (diatom-inferred salinity, dendroclimatic reconstructions of temperature and precipitation, and reconstructions of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) range from 0.35 to 0.42. Similarly, since the mid Holocene the correlation between the CM fire index and independent proxies of past climate (diatom-inferred salinity and temperature inferences from chironomids from the southern interior of British Columbia) range from 0.70 to 0.76. These significant correlations strongly contrast with the very low and insignificant correlations between the CM fire index and total charcoal, suggesting that this approach provides paleofire information not available from traditional techniques. The CM fire index suggests that fires were at least two-and five-fold larger than those observed during the instrumental period, over the last 400 and 6000 years, respectively.																			0959-6836	1477-0911				SEP	2009	19	6					835	846		10.1177/0959683609337357	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683609337357													WOS:000269026100003

Study focus: The Great Salt Lake is a hypersaline, closed basin lake with an east-west rockfill railroad causeway dividing the lake into north and south arms. Recent record low lake levels, increased salinity and water elevation gradients between the two arms have threatened critical ecologic and economic productivity. In response, recent management efforts have focused on a newly constructed submerged berm within a causeway breach, completed December 2016, that has been altered to control bidirectional flow exchange between the higher salinity north arm and the south arm, which receives all freshwater inflows. In this study, a new 1D analytical model of breach exchange flows has been incorporated into a new open-source multi-layer mass balance model of the Great Salt Lake to predict lake levels and salinity. New hydrological insights for the region: The applied model considers newly combined and curated salinity data from various entities along with relevant hydrologic data and a sensitivity of groundwater contributions. Water level results validated the model formulation and necessary assumptions, with predictions generally within the range of data uncertainty. Further, salinity predictions in the south arm fell within the 90 % confidence intervals. Through model application, the efficacy of the new submerged berm as an adaptive management tool was confirmed, along with the need for additional lake monitoring.																				2214-5818				DEC	2025	62								102768	10.1016/j.ejrh.2025.102768	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2025.102768													WOS:001592769600003
J	HALL, RJ; LIKENS, GE				HALL, RJ; LIKENS, GE			CHEMICAL FLUX IN AN ACID-STRESSED STREAM	NATURE												The acidity of rain and snow falling on widely separated areas of the world has increased during the past 30 yr. Acid rainfall consists of a dilute solution of H2SO4 and HNO3 due to the oxidation and hydrolysis of airborne S and N and frequently has a pH < 4.0. Recent studies showed that acid rain altered the chemistry and biology of streams and lakes in large regions of the world. Results from reconnaissance studies in the field and physiological studies in the laboratory showed the diversity and numbers of aquatic organisms of all major trophic levels were affected by low pH (high acidity). The quantitative effects of such acidification on biogeochemistry and biological function in natural streams have received little attention. Much is known about aquatic ecosystems affected by acid mine drainage. Waters receiving acid mine drainage show effects caused by metal contamination and deposition of iron oxide particulates and acidification. A 3rd-order section of a small mountain stream in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, West Thornton, New Hampshire, USA was acidified. Effects of increased acidity on chemical and biological export in the stream was measured. Experimental stream acidification to pH 4 altered the chemical and biological flux. The most significant inorganic component affected by the experiment was Al. A significant net flux of C and N occurred in the biologically bound forms but not in dissolved substances. Net flux of P was significant in biologically bound forms. The increased loss of nutrients in the particulate organic fraction was also important, particularly if scaled to the total stream ecosystem.																			0028-0836	1476-4687					1981	292	5821					329	331		10.1038/292329a0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/292329a0													WOS:A1981LY39000038

An evaluation of three trap designs for invasive rusty crayfish (Faxonius rusticus) suppression on critical fish spawning habitat in northern Lake Michigan	MANAGEMENT OF BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												High densities of invasive rusty crayfish on critical spawning reefs present a potential impediment to the recovery of native fish in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Suppression of rusty crayfish on spawning reefs to protect fall spawning native fishes in the Great Lakes is hampered by regular storm events and ambient weather conditions, limiting the number of practical days traps can be checked, cleared, and re-baited. The Gee minnow trap design is the most common gear for sampling and managing crayfish, yet design constraints of the standard Gee minnow trap manifest as tradeoffs between capture efficiency and retention for users. In this study, we compared catch rates from a semi-controlled field experiment and escapement probabilities from laboratory controlled trials for a Gee minnow trap, a modified Gee minnow trap with intention to reduce escapement, and an experimental flat-bottomed pyramid design which showed potential promise during prototype-stage development. Bayesian parameter estimation of generalized linear models applied to catch data suggested that standard Gee minnow traps performed at least as well and often better than both novel trap designs in catch rate and escapement probability. Escapement during laboratory controlled trials was high for all trap designs, demonstrating that retention of trapped individuals is a persistent problem for crayfish monitoring and management. We conclude from our data that standard Gee minnow traps are a sensible gear choice for monitoring and/or potential suppression efforts for invasive rusty crayfish on nearshore spawning reefs in the Great Lakes. However, modifications to its design to improve retention should yet be pursued.

In this article, we focus on the impact of the LUc and later cultures on the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems at Bruszczewo on a microregional scale and within the broad context of analogous processes in central-eastern Europe. We did high resolution multi-proxy analyses of pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs (NPPs), diatoms and plant macrofossils, supplemented with a lithological and geochemical study of lake and peat deposits from near the archaeological site. The results revealed that between ca. 1020 and 920 bc, woodland clearance took place, possibly connected with farming. This probably contributed to the spread of the weeds Xanthium cf. strumarium and Convolvulus arvensis in the newly created disturbed habitats. Woodland clearance and other human activities contributed to better preservation of diatoms in the lake sediments, probably as a result of increased acidity in this environment. Diatoms, especially taxa preferring eutrophic waters and tolerant of large amounts of dissolved organic matter, were the most frequent at that time. Climate deterioration associated with the 2.8 ka event probably lessened human impact around the lake shore. The diatom records suggest prolonged ice cover on the lake and/or colder springs at that time. Another intensification of human impact occurred at ca. 530 bc and was probably related to activity by people of Pomeranian culture (kultura pomorska, Pommerellische Gesichtsurnenkultur). Later, from ca. 330 bc, arable farming activity declined and grazing was suggested by an abundance of coprophilous fungi spores which, however, should not be regarded as definitive indicators of pasture.

Previous studies have extensively revealed a simple linear relationship between heat vulnerability indices (HVIs) and morbidity or mortality of heat-related illnesses, but the nonlinear relationship and interactions between main HVIs have not yet been fully explored. Based on vulnerability assessment framework, this paper selected fifteen indicators from built environment, sociodemographic and socioeconomic attributes, resource accessibility and residential thermal comfort, obtained from multisource data. Through the evaluation and analysis of composite HVI and its dimensions, we found that Qingshan district and East Lake scenic area contain more high to very high heat vulnerability communities. The performances of the ordinary least squares (OLS) and gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) were compared, and results indicate GBDT outperforms the OLS model and captures the nonlinear relationship more efficiently in study areas with higher accuracy. When analyzing HVIs' contributions and interactions with the GBDT model and the SHAP algorithm, nighttime light (NTL), building year (BY), PM2.5, floor area ratio (FAR), number of elderly (>= 65 years) (NE) and urban surface roughness (USR) are six key indicators of morbidity of heat-related diseases (mean SHAP value>2.5), and they have an evident nonlinear relationship with the threshold effect and spatially heterogeneous contributions for the morbidity variation of heat-related diseases. Our study provides insights into machine learning (ML) model for the effect of heat vulnerability on city residential health and mitigation and adaptation strategies for governments and urban planners to develop heat resilience cities.					tong, zhaomin/KWT-8897-2024														2212-0955					FEB	2025	59								102320	10.1016/j.uclim.2025.102320	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2025.102320		JAN 2025											WOS:001421369700001

Therefore, in this study, we employed a deep learning model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to produce a daily LST dataset for the Great Lakes that spans an unparalleled 42 years (1979-2020) at a spatial resolution of similar to 1 km. In our dataset, the Great Lakes are represented by similar to 33,000 unstructured grid points and the LSTM training incorporated the information from each grid point. The LSTM was trained with seven meteorological variables from reanalysis data as feature variables and the LST from a historical satellite-derived dataset as the target variable. The LSTM was able to capture the spatial heterogeneity of LST in the Great Lakes well and exhibited high correlation (>= 0.92) and low bias (limited to +/- 1.5 degrees C) for the temporal evolution of LST during the training (1995-2020) and testing (1979-1994) periods.					; Xue, Pengfei/P-4016-2014; Huang, Chenfu/G-9662-2014; Xue, Pengfei/P-4016-2014; Liu, Tao/AAB-4111-2019	Liu, Tao/0000-0001-5917-8303; Xue, Pengfei/0000-0002-5702-421X; Kayastha, Miraj B/0000-0002-9956-8362; 														2072-4292				SEP	2023	15	17							4253	10.3390/rs15174253	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15174253													WOS:001065616500001

However, accurately estimating their historical or future CH4 emissions remains challenging, particularly under dynamic environmental changes such as eutrophication, sedimentation-driven shallowing, and global warming. We synthesized 674 observations of CH4 emission rates to identify key drivers and develop a process-based predictive model. We present a framework for spatially explicit estimation of pond CH4 emissions in China from 1960 to 2020, accounting for factors such as temperature dependence, depth, nutrient levels, and pond area. Our findings show that pond CH4 emissions are strongly temperature-dependent, characterized by a high average activation energy (0.834 eV). Notably, ebullitive emissions exhibit greater temperature sensitivity than diffusive emissions. Nitrogen concentrations and water column depth emerged as critical predictors of total CH4 fluxes. Over the past six decades, CH4 emissions from Chinese ponds increased approximately 9-fold, from 0.16 Tg CH4 yr-1 in 1960 to 1.53 Tg CH4 yr-1 by 2020, emphasizing their growing role in global methane emissions. Notably, half of these emissions occur during summer, with ebullition accounting for 66 % of the total CH4 flux. This increase was primarily driven by the interactions of warming, nutrient enrichment, declining water depth, and pond expansion. Our results underscore the growing role of ponds in CH4 emissions and highlight the urgent need for mitigation measures, such as reducing nutrient loading and implementing periodic dredging management. This study provides a robust foundation for improving CH4 emission estimates and developing sustainable management practices for ponds in the context of global environmental change.					; Huang, Ping/KBC-2991-2024	Mingquan, Lu/0000-0002-1554-1198; 													0043-1354	1879-2448				AUG 1	2025	281								123576	10.1016/j.watres.2025.123576	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2025.123576		APR 2025						40198951					WOS:001468535700001

Continued use of soft-metal bands on gulls in North America reduces the value of recovery data	JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY												Use of soft-metal (aluminum alloy) bands on gulls (Laridae) is known to result in high rates of band loss and, as a result, hard-metal (monel, incoloy, or stainless steel) bands are superior for most studies. However, the U.S. Bird Banding Laboratory (BBL) and the Canadian Wildlife Service Bird Banding Office continue to issue soft bands for use on gulls, and the BBL does not make specific recommendations about use of hard bands so many banders continue to use soft bands. For wholly marine species of gulls banded in North America since 1996, approximate to 20% have been banded with soft bands; the proportion of soft bands used on partially freshwater gulls was approximate to 70% up to 2009, but has since fallen to 40%. Using hierarchical Bayesian models in program MARK, we analyzed recovery data for three gull species and found that estimates of annual survival rates derived from soft bands (0.68-0.81) were lower than those derived from hard bands (0.85-0.96). Comparison of survival rates of Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus) in the Great Lakes basin and on the Atlantic coast provided no evidence that soft bands last longer in freshwater than saltwater. Band loss compromises many types of studies, including those assessing the possible effects of climate change. We recommend that use of soft bands on gulls be discontinued, and that banders be required to use hard bands on these species in the future. The same consideration applies to other long-lived species, including some waterfowl and all albatrosses, pelicans, cormorants, shearwaters, petrels, terns, shorebirds, and alcids. Use of hard bands should be based on expectations about a species' longevity and evidence of band wear, rather than on whether or not it occurs in saltwater.																			0273-8570	1557-9263				DEC	2013	84	4					403	415		10.1111/jofo.12039	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jofo.12039													WOS:000327302600007

SETTING: John A. Moran Eye Center, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. DESIGN: Experimental study. METHODS: Bilateral phacoemulsification was performed on 9 New Zealand white rabbits; 1 eye received the test IOL and the contralateral eye received a commercially available plate-type silicone control IOL (AA4204VL). Two rabbits were humanely. killed at 2 months and the remaining at 6 months. After gross examination of the eyes from the posterior Miyake-Apple view, select IOLs were explanted and had surface staining for implant cytology. All globes were then sectioned and processed for complete histopathologic examination. RESULTS: Overall uveal biocompatibility was similar between the test IOLs and control IOLs throughout the study. The mean posterior capsule opacification at 6 months was 0.8 +/- 0.27 (SD) in the test group and 4.0 +/- 0 in the control group (P = .001, t test: paired 2-sample for means). The mean posterior synechiae formation at 6 months was 1.28 +/- 1.25 in the test group and 2.71 +/- 0.75 in the control group (P = .01). A histopathologic examination confirmed the relative lack of capsule opacification in the study eyes compared with the control eyes and the absence of untoward inflammatory reaction or toxicity in all eyes. CONCLUSION: The new IOL maintained an open capsular bag secondary to its design, which appeared to prevent overall capsular bag opacification and retain uveal and capsule biocompatibility.

J	Black, TJ				Black, Tyrone J.			Deep karst system research, Michigan, USA	CARBONATES AND EVAPORITES												At least three major evaporite dissolution events have developed deep karst in two zones of the northern Michigan basin. Dissolution of outer margin Silurian evaporites resulted in the Mackinac Breccia during the early Devonian. This rebound and exposure or a later, brief basin rebound also caused the development of surficial evaporate epikarst in the middle Detroit River Group before the next subsidence and new deposition. Pleistocene glaciation pumped fresh water into shallow Silurian and Devonian carbonate aquifers and stressed the formations by repeated loading and unloading. Buried early Devonian paleokarst in the Detroit River Group was affected by hydrostatic pressure from the glacial waters and exposure along hydraulically open faults and fractures which developed the ancient karst. The current karsted zone varies from totally removed evaporites and collapsed formations along the northern margin of the Detroit River Group subcrop, to an irregular active evaporite dissolution front 29-39 km further basinward. The last glacial retreat from the Lake Huron basin approximately 10,000 years before present (ybp), opened and flooded the basin, The level dropped approximately 150 m in the Lake Huron basin to Lake Stanley stage at 10,000-7,500 ybp to approximately 58 m compared to the present 177 m above sea level of Lake Huron. This is likely the time when most of the visible collapse sinkholes in Northern Michigan formed. Some of these sinkholes have been identified in Lake Huron recently by subbottom profiling. Water venting from them into the lake has conductivity values ranging from 123 to 1,821 mu S/cm, attributed to high levels of chloride and sulfate. A benthic ecosystem of anoxic chemosynthetic bacteria is established in mat and bacteria filament forms at the vents. There are no land springs from this system which has hundreds of square kilometers of active swallow area.																			0891-2556					JUN	2012	27	2			SI		119	122		10.1007/s13146-012-0093-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13146-012-0093-6													WOS:000306589300005
J	Korhola, A				Korhola, A			Distribution patterns of Cladocera in subarctic Fennoscandian lakes and their potential in environmental reconstruction	ECOGRAPHY												Multivariate statistical techniques were used to examine the relationships between surface-sediment cladoceran assemblages and 28 physical and chemical variables in 53 small subarctic lakes from northern Fennoscandia, The lakes were distributed along a steep eco-climatic gradient, spanning boreal corniferous forest to treeless tundra. In general, the sites were small, oligotrophic: and bathymetrically simple, with little or no disturbance in their catchments. From the initial 53 localities, only 36 contained a sufficient number of cladoceran remains for reasonable quantification. From these, a total of 29 cladoceran taxa representing 19 genera were identified; comprising predominantly littoral chydorid species. A constrained redundancy analysis (RDA) and associated Monte Carlo permutation tests indicated that maximum lake depth, sediment organic content, epilimnetic summer temperature, lake perimeter, and lake catchment area made statistically significant (p less than or equal to 0.05) contributions to explaining the variance in the cladoceran taxon data. These five variables together accounted for 67.7% of the explained variance, and made a unique contribution of 26.8% to the total variance: all physical determinants independently captured 33.2% of the total variance. The significance of the most powerful explanatory variables is discussed in the paper in detail, and autecological information regarding the most common cladoceran taxa is given. To assess the potential of cladoceran assemblages in environmental reconstruction, quantitative inference models for mean July water and air temperatures were developed for the cladoceran assemblage using partial least squares (PLS) regression. The final prediction model yielded a root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP), as assessed by jackknifing, of 1.19 degrees C for Cladocera-water temperature data-set, whereas the cladoceran assemblages showed only very weak relationships to mean July air temperature. The overall results emphasize the role of physical factors in regulating species abundance and distributions in these environmentally sensitive ecotonal lakes.

J	VEKHOV, NV				VEKHOV, NV			BIOLOGY OF CLADOCERA IN TUNDRA THERMOKARST SMALL LAKES	ZHURNAL OBSHCHEI BIOLOGII												In most of the basins in the eastern Bolshaya Zemlya tundra, the structure of cladoceran [Daphnia pulex tenebrosa, D. p. middendorfiana, Simocephalus vetulus, Holopedium gibberum, Scapholeberis mucronata, Ophryoxus gracilis and Eurycercus glacialis] populations remains constant through the years. The only notable differences observed (for D. p. tenebrosa Fischer) were the result of considerable temperature changes. An age dependant change was observed in the fertility of many species: the lowest fertility was recorded in young populations, the highest.sbd.in mature ones. By the end of July, a decrease in numbers was observed in some species, which might be due to a decrease in water depth, aquatic weed-growth or predation. In deep basins and in weed thickets, no decrease in numbers was observed. Fertility of Cladocera in thermokarst basins is similar to that in the basins of the temperate zone. The number of generations and the number of offspring in each generation is less in tundra basins due to a shorter vegetation period. A positive correlation was established between the changes in numbers and fertility and between the body size and fertility. Sexual reproduction proceeds with the participation of males, unlike the arctic basins where no males were observed. In cladoceran populations males and ephippial females begin from the 2nd generation. By the middle of Aug., the number of ephippiae increases and reaches 5000/l m2. The survival rate of ephippiae of different species does not exceed 10-15% in conditions of the severe tundra winter.																			0044-4596						1979	40	3					407	414																WOS:A1979GZ07200009

Quality Improvement in 'Vignoles' through Clonal Selection	X INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON GRAPEVINE BREEDING AND GENETICS	Acta Horticulturae				10th International Conference on Grapevine Breeding and Genetics	AUG 01-05, 2010	Geneva, NY	Int Soc Hort Sci				'Vignoles' is a valuable component of the wine grape cultivar portfolio in the eastern United States. Because it is relatively winter hardy, 'Vignoles' is grown in such diverse locations as New York, Missouri, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Nebraska and Michigan. However, Vignoles has tight clusters prone to bunch rot, and losses up to one third of the crop are possible. Despite consumer demand for Vignoles, its production is limited by bunch rot susceptibility associated with compact cluster architecture. Our goal is to select a loose-clustered clone of 'Vignoles' that will contribute to an integrated approach to disease control. Following gamma radiation, irradiated buds and non-irradiated controls were bench grafted onto 3309C rootstock. A total of 2,336 vines, including 30 non-mutagenized 'Vignoles' control vines, were planted in 2007 (500 vines) and in 2008 (1,839 vines). The experimental vineyard is located at the Cornell Lake Erie Research and Extension Laboratory (Portland, New York) in the Lake Erie shore grape and wine production region. Vines were cultivated in grow tubes and drip irrigated to promote rapid vine establishment and growth. The vines were trained to a bilateral cordon, spur pruned, and cultivated following standard practices for hybrid wine grape cultivars in western New York, including fertilization and weed, pest, and disease management. Many clones planted in 2007 fruited in 2008, but fruit was dropped to encourage vegetative establishment. The generation of new clones and the establishment of the vineyard are complete. The second stage of the project is evaluation of cluster looseness and bunch rot susceptibility. A pyramidal selection approach for cluster compactness is being followed, using berries per centimeter as a measure of cluster compactness. We have identified several clones with looser clusters than control, non-mutagenized 'Vignoles' vines.																			0567-7572		978-94-62610-34-7				2014	1046						287	290		10.17660/ActaHortic.2014.1046.38	http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2014.1046.38													WOS:000344023100038
J	Kirillin, G; Terzhevik, A				Kirillin, Georgiy; Terzhevik, Arkady			Thermal instability in freshwater lakes under ice: Effect of salt gradients or solar radiation?	COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The phenomenon of "temperature dichotomy", or anomalous heating of surface water under the ice up to temperatures exceeding 4 degrees C is known to take place occasionally in solar-heated ice-covered freshwater lakes and has usually been explained by the stabilizing effect of the weak vertical salinity gradient created by the melt water flux from the ice and supporting the unstable temperature distribution. Here, we report an observation of the local temperature maximum in the upper part of the water column of ice-covered Lake Vendyurskoe (northwestern Russia). The observation was accompanied by vertically resolved measurements of the conductivity allowing estimation of the dissolved salts effect on the vertical density distribution. The results demonstrate insufficiency of the salt gradient to support the vertical stability of water column. Therefore, we suggest the vertically inhomogeneous radiation absorption to be the probable stabilizing mechanism here, similarly to radiatively heated boundary layers in the ocean, the atmosphere and star interiors. An analytical solution of the heat transfer equation is derived describing the temperature profile evolution in ice-covered lakes subject to solar radiation heating above the maximum density temperature. Observed daytime temperature profiles agree well with the analytical model that suggests the absence of convective mixing. According to the model, the temperature maximum is formed within a day that supports the hypothesis about the stabilizing effect of the solar radiation absorption. We conclude that in temperate lakes the warm layer should have diurnal character and should be destroyed during the nighttime by convection. In polar lakes, in turn, the warm layer can exist during essentially longer periods that is supported by application of the model to the previously published data from Lake Peters, Alaska. In this case, the ice melting rate can be significantly affected by the increased temperature gradient beneath the ice. Apart from potential effects on the ice melting rate and the spring plankton development in lakes, the regime represents a rare geophysical example of instability driven solely by radiative heating with many useful analogies in planetary and stellar physics.

J	Birkett, CM; Beckley, B				Birkett, C. M.; Beckley, B.			Investigating the Performance of the Jason-2/OSTM Radar Altimeter over Lakes and Reservoirs	MARINE GEODESY												Many inland water investigations utilize archival and near-real time radar altimetry data to enable observation of the variation in surface water level. A multialtimeter approach allows a more global outlook with improved spatial resolution, and combined long-term observations improve statistical analyses. Central to all programs is a performance assessment of each instrument. Here, we focus on data quantity and quality pertaining to the Poseidon-3 radar altimeter onboard the Jason-2/OSTM satellite. Utilizing an interim data set (IGDR), studies show that the new on-board DIODE/median and DIODE/DEM tracking modes are performing well, acquiring and maintaining the majority of lake and reservoir surfaces in varying terrains. The 20-Hz along-track resolution of the data, and particularly the availability of the range output from the ice-retracker algorithm, also improves the number of valid height measurements. Based on test-case lakes and reservoirs, output from the ice-retracker algorithm is also seen to have a clear advantage over the ocean-retracker having better height stability across calm and icy surfaces, a greater ability to gain coastline waters, and less sensitivity to loss of water surface when there is island contamination in the radar echo. Such on-board tracking and postprocessing retracking enables the lake waters to be quickly gained after coastline crossing. Values can range from <0.1 s to 2.5 s, but the majority of measurements are obtained in less than 0.4 s or <2.3 km from the coast. Validation exercises reveal that targets of similar to 150 km(2) surface area and similar to 0.8 km width are able to be monitored offering greater potential to acquire lakes in the 100-300 km(2) size-category. Time series of height variations are also found to be accurate to similar to 3 to 33 cm rms depending on target size and the presence of winter ice. These findings are an improvement over the IGDR/GDR results from the predecessor Jason-1 and TOPEX/Poseidon missions and can satisfy the accuracy requirements of both the science-related and operational lake study programs.																			0149-0419	1521-060X					2010	33			1			204	238		10.1080/01490419.2010.488983	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490419.2010.488983													WOS:000281422900011

Copper, zinc, iron, and manganese declines in Camanche Reservoir downstream of an abandoned mine	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Horne, AJ, Jung R. 2022. Hypolimnetic oxygenation 5. Copper, zinc, iron, and manganese declines in Camanche Reservoir downstream of an abandoned mine. Lake Reserve. Manage. XX:XXX-XXX. An abandoned mine upstream of Camanche Reservoir in California had increased sediment copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) concentrations by 10-fold. Regulators and environmentalists claimed that a hypolimnetic oxygenation system (HOS) on the reservoir bed would stir sediments and increase metal toxicity in the hypolimnetic water supplied to steelhead and Chinook salmon in the Mokelumne River and its large fish hatchery. On the contrary, after HOS, small decreases in the concentrations of Zn and Cu and large decreases in iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) occurred. Before HOS, sigma Cu concentrations were relatively low (mean deep, 3.3 mu g/L, surface, 2.4 mu g/L) but in the soft water sometimes exceeded an aquatic life criterion of 3 mu g/L. After HOS, the long-term mean sigma Cu dropped 12% to 2.9 mu g/L (deep); surface concentrations were unchanged. Before HOS, bottom water sigma Zn (mean = 17.7 mu g/L) occasionally exceeded the criterion of 27 mu g/L, but after HOS the long-term mean fell 36% to 11.3 mu g/L. In contrast, sigma Fe dropped 40-fold, dissolved Fe dropped 150-fold, sigma Mn dropped 30-fold, and dissolved Mn dropped 400-fold. Fe and Mn declines were consistent with oxide precipitation. However, declines in Cu and Zn were due to homogenization of the deeper hypolimnion by mixing in the oxygenated HOS plume and not due to oxidation itself or the HOS-induced 79% reduction in algae. Important for reservoir management, HOS slightly reduced heavy metals in the reservoir outflows, benefiting the downstream river and fish hatchery. Similar results are predicted for mixing by aeration or propellers.																			1040-2381	2151-5530				JUN 9	2022	38	2					139	149		10.1080/10402381.2021.1905755	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2021.1905755		MAR 2021											WOS:000783018700001

Modeling a glacial lake outburst flood process chain: the case of Lake Palcacocha and Huaraz, Peru	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												One of the consequences of recent glacier recession in the Cordillera Blanca, Peru, is the risk of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) from lakes that have formed at the base of retreating glaciers. GLOFs are often triggered by avalanches falling into glacial lakes, initiating a chain of processes that may culminate in significant inundation and destruction downstream. This paper presents simulations of all of the processes involved in a potential GLOF originating from Lake Palcacocha, the source of a previously catastrophic GLOF on 13 December 1941, killing about 1800 people in the city of Huaraz, Peru. The chain of processes simulated here includes (1) avalanches above the lake; (2) lake dynamics resulting from the avalanche impact, including wave generation, propagation, and run-up across lakes; (3) terminal moraine overtopping and dynamic moraine erosion simulations to determine the possibility of breaching; (4) flood propagation along downstream valleys; and (5) inundation of populated areas. The results of each process feed into simulations of subsequent processes in the chain, finally resulting in estimates of inundation in the city of Huaraz. The results of the inundation simulations were converted into flood intensity and preliminary hazard maps (based on an intensity-likelihood matrix) that may be useful for city planning and regulation. Three avalanche events with volumes ranging from 0.5 to 3 x 10(6) m(3) were simulated, and two scenarios of 15 and 30 m lake lowering were simulated to assess the potential of mitigating the hazard level in Huaraz. For all three avalanche events, three-dimensional hydrodynamic models show large waves generated in the lake from the impact resulting in overtopping of the damming moraine. Despite very high discharge rates (up to 63.4 x 10(3) m(3) s(-1)), the erosion from the overtopping wave did not result in failure of the damming moraine when simulated with a hydro-morphodynamic model using excessively conservative soil characteristics that provide very little erosion resistance. With the current lake level, all three avalanche events result in inundation in Huaraz due to wave overtopping, and the resulting preliminary hazard map shows a total affected area of 2.01 km(2), most of which is in the high hazard category. Lowering the lake has the potential to reduce the affected area by up to 35 %, resulting in a smaller portion of the inundated area in the high hazard category.

Despite being a scientific hub, the creation of the MDV Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA) made significant steps toward protecting the environment from degradation from human usage. However, with sustained human presence within the MDV, increasing human activity across Antarctica, and aquatic ecosystems subject to environmental change, the effectiveness of current protections for biodiversity conservation requires evaluation. This study employs spatial analysis of MDV protected areas, streams, lakes, research camps, and tourist sites to assess the robustness of current protections, identify underprotected areas, and outline steps for future protection. Within the MDV ASMA, five smaller Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs) exist. Only two ASPAs contain streams, and only one with a full hydrologic catchment. With roughly 6% of the lotic habitat area protected by ASPAs, the MDV fall short of global goals for freshwater protection. Past successful management of the MDV shows the effectiveness of collaboration and early action, and amongst calls for ASPA network expansion and restructuring, the MDV has the opportunity to be at the forefront again and increase the protection of Antarctic aquatic ecosystems.

Data are presented which provide a description of how sea level changes have influenced and formed the island Anholt. This geological history can be used to provide information on the development of the salt-fresh groundwater interface under a sand island. The center of Anholt was covered by the sea at 6 ka and has now an ideal Ghyben-Herzberg freshwater lens. This means that the present equilibrium between the saltwater and freshwater has been established in less than 6000 years. Limestone aquifers on Zealand show no ideal Ghyben-Herzberg freshwater lens. Detailed 3-D mapping of a study area, around Roskilde- and Isefjord, has revealed how low sea-levels (around 50-30 ka) cause development of karst structures and deep erosion channels in the limestone (later filled with high permeable sand and gravel). These channels drain the groundwater to subsea springs, working as natural pumps, resulting in a freshwater "lens" much thinner than the equilibrium.

J	STAUFFER, RE				STAUFFER, RE			A COMPARATIVE-ANALYSIS OF IRON, MANGANESE, SILICA, PHOSPHORUS, AND SULFUR IN THE HYPOLIMNIA OF CALCAREOUS LAKES	WATER RESEARCH												The chemistry of the hypolimnion was studied in late summer in 23 individual basins of 19 calcareous lakes situated in the Midwestern U.S.A. The basins represented a broad range in morphometry, and drainage basin influences. All but two of the basins were anoxic by early September. The concentrations of Fe were low in the anoxic basins because of precipitation of FeS. Excess sulfide accumulated in the hypolimnion (up to 7 mg-1) making these basins sulfuretums. The concentrations of total-P ranged widely.sbd.from 0.03 mg l-1in several seepage lakes to > 0.5 mg l-1 in drainage lakes with very short .tau.w, or influenced by agricultural or urban drainage, or municipal waste. Neither apatite nor vivianite limited the hypolimnetic build-up of this key nutrient. Hypolimnetic Mn was almost entirely soluble if the basin was anoxic. The concentrations indirectly reflected external inputs, not the thermodynamics of rhodochrosite. Concentrations of dissolved silica were generally much lower than in inflowing waters. The hypolimnetics Si/P ratio was low unless the lake lacked surface inflows and also experienced high rates of groundwater inflow rich in silica and very low in P. Because of the very low hypolimnetic Fe/P and Fe/Si ratios, phosphate and silica are liberated from significant chemical interactions with Fe accompanying their eddy diffusion transport upward within the hypolimnion, and across the metalimnetic oxycline. Because of external P inputs and efficiency of internal P recycycling, Si is potentially a limiting nutrient for diatoms in calcareous lakes.																			0043-1354	1879-2448				SEP	1987	21	9					1009	1022		10.1016/0043-1354(87)90022-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(87)90022-4													WOS:A1987K547600001
J	Leitch, AM; Chen, JG; Rashid, H				Leitch, Alison M.; Chen, Jianguang; Rashid, Harunur			A tale of two ponds, Newfoundland, Canada	ATLANTIC GEOLOGY												Bathymetric surveys of two small lakes in Newfoundland, located in different environments and separated by hundreds of kilometres, were carried out using two different survey methods-ground penetrating radar (GPR) and sound navigation and ranging (sonar). The different structures of these two disparate ponds were found to be related to the differing geology and degrees of anthropogenic influence at the two locations. In addition, the study outlined the strengths and limitations of the two survey methods. Tipping's Pond, on the outskirts of the town of Corner Brook in western Newfoundland, is a sinkhole in a popular recreation area. It is roughly square with an area of 1.6 km(2) and is slightly salty, making it largely impenetrable by radar. Bathymetric surveys with a salinity-impervious fish-finder sonar system revealed Tipping's Pond to be bowl-shaped and more than 25 m deep in the centre. Grassy Pond, 3 km inland from the Trans-Canada Highway in eastern Newfoundland, is within an undeveloped area accessible by snowmobile in the winter. It has an irregular, elongated shape 1.2 km(2) in area and is very fresh. As well as determining the bathymetry, GPR was able to determine the depth of a soft sediment layer overlying till, and to image structures within the soft sediments. The top of the sediment layer is undulating and shallow (<2.9 m deep) whereas the base of the sediments overlies sub-basins about 8 m deep.																			0843-5561	1718-7885					2025	61						343	354		10.4138/atlgeo.2025.016	http://dx.doi.org/10.4138/atlgeo.2025.016													WOS:001592060200001

Therefore, surface-water source heat pumps have been extensively studied in recent years as substitutes for conventional air-source heat pumps. Surface-water source heat pumps can be operated by various surface water such as river water, seawater, or lake water as heat sources. However, there is a problem that the surface-water temperature can rapidly drop in winter, and there is a risk of freezing in the heat source side heat exchanger during the heating operation. Therefore, the concept of an air-assisted surface-water source heat pump is proposed as a solution to the freezing problem. Air-source heat pumps can operate under frosting conditions even at low ambient temperatures. In the hybrid system, heat is charged to the thermal energy storage by the assistive air source heat pump using late-night electricity, and the thermal energy storage is used as a heat source for the daytime heat-source compensation operation of the surface-water source heat pump. Energy analysis is conducted through dynamic simulation, and a comparison with a hybrid water source heat pump and an air source heat pump is conducted. As a result, it is confirmed that primary energy consumption can be saved 6.5 to 19.2% compared with the conventional systems.																									2023							1691	1694		10.1615/TFEC2023.ref.045851	http://dx.doi.org/10.1615/TFEC2023.ref.045851													WOS:001191885700184

Composition and origin of the sabkha brines, and their environmental impact on infrastructure in Jizan area, Red Sea Coast, Saudi Arabia	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The sulfate evaporite minerals (gypsum and anhydrite) and brines of Jizan sabkha cause corrosion of the steel reinforcement and deterioration of the concrete, and consequently hinder the development activity for building new urban communities and industrial zones in Jizan area, Red Sea coastal plain of Saudi Arabia. The sabkha evaporite minerals below the sediment surface are represented by displacive and inclusive growth of lenticular and rosette gypsum, and nodular anhydrite. In small saline pans, halite precipitates form rafts, chevrons and cornets. The salinity (TDS) of the groundwater in the sabkha area is highly variable, and ranges from 12,900 to 495,000 mg/l, compared to the average value of the Red Sea water of 40,366 mg/l. The low salinity values of the sabkha brines are most probably caused by localized influx of groundwater of meteoric origin from direct rain fall and/or temporary floods, in addition to seepage of sewage water from septic tanks. The electric conductivity (EC) values range from 20,000 to 199,100 lS/ cm which are conformable to the salinity values of the brine. The dominant cation concentration order in seawater and brines of the sabkha is Na+ > Mg2+ > Ca2+ > K+, or Na+ > Mg2(+) > K+ > Ca2(+) >. The dominant anion concentration order is Cl- > SO42- > HCO3-. The dominant brine type for most samples is sodium chloride, with variable proportions of the major cations Ca2(+) and Mg2+ and the major anion SO42-. Most brine samples indicate their source is of modified marine water having an elevated CaCl2 content, which may be derived from dissolution of mixed salt from the Miocene salt dome in Jizan area. The chemical composition and origin of the brines, and mineralogy and textures of the evaporite minerals in Jizan sabkha help in understanding the nature of the corrosive factors to the foundations in Jizan area.					; Aref, Mahmoud/H-8894-2012	Aref, Mahmoud/0000-0001-8954-8096; 													1866-6280	1866-6299				JAN	2016	75	2							105	10.1007/s12665-015-4913-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4913-6													WOS:000370240800016
J	Roseman, EF				Roseman, Edward F.			Diet and habitat use by age-0 deepwater sculpins in northern Lake Huron, Michigan and the Detroit River	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Deepwater sculpins (Myoxocephalus thompsonii) are an important link in deepwater benthic foodwebs of the Great Lakes. Little information exists about deepwater sculpin spawning habits and early life history ecology due to difficulty in sampling deep offshore habitats. Larval and age-0 deepwater sculpins collected in northern Lake Huron and the Detroit River during 2007 were used to improve our understanding of their habitat use, diet, age, and growth. Peak larval density reached 8.4/1000 m(3) in the Detroit River during April and was higher than that in Lake Huron. Offshore bottom trawls at DeTour and Hammond Bay first collected benthic age-0 deepwater sculpins in early September when fish were >= 25 mm TL Otolith analysis revealed that hatch dates for pelagic larvae occurred during late March and larvae remained pelagic for 40 to 60 days. Diet of pelagic larvae (10-21 mm U) was dominated by calanoid copepods at all sample locations. Diets of benthic age-0 fish varied by location and depth: Mysis and chironomids were prevalent in fish from Hammond Bay and the 91 m site at DeTour, but only chironomids were found in fish from the 37 m DeTour site. This work showed that nearshore epilimnetic sites were important for pelagic larvae and an ontogenetic shift from pelagic planktivore to benthivore occurred at about 25 mm TL in late summer. Age analysis showed that larvae remained pelagic long enough to be transported through the St. Clair-Detroit River system, Lake Erie, and the Niagara River, potentially contributing to populations in Lake Ontario.

Phytoplankton biomass was used and similarity of assemblages in same months of the annual data sets was then calculated by subtracting the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index from 1. The extent of biological and physical forcing was partly based on "expert evaluation": the importance of four physical (light availability, temperature, conductivity, and sediment stirring up) and five biological variables (basic nutrients [SRP-, DIN-, SRSi-availability] as estimators of competition straight, importance of grazing, and importance of parasitism) was evaluated month by month by arbitrarily scaling from 1 to 5 the intensity of each variable and then summing them in the appropriate subgroup. Since the number of physical variables is less than that of the biological ones, the latter was rescaled to reach the same maximum attainable value of physical variables. The results showed an extremely high variability, making evident that each lake, although showing the same metabolic processes, behaves as an individual with regard to its phytoplankton structure. More generally, it was possible to highlight a largely more important role of physical constraints in shaping both biomass and composition of phytoplankton. This is especially true in winter. In addition, the results were compared to the outcomes of the PEG model, since a plasticity in the structure of phytoplankton much greater than that reported in this widely acknowledged model has been recorded in the data set used. This high variability found in this study in relation to physical constraints might also explain the different patterns of phytoplankton growth observed from Northern temperate to Mediterranean lakes as well as those occurring in shallow and deep lakes.

With similar to 70% of Bhutan under forest cover, this water-rich country promises to maintain at least 60% of the landmass under forest in perpetuity at any given point of time. Yet, climate change hasn't pardoned this carbon-neutral nation. This article conveys a brief idea about the dent that climate change is leaving on the glacier environment in Bhutan. Bhutan is undergoing warming at an unprecedented rate with evidences suggesting higher warming trends during winter months and also at higher altitudes (>4000 m.a.s.l.) (Sharma et al., 2009). With large diversity of glaciers in the region, comprehensive field-based studies have been difficult due to rugged terrain, political issues and limited manpower and financial aid. Yet several remote sensing based have suggested glaciers in Bhutan are melting. Evidences suggest oldest stage of glaciers in Bhutan extended down to 2600 m.a.s.l. (Mool et al., 2001); whereas in the present day, they are found only above 4000 m.a.s.l. Glacial retreat in Bhutan has been extensive (Karma et al., 2003; Rupper et al., 2012; Naito et al., 2012; Bajracharya and Shrestha, 2011; Bajracharya et al., 2014; Veettil et al., 2015) leading to formation of supra-glacial, pro-glacial and moraine dammed lakes. Particularly in Bhutan and Eastern Himalayas, threat from glacial lake outburst floods is high. With 22 potentially dangerous glacial lakes, there is high risk and hazard potential to the regions lying downstream from outburst. In spite of being an environmentally sustainable country with a conservative approach, Bhutan is at the frontline of climate change-related threats. Future water security is not warranted under this scenario. This can have serious implications on water-dependent-economy of Bhutan that thrives on hydropower, agriculture and tourism. Extensive research is called for in Bhutan, apart from efforts to adapt and mitigate climate change.					; AL, Ramanathan/E-7217-2012; Wangchuk, Sonam/W-2432-2019	Wangchuk, Sonam/0000-0003-0897-1402; Tshering, Dendup/0000-0001-6128-9539													2395-7611	2395-7697					2017	3	2					1	10		10.3233/JCC-170010	http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/JCC-170010													WOS:000414072900002

In total, 689 measurement sites were defined within the selected 300x350 in rectangle (ca. 10.5 ha). The analysed soil gases vary in their molecular and isotopic compositions. Several zones with anomalous methane concentrations over 10 vol% were identified in the study area. These anomalous concentrations correlate well with total C-2-C-5 alkane anomalies (over I vol%). The zones with carbon dioxide concentrations over 15 vol% are generally shifted SW of those, where the methane and the sum of C-2-C-5 alkanes anomalies were identified. High helium concentrations of crustal origin (over 0.001 vol%) are clustered near fault zones. In a majority of cases methane is of thermogenic origin, migrating to the near-surface zone from deep-seated accumulations. Microbial methane, or methane with a high microbial component, is genetically related to recent swamps. The high variability of concentrations of gaseous components together with the highly variable isotopic composition of individual gases in the soil, indicate their thermogenic and/or microbial origin, and point to the lithological diversity of Quaternary sediments in the study area. Several zones with thermogenic gaseous hydrocarbons and helium were delineated. It is likely that during the Pleistocene winters, under a thick ice and snow cover, the tundra lake and swamp zones around outflows of brines, oil, helium and thermogenic gases had a higher temperature, which resulted in melting and cracking of the ice cover. These sites would be more prospective for future search of well-preserved large vertebrates.					; Sechman, Henryk/B-3013-2016	Kotarba, Maciej/0000-0001-6895-5872; Sechman, Henryk/0000-0001-5225-8204													0208-9068						2009	79	3					375	390																WOS:000273648000012

The development of several networks for aerosol measurements, and the next day availability of preliminary data for some, have further enhanced interest in the products this type of measurement can provide. With several networks operating globally and others operating either regionally or continentally within North America the comparability of the data emanating from the various archive centers is an important issue. The Bratt's Lake Observatory operates four separate types of Sun photometers in conjunction with three different networks: Aerosols in Canada, Global Atmosphere Watch, and the U. S. Department of Agriculture UV-B Monitoring Program. Data collected during the summer of 2001, following the protocols established by the networks and the Meteorological Service of Canada, were analyzed to determine the comparability among these networks. As the instruments and conversion algorithms are similar to other networks from around the globe, it is believed that the results of this comparison can be transferred, at least in part, to other operational networks. The results of the 3-month study indicate that the data obtained from the networks that operate direct-pointing instruments are very comparable, being within +/- 0.01 of an optical depth for instantaneous measurements during cloud-free line-of-sight conditions. Over the length of the comparison the root mean square difference of aerosol optical depth at 500 nm between the direct sun-pointing instruments was 0.0069. The rotating shadowband instruments did not perform as well. These results indicate that the data from well-maintained networks of direct sun-pointing photometers can provide data of the quality necessary to compare stations from across the globe.																			2169-897X	2169-8996				OCT 2	2003	108	D19							4596	10.1029/2002JD002964	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2002JD002964													WOS:000185892200001

Late-Holocene fossil pollen assemblage and associated vegetation diversity estimates provide an opportunity to explore the interactions among vegetation, climate, and human activities. A continuous 2000-year palynological record was obtained from the Beihai Wetland, southwestern China, to represent regional vegetation history, particularly the vegetation diversity changes. The results indicate that regional vegetation was dominated by deciduous broadleaved forest components (e.g. Alms, deciduous Quercus), which showed a gradual decrease accompanied by expansion of herbaceous taxa (mainly Poaceae) after AD 800. Such progressive decline of forest was attributed to regional deforestation driven by intensified human activities, which was further confirmed by the increasing non-pollen polymorph abundance, particularly an abrupt rise after AD 1350. Vegetation diversity based on the Hill numbers (N0, N1, and N2) showed a dramatic decline between ca. AD 200-400, which was triggered by regional fire events as shown by increased charcoal abundance from a nearby lake. The vegetation diversity reduced gradually after AD 800, especially the vegetation richness reflected by NO, revealing the transitional process from climate-driven to human-dominated vegetation changes. Minor increases of vegetation diversity occurred during Chinese dynastical transitions, probably due to reduced human activities following war-induced population crises. On the multidecadal scale, variations in vegetation diversity correlated significantly with climate fluctuations (revealed by synthesized temperature of China and stable oxygen isotope record from Dongge Cave) before AD 800, indicating a climate dominant condition. Then, the correlation between vegetation diversity and climate declined after AD 800, representing a progressive transition to human-dominant condition. In addition, the compositional turnover based on DCCA of the fossil pollen assemblage revealed a stepwise decrease, indicating reduced vegetation turnovers under anthropogenic influences.

J	NIELSEN, SN				NIELSEN, SN			MODELING STRUCTURAL DYNAMICAL CHANGES IN A DANISH SHALLOW LAKE	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Biomanipulation and diversion of nutrients can affect not only the eutrophication level, but also the trophic structure and species composition of the phytoplankton society in lakes. Existing models often fail to describe the reactions of the ecosystem when such qualitative changes are involved. For this purpose structural dynamic models are needed. This paper presents the first attempt to model the qualitative changes that have been observed to occur in a Danish shallow lake as a result of biomanipulation. A structural dynamic model was developed that included nine species or types of algae normally observed in Danish shallow lakes. The high flow ratio of the lake was assumed to justify that summer conditions would represent a steady state of the system. The parameters of the model were calibrated until the model gave adequate results. The available mathematical tools normally used for calibration were found to give unsatisfactory results. The calibration therefore had to be carried out by running the model repetitively, adjusting parameters until it was able to perform according to the changes actually observed in the lake chosen for this case study. The use of parameters from literature to characterize the different types of algae is shown to have a great impact on this phase of model development. The calibration was found to be very time consuming, mainly due to uncertainties connected to the input parameters. The importance and uncertainty of the parameters chosen indicate that we may probably have to choose new strategies for similar modelling approaches in the future, such as the application of goal functions. The implementations would allow parameters to vary during simulations in order to simulate ecosystem properties, such as adaptational processes and buffering capacities which are features possessed by natural ecosystems.

A distinct difference was observed between brown trout and Arctic charr in the accumulation of radiocaesium (Cs-134 and Cs-137) from the Chernobyl fallout, and the study focused on the understanding of this difference. (2) Brown trout had a large food consumption and a corresponding high intake of radiocaesium. Excretion was 20% faster in brown trout than Arctic charr as brown trout lived at high temperatures in epilimnic water. Arctic charr had a lower food consumption (less than one-third of trout) and lived in colder meta- and hypolimnic water. Arctic charr therefore had a lower intake and slower excretion of radiocaesium. (3) Brown trout and Arctic charr had different diets. For brown trout zoobenthos was the dominant food item, whereas Arctic charr mainly fed on zooplankton. The radioactivity in the stomach contents of the two species was different in 1986, but similar for the rest of the period. (4) Higher levels of radiocaesium in brown trout than Arctic charr in 1986 were due to a higher food consumption and more radioactive food items in its diet. (5) The parallel development in accumulated radiocaesium through summer 1987 was probably formed by brown trout balancing a higher intake with a faster excretion. (6) The ecological half-lives of radiocaesium in brown trout (357 days) and Arctic charr (550 days) from Lake Hoysjoen indicated a slow removal of the isotopes from the food webs.

Without a long written history in Vietnam, we need to rely on geoarchives such as lake sediments to reconstruct past monsoon variability and regional paleoenvironmental fluctuations and evaluate current climatic trends. Natural lakes in the Central Highlands of Vietnam have the potential to have recorded shifts of the monsoon belt over glacial/interglacial cycles.

Numerous sediment cores have been retrieved from Bi ển H ồ, Ia Bang, Ea Tyn, Ea Sno and Lak lakes between 2016 and 2022. Of special importance is a 25 m long sediment core from Bi ển H ồ Lake (Gia Lai province) covering the last 57 ka, which the team retrieved in April 2021. Sediment cores were analyzed for geochemistry, sedimentology, magnetic susceptibility, and radiocarbon dating. This paper reviews the status of our currently available sedimentary records to assess the paleoenvironmental potential of lacustrine sediments in the Central Highlands of Vietnam. Current data suggest that the lakes in the Central Highlands provide reliable sedimentological and geochemical records and bear the potential to reconstruct the paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic conditions in Vietnam across several glacial periods, with a high-resolution record at least in the Holocene. The records contribute to quantifying the effects of monsoon variability and assessing the changes in hydrological conditions before and after the onset of human land use by comparing different lakes in the region. Future fieldwork will focus on retrieving longer lake sediment sequences from the Central Highlands, possibly covering the full interglacial-glacial cycle (i.e. the last 125 ka, back to MIS-5e), and on the assessment of comparable lake archives in other parts of Vietnam where the timing and character of monsoon-related climatic variations may have differed.					; Thi Minh Nguyet, Nguyen/HLX-2780-2023; Nguyen, Thai/KII-5037-2024; Nguyễn-Văn, Hướng/ABA-7248-2021; Le, HuuQuynhAnh/ODM-0324-2025; Nguyen-Van, Huong/ABA-7248-2021	Sauer, Peter/0000-0002-3756-4366; Nguyen-Dinh, Thai/0000-0002-1303-0239; Nguyen-Van, Huong/0000-0003-1523-5921													0866-7187	2615-9783					2023	45	2					164	182		10.15625/2615-9783/18281	http://dx.doi.org/10.15625/2615-9783/18281													WOS:001014952100003

Scott			Phytoplankton Drivers of Dissolved Organic Material Production in Colorado Reservoirs and the Formation of Disinfection By-Products	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Previous studies have shown that algal-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) has a strong influence on the formation of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) during the treatment of drinking water. In the summer of 2010, we evaluated the role of nitrogen and phosphorus loading and phytoplankton abundance as drivers of the concentrations and quality of DOM and the associated DBP formation in 30 reservoirs in the mountains and plains of the State of Colorado. Optical properties such as Specific Ultraviolet Absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA(254)) and fluorescence spectroscopy were used to characterize DOM quality. Nutrient concentrations such as total nitrogen were also assessed and were associated with high concentrations of chlorophyll a (Chl-a). In turn, high total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations were associated with high concentrations of Chl-a, and the DOM in these reservoirs had a fluorescence signature indicative of contributions from phytoplankton growth. The reservoirs with TOC concentrations above 4 mgC/L were predominantly located in the plains and many are impacted by agricultural runoff and wastewater discharges, rather than in the mountains and are characterized by warm water conditions and shallow depths. For a subset of fourteen reservoirs, we characterized the composition of the phytoplankton using a rapid imaging microscopy technique and observed a dominance by filamentous Cyanobacteria in reservoirs with TOC concentrations above 4 mgC/L. The combination of high TOC concentrations with microbial characteristics resulted in high potential for production of two major classes of regulated DBPs, trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids. While fluorescence spectroscopy was useful in confirming the contribution of phytoplankton growth to high TOC concentrations, evaluation of predictive models for DBP yields found that all equally predictive models included SUVA(254) and some of these models also included fluorescence indices or logTOC. These findings provide a limnological context in support of the recent guidelines that have been implemented for protection of high-quality drinking water supplies in the State of Colorado.

Relationships between Microcystis cell density (MCD) and environmental parameters were analyzed, and the morphophysiological changes of Microcystis were described in the present research. Results showed that total phosphorus, ammonia-nitrogen, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, conductivity and pH significantly affected the MCD, respectively, but water temperature was negatively correlated (p<0.01) with MCD. During the decline phase, Micro cystis cellular carbohydrate and protein contents decreased, and the large colonies ruptured into small ones which accelerated by raining interference. Meanwhile, most of Microcystis cells were dead, leaving only few living cells. Since water temperature (ranging from 26.4 to 29.3 degrees C) increased gradually and was higher than the suitable growth temperature for Microcystis in the whole experiment, it was concluded that short-term dynamics of Microcystis resulted from changes of multiple environmental parameters rather than the water temperature. Simultaneously, recruitment was considered to contribute little to the formation of Microcystis blooms in Xiangxi River for the remaining living cells which would further decay in the sediment during the over-wintering periods. The present study also demonstrated the convenience of using the in situ enclosures to study the eco-physiological changes of algae.																			1018-4619	1610-2304					2011	20	12					3226	3234																WOS:000299241800019
J	Shin, HS; Ahn, HS				Shin, HS; Ahn, HS			Simple, rapid, and sensitive determination of odorous compounds in water by GC-MS	CHROMATOGRAPHIA												A gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric method has been developed for rapid and sensitive determination of odorous compounds in water. The water sample (200 mL), at pH 6.5, was extracted with 1 mL pentane in a 250-mL separatory funnel. Fluorobenzene was added to the water sample as internal standard and the solution was mechanically shaken for 5 min and analyzed by GC-MS, with selected ion monitoring, without further concentration or purification steps. The peaks had good chromatographic properties and extraction of the compounds from water resulted in relatively high recoveries with small variations. The detection limits of the assay were 0.1 ng L-1 for 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine, 2-isobutyl-3-methoxypyrazine, 2-methylisoborneol, and geosmin, 0.5 ng L-1 for anisole, and 1.0 ng L-1 for 2,4,6-trichloroanisole and trans, trans-5-2,4-heptodienal. Turn-around time was one day for up to approximately 40 samples. The method is simple, convenient, and can be learned easily by relatively inexperienced personnel. It was used to analyze seven odorous compounds in water from Decheung-Lake in Korea, and raw and treated water originating from the same lake. In the summer of 2001 significant levels of anisole (up to 225 ng L-1) were observed, and geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol were detected at concentrations of up to 23.8 and 26.7 ng L-1, respectively. 2-Isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine, 2-isobutyl-3-methoxypyrazine, and trans,trans-2,4-heptadienal levels during that period were not significant. The method can used for simultaneous detection of several odorous compounds in water.																			0009-5893					JAN	2004	59	1-2					107	113		10.1365/s10337-003-0125-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1365/s10337-003-0125-4													WOS:000224099600016

Bivalve molluscs are effective bioindicators due to their benthic nature, their ability to filter water, and their capacity to bioaccumulate persistent pollutants. This study analyzes plasticizers and bisphenols in three native clam species (Ruditapes decussatus, Cerastoderma glaucum, and Polititapes aureus) from two Sicilian lagoons under different levels of anthropogenic pressure: the urbanized Capo Peloro lagoon (Ganzirri Lake) and the less impacted Oliveri-Tindari lagoon. The clams, together with water and sediment samples, were collected in winter 2023. Both groups of clams from the two sampling areas contained phthalates such as DMP, DEP, DiBP, and DEHP, as well as non-phthalate plasticizers such as DEHT, DBA, DEA, and DEHA. The sum of non-phthalate plasticizers (NPPs) was consistently higher than the sum of phthalates in all clam samples, confirming the emerging trend of NPPs. This trend was also observed in the water and sediment samples, regardless of the sampling area. The presence of structural analogues of bisphenol A (BPA) highlights the growing prevalence of BPA-like structures in aquatic environments. Given the increasing evidence of widespread and persistent contamination of aquatic environments by plasticizers and bisphenols, it is evident that these substances pose a significant threat to ecosystems and human health.

J	Wang, YH; Zhang, H				Wang, Yinghong; Zhang, Hui			Preliminary study on the impact of severe heat waves on dolostone weathering: implications for deterioration of carbonate rock-hewn heritage in SE China	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Climate change has led to many catastrophic events. In summer 2022, southern China witnessed a record-breaking heat wave. For example, Hangzhou, the capital city of Zhejiang Province (China), experienced a 2-month period of extreme hot weather. Rock outcrops exposed to strong solar radiation and high temperatures can experience rapid increase in temperature and repeated thermal cycles, which can affect the fabric and physical/mechanical properties of the rock and threaten the preservation of rock-hewn heritage. China has many examples of carbonate rock-hewn heritage with high historical and artistic value. Most are found in subtropical coastal areas with high heat and humidity, and where they might experience extreme high-intensity heat events in the future. Therefore, to study the impact of heat wave events on such examples of cultural heritage, a realistic heat wave aging test was performed in this study using samples of dolostone freshly quarried from near the West Lake Cultural Landscape of Hangzhou world heritage site. The nature of deterioration of the dolostone was evaluated using the capillary water absorption coefficient, surface hardness, and splitting tensile strength. The pore system of the dolostone samples was determined using the nitrogen adsorption method. Experimental results showed that the mechanical properties of the dolostone decreased moderately, while the water absorption capacity and porosity (micropores-mesopores) increased, indicating that high-temperature heating affects the physical and mechanical properties of dolostone to a certain extent. On the basis of the rapid rate of global warming and the increasingly frequent occurrence of extreme high-temperature events in China, the influence of thermal cycling on rock-hewn heritage deserves further attention.					wang, yinghong/IZJ-4099-2023; zhang, hui/GXH-6098-2022														1866-6280	1866-6299				APR	2024	83	7							209	10.1007/s12665-024-11519-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-024-11519-z													WOS:001190598100002

Inter-annual Variability of Snowfall in the Lower Peninsula of Michigan	FRONTIERS IN WATER												Winter snowfall, particularly lake-contributed snowfall, has a significant impact on the society and environment in the Great Lakes regions including transportation, tourism, agriculture, and ecosystem. Understanding the inter-annual variability of snowfall will provide sound basis for local community safety management and reduce its environmental impacts on agriculture and ecosystems. This study attempts to understand the trend and inter-annual variability in snowfall in the Lower Peninsula of Michigan (LPM) using statistical analysis based on snowfall measurements from eight weather stations. Our study demonstrates that snowfall has significantly increased from 1932 to 2015. Correlation analysis suggests that regional average air temperatures have a strong negative relationship with snowfall in the LPM. On average, approximately 27% of inter-annual variability in snowfall can be explained by regional average air temperatures. ENSO events are also negatively related to snowfall in the LPM and can explain ~8% of inter-annual variability. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) does not have strong influence on snowfall. Composite analysis demonstrates that on an annual basis, more snowfall occurs during the years with higher maximum ice cover (MIC) than during the years with lower MIC in Lake Michigan. Higher MIC is often associated with lower air temperatures which are negatively related to snowfall. This study could provide insight on future snow related climate model improvement and weather forecasting.																				2624-9375				NOV 3	2021	3								746354	10.3389/frwa.2021.746354	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/frwa.2021.746354													WOS:000719833900001

In terms of carbon, the territory is characterized by the high hydrothermal and volcanic activity of the South Aegean Active Volcanic Arc (SAAVA), and by widespread geological seeps of buried carbon dioxide and methane. In the present work, we investigate the island of Gyali located in the volcanic system Kos-Gyali-Nisyros. Nine gas samples have been collected on the island of Gyali in areas found both on land, in a small lake (similar to 2000 m(2)) along its beach, and in the sea close to the shore at shallow depths (<20 m). Results show that CO2 is the prevailing gas species with concentrations above 833,000 mu mol/mol, whilst minor enrichments in N-2 are noticed in some of the samples. Helium isotope ratio suggests an up to 70% mantle origin (considering a MOR type source) with the contribution of the atmospheric component being negligible, whereas C presents a mixed mantle-limestone origin with organic sediment being unimportant. Such isotope values fall in the range that characterizes the Kos-Gyali-Nisyros Volcanic Field. First estimations on the CO2 release suggest an output in the range from 18 to 28 t/d for Gyali Island, which is much lower than the total output of Kos similar to 75 t/d and Nisyros similar to 100 t/d. However, such results highlight that Gyali is an active system and, despite its small size, its degassing is not trivial.					; D'Alessandro, Walter/GQB-3978-2022; Daskalopoulou, Kyriaki/O-6669-2019; Gagliano, Antonina/AAZ-2160-2020; Longo, Manfredi/LZH-4682-2025; Calabrese, Sergio/H-9033-2013; pecoraino, giovannella/LZF-2682-2025	Giovannella, Pecoraino/0000-0001-5478-1912; Longo, Manfredi/0000-0002-9465-2653; Li Vigni, Lorenza/0000-0002-1223-6737; Daskalopoulou, Kyriaki/0000-0002-5637-2984; 													2038-1719	2038-1727				FEB	2021	140	1					16	28		10.3301/IJG.2020.18	http://dx.doi.org/10.3301/IJG.2020.18													WOS:000620931300002
J	Matthews, JA; Seppälä, M				Matthews, John A.; Seppala, Matti			Holocene colluvial chronology in a sub-arctic esker landscape at Kuttanen, Finnish Lapland: kettleholes as geo-ecological archives of interactions amongst fire, vegetation, soil, climate and geomorphological instability	BOREAS												Excavations were made in the colluvial deposits of seven kettleholes in a sandy esker at Kuttanen, northwestern Finnish Lapland. The Holocene history of forest fires and the associated colluvial activity initiated on the slopes of the kettleholes were reconstructed based on 131 radiocarbon dates from charcoal layers. These dates were supplemented by luminescence dating of colluvial sand layers. The first forest fires occurred approximate to 9000 years ago following the immigration of Pinus sylvestris about 1000 years after deglaciation. Evidence of forest fires and colluvial activity increased with the density of the pine forest, reaching a maximum during the Holocene Thermal Maximum between approximate to 8000 and 4000 cal. a BP, declining thereafter to a minimum in the last approximate to 500 years. This multimillennial-scale pattern corresponds with forest fires being triggered by lightning strikes during the warmest summer weather of the Holocene, which also produced heavy rain and slope wash from convective storms. The 50 forest fires identified over the Holocene indicate a long cycle in fire frequency of 1 in approximate to 200 years, which appears to reflect the average successional recovery time of the forest. Complex interactions amongst vegetation, fire and climate may account for little or no association between 23 centennial- to millennial-scale clusters of forest fires/colluvial events and Holocene temperature or precipitation anomalies. Buried podzols indicate five phases of soil formation and hence low levels of landscape disturbance. The kettleholes and their colluvial deposits therefore provide a unique geo-ecological archive that has led to new insights into the geo-ecological interactions that affect environmental change in the sub-arctic landscape.																			0300-9483	1502-3885				APR	2015	44	2					343	367		10.1111/bor.12107	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bor.12107													WOS:000351852200006

Opportunistic disease in yellow perch in response to decadal changes in the chemistry of oil sands-affected waters	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Oil sands-affected water from mining must eventually be incorporated into the reclaimed landscape or treated and released. However, this material contains petrogenic organic compounds, such as naphthenic acids and traces of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. This has raised concerns for impacts of oil sands process-affected waters on the heath of wildlife and humans downstream of receiving environments. The objective of this study was to evaluate the temporal association of disease states in fish with water chemistry of oil sands-affected waters over more than a decade and determine the pathogens associated with disease pathologies. Yellow perch (Perca flavescens) captured from nearby lakes were stocked into two experimental ponds during 1995-1997 and 2008-2010. South Bison Pond is a drainage basin that has received unextracted oil sands-contaminated material. Demonstration Pond is a constructed pond containing mature fine tailings capped with fresh water. Two disease pathologies, fin erosion for which a suspected bacterial pathogen (Acinerobacter Iwoffi) is identified, and lymphocystis (confirmed using a real-time PCR) were associated with oil sands-affected water exposure. From 1995 to 1997 pathologies were most prevalent in the South Bison Pond; however, from 2008 to 2009, disease was more frequently observed in the Demonstration Pond. CYP1A activity was 3-16 fold higher in fish from experimental ponds as compared to reference populations and this pattern was consistent across all sampling years. Bile fluorescence displayed a gradient of exposure with experimental ponds being elevated over local perch populations. Naphthenic acids decreased in the Bison Pond from approximately 12 mg/L to <4 mg/L while naphthenic acids increased in the Demonstration Pond from 6 mg/L to 12 mg/L due to tailings densification. Temporal changes in naphthenic acid levels, CYP1A activity and bile fluorescent metabolites correlate positively with incidence of disease pathologies whereas all inorganic water quality changes (major ions, pH, metals) were not associated with disease responses.

After cessation of the phreatomagmatic eruptions responsible for the maar creation, the maar was filled by the finely laminated sediments. The domatic rise of the Cerova vrchovina Upland motivated the erosional destruction of any relatively soft relief protuberance. The ring of the maar was partly destroyed and the sedimentary maar fill was swept out. Later on the emptied maar was filled by water. In the lake originated in this way sandy sediments and tuff were deposited together with the bones of mammals, killed by postvolcanic gas emanations, or tephra fall, when the animals drank the water of the lake. The age of the subzone MN 16a is 2.8-3.3 Ma BP (Fejfar & Heinrich 1987). The subzone corresponds to the middle part of the chron C2An. The maar originated earlier in the early period of the same chron, because the tuff has a normal magnetic polarity. It could not be generated before 3.55 Ma BP - that is the numerical age of the chron C2An/C2Ar, because the chron C2Ar lasting 0.6 Ma (3.55-4.15 Ma BP) was a period of the reverse polarity of the Earth's magnetic field. From the comparison of the age of the bone accumulation in the Hajnacka maar and the basalt lava flows of the Cerova Basalt Fm. it follows that effusive activity acted before both phases of the maar creation and its filling as well as after it.

J	Elliott, JM				Elliott, JM			Pools as refugia for brown trout during two summer droughts: trout responses to thermal and oxygen stress	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												In non-drought years (1977, 1985), temperatures and oxygen concentrations from 1 to 14 July at the deepest point in each of five pools in Wilfin Beck were similar with ranges of 12-18 degrees C and 7.8-9.8 mg l(-1). Trout Salmo trutta were present in all pools. In drought years (1976, 1983), temperature increased and oxygen concentration decreased as pool size decreased. In the two smallest pools, they were outside the thermal and oxygen limits for trout (ranges for both pools 24-29 degrees C, 1.2-2.5 mg l(-1)), and trout were absent. Values in a medium-sized pool were close to the incipient lethal levels and a few juvenile trout were present in both drought years. The lowest temperatures and highest oxygen concentrations were recorded in the two largest pools (ranges 20-25 degrees C, 3.6-4.8 mg l(-1)) and trout of all ages (0+ to adults) were present in both drought years. In these two pools, both temperature and oxygen concentration decreased from the surface to the deepest point in the pool. Trout preferred lower temperatures near the pool bottom rather than higher oxygen concentrations near the surface, but some fish moved towards the surface at night when the pool cooled slightly. These field results were discussed in relation to lethal values recorded for brown trout in the laboratory, and there was general agreement between field and laboratory values. Trout in the drought years occurred at temperatures close to, or below, the incipient lethal value of 24.7 degrees C (+/- 0.5) and also at the highest oxygen concentrations, but only when these were at temperatures below the incipient lethal value.

In this study, we investigated five well-preserved paleolake shoreline sequences, 15-27 m above the modern lake basin of the now-dry Manas Lake, a representative terminal lake in the Junggar Basin of arid Central Asia. Both single aliquot and single-grain K-feldspar postinfrared infrared stimulated luminescence (pIRIR) dating protocols were applied to 26 shoreline samples to reconstruct a lake level variation for Manas Lake over the past 90 kyr. The reliability of the K-feldspar pIRIR dating was tested through assessment of luminescence characteristics and comparison of single-grain and singlealiquot K-feldspar pIRIR Des. The results indicate that the highest water levels ( 25 m deep) occurred during late Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5 ( 80 ka) and MIS 3 (31-27 ka). A lake level 20 m above modern lake basin (a.m.l. b.) occurred from the last deglaciation to the early Holocene (14-10 ka) and again in the late Holocene (3.4-0.3 ka). The lake level changes of Manas Lake are decoupled from observed Westerlies precipitation changes over the past 90 kyr. This decoupling suggests enhanced glacial meltwater sourced from the high Tianshan Mountains, triggered by higher mean summer temperatures, worked together with Westerlies precipitation drove periods of lake level highstand in Manas Lake during late MIS 5, late MIS 3, and early Holocene periods.

In any particular year, most lakes were either in a macrophyte-dominated clear state or in a contrasting state with turbid water and sparse submerged macrophyte cover. Macrophyte dominance was positively related to the occurrence of drawdown, and negatively to lake surface area and mean depth. We did not find a relation with nutrient levels. Remarkably, shifts between the two contrasting states were common, and episodes of low water levels appear to be an important external driver. A dry period before our study and the exceptionally dry summer of 2003 caused widespread drawdown of floodplain lakes, resulting in establishment of submerged macrophytes in the next year upon refill. In the 4 years without drawdown, many lakes returned to a macrophyte-poor turbid state. Although some lakes turned turbid again quickly, others took several years to shift into the turbid state. A model analysis suggests that such prolonged transient vegetated states may be explained by the fact that the system dynamics slow down in the vicinity of the '' almost stable '' macrophyte-dominated state. Such a '' ghost '' of an equilibrium causes the system to stick around that state relatively long before slipping into the only true stable state. Our results support the idea that transient dynamics rather than equilibrium may be the key to understanding the overall state of some ecosystems. A practical implication of our findings is that artificial stabilization of the water level in shallow lakes may have been an important factor aggravating the permanent loss of submerged macrophytes due to cultural eutrophication.

J	Calcote, R				Calcote, R			Mid-Holocene climate and the hemlock decline:: the range limit of Tsuga canadensis in the western Great Lakes region, USA	HOLOCENE												Eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) expanded rapidly across Upper Peninsula Michigan from similar to6500 to 5500 cal. yr BP, followed by a sudden decline of hemlock pollen percentages that lasted over 1000 years. Hemlock declined throughout its range, apparently due to insect/pathogen outbreaks, which may have been affected by regional climatic shifts. Modem analogues were used to reconstruct submillennial climatic trends from fossil pollen sites spanning the western range limit of hemlock. Reconstructions from eight sites inside the range of hemlock at the time of the decline (5400 cal. yr BP) are compared with eight sites outside the range, which should be independent of variation in hemlock pollen percentages and the non-climatic effects of insects/pathogens. Expansion of hemlock before the decline occurred at a time of increasing precipitation and January temperature. Long-term precipitation averages stabilized at similar to5500 cal. yr BP and remained fairly constant throughout the period of low hemlock abundance. January temperature reconstructions decrease at the time of the hemlock decline to approximately modem values at sites inside the range, as well as at oak-dominated sites just outside the range. The lower-than-modern precipitation of the mid-Holocene may have reduced hemlock's tolerance for cold stress and winter desiccation and perhaps increased its susceptibility to insects or pathogens. January temperature reconstructions for pine-dominated sites outside the pre-decline hemlock range show little change, possibly due to the insensitivity of pine-dominated pollen assemblages to small climatic fluctuations. Hemlock began a new expansion across the region after 4000 cal. yr BP as July temperature decreased and precipitation increased.																			0959-6836						2003	13	2					215	224		10.1191/0959683603hl608rp	http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683603hl608rp													WOS:000181279000006

We analyzed the movement and ablation patterns of icebergs at an ice-contact lake at Pasterze Glacier, Austria, using time-lapse images. Iceberg evolution was quantified for two timescales and related to meteorological as well as glacier ablation data from the adjacent glacier tongue. On a multiyear scale, ablation and movement of one iceberg (IB1) was monitored during a twenty-five-month period. On a single-day scale, the movement paths of eighty-four icebergs were tracked over 16 hours. Results for IB1 revealed an average iceberg ablation of 72 mm d-1 from June to September and no winter ablation. Iceberg ablation rates rose over time, explained by a rising surface area-to-volume ratio. Monitoring lake-wide iceberg movement for one day shows that a persistent katabatic glacier wind and a valley wind are the main influences on horizontal iceberg movement. Iceberg velocity is roughly 0.6 percent of the wind velocity. The existence of a wind-driven current on the lake surface is proposed. Sudden changes in movement rates, which are not explained by wind data, suggest that iceberg grounding is common. This study provides insight into iceberg melt rates in the absence of wave erosion.					; Kellerer-Pirklbauer, Andreas/JRX-7607-2023	Kellerer-Pirklbauer, Andreas/0000-0002-2745-3953; Hynek, Bernhard/0009-0001-7705-0001													1523-0430	1938-4246				DEC 31	2024	56	1							2367778	10.1080/15230430.2024.2367778	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15230430.2024.2367778													WOS:001280694000001

To examine the habitat selection mechanism of cranes in this area, two natural wetland reserves, Shengjin Lake and Poyang Lake, which are the main habitats of typical cranes, were selected as the study area. Using 20 years of Landsat satellite image data (between 1999 and 2019), the vegetation cover index was calculated from a pixel dichotomy model, and the landscape pattern index was obtained through Fragstats. The entropy method was adopted to determine the weight of the landscape index, and then, the habitat suitability index was calculated. Combined with the number of typical crane populations in the reserve, the selection mechanism of overwintering habitat of cranes was revealed. On the change of land-use type, the crane habitat of Shengjin Lake transferred more to non-crane habitat, and other land types increased, resulting in the decrease of crane habitat area. However, the change of crane habitat in Poyang Lake Reserve was small, so it can accommodate more cranes to overwintering here. In terms of vegetation coverage, most of the vegetation cover areas of Shengjin Lake were woodland near or far from the lake, but the woodland was not the habitat of cranes. Most of the vegetation-covered areas of Poyang Lake are grassland near the lake, which provide rest and foraging places for cranes. In the landscape pattern, the number of landscape patches in Shengjin Lake was large, the degree of landscape fragmentation was higher than that in Poyang Lake, the landscape complexity was higher, and the landscape diversity was simpler. This is not conducive to the maintenance of crane habitat, but also reduces the attractiveness of overwintering cranes, while the landscape suitability of crane habitat in Poyang Lake was higher than that in Shengjin Lake, and cranes were more likely to choose Poyang Lake as their overwintering habitat.

J	GRIFFITHS, RW				GRIFFITHS, RW			ENVIRONMENTAL-QUALITY ASSESSMENT OF THE ST-CLAIR RIVER AS REFLECTED BY THE DISTRIBUTION OF BENTHIC MACROINVERTEBRATES IN 1985	HYDROBIOLOGIA												A benthic macroinvertebrate and sediment chemistry study of the St. Clair River from Lake Huron to Lake St. Clair was conducted in the spring of 1985. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the environmental quality of the nearshore areas and assess the effectiveness of industrial and municipal abatement programs that have been implemented since 1977. A total of 112 macroinvertebrate taxa was collected from the river. Classification analysis indicated that 7 macroinvertebrate communities were evident in the river. Discriminant analysis suggested that physical habitat characteristics explained the distribution of 4 benthic communities, while sediment contaminants explained the distribution of 3 benthic communities. These analyses showed that the environmental quality of a 12 km stretch of the river along the Canadian shoreline had been degraded, probably by industrial waste discharges and spills. Toxic conditions were evident along the waterfront of Dow Chemical Canada Inc., probably a result of the combined effects of chlorinated organics, oils and greases, and mercury (historical contaminant) in the sediments. In contrast, the invertebrate fauna throughout the remainder of the St. Clair River reflected meso-eutrophic conditions, typical of a large, unstressed river. A comparison of the environmental quality as reflected by the benthic invertebrate fauna in 1985 with that in 1977 suggests that the abatement programs implemented over the past decade have improved the environmental quality along the Canadian side of the river. The total length of river adversely affected by waste discharges from Canadian industries and municipalities decreased from 21 km in 1977 to 12 km in 1985.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL 26	1991	219						143	164		10.1007/BF00024752	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00024752													WOS:A1991GK03100010

In situ enclosure experiments were performed in the mesotrophic Bermejales reservoir to evaluate the algal response to changes in the nutrient supply and in the zooplankton size structure and density in a 2 x 2 factorial design. The experiments were conducted during the spring bloom of nanoplanktonic diatoms in 1989. 2. Nutrient enrichment promoted a great increase of phytoplankton biomass indicating a strong nutrient limitation on phytoplankton growth. Total phytoplankton biomass was significantly lower in the Daphnia-added enclosures at a given nutrient level and strong direct an indirect effect of zooplankton on phytoplankton community structure and nutrient availability were observed. 3. Most of the nanoplanktonic species were effectively grazed but species with protective coverings and large size colonies were favoured by grazers and small chlorococcales were unaffected probably because of their compensatory high growth rates. The decrease in total biomass imposed by grazers is attributable mainly to the decrease of Cyclotella ocellata, the most abundant species. This taxon suffers two net effects of zooplankton: direct grazing and the indirect decrease of Si availability caused by the growth of C. ocellata which was promoted by P excretion by zooplankton. Indirect effects of grazers on Si availability should, therefore, be taken into account in explaining phytoplankton succession and community structure. 4. In this experiment grazers affected considerably the nanoplanktonic community in Bermejales reservoir. The extent which they were affected, however, depended not only on the algal size as a determinant of edibility but also greatly on the specific nutrient requirements and taxonomic features of the algal species.

The sedimentary facies record is analyzed to reconstruct the lake's depositional history and to disentangle the combined signal of climatic and geothermal factors. The facies succession comprises: a lake-fringe elastic apron shed from the maar walls; early-stage, coarse-grained tuffaceous deposits of the lake proper, intercalated with brecciated mudstones and limestones; and final-stage, fine-grained tuffaceous deposits of the lake proper, intercalated with peats and plant-bearing clastics and with some terminal travertines. The closed lake was highly dependent on climate, particularly precipitation, and the depositional conditions were further controlled by a connective hydrothermal system which itself was driven by the input of meteoric water. The associated heat flow played an important role by creating a microclimatic niche, where even the impoverished late-Quaternary (cold regional climate) vegetation could flourish and form substantial peats. The varying hydrological budget of the lake was the main ''switching'' mechanism for the peat-forming conditions, with two water-depth thresholds involved. If the lake level rose too high, the low vegetation was drowned and hemipelagic elastic sedimentation prevailed. If the lake level fell too low, the vegetation was killed and formation of travertine took place. The heat flow through the pore water and elastic sediments was crucial to the high maturation of the peat deposits.																			0037-0738					JAN	1995	94	3-4					255	266		10.1016/0037-0738(94)00092-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0037-0738(94)00092-9													WOS:A1995QC42200006
J	Dean, WE; Doner, LA				Dean, Walter E.; Doner, Lisa A.			A Holocene record of endogenic iron and manganese precipitation and vegetation history in a lake-fen complex in northwestern Minnesota	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Little Shingobee Lake and Fen are part of the extensive network of lakes and wetlands in the Shingobee River headwaters of northwestern Minnesota, designed to study the interactions between surface and ground waters. Prior to about 11.2 cal. ka, most of these lakes and wetlands were interconnected to form glacial Lake Willobee, which apparently formed when a debris flow dammed the Shingobee River. Between 11.2 and 8.5 cal. ka, the level of Lake Willobee fell as a result of breaching of the dam, transforming the deep lake into the existing lakes and wetlands. Analyses of a 9-m core from Little Shingobee Lake (LSL-B), and lacustrine sediments under 3.3 m of peat in a 17-m core from Little Shingobee Fen (LSF-10), show that the dominant components are allogenic clastic material, and endogenic CaCO(3) and organic matter. In both cores almost all of the iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) are incorporated in endogenic minerals, presumed to be X-ray amorphous oxyhydroxide minerals, that occur in significant quantities throughout the cores; almost no Fe and Mn are contributed from detrital aluminosilicate minerals. This suggests that, for most of the Holocene, the allogenic watershed contributions to lake chemistry were minor compared to the dissolved mineral load. In addition, prior to 3.5 cal. ka, pollen zone boundaries coincide with large changes in lake-sediment mineralogy, indicating that both landscape and climate processes were linked to early- and mid-Holocene lake chemistry. The pollen time series, with sequential domination by spruce, pine, sagebrush-oak, birch-oak and, finally, white pine is typical of the region and reflects the changing location of the prairie-forest transition zone over time. These changes in vegetation had some profound effects on the geochemistry of the lake waters.

A 60-50 ka African Humid Period modulated by stadial Heinrich events HE6 and HE5a in northwestern Africa	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												A Late Pleistocene lacustrine sedimentary succession has recently been discovered and investigated in Northwest Africa (Morocco, Anti-Atlas, Agadir-Tissint Feija). By integrating new radiometric 230Th/U and OSL ages and new clay mineral analyses with previous sedimentological evidence, we significantly refine the origin and the timing of this succession and its significance for African paleoenvironments and paleoclimate. The sedimentary succession reflects the evolution of a paleolake, referred to as paleolake Tissint, that indicates the abrupt establishment of a wet period at similar to 60 ka and a gradual return to drier conditions at similar to 50 ka. Establishment of this paleolake coincides with a peak of precession-forced high summer insolation centered around similar to 60 ka suggesting that orbital parameters triggered humid conditions in northwest Africa during this time interval. Comparing this observation with others from the literature, it appears that continental-scale wet conditions prevailed across North, Central and East Africa at that time and add evidence in support of a 60-50 ka African Humid Period (AHP). Given that the Holocene African Humid Period was associated with "Green Sahara" conditions, wet conditions between 60 and 50 ka likely sustained coeval greening, at least partially, of the Sahara region. In northwest Africa, the 60-50 ka AHP is affected by Heinrich Event HE6 which via adjustment of the Atlantic Meridional Ocean Circulation (AMOC) seems to have delayed the onset of this AHP. In a similar way, the younger Heinrich Event 5a resulted in short-term regional aridification about 55 ka ago that briefly interrupted the generally wetter period. Finally, as the AHP between similar to 60 ka and similar to 50 ka coincides with a major Human dispersal out of Africa; these particular conditions may have offered a climatic window of opportunity for Homo sapiens to open migration routes across Africa towards the Levant.

Morphological and population changes of the cockle Cerastoderma glaucum in Lake Qarun, Egypt, may be driven by accelerated environmental deterioration	JOURNAL OF TAIBAH UNIVERSITY FOR SCIENCE												The cockle Cerastoderma glaucum represents a significant element of the benthic community in Lake Qarun, Egypt. The population of this species has severely declined in the lake. For stock position assessment, cockles were collected in the winter of 2008 and 2018. The body size (length-frequency) distributions considerably varied among the collections. A single peak at 14 mm was present in 2008, and two peaks appeared ten years later (one at 13mm and another at 19 mm). The total weight, shell weight and flesh weight of individuals collected in 2008 exhibited isometric increase with shell length (SL). For samples collected in 2018, flesh weight increase was slower than shell length, indicating negative allometric growth. When 50% of the population achieved maturity (SM50), their sizes were 7.7 and 7.4 mm of SL for 2008 and 2018 collections, respectively, consistent with the sexual maturity being related to size rather than age. The overall sex ratios did not significantly differ from unity (1:1). The results of this study suggest that the species is sensitive to salinity changes and water pollution, with larger individuals being more resistant than the smaller ones. This may have implications for species' long-term reproduction and density.																			1658-3655					JAN 1	2021	15	1					1068	1077		10.1080/16583655.2021.2017583	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/16583655.2021.2017583													WOS:000737552600001

The average oxidation efficiencies of BOD and COD were low (16% and 36%, respectively), compared with TOC analysis. Weakly positive correlations could be observed between TOC vs. BOD (r = 0.64) and TOC vs. CODMn (r = 0.66) in the upper layer, whereas significant correlations were not observed in the middle and deep layers of the water column. In the upper layer, CODMn was more strongly correlated with particulate organic carbon (POC) than with dissolved organic carbon (DOC), even though DOC is ten times more abundant than POC. This might imply that DOC in the take is more resistant to permanganate oxidation than POC. The oxidation efficiency of BOD, an indicator of biodegradability, varied among water layers (upper > deep > middle layer). The lower efficiency in the middle layer may be due to an input of recalcitrant allochthonous organic matter during the summer monsoon, when water is known to flow into this layer of the lake. The oxidation efficiency of CODMn also varied significantly by water layer (upper congruent to middle > deep layer). Because of poor and variable oxidation efficiencies, BOD and CODMn measured at any particular time or location should be used with caution as indices of organic matter content in takes.																			1040-2381	2151-5530				JUN	2004	20	2					130	140		10.1080/07438140409354357	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140409354357													WOS:000222768300004

We adopted a sedimentary analysis of the sediment crust from the landward to the coastal ridge in winter 2020. Land cover/land use (LCLU) assessment was based on different Remote Sensing (RS) data-scenes of Landsat 5 and 8 for the years 1972-1984-1985-1994-2010 and 2020, completed by the aerial scenes (1974s) and the K-means clustering. In coastal area, grain size distributions show medium to fine sand, well-sorted and which are mostly unimodal. The sabkha crust distribution reveals silty-clay logarithmic-shaped facies of turbidite channel deposit in shallow-water calm environment. The change detection of LC between 1985 and 2020 reveals a decrease of vegetation classes by similar to 27%, the sandy deposit by 7% and an increasing trend by 15% and 22% of bare soil and the urban areas, respectively. Diachronic assessment of the sabkha landscape from 1972 to 2020 datasets revealed the expansion of the salt-flat crust from 19 to 27 ha. Both the global aridification and the urbanization impacted the natural dynamics of the coastal sabkha, resulting in decreasing trend of the vegetation covers and natural features in favor of the salt flats and urban spaces.

J	ELSER, JJ; CARPENTER, SR				ELSER, JJ; CARPENTER, SR			PREDATION-DRIVEN DYNAMICS OF ZOOPLANKTON AND PHYTOPLANKTON COMMUNITIES IN A WHOLE-LAKE EXPERIMENT	OECOLOGIA												1. Species compositions of zooplankton and phytoplankton were followed in Tuesday Lake [Michigan, USA] before and after experimental manipulation of its fish populations (addition of piscivorous largemouth bass, removal of planktivorous minnows). Plankton dynamics were compared to those of adjacent, unmanipulated Paul Lake, where piscivorous fish have been dominant historically. 2. Indices of similarity for the zooplankton communities in the two lakes in 1984 prior to the manipulation were low; however, following the manipulation in spring, 1985, similarity of the zooplankton in the two lakes rose considerably and remained high throughout 1986. This was the result of an increase in Tuesday Lake of previously rare large-bodied cladocerans (Daphnia pulex, Holopedium gibberum) which were the dominants in Paul Lake, and the disappearance in Tuesday Lake of the dominant small-bodied copepod Tropocyclops prasinus, a minor component of the Paul Lake zooplankton. These observations are consistent with prior observations of the effects of size-selective predation on zooplankton communities. 3. Phytoplankton communities also responded strongly to the manipulation, with similarity indices for the two lakes rising from low levels in 1984 to high levels of similarity in 1985 and 1986, reflecting the decrease of formerly dominant Tuesday Lake taxa which were unimportant in Paul Lake and the appearance or increase in Tuesday Lake of several taxa characteristic of the Paul Lake phytoplankton assemblage. These results clearly show that food web structure can have pronounced effects on community composition at all levels of the food web, and that, just as zooplankton communities are structured by size-selective predation, phytoplankton communities are structured by herbivory. These observations may provide some insight into factors governing the complex distributions of phytoplankton species among various lakes.

The raw data of the rare animals' habitat areas and the monitoring data are usually in large scale and isolated without any semantic information when to comprehensive analyze. In this paper, we introduce the linked data concept to the knowledge for the biologists to reveal the relationship between ecological environment and biological diversity by the semantic analysis. Our key idea is the notion of linking different raw sources via spatial-temporal continuum based on migration habitats discovered by agglomerative clustering with biologic semantic analysis of the linked biotope data. The first step is to derive the habitats by clustering, and then to link the raw data, at last, to analyze the biological significance based on the linked data. One of our results is the clustering areas, an illusive map depicting the breeding and wintering home range of monitored birds, and the other is the linked data platform based on the clustered habitats, and the linked data sets includes the census data of waterfowl and plant, meteorological data, remote sensing data, video data and so on, the core result is the semantic analysis chart which reveal the interaction of species and environment.																					978-1-60595-198-0				2014							143	156																WOS:000351916000018

The depth of Lake Windermere fluctuated by about 7 m during this study (1982-1988); however, fluctuations up to 15 m were observed between 1970 and 1988. Lake Windermere is exposed to wind mixing, is transparent and is usually mixed, or only weakly stratified. Lake McKenzie is semi-perched, darkly coloured and strongly stratified with an anoxic hypolimnion during summer. It is about one fifth of the surface area and half the depth of Lake Windermere and protected from wind mixing. Both lakes are acidic and have low salinity, and the dominant ions are sodium and chloride probably from precipitation of marine aerosols. Oxygen depletion in the hypolimnion of both lakes indicates a substantial organic load, the source of which is allochthonous material from the catchment rather than autochthonous material. Lake Windermere had higher densities of zooplankton (mostly Calamoecia tasmanica) than Lake McKenzie, but the latter lake had higher numbers of the predaceous Chaoborus sp. Lake McKenzie had higher invertebrate densities than Lake Windermere and these fluctuated widely between years, corresponding with variation in rainfall. Mayflies and chironomids were numerically dominant in Lake McKenzie, and caddisflies and chironomids were numerically dominant in Lake Windermere. Turtle and odonate predators were more common in Lake McKenzie than in Lake Windermere. It is postulated that biological interactions are more important in shaping the communities in Lake McKenzie and physical factors such as wave action are more important in Lake Windermere.

The lake was sharply stratified during the summer and was anaerobic below a depth of 3 m. Large concentrations (4000 .mu.mol/l) of dissolved CH4 were detected in the bottom waters. A CH4 concentration maximum occurred at 4 m above the sediment. The production of 14CH4 from 14C-labeled HCOOH, HCO3- and CH3OH and [2-14C]acetate demonstrated microbial methanogenesis in the water column of the lake. The maximum rate of methanogenesis calculated from reduction of H14CO3- by endogenous electron donors in the surface sediment (depth, 22 m) was 7.6 nmol/h per 10 ml and in the water column (depth, 21 m) was 0.6 nmol/h per 10 ml. The methyl group of acetate was simultaneously metabolized to CH4 and CO2 in the anaerobic portions of the lake. Acetate oxidation was greatest in surface waters and decreased with water depth. Acetate was metabolized primarily to methane in the sediments and water immediately above the sediment. Sulfide inhibition studies and temperature activity profiles demonstrated that acetate metabolism was performed by several microbial populations. Sulfide additions (less than 5 .mu.g/ml) to water from 21.5 m stimulated methanogenesis from acetate, but inhibited CO2 production. Sulfate addition (1 mM) had no significant effect on acetate metabolism in water from 21.5 m, while nitrate additions (10-14,000 .mu.g/l) completely inhibited methanogenesis and stimulated CO2 formation.																			0099-2240	1098-5336					1979	37	2					213	221		10.1128/AEM.37.2.213-221.1979	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.37.2.213-221.1979								434805					WOS:A1979GJ97100007

We used lake, river, and spring water samples. The density of genetically engineered and wild-type P. putida decreased rapidly within 5 days (population change rate k -0.87 approximately -1.00 day-1), then moderately after 5 to 28 days (-0.10 approximately -0.14 day-1). The population change rates of genetically engineered and wild-type P. putida were not significantly different. We studied the important factors affecting the survival of genetically engineered and wild-type P. putida introduced in aquatic microcosms. Visible light exerted an adverse effect on the survival of the two strains. The densities of genetically engineered and wild-type P. putida were almost constant until 7 days after inoculation in natural water filtered with a 0.45-mum membrane filter, or treated with cycloheximide to inhibit the growth of protozoa. These results suggested that protozoan predation was one of the most important factors for the survival of two strains. We examined the impact of the addition of genetically engineered and wild-type P. putida on indigenous bacteria and protozoa. Inoculation of genetically engineered or wild-type P. putida had no apparent effect on the density of indigenous bacteria. The density of protozoa increased in microcosms inoculated with genetically engineered or wild-type P. putida at 3 days after inoculation, but after 5 to 21 days, the density of protozoa decreased to the same level as the control microcosms.																			0916-8451	1347-6947				AUG	1993	57	8					1264	1269		10.1271/bbb.57.1264	http://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.57.1264								7764012					WOS:A1993LV69800007
J	Jenniskens, P; Devillepoix, HAR				Jenniskens, Peter; Devillepoix, Hadrien A. R.			Review of asteroid, meteor, and meteorite-type links	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE												With the goal to determine the origin of our meteorites in the asteroid belt, video and photographic observations of meteors have now tracked 75 meteorite falls. Six years ago, there were just hints that different meteorite types arrived on different orbits, but now, the number of orbits (N) is high enough for distinct patterns to emerge. In general, 0.1-1-m sized meteoroids do not arrive on similar orbits as the larger similar to 1-km sized near-Earth asteroids (NEA) of corresponding taxonomic class. Unlike larger NEA, a group of H chondrite meteoroids arrived on low-inclined orbits from a source just beyond the 5:2 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter (N = 12), three of which have the 7 Ma cosmic ray exposure (CRE) age from a significant collision event among H chondrites. There is also a source of H chondrites low in the inner main belt with a similar to 35 Ma CRE age (N = 8). In contrast, larger H-like taxonomic S-class NEA arrive from high-inclined orbits out of the 3:1 resonance. Some H chondrites do so also, four of which have a 6 Ma CRE age and two have an 18 Ma CRE age. L chondrites arrive from a single source low in the inner main belt, mostly via the nu 6 secular resonance (N = 21), not the 3:1 resonance as most L-like NEA do. LL chondrites arrive too from the inner main belt (N = 5), as do larger LL-like NEA. CM chondrites are delivered from a low i < 3 degrees inclined source beyond the 3:1 resonance (N = 4). Source asteroid families for these meteorite types are proposed, many of which have the same CRE age as the asteroid family's dynamical age. Also, two HED achondrites are now traced to specific impact craters on asteroid Vesta.

Lake sturgeon population attributes and reproductive structure in the Namakan Reservoir, Minnesota and Ontario	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												Quantified were the age, growth, mortality and reproductive structure of lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) collected in the US and Canadian waters of the Namakan Reservoir. The hypotheses were tested that (i) age and growth of lake sturgeon in the Namakan Reservoir would differ by sex and reproductive stage of maturity, and (ii) that the relative strength of year-classes of lake sturgeon in the reservoir would be affected by environmental variables. To quantify age, growth and mortality of the population, existing data was used from a multi-agency database containing information on all lake sturgeon sampled in the reservoir from 2004 to 2009. Lake sturgeon were sampled in the Minnesota and Ontario waters of the Namakan Reservoir using multi-filament gillnets 1.8 m high and 30100 m long and varying in mesh size from 178 to 356 mm stretch. Reproductive structure of the lake sturgeon was assessed only during spring 2008 and 2009 using plasma testosterone and estradiol-17 beta concentrations. Ages of lake sturgeon >75 cm ranged from 9 to 86 years (n = 533, mean = 36 years). A catch-curve analysis using the 19811953 year classes estimated total annual mortality of adults to be 4.8% and annual survival as 95.2%. Using logistic regression analysis, it was found that total annual precipitation was positively associated with lake sturgeon year-class strength in the Namakan Reservoir. A 10 cm increase in total annual precipitation was associated with at least a 39% increase in the odds of occurrence of a strong year class of lake sturgeon in the reservoir. Plasma steroid analysis revealed a sex ratio of 2.4 females: 1 male and, on average, 10% of female and 30% of male lake sturgeon were reproductively mature each year (i.e. potential spawners). Moreover, there was evidence based on re-captured male fish of both periodic and annual spawning, as well as the ability of males to rapidly undergo gonadal maturation prior to spawning. Knowledge of lake sturgeon reproductive structure and factors influencing recruitment success contribute to the widespread conservation efforts for this threatened species.

Many PCB congeners were found at elevated levels, and biomagnification was apparent in all congeners but was more predominant in congeners with relatively high octanol-water partition coefficients (log K(ow) > 6.0). PCA analysis suggested that most PCB congeners had similar distributions in the Lake Erie food web, although congeners with very high Kows and coplanar congeners IUPAC # 77, 126, and 169 were found to have different distributions. Non-parametric statistics were used to determine if significant differences in concentration of selected PCB congeners existed among species and among tissues. Congener 126 was found primarily in benthic fish and top predators, whereas there was no significant differences in the concentrations of congener 77 in fish species of the benthic and pelagic food web. Congener 169 was found at very low concentrations in the food web of Lake Erie. There were also significant differences in concentrations of coplanar PCBs among liver, egg, and muscle tissues, but trends were not consistent among all the species examined. As significant differences were observed in the distribution of PCB congeners in the Lake Erie food web ''total PCB'' might not be an adequate estimation of the toxicological hazards associated with PCB accumulation. It is evident that the dynamics of individual congeners, in particular the coplanar PCBs, need to be accurately assessed in order to predict the environmental hazard of PCBs.																			0380-1330						1994	20	1					260	270		10.1016/S0380-1330(94)71145-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(94)71145-X													WOS:A1994NL34800020

The Toba Caldera is an interesting area that forms a unique, spectacular landscape and is a popular international tourist destination. This caldera has become an important Indonesian tourism icon, and a plan is being developed with respect to sustainable development within the vicinity. The authors prepared an educational outreach event consisting of class and field presentations to residents of the Lake Toba area. The course covered the evolution of the Toba Caldera and its relationship to Samosir Island, part of a resurgent dome complex (Chesner 2011). A comprehensive survey indicated that approximately 67% of the local residents and students in the course understood the geological implications of the Toba area. This number indicates a very rapid increase, when compared to 11% of those individuals who understood the volcanic geology aspect before they entered the education program. Fortunately, soon after learning the material, the residents and the students demonstrated an eagerness to preserve the Toba Caldera geoheritage site (i.e., to protect the fossil geosites and/or become involved as geotourism guides). This attitude can be considered as the key factor for the success of Toba's geoheritage preservation, which is dependent on the awareness of local communities and their appreciation towards geoconservation, especially at fossil outcrop locations. Fossil outcrops are so important because of their limited distribution and they usually were preserved in a soft rock/formation. Another finding of this study is that 53% of the participants (most of them are young boys) became interested in geotourism guide services after learning the evolution of the Toba Caldera, citing a desire to be involved in the Toba caldera geopark program's success. In response to the positive impact the program had on the participants, the authors assisted them in developing a responsibility to protect the geoheritage of Toba Caldera from any disrupters. In addition to the study, the authors produced a geoheritage map that displays 36 geosites. Moreover, for further advancement of public education programs, some written materials will be prepared, such as leaflets, posters, and geotourism guidelines.

Combined probability density functions of high- and low-activity dates were used to detect time intervals of different palaeohydrological status. After low fluvial activity during LGM, two palaeohydrological epochs were designated: extremely high activity in the end of MIS 2 (ca. 18-11.7 ka before CE 2000-b2k), and much lower activity in the Holocene. Within the Holocene, two hierarchical levels of hydroclimatic variability were designated according to their duration and magnitude - regional palaeohydrological phases ( centuries to few millennia) and regional palaeofluvial episodes (decades to few centuries). Tendency is rather clear of activity lowering in the first half and rise in the second half of the Holocene. Extremes within the palaeohydrological phases were designated as 19 palaeofluvial episodes: 7 high activity HA-episodes, 8 low activity (stability) LA-episodes and 4 contrast, or complex, CA-episodes. In most cases changes of fluvial activity were most likely induced by changing amounts of spring snowmelt runoff. Most distinct correlation of temperature and hydrological regimes was found in the Late Holocene: high fluvial activity corresponded to cold climatic phases (Little Ice Age), low activity, to warm phases (Medieval Climatic Optimum, current climate warming). The suggested fluvial chronology was compared with independent hydroclimatic archives such as palaeosoils and lake levels. Correlation with soil formation/alluviation epochs was found very close, with some exceptions in the Early Holocene. Correspondence of fluvial activity to the Caspian Sea level changes is rather high in the second part of the Holocene and is poor before 4-5 ka b2k, which can be explained by insufficient data behind both types of reconstructions. Correlation of changes in fluvial activity within a west-east transect over Europe revealed relatively poor correlation in the Early and Mid Holocene and much higher synchronism since 3.0 ka b2k, which may indicate increasing role of westerlies in controlling European climates in the Late Holocene. Throughout the whole Holocene, changes of fluvial activity over EEP were governed by natural climate forcing until the last few centuries when land use changes induced accelerated hillslope and gully erosion.

Mead provides an opportunity to establish a more accurate itinerary of his exploration of Colorado that summer. The provenance of Mead's manuscripts, including this journal, is summarized. The history of Mead's expedition and the subsequent distribution of his butterfly specimens are reviewed. Despite the general belief that Mead participated in the Wheeler Survey, there is no evidence to support this claim. Information is presented on three significant localities where Mead collected butterfly type specimens: Kenosha House (figured and mapped), Turkey Creek Junction (=Bradford Junction; figured and mapped), and Twin Lakes (mapped). Based on Mead's actual whereabouts, type localities are clarified for 19 nominal taxa: Pamphila colorado Scudder, Pamphila nevada Scudder, Hesperia dacotah W. H. Edwards, Hesperia napa W H.

Based on the lectotype and type locality of P. colorado, Hesperia comma oroplata Scott should be treated as a synonym. The type locality of M. eurytion is fixed through a lectotype designation and the conceptual history of this nominal taxon is explored. Events related to the selection of the lectotype of L. melissa are reviewed in detail.																			0024-0966					MAR 6	2015	69	1					1	38																WOS:000350836600001

We studied the in situ partitioning of Hg in the organic top layer (mor) of podsols at two boreal forest sites differing in Hg deposition and climatic regime (S. and N. Sweden, with pollution declining to the north). Soil solution leaching from the mor layer was repeatedly sampled using zero-tension lysimeters over 2 years, partly in parallel with tension lysimeters. Concentrations of Hg and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were higher while pH was lower at the southern site (means +/- SD: Hg=44 +/- 15 ng L-1, DOC=63.0 +/- 31.3 mg L-1, pH=4.05 +/- 0.53) than at the northern site (Hg=22 +/- 6 ng L-1, DOC=41.8 +/- 12.1 mg L-1, pH=4.28 +/- 0.43). There was a positive correlation over time between dissolved Hg and DOC at both sites, even though the DOC concentration peaked during autumn at both sites, while the Hg concentration remained more constant. This correlation is consistent with the expected strong association of Hg with organic matter and supports the use of Hg/C ratios in assessments of Hg mobility. In the solid phase of the overlying O-f layer, both Hg concentrations and Hg/C ratios were higher at the southern site (means +/- SD: 0.34 +/- 0.06 mu g g(-1) dw and 0.76 +/- 0.14 mu g g(-1) C, respectively) than at the northern site (0.31 +/- 0.05 mu g g(-1) dw and 0.70 +/- 0.12 mu g g(-1) C, respectively). However, concentrations in the solid phase differed less than might be expected from the difference in current atmospheric input, suggesting that the fraction of natural Hg is still substantial. At both sites, Hg/C ratios in the upper half of the mor layer were only about two thirds of those in the lower half, suggesting that the recent decrease in anthropogenic Hg deposition onto the soil is offset by a natural downward enrichment of Hg due to soil decomposition or other processes. Most interestingly, comparison with soil leachate showed that the average Hg/C ratios in the dissolved phase of the mor layers at both sites did not differ from the average Hg/C ratios in the overlying solid organic matter. These results indicate a simple mobilisation with negligible fractionation, despite differences in Hg deposition patterns, soil chemistry and climatic regimes. Such a straight-forward linkage between Hg and organic matter greatly facilitates the parameterisation of watershed models for assessing the biogeochemical fate, toxic effect and critical level of atmospheric Hg input to forest soils.

J	Reitner, B; Herzig, A; Herndl, GJ				Reitner, B; Herzig, A; Herndl, GJ			Microbial activity under the ice cover of the shallow Neusiedler See (Austria, Central Europe)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												In an attempt to assess bacterioplankton production and growth yield under low temperature conditions and to compare bacterioplankton with phytoplankton production in the ice-covered water column of the shallow Neusiedler See, outdoor measurements under near in situ conditions were performed during the winter of 1995/96. During the investigation period, mean chlorophyll (Chl) a concentration was 21.03+/-14.95 mu g Chlal(-1). Phytoplankton primary production integrated over the water column ranged from 1.35 to 4.23 mg C m(-2) d(-1) (mean +/- SD = 2.46 +/- 1.06 mg C m(-2) d(-1)). Bacterial abundance varied from 20 to 40 x 10(5) ml(-1) for most of the investigation period and increased by the end of March concomitantly with the increase in temperature from 1.3 to 6.3 degrees C within 5 days. Mean bacterial production was 15.3 +/- 12.8 mu g C l(-1) d(-1) (range: 3.0 to 41.7 mu g C l(-1) d(-1)) and mean bacterial growth rate 0.23 +/- 0.16 d(-1) following closely the pattern in bacterial production. DOC concentration declined linearly from 20.7 mg C l(-1) to 16.45 mg C l(-1) over the 4 months period of ice cover. The contribution of humic substances to the total DOC pool declined from 43.6% at the end of November to 37.3% at the end of March. Calculated on an area basis, phytoplankton production amounted to only 16% of bacterial production which makes it unlikely that phytoplankton supply substrate for bacterioplankton growth in significant quantities when the lake is ice covered. From the observed decline in DOC over the investigation period and assuming only negligible input of DOC from other sources we calculated an average DOC uptake by the bacterioplankton community of 47.5 mu g C l(-1) d(-1) resulting in a bacterial growth efficiency of 15.9% for the ice covered conditions. Based on the growth efficiency we estimate that pelagic primary production amounts to 2.8% of the bacterial carbon demand. This might indicate that the bacterioplankton in Neusiedler See sustain their high growth rates at low temperatures (< 2 degrees C for most of the investigation period) by using probably the DOC originating from the previous season. This DOM stems most likely from the decay of the reed Phragmites australis and its epiphytes and, probably of minor importance, from phytoplankton leachates.

In this study, we monitored 151 municipalities in southern Brazil between 2012 and 2019 with the objective of detecting and recording the species' occurrence and abundance in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, as well as to examine its expansion and persistence pattern. Ceratium furcoides was recorded in 84.1% of the monitored municipalities, in all three of the state's hydrographic regions (HR). Spatially, the Guaiba HR showed the highest density for the species (10,912 cells mL(-1)); in temporal scales, 2014 and 2015 displayed density peaks, usually in the summer. The cumulative area invaded by C. furcoides gradually increased, reaching 266,625 km(2) in 2018, corresponding to about 94% of the state; however, the highest expansion rate (3142 km year(-1)) and longest distance covered (40.4 km) occurred in 2012, during its introduction. The expansion varied over the studied years, initially heading toward HR Littoral and Guaiba (between 2012 and 2014), followed by a steady period (2015-2017), and subsequently a progression toward HR Uruguay (2018). The frequency analysis showed that persistence was short in most of the municipalities. The results indicate that local environmental characteristics, especially temperature and precipitation, could be key for the invasion and development of the species. Given its rapid expansion, statewide dispersibility, and extremely large bloom formation, Rio Grande do Sul looks to be C. furcoides' second home.					de S Cardoso, Luciana/D-9523-2013; Rosa, Luis/B-1201-2010; Cardoso, Luciana/D-9523-2013	da Silva, Ruan Dutra/0000-0002-6422-0198; Cardoso, Luciana/0000-0003-1112-9814													1015-1621	1420-9055				APR	2024	86	2							28	10.1007/s00027-024-01042-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-024-01042-5													WOS:001152848100001

ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The aquatic microbiota is involved in crucial ecosystem functions. Thus, investigating the effects of global warming on these organisms is highly relevant, especially given the numerous climatic changes expected by the end of the century. In this study, we used an experimental approach and high-throughput sequencing to evaluate the shortterm effect of warming predicted by different future scenarios in the composition of the planktonic freshwater bacteria and microeukaryotes, and to verify if the same effects occur for each trophic level separately (autotrophic, heterotrophic and mixotrophic). Our experiment demonstrated that the composition for eukaryotes and prokaryotes based on DNA metabarcoding is affected by the increase in temperature and these have a similar pattern of response to warming. This highlights the temperature importance in structuring the communities of different groups. Modifications in the communities were observed through the substitution of specific taxa, which occurred mainly in warmer levels. Changes in community composition were also identified when trophic levels were assessed separately. Mixotrophic eukaryotes organisms are more sensitive to warming, modifying the patterns of composition with an increase in temperature of 2 degrees C. Microeukaryotes and heterotrophic bacteria were more resistant, with alterations in the communities composition visualized only in higher warming levels. The composition of autotrophic organisms was not affected by the increase in water temperature in any of the biological classifications evaluated, although the richness of eukaryotic autotrophic has decreased with warming. Our results contribute to predict how different biological levels and trophic groups of the aquatic microbiota respond to global warming. This approach is relevant because warming leads to changes in community composition and affects ecosystem processes essentials to the aquatic environment.

Modeling soil erosion for sustainable landscape management using RUSLE in the landscapes of Abaya-Chamo Sub-Basin, Ethiopia	MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT												This study aimed to assess and model soil erosion for sustainable landscape management using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) across six diverse landscapes in the Abaya-Chamo Sub-Basin of Ethiopia's Rift Valley Lakes Basin. The study spans six landscapes: Abaya Guangua, Arba Minch, Chencha, Hobicha, Loka Abaya, and Mierab Abaya during 2016 and 2021. The RUSLE integrates five key factors: rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, slope length and steepness, cover management, and conservation practices. By leveraging ArcGIS software, spatial analyses were performed to estimate annual soil loss across the studied landscapes. The main results accentuate both the spatial and temporal dynamics of soil loss. In 2016, estimated soil loss ranged from 0.08 to 1652 with an average of 128.39 t/ha/year. By 2021, soil loss ranged from 0.08 to 1474.08 with a reduced mean of 63.91 t/ha/year. In 2016, Abaya Guangua experienced minimal soil loss, with 90.36% of the area seeing <5 t/ha/year. This trend improved slightly by 2021, with 91.46% of the extent falling below the same threshold. In contrast, Chencha experienced severe erosion, reaching up to 1445.73 t/ha/year in 2016 with a notable decline by 2021. In Arba Minch, soil loss increased from 265.08 in 2016 to 292.71 t/ha/year in 2021, indicating improved erosion control. The Mierab Abaya exhibited severe soil loss in 2016, with slight improvements by 2021. Ethiopia's soil loss tolerable limit of 2-18 t/ha/year reveals that erosion in several landscapes, especially Chencha, Mierab Abaya, and Arba Minch, exceeds sustainable levels. In the studied landscapes, the spatial-temporal variability of soil loss underscores the critical importance of tailored strategies for sustainable landscape management. Decision-makers can leverage these insights to implement effective erosion control measures across diverse agroecological zones.

We assessed the relationship between macrophyte community structure (composition, species abundance, and plant diversity) and environmental features (SL dynamics, connectivity, morphometry, flood frequency, and water and sediment physical and chemical variables) in the Lower Parana River floodplain. Our main hypothesis was that SL macrophyte distribution depends on direct and indirect environmental controls operating at multiple scales. The SL dynamics during the April-November 2017 Parana River pulse were described according to their coverage changes (vegetation, and turbid or clear open water), which were assessed with supervised classifications on Landsat 8-OLI scenes. Twenty-five SL of the Lower Parana River floodplain were selected to represent all the SL dynamics identified. Ten SL were permanently connected and 15 were disconnected from watercourses. Water and sediment physical and chemical characteristics, macrophyte assemblage composition, and plant species abundance were surveyed at each site in the 2018 summer. Also, SL morphometric parameters and flood frequency were estimated from ancillary geographic data. The direct controlling factors of macrophyte assemblages were water ammonium and water nitrate concentrations, turbidity, and flood frequency. No clear effects of environmental conditions on macrophyte diversity were found. The connectivity of SL with watercourses affected their water and sediment physical and chemical features. Also, SL dynamics during the 2017 pulse were related to flood frequency. As connectivity to watercourses affects SL chemical and physical variables, and SL dynamics were associated with flood frequency, connectivity and SL dynamics indirectly influenced macrophyte assemblage composition. This study improved our understanding of macrophyte distribution patterns in the study area, which was related to several environmental variables operating at different scales. Our results highlight the importance of the variability of hydrological connectivity in promoting environmental heterogeneity in river floodplain systems, which is central to their functioning, and the high biodiversity that characterises these environments.					; Morandeira, Natalia/AAZ-8625-2021	Morandeira, Natalia/0000-0003-3674-2981; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				DEC	2022	67	12					2100	2112		10.1111/fwb.13999	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13999		SEP 2022											WOS:000860759600001
J	Wu, JY; Xiao, Y; Zhu, LJ; Cheng, SH				Wu, Jingyu; Xiao, Yao; Zhu, Linjie; Cheng, Sihua			The Identification of Historic Plant Landscape Characteristics and Conservation Strategies for Longevity Hill Based on the WSL Monoplotting Tool	LAND												The surrounding environment of architectural heritage sites is integral to cultural heritage protection; plant landscapes play crucial roles in them. Controlling plant spaces and appearances is essential for preserving plant landscapes. A World Cultural Heritage Site, the Summer Palace has undergone multiple changes since the 1860s; restoring and protecting plant landscapes has been an ongoing research focus. However, data accuracy limitations have hindered analyses of the overall spatial characteristics of historical gardens. Here, the historical dynamics and unique landscape features of plants on the front hill of Longevity Hill (FLH) are explored, and conservation and renewal strategies are proposed. Geographic information system (GIS) and WSL Monoplotting Tool are used to identify historical plant spaces. Plant space types are classified, and their landscape characteristics are analyzed. On the basis of historical events, the historical plant spaces on the FLH can be divided into two major categories and six subcategories. The vegetation retention area (south side) was less affected, and the plant landscape along Kunming Lake was the most well-preserved. However, the vegetation-damaged area (north side) was impacted more in the western part than in the eastern part, with notable changes in spatial landscape characteristics, particularly regarding forest function, morphology, and structure. Strategies are proposed for reducing human intervention and adjusting retention areas; furthermore, historical images and spatial grading in damaged areas can be used to suggest landscape adjustment and restoration strategies. This study introduces a method for analyzing the historical characteristics of plant landscapes over time that can be used to protect cultural heritage sites worldwide.					wu, jingyu/JFT-0067-2023	, wujingyu/0009-0009-7002-6218														2073-445X				AUG	2024	13	8							1255	10.3390/land13081255	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land13081255													WOS:001304895300001

A palaeoenvironmental reconstruction was made regarding this region where communities of fisher-gatherers lived in prehistory, producing numerous shell mounds. From at least 4900 until 3470 cal yr BP the site was a lagoon surrounded by a relatively open forest. The occurrence of shell mounds 50 kin from the coast and the 'peak' of human occupation between 5700 and 3300 cal yr BP can be linked to the presence of this great lagoon which formed an important food source. The lagoon desiccated ca. 3470 cal yr BP, i.e. during the Late Holocene sea-level fall, and was replaced by a swamp forest that still exists today. This forest was altered during a short period between 1300 and 675 cal yr BP, when a freshwater lake or marsh was formed as a result of a rise in groundwater level. The climate in the area throughout the Middle-Late Holocene (ca. 5000 cal yr BP to the present) has not changed significantly except for three slightly more humid episodes at 3470 2750, ca. 1940, and 1300-675 cal yr BP. No indications of human impact on the vegetation during this period could be identified. Our results show that from 4900 to 3470 cal yr BP sea-level was higher than at present, contradicting a widely accepted relative sea-level trend that suggests that at least two 'negative' sea-level oscillations occurred during the Holocene, i.e. at 4560-4150 and 3200-2800 cal yr BP. Our data confirm recent studies instead proposing a continuously declining relative sea-level during the Late Holocene. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Samuel Li, and Jinsong Guo, 2012. Modeling Monthly Fluctuations in Submersion Area of a Dammed River Reservoir: A Case Study. Journal of the American Water Resources Association (JAWRA) 1-13. DOI: 10.1111/jawr.12003 Abstract: Fluctuations in water submersion of the Three Gorges Reservoir in China have not been explored in spite of their important implications for shoreline erosion and other undesirable consequences. This article aims to quantify the monthly fluctuations in response to changing hydraulic parameters and regional climatic factors. Flow velocity and water levels distributed along the 609-km long dammed river reservoir are calculated with a one-dimensional hydrodynamics model. Evaporation of water from the surface of the reservoir is determined using mass transfer-based methods. Calculated flow velocities and water levels compare well with field data. We show that the water surface slope decreases with rising water level at the dam, and decreases to almost zero during the winter months of water storage when the downstream water level reaches the normal pool level. The submersion area varies between 830 and 1,070km2 over the year or over 20% of the reservoir zone will experience the annual cycle of dry land and partial or complete submersion. These fluctuations are of relevance to shoreline management and to the prevention and restoration of shoreline erosion. Evaporation is estimated to fluctuate between 1,240 and 26,110 tons of water per month per kilometer length of reservoir channel; this can possibly affect the hydrological budget of the reservoir region. The simple methodologies discussed in this article can easily be applied to other dammed river reservoirs for submersion estimates.

J	Brinkhoff, T; Muyzer, G				Brinkhoff, T; Muyzer, G			Increased species diversity and extended habitat range of sulfur-oxidizing Thiomicrospira spp.	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												We combined traditional cultivation methods and new molecular techniques to study the diversity and habitat range of bacteria of the genus Thiomicrospira. Specific primers were designed and used in the PCR to amplify the 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) of Thiomicrospira spp. and thus detect the presence of these bacteria in environmental samples and enrichment cultures, By using this genus-specific PCR, we were able to amplify 722-bp-long 16S rDNA fragments from different saltwater habitats as well as from a freshwater ecosystem, Furthermore, we were able to isolate most of these bacteria in pure culture by using enrichment cultures for chemolithoautotrophic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, With denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of PCR-amplified 16S rDNA fragments followed by hybridization analysis with one of the primers as a genus-specific probe, it was possible to monitor the success of isolation, The combined approach resulted in the isolation of several chemolithoautotrophic bacteria from different habitats: e.g., a coastal sediment along the coast of Chile, a microbial mat of the hypersaline pond Solar Lake (Sinai, Egypt), and the saline spring Artern (Thuringia, Germany), In addition, four different isolates were obtained from sediment and water samples taken at Jadebusen, which is part of the German Waddensea. Comparative analysis of the nearly complete 16S rRNA sequences of these isolates indicated several new species, all grouping with the Thiomicrospira species of the gamma subdivision of the class Proteobacterin, A freshwater Thiomicvospira species could not be isolated, but sequence analysis of the PCR product obtained after amplification of the environmental DNA with the Thiomicrospira-specific primers revealed its phylogenetic affiliation, The study indicates an increased species diversity of Thiomicrospira and the ubiquity of this sulfur-oxidizing bacterium in habitats with reduced sulfur compounds.

J	DESLOGES, JR; GILBERT, R				DESLOGES, JR; GILBERT, R			SEDIMENTARY RECORD OF HARRISON LAKE - IMPLICATIONS FOR DEGLACIATION IN SOUTHWESTERN BRITISH-COLUMBIA	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												A sedimentary record from 60 km long Harrison Lake was constructed by using 3.5 kHz subbottom acoustic profiles and gravity cores of surface sediments. In places, the glaciolacustrine sediments exceed 70 m in thickness and represent the entire deglacial and postglacial accumulation record. An upper, acoustically transparent layer decreases in thickness from 12 to 4 m southward from the upper lake. Cores from the upper metre of this layer demonstrate that deposition is dominated by settling of suspended sediment transported in a laterally mixed, wind-driven surface plume from the north. Depositional rates, inferred from C-14 dating of organic macrofossils and counting of probable annual laminated couplets in the cores, are almost 2 mm/a in the north and decline to less than 0.1 mm/a in the south. Hence, the upper acoustic layer accounts for all postglacial (last 10 500 years BP) lacustrine deposition, with most of the sediment derived from Lillooet River. A lower, thicker (12-22 m), acoustically stratified layer is interpreted as high-energy glaciolacustrine deposits. This large volume of deglaciation sediment is derived from two sources: (i) ice retreating rapidly northwest up the Lillooet valley, which may have existed for no more than 400 years in the lower valley prior to opening of Lillooet Lake (which now traps most sediment derived from the upper basin); and (ii) inflow from the south as the late-glacial Fraser River rapidly built a delta north from the sill at Harrison Hot Springs. Despite known higher sea levels during deglaciation of the eastern Fraser Lowland, we have no evidence for a marine incursion.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				MAY	1991	28	5					800	815		10.1139/e91-069	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/e91-069													WOS:A1991GB81300011

Moderate rates of late Quaternary slip along the northwestern margin of the Basin and Range Province, Surprise Valley fault, northeastern California	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												The 86-km-long Surprise Valley normal fault forms part of the active northwestern margin of the Basin and Range province in northeastern California. We use trench mapping and radiocarbon, luminescence, and tephra dating to estimate displacements and timing of the past five surface-rupturing earthquakes on the central part of the fault near Cedarville. A Bayesian OxCal analysis of timing constraints indicates earthquake times of 18.2 +/- 2.6, 10.9 +/- 3.2, 8.5 +/- 0.5, 5.8 +/- 1.5, and 1.2 +/- 0.1 ka. These data yield recurrence intervals of 7.3 +/- 4.1, 2.5 +/- 3.2, 2.7 +/- 1.6, and 4.5 +/- 1.5 ka and an elapsed time of 1.2 +/- 0.1 ka since the latest surface-rupturing earthquake. Our best estimate of latest Quaternary vertical slip rate is 0.6 +/- 0.1 mm/a. This late Quaternary rate is remarkably similar to long-term (8-14 Ma) minimum vertical slip rates (>0.4-0.5 +/- 0.3 mm/a) calculated from recently acquired seismic reflection and chronologic and structural data in Surprise Valley and the adjacent Warner Mountains. However, our slip rate yields estimates of extension that are lower than recent campaign GPS determinations by factors of 1.5-4 unless the fault has an unusually shallow (30 degrees-35 degrees) dip as suggested by recently acquired seismic reflection data. Coseismic displacements of 2-4.5 +/- 1 m documented in the trench and probable rupture lengths of 53-65 km indicate a history of latest Quaternary earthquakes of M 6.8-7.3 on the central part of the Surprise Valley fault.

J	Hoelzmann, P; Kruse, HJ; Rottinger, F				Hoelzmann, P; Kruse, HJ; Rottinger, F			Precipitation estimates for the eastern Saharan palaeomonsoon based on a water balance model of the West Nubian Palaeolake Basin	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												During the Holocene, the eastern Sahara underwent a drastic climatic change: in less than 6000 years, the climate changed from hyperaridity to semiaridity and back to its current hyperarid state. The West Nubian Palaeolake Basin in NW Sudan (ca 18.5 degreesN/25.5 degreesE) contains widespread lake carbonates, which indicate development of a freshwater lake between approximately 9500 and 4000 years BP. The size of the lake has been estimated as between 1100 and 7000 km(2). Water balance calculations and a dense drainage net surrounding the terminal lake indicate predominance of superficial and minor importance of groundwater inflow. A lake with an area of 1100 km(2) would require an annual precipitation of approximately 500 mm to balance the respective aerial evaporation. Similar precipitation values are currently observed at a latitude of 12 degreesN, some 600 km farther south, while the West Nubian Palaeolake Basin receives an annual rainfall of less than 15 mm/year. A lake size of 7000 km(2) would have required 900 mm of annual rainfall, an amount characteristic of sub-tropical conditions. This value could indicate inhomogenities in the wet phase climate, which could strongly influence the water level of a terminal lake located in a flat terrain. The highly depleted oxygen isotope values of the lake carbonates indicate that the Holocene wet phase was characterized by intense tropical summer (monsoonal) rainfall with heavy thunderstorms. Thus, an intensified southwest palaeomonsoon apparently transported large quantities of moisture to the eastern Sahara, producing the necessary conditions for the persisting existence of freshwater in the West Nubian Palaeolake Basin. The reconstructed palaeoclimate implies high groundwater levels and corresponds to precipitation rates from other sites in North Africa. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The four major species of phytoplankton found in the lake were identified by electron microscopy. The most abundant phytoplankter was Pyramimonas gelidicola McFadden (Chlorphyta, Prasinophyceae) which occurred in greatest numbers at 10 m, the base of the oxylimnion. The pigments and lipids at this depth were mainly derived from this alga. At 11 m (the top of the anoylimnion) only traces of lipids and pigments attributable to P. gelidicola were found, indicating only limited settling of algal cells through to the anoxylimnion, at least in summer. The pigments at 11 m were dominated by bacteriochlorophylls c derived from green photosynthetic bacteria Chlorobium spp. These pigments were also abundant at 23 m suggesting the presence of intact bacterial cells which had settled out from higher in the water column. Major non-polar lipid classes in the sediments included sterols, alcohols, hydrocarbons and an unusual suite of very long-chain unsaturated ketones and esters which have not previously been reported from antarctic environments. Several novel compounds, not found previously in either sediments or organisms, are reported. These include tri- and tetra-unsaturated straight-chain C39 methyl ketones and C40 ethyl ketones and the methyl ester of a tetra-unsaturated straight-chain C36 fatty acid. The distributions of lipids in the sediment were markedly different from those in the water column indicating extensive bacterial degradation and recycling of labile lipids.

The importance of spatial and temporal scale in describing hydrogeomorphic character of riverine landscapes	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Context Describing the hydrogeomorphic character of rivers in a holistic way is essential to understanding the processes whereby freshwater ecosystems maintain patterns of biodiversity and ecosystem processes. A key question in carrying out this characterisation is the temporal and spatial scales which best represent differences and similarities between habitats. Objectives The purpose of this study is to describe the hydrological and geomorphological character of a large river-floodplain system (the Upper Mississippi River, USA) at multiple spatial and temporal scales in order to holistically determine the physical template influencing the riverine ecosystem. Methods Seventeen variables are used to describe the hydrogeomorphic character of 99 backwaters and floodplain lakes along a 100 km reach of the river. Results At the landscape scale (10 s of km), position in the landscape and proximity to neighbouring habitats contributed most to variability in hydrogeomorphic character. At the smaller patch scale (10-100 s of m), the shape of entry to the patch and water depth were distinguishing variables. In relation to temporal variables, habitats are distinguished by decadal scale variables describing the historic nature of the rise and fall of connection events, and mean peak and duration of connection over long periods. In contrast, the interplay of magnitude and duration of individual connection events produced unique patterns at the short-term temporal scale (intra-annual). Analysis of all variables across all scales showed that no variable from one scale of observation was dominant, rather variables from multiple scales are contributing to hydrogeomorphic character to varying degrees. Conclusions This work demonstrates how an interdisciplinary, multi-scale approach is critical in detecting unique patterns in hydrogeomorphic character across different spatial and temporal scales. This approach enables a holistic view of spatio-temporal heterogeneity of a system and provides a firm basis for investigating how the physical template influences and helps to maintain patterns of biodiversity and ecosystem processes in complex and dynamics systems.

J	den Heyer, C; Kalff, J				den Heyer, C; Kalff, J			Organic matter mineralization rates in sediments: A within- and among-lake study	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Organic matter mineralization rates were measured by the accumulation of DIC + CH4 in the water overlying intact cores taken from littoral and profundal sediments of nine Quebec lakes. The variability in areal carbon mineralization is much greater within lakes than among lakes varying in trophic richness. Organic matter mineralization in littoral sediments is more variable and, on average, threefold higher than in the profundal sediments. Sixty percent of the variation in mean summer mineralization rates is explained by site depth, a surrogate variable that incorporates the effect of temperature and may also be reflecting substrate quality and(or) supply. The lake specific characteristics most strongly correlated to the residuals of the regression with depth are catchment area-to-lake area ratio (CA:LA) and water residence time. In lakes with a larger CA:LA and a shorter residence time, the amount and(or) the quality of organic matter settling to the sediments at a given depth may be reduced, resulting in the lower observed mineralization rates. Total mineralization in the sediments is, not surprisingly, greater in larger lakes but the rate per unit area is smaller, reflecting the decreased importance of the littoral zone. More than half (54-100%) of the DIC + CH4 produced in the sediments is from the littoral zone. Yet, because of the large biomass in epilimnetic waters, the littoral sediments account for <20% of the sum of metabolism in the epilimnetic water column and underlying sediments. The relative importance of the sediments in metabolism in lakes is a function of both the trophy and lake morphometry. In deep lakes a smaller proportion of total respiration occurs in the sediments than in shallow lakes, and in eutrophic lakes the sediments account for a smaller proportion of total respiration than in oligotrophic lakes.																			0024-3590					JUN	1998	43	4					695	705		10.4319/lo.1998.43.4.0695	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1998.43.4.0695													WOS:000075320300015

This lake is one of the clear water lakes in Olsztyn, but the progressive deterioration of water quality has been observed during recent years. The phosphorus concentration in the water-sediment interface, phosphorus fractions quantity and the amount of components which can bind this element was investigated in the upper (0-5 cm) layer of deposits. The aim of study was to analyze the potential influence of bottom sediment on the lake water quality. The obtained results revealed that the bottom sediment of Tyrsko Lake can be classified as mixed, silica-organic type, with a relatively high content of iron (over 4% Fe in d.w.). The total phosphorus content was ca. 3.5 mg P g(-1) d.w. on average. Phosphorus in the bottom sediment was bound mainly with organic matter (NaOH-nrP fraction), which had over 50% share in TP. Highly mobile fractions (NH4-Cl-P and BD-P) together only included ca. 5% to 7% TP. The obtained results show that the bottom sediment of Tyrsko Lake can bind phosphorus quite effectively. The calculated internal mineral phosphorus loading during summer stagnation period was 10.9 kg and it was lower that the assessed annual external phosphorus load (22.6 kg). The assessed annual phosphorus loading from both sources was still lower than the critical load according to Vollenweider criteria. However, due to the fact that the internal loading phenomenon is occurring in the lake, it should be taken into consideration that the lake water quality can deteriorate gradually during the longer time perspective. These findings should be accounted for in the future if the potential protection and restoration procedures will be developed.					; Augustyniak, Renata/AAY-3672-2021	Tandyrak, Renata/0000-0001-6767-6572; Filipkowska, Zofia/0000-0003-4322-877X; Augustyniak-Tunowska, Renata/0000-0003-0098-0427; Lopata, Michal/0000-0002-1993-3287; Grochowska, Jolanta/0000-0001-7319-4174; Parszuto, Katarzyna/0000-0002-1373-2265; Neugebauer, Maciej/0000-0002-9067-3609													2299-8993					SEP	2017	18	5					55	62		10.12911/22998993/74624	http://dx.doi.org/10.12911/22998993/74624													WOS:000416835200007

Based on multi proxy analysis (i.e., grain size, mineral magnetism, clay mineralogy, Total Organic Carbon (TOC) and carbon isotopes), supported by a robust radiocarbon chronology, three major environmental phases were identified. Warm, wet phases occurred between 1,150-650 cal yr BP and 260 cal yr BP to the present. These phases coincide closely with the Medieval Climatic Anomaly (MCA) and modern warming, respectively. These warm/wet events were due to elevated precipitation, resulting in high lake levels and an expansion of the lake margin, which were marked by lower delta 13C values, comparatively higher sand concentration, TOC values and magnetic susceptibility (chi lf). The inference of a modern warm phase is supported by high resolution instrumental data. The MCA, which is marked by elevated amounts of coarse grained (sand) detrital material, is inferred to be an interval of strengthened of monsoonal intensity, which correlates with available monsoon records from various continental paleoclimate archives. Following the MCA a cold and dry phase was observed to occur between 610 and 260 cal yr BP, corresponding to the Little Ice Age (LIA). The LIA, which was characterized by high silt and clay concentration, high delta 13C, low TOC and reduced magnetic susceptibility (chi lf), is inferred to represent an interval of low lake levels, likely reflecting an episode of weakened monsoonal intensity.

The latter is a pivotal traffic line in the Southeast Tibetan Plateau. In order to investigate the state of glaciers and glacial lakes in the Bosula Mountain Range, we estimated the changes in glacier/glacial lake boundaries, glacier surface elevation, and glacier flow velocity between 2000 and 2021 based on multisource remote sensing data. Our results showed that, from the period 2000-2013 to the period 2013-2021, the average shrinking rate of glacier area increased from 0.99 km(2)/a to 1.74 km(2)/a, and the average expanding rate of glacial lake area increased from 0.04 km(2)/a to 0.06 km(2)/a. From the period 1990-2011 to the period 2015-2019, the average thinning rate of glaciers increased from 0.83 m/a to 1.58 m/a. These results indicate the Bosula Mountain Range is one of the fastest melting glacierized regions in the High Mountain Asia, and the factors that account for this may include quick temperature rise, abundant summer rainfall, and thin debris cover. In spite of strong ice melting, the observed changes in glacier boundaries, surface elevation, and flow velocity show no sign of surge activity, and the frequency of glacier lake outburst has not increased since 1989. Currently, three proglacial lakes that expanded quickly during 2000-2021 are now prominent hazards. They are directly threatened by accidental ice calving and ice avalanche, and their outburst could cause considerable damage to the downstream settlements and the Sichuan-Tibet Road.

We collected the coarse (>2.5 mu m) dust fraction on the northern slopes of the Tien Shan 42 degrees 40'49.69"N, (74 degrees 41'37.36"E, 1740 m asl) using a high-volume slit-impactor at 3-day sampling intervals. We present data on the mineralogical composition, particle-size distribution, soluble salts and nitrate isotope composition of the collected dust. The short-term and seasonal changes in dust concentration and composition are discussed in the context of high temporal resolution measurements of meteorological parameters and particle counts for 31 grain-size bands. Throughout the study period, CaCO3 was a major dust constituent (average particle frequency 14%). Between July 2010 and October 2012, the average content of soluble salts was 10 wt.%; mole percentages of water-leachable anions were 60% NO3, 30% SO4, 10% Cl. Ca was the dominant leachable cation (>90%). The collected dust comprised (i) gypsum which forms pedogenically in the topsoils of arid regions and (ii) secondary gypsum originating from the interaction of sulphuric acid aerosols with CaCO3 in the atmosphere. Variable proportions of (i) and (ii) and the extent of Ca(NO3)2 formation (verified by chemical mass budgets) were documented in the Ca/Sr and Ca/SO4 ratios of the aqueous leachates. The isotopic compositions of the dust nitrate in the majority of the samples clustered between 10 and +10%0 for delta N-15[NO3] (VSMOW) and +50 and +100%0 for delta O-18[NO3] (Air). The delta O-18[NO3] values of a majority of the collected samples exhibited a weak positive correlation with the NO3 load of the collected dust (R-2 = 0.148). The time series of the delta N-15[NO3] values varied around a basement level of -6%0, which indicates that NO from mobile sources is a major precursor of the dust-NO3. The distinct, positive departures from these values correlated with increases in the content of soot. We conclude that the related delta N-15[NO3] peaks reflect increased NOx, contributions from coal burning. The possible origin of the dust was evaluated using satellite images and backward trajectory calculations for a few example monitoring intervals. Data synthesis in the context of hemispherical atmospheric circulation models, including the data for 2013, the results from ongoing chemical and isotope analyses of the non-soluble solid residues of the collected materials and the statistical handling of an extended data set will further elucidate the relationships involving atmospheric circulation, atmospheric dust load, dust sources and the characteristics of the study region.

Evaluation of Offshore Stocking of Lake Trout in Lake Ontario	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Restoration stocking of hatchery-reared lake trout Salvelinus namaycush has occurred in Lake Ontario since 1973. In U. S. waters, fish stocked through 1990 survived well and built a large adult population. Survival of yearlings stocked from shore declined during 1990-1995, and adult numbers fell during 1998-2005. Offshore stocking of lake trout was initiated in the late 1990s in response to its successful mitigation of predation losses to double-crested cormorants Phalacrocorax auritus and the results of earlier studies that suggested it would enhance survival in some cases. The current study was designed to test the relative effectiveness of three stocking methods at a time when poststocking survival for lake trout was quite low and losses due to fish predators was a suspected factor. The stocking methods tested during 2000-2002 included May offshore, May onshore, and June onshore. Visual observations during nearshore stockings and hydroacoustic observations of offshore stockings indicated that release methods were not a direct cause of fish mortality. Experimental stockings were replicated for 3 years at one site in the southwest and for 2 years at one site in the southeast. Offshore releases used a landing craft to transport hatchery trucks from 3 to 6 km offshore out to 55-60-m-deep water. For the southwest site, offshore stocking significantly enhanced poststocking survival. Among the three methods, survival ratios were 1.74 : 1.00 : 1.02 (May offshore : May onshore : June onshore). Although not statistically significant owing to the small samples, the trends were similar for the southeast site, with survival ratios of 1.67 : 1.00 : 0.72. Consistent trends across years and sites indicated that offshore stocking of yearling lake trout during 2000-2002 provided nearly a twofold enhancement in survival; however, this increase does not appear to be great enough to achieve the 12-fold enhancement necessary to return population abundance to restoration targets.																			0275-5947						2011	31	4					671	682		10.1080/02755947.2011.608613	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2011.608613													WOS:000296141400009

Genetic zoogeography of the Hyalella azteca species complex in the Great Basin: Rapid rates of molecular diversification in desert springs	LATE CENOZOIC DRAINAGE HISTORY OF THE SOUTHWESTERN GREAT BASIN AND LOWER COLORADO RIVER REGION: GEOLOGIC AND BIOTIC PERSPECTIVES	Geological Society of America Special Papers				Workshop on Geologic and Biotic Perspectives on Late Cenozoic Drainage History of the Southwestern Great Basin and Lower Colorado River Region	APR 12-15, 2005	CA	US Geol Survey Earth Surface Dynam Program, US Geol Survey Natl Cooperat Geol Mapping Program, Smithsonian Inst				The North American Great Basin is a useful venue for the study of dispersal, vicariance, and rates of molecular evolution among aquatic organisms because its Pleistocene hydrogeographic history is relatively well known. This study examines regional molecular variation in the amphipod Hyalella azteca using mitochondrial (mt) gene sequence (deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA]) data. Populations within several endorheic drainages in the southern Great Basin were analyzed to determine if they represent a monophyletic assemblage with respect to populations from the pluvial Lake Bonneville drainage in the northern Great Basin. We also tested whether the patterns of molecular diversification among populations in the southern Great Basin were consistent with a Pleistocene vicariance hypothesis, and if the magnitude of observed sequence divergence was concordant with standard molecular clock calibrations. Our results show that diversity and endemism among Hyalella populations in the southern Great Basin are high with respect to those in the Lake Bonneville Basin. We further demonstrate that hyalellid populations in the southern Great Basin are a polyphyletic assemblage with respect to their counterparts in the Bonneville Basin, suggesting that dispersal events have been partially responsible for the enigmatic relationships within this assemblage. The relationships among lineages within the southern Great Basin are largely enigmatic and are not concordant with Pleistocene hydrographic history. Our data also indicate that rates of molecular evolution have been heterogeneous; there is a 2.8-fold disparity in relative rates of mtDNA divergence among closely allied lineages. The magnitude of sequence divergence among lineages is inconsistent with standard molecular clock calibrations, and evidence indicates that accelerated rates of divergence may have contributed to the high diversity and endemism among Great Basin hyalellids, complicating reconstruction of the temporal sequence of biogeographic events.

J	Anderson, L; Abbott, MB; Finney, BP				Anderson, L; Abbott, MB; Finney, BP			Holocene climate inferred from oxygen isotope ratios in lake sediments, central Brooks Range, Alaska	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Analyses of sediment cores from two lakes in the central Brooks Range provide temperature and moisture balance information for the past similar to 8500 cal yr at century-scale resolution. Two methods of oxygen isotope analysis are used to reconstruct past changes in the effective moisture (precipitation minus evaporation) and temperature. Effective moisture is inferred from oxygen isotope ratios in sediment cellulose from Meli Lake (area similar to0.13 km(2), depth 19.4 m). The lake has a low watershed-to-lake-area ratio (7) and significant evaporation relative to input. Summer temperature shifts are based on oxygen isotope analyses of endogenic calcite from Tangled Up Lake (area similar to0.25 km(2), depth 3.5 m). This basin has a larger watershed-to-lake-area ratio (91) and less evaporation relative to input. Sediment oxygen isotope analyses from the two sites indicate generally more arid conditions than present prior to similar to 6000 cal yr B.P. Subsequently, the region became increasingly wet. Temperature variability is recorded minimally at centennial scale resolution with values that are generally cool for the past similar to 6700 cal yr. The timing and direction of climate variability indicated by the oxygen isotope time series from Meli and Tangled Up lakes are consistent with previously established late Holocene glacier advances at similar to 5000 cal yr B.P. in the central Brooks Range, and high lake-levels at Birch Lake since similar to 5500 cal yr B.P. This unique use of oxygen isotopes reveals both moisture balance and temperature histories at previously undetected high-resolution temporal scales for northern Alaska during the middle to late Holocene.

In the spring of 2016, we tracked four oriental white stork (Ciconia boyciana) fledglings' movement patterns in Xingkai Lake National Reserve of Heilongjiang Province in China using miniaturized multi-sensor satellite transmitters from three different artificial nests established in the same wetland fragment. Location information and hourly distance from satellite transmitters were recorded to quantify activity patterns, movement hot spots, and home range size. In this paper, we provide systematic conservation recommendations of oriental white storks with perspective on artificial nests, activity rhythms, and spatial movement patterns in the breeding landscape. Results showed that oriental white stork fledglings were more active during the daytime, significant activity peaks occurred from 03:00-05:00 A.M and from 17:00-19:00 P.M. This suggests that anthropogenic pressure should be reduced or suspended during these activity peaks and captive fledglings should feed following natural rhythms. Fledglings tended to concentrate their movement around two or three hot-spot locations with flat spaces or small ponds and their movement routes between the different hot spots presented different shapes: triangular shape, L shape, and straight line. It is necessary to create enough flat spaces or man-made ponds to support fledglings foraging. The home range area based on 100% Minimum Convex Polygons varied considerably among the four individuals, ranging from 14.79 to 39.40 km(2) during the tracking period. This helps determine the core protection boundary of the fledglings in the breeding habitat fragment. Establishing more artificial nests and improving nests monitoring systems are essential to ensure breeding success. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Tommy			Predation by American White Pelicans and Double-Crested Cormorants on Catchable-Sized Hatchery Rainbow Trout in Select Idaho Lentic Waters	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												In southern Idaho, population growth of American white pelicans Pelecanus erythorhynchos at the Blackfoot Reservoir and Lake Walcott colonies since the early 1990s has generated concerns about whether pelican predation is impacting angler catch of hatchery trout stocked in Idaho waters. To evaluate this concern, we estimated rates of pelican predation (i.e., the proportion of fish consumed by pelicans) and angler catch (i.e., the proportion of fish caught by anglers) for 19 unique springtime fish stocking events over 3 years across 12 study waters; where feasible we also estimated double-crested cormorant Phalacrocorax auritus predation. Stocked Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss averaged 247 mm in length and were internally PIT-tagged (to monitor bird predation) and externally anchor-tagged (to monitor angler catch) before stocking. Additional hatchery trout were PIT-tagged, euthanized, and fed directly to pelicans to estimate PIT tag deposition rates at the colonies; feeding was unsuccessful for cormorants. After the juvenile pelicans and cormorants fledged in the fall, we recovered PIT tags from stocked and fed fish that were deposited at the two colonies. Deposition rates for pelican-consumed tags averaged 21% and declined exponentially as distance increased from the colonies. Pelican predation on hatchery trout averaged 18% and ranged from 0 to 48%, whereas angler catch averaged 21% and ranged from 0 to 82%. Mean angler catch was nearly four times higher when pelican predation was low (i.e., <25%) than when pelican predation was high (>= 25%). Cormorant predation estimates (available for seven stocking events) were minimum estimates only (i.e., they assumed 100% of tags consumed by cormorants were recovered) and averaged 14% (range, 2-38%). Our results suggest that predation by American white pelicans and double-crested cormorants on catchable-sized hatchery Rainbow Trout stocked in southern Idaho waters often exceeds the total catch of those fish by anglers who compete directly with avian predators for use of stocked trout.																			0275-5947	1548-8675					2016	36	2					294	308		10.1080/02755947.2015.1120835	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2015.1120835													WOS:000374565000009
J	Tsuji, H; Funaki, H; Watanabe, M; Hayashi, S				Tsuji, Hideki; Funaki, Hironori; Watanabe, Mirai; Hayashi, Seiji			Effects of temperature and oxygen on 137Cs desorption from bottom sediment of a dam lake	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												The temperature and oxygen environment play important roles in the desorption of Cs-137 from freshwater lake sediment to lake water. In this study, 12 quarterly surveys were performed to measure the dissolved Cs-137 concentration in surface and bottom lake water, the vertical distribution of water temperature, and the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration at the upstream, midstream, and downstream sites of the Yokokawa Dam Lake in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. Higher concentrations of dissolved Cs-137 were detected in the bottom water than in the surface water, especially in the summer and midstream lake regions at depths of 8-21 m owing to higher temperatures, which activated the bacterial decomposition of organic matter, and anaerobization, which enhanced the NH4+ in the pore water and Cs-137 desorption from mineral particles. To compare the effects of anaerobization and increasing temperature on Cs-137 desorption from sediment particles, intact sediment core samples were collected from the lake midstream and incubated for 1-14 days in a chamber under three controlled temperature and oxygen environment conditions: aerobic +10 degrees C; anaerobic +10 degrees C; and anaerobic +20 degrees C. The vertical distribution of Cs-137 in the sediment pore water showed a similar profile as NH4+ and K+, and both the increased temperature and reduced DO concentration enhanced the Cs-137 desorption. A comparison of the standard partial regression coefficients of temperature and DO concentration in the multiple regression equation for the Cs-137 concentration in pore water shows that the reduction of DO from saturation to zero at the water-sediment interface accelerated the desorption of Cs-137 more strongly than did the temperature rise from 10 to 20 degrees C. The experimental results show a nearly inverse proportional relationship between NH4+ and the distribution coefficients of Cs-137 after thermodynamic correction, except in the surface layer. These findings indicate that the Cs-137 concentration in pore water can be explained by the temperature-dependent chemical distribution between the solid-aqueous phase and its equilibrium with NH4+.

J	Koed, A; Baktoft, H; Bak, BD				Koed, A; Baktoft, H; Bak, BD			Causes of mortality of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) smolts in a restored river and its estuary	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												During October 2000 to August 2002, the River Skjern Nature Project was implemented by removing dykes and re-meandering 20.5 km of the lower canalized river. As a consequence the length of the river stretch increased to 23 km. A lake of 250 ha developed in the river valley 5 km upstream from the river mouth because of subsiding soils caused by reclamation and drainage since the 1960s. Using radiotelemetry, the mortality of wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) smolts in the River Skjern and its estuary was investigated prior to and after the implementation of the project. Altogether, 77 Atlantic salmon and 66 brown trout smolts were caught, tagged and released in the river upstream of the restoration project during the spring of 2000 and 2002. The in-river smolt mortality was more than double in 2002 for both Atlantic salmon and brown trout compared with 2000. This was primarily due to bird predation in 2002 which was not observed in 2000. The in-river bird predation in 2002 was mediated by the new lake, which quickly became an important bird rest area. Estuarine mortality mainly caused by cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis) differed significantly between species, but was high for both Atlantic salmon (39%) and brown trout (12%) in both years of investigation. The aggregated smolt mortality in the river and in the estuary (48%) may threaten an indigenous self-sustaining Atlantic salmon population in the River Skjern. When planning river restoration projects, caution should be used, especially where permanently flooded floodplains (lakes) develop due to subsiding soil. In situations where rivers pass directly through newly developed lakes, migratory species such as Atlantic salmon and brown trout may be severely affected due to increased exposure to predation from predatory fish and birds.

Taphonomy of lacustrine shoreline fish-part conglomerates in the Late Triassic age Lockatong Formation (Collegeville, Pennsylvania, USA): Toward the recognition of catastrophic fish kills in the rock record	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Fish parts, bones and scale elements, preserved in sandstones and conglomerates characterize an uncommon type of lacustrine strandline setting identified in the Triassic Lockatong Formation of the Newark Supergroup. The Triassic fish-part sandstones and conglomerates are composed of disarticulated skeletal remains and formed during the lake expansion phase. Diverse mudstone-clast types derived from the underlying low-stand playa deposits integrated into the younger transgressive shoreline sequence that contains disarticulated fish parts. We propose that the Salton Sea, California, USA is a modern hypersaline lacustrine environmental analog for the deposition of fish remains. On the Salton Sea, high-wind events cause mass fish kills forming a modern shoreline dominated by barnacles and fish remains. Using modern day observations from fish kills in the Salton Sea, California, USA, we suggest that the following taphonomic scenario: mass kills of Triassic fish species took place during deposition of the lacustrine Lockatong Formation. High wind events caused overturning of the lake waters either depleting oxygen or toxically poisoning the fish. After death, bacterial decomposition bloated the fish by generated gas in tissues causing the fish carcasses to float. The decomposing fish carcasses were driven shoreward by wind and wave action and deposited on the shoreline and possibly scavenged by phytosaurs. Following soft tissue decay, the disarticulated remains were reworked into normally graded beds composed of intraclasts and fish-part elements. The intermixing of intraformational clasts and fish parts reflects the impact of storms on the lacustrine shoreline during the expansion phase of the Van Houten cycle, short period Milankovich frequency cycles that consist of three recorded phases of lake rise to fall recorded in various facies stackings.

J	Roush, D; Couradeau, E; Guida, B; Neuer, S; Garcia-Pichel, F				Roush, Daniel; Couradeau, Estelle; Guida, Brandon; Neuer, Susanne; Garcia-Pichel, Ferran			A New Niche for Anoxygenic Phototrophs as Endoliths	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria (APBs) occur in a wide range of aquatic habitats, from hot springs to freshwater lakes and intertidal microbial mats. Here, we report the discovery of a novel niche for APBs: endoliths within marine littoral carbonates. In a study of 40 locations around Isla de Mona, Puerto Rico, and Menorca, Spain, 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing of endolithic community DNA revealed the presence of abundant phylotypes potentially belonging to well- known APB clades. An ad hoc phylogenetic classification of these sequences enabled us to refine the assignments more stringently. Even then, all locations contained such putative APBs, often reaching a significant proportion of all phototrophic sequences. In fact, in some 20% of samples, their contribution exceeded that of oxygenic phototrophs, previously regarded as the major type of endolithic microbe in carbonates. The communities contained representatives of APBs in the Chloroflexales, various proteobacterial groups, and Chlorobi. The most abundant phylotypes varied with geography: on Isla de Mona, Roseiflexus and Chlorothrix-related phylotypes dominated, whereas those related to Erythrobacter were the most common in Menorca. The presence of active populations of APBs was corroborated through an analysis of photopigments: bacteriochlorophylls were detected in all samples, bacteriochlorophyll c and a being most abundant. We discuss the potential metabolism and geomicrobial roles of endolithic APBs. Phylogenetic inference suggests that APBs may be playing a role as photoheterotrophs, adding biogeochemical complexity to our understanding of such communities. Given the global extent of coastal carbonate platforms, they likely represent a very large and unexplored habitat for APBs. IMPORTANCE Endolithic microbial communities from carbonates, which have been explored for over 2 centuries in predominantly naturalistic studies, were thought to be primarily composed of eukaryotic algae and cyanobacteria. Our report represents a paradigm shift in this regard, at least for the marine environment, demonstrating the presence of ubiquitous and abundant populations of APBs in this habitat. It raises questions about the role of these organisms in the geological dynamics of coastal carbonates, including coral reefs.

It is an endemic species for the Balkan Peninsula and Europe. According to the European Red list, it is in the Data Deficient (DD) category. In the Habitats Directive, it is placed in Annex II. Kottelat and Freyhof (2007) consider that the population of P.minutus in Lake Ohrid is probably extinct. The Belchisko Blato is its last refugium. This study aims to investigate the species' main morphological, physiological, and ecological features due to a need for more information regarding its biological characteristics. A total of 71 individuals were analysed during the ichthyological research. Sixteen meristic counts are presented, and 41 morphometric measurements are performed with percentage relationships. The gender structure indicates a stable population. The percentage representation is 4.2% juvenile, 43.7% male and 52.1% female individuals, with age range from 0+ to 3+. The majority of the population belongs to individuals aged 2+ (47%), and the rest are as follows: 1+ (28.2%), 3+ (19.7%) and 0+ (5.1%). Sexual maturity is reached during the second year of life (1+). The most minor sexually mature male and female individuals are aged 1+. Spawning occurs during the late winter months (February- March). The average absolute fecundity is 1549 eggs, ranging from 1144 to 1549.

The viral RNA, DNA, and 90-kd protein were localized at the cellular level. Riboprobes complementary to the 5' terminal region of WDSV genome were used to detect viral nucleic acids. Rabbit polyclonal antiserum was generated against the 90-kd virus-associated antigen, presumably a product of the env gene, for immunohistochemical studies. Viral transcripts were detected in the neoplastic cells of all dermal sarcomas, in which they were generally abundant. Rare mononuclear inflammatory cells and cells within the epidermis also expressed viral RNA. In all sarcomas, low to moderate levels of viral DNA were present in all neoplastic and most mononuclear inflammatory and epidermal cells. Many neoplastic cells were immunopositive for the virus-associated protein. The distribution of immunopositive neoplastic cells mimicked approximately that of cells containing viral transcripts. The number of neoplastic cells with transcripts exceeded that of cells with protein, suggesting that productively infected neoplastic cells constituted a subset of the neoplastic cells that expressed WDSV transcripts. The viral antigen was also present within many mononuclear inflammatory cells. These data suggested that 1) dermal sarcomas were associated with elevated transcriptional activity of WDSV in the neoplastic cells and 2) the cell tropism of WDSV extended beyond the mesenchymal fibroblast-like neoplastic cells and included at least mononuclear inflammatory and epidermal cells.																			0300-9858					MAR	1995	32	2					162	172		10.1177/030098589503200210	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/030098589503200210								7771057					WOS:A1995QK24300010

Here, we present absolutely dated speleothem multi-proxy records spanning 9.0-7.9 ka from Beijing in North China, near the northern limit of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) and thus sensitive to climate change, to provide evidence of the intensified multi-decadal climatic oscillations since 8.52 ka. Three extreme excursions characterized by inter-decadal consecutive delta 18O excursions exceeding +/- 1 sigma are identified from 8.52 ka in our speleothem record. The earlier two are characterized by enriched 18O at similar to 8.50 and 8.20 ka, respectively, suggesting a prolonged arid event, which is supported by the positive trend in delta 13C values, increased trace element ratios, and lower growth rate. Following the 8.2 ka event, an excessive rebound immediately emerges in our delta 18O and trace element records but moderate in the delta 13C, probably suggesting pluvial conditions and nonlinear response of the local ecosystem. Following two similar severe droughts at 8.50 and 8.20 ka, the different behavior of delta 13C suggests the recovering degree of resilient ecosystem responding to different rebounded rainfall intensity. A comparison with other high-resolution records suggests that the two droughts-one pluvial pattern between 8.52 and 8.0 ka is of global significance instead of being a regional phenomenon, and is causally linked to the slowdown and acceleration of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation that was further dominated by the freshwater injections in the North Atlantic.					; Li, Han/MEO-0927-2025	dong, xiyu/0000-0002-7611-0244; 													1814-9324	1814-9332				JUN 27	2024	20	6					1401	1414		10.5194/cp-20-1401-2024	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-20-1401-2024													WOS:001255261200001

In the past two decades, the water environment of Honghu Lake has been suffering from serious deterioration due to the rapid development of agriculture and industry in the urbanization of surrounding areas. Under the combined effect of multiple non-point source pollution and point source pollution, cyanobacteria blooms often occur here. As a proxy of eutrophication, chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) has been considered to be an important indicator of water quality parameters. For better understanding of the change of the water quality of Honghu Lake, an improved empirical model for estimating chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chl-a) from different multi-spectral satellites images was established and validated. (1) We combined the results of two-band algorithms(2BDA), three-band algorithms(3BDA), normalized difference chlorophyll index (NDCI) and fluorescence line height (FLH) into support vector machine model (SVM) for better multi-nonlinear relationship establishment between Chl-a concentration and surface water reflectance, which acquired higher model accuracy.(2) Based on the long-term time series data derived from Landsat-7, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, the variation of Chl-a concentration of Honghu Lake over long term was obtained. (3) Our results demonstrate that the average chlorophyll concentration has been at a very high level and showing an increasing tendency in recent years, which may indicate the eutrophication in the Honghu Lake is still getting worse.					xia, yu/GSM-9714-2022														0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-4559-2; 978-1-5106-4558-5				2021	11857								118570A	10.1117/12.2597710	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2597710													WOS:000796436200007

Results of this study reveal complex proxy responses that are variable in time and influenced by the long-term evolution of the lake and its catchment. A new field sampling approach facilitated continuous and precisely controlled parallel sampling at decadal to sub-annual resolution for mu-XRF element scanning, carbon geochemistry, stable isotope measurements on ostracods, pollen analyses and large-scale thin sections for microfacies analysis. The Holocene chronology is established through microscopic varve counting and supported by accelerator mass spectrometric C-14 dating of terrestrial plant macrofossils, 'whereas the Lateglacial age model is based on delta O-18 wiggle matching with the Greenland NGRIP record, using the GICC05 chronology. Microfacies analysis enables the detection of subtle salimentological changes, proving that depositional processes even in rather large lake systems are highly sensitive to climate forcing. Comparing periods of major warming at the onset of the Lateglacial and Holocene and of major cooling at the onset of the Younger Dryas reveals differences in proxy responses, reflecting threshold effects and ecosystem inertia. Temperature increase, vegetation recovery, decrease of detrital flux and intensification of biochemical calcite precipitation at the onset of the Holocene took place with only decadal leads and lags over a ca. 100 a period, whereas the spread of woodlands and the reduction of detrital flux lagged the warming at the onset of the Lateglacial Interstadial by ca. 500-750a. Cooling at the onset of the Younger Dryas is reflected by the simultaneous reaction of delta O-18 and vegetation, but sedimentological changes (reduction of endogenic calcite content, increase in detrital flux) were delayed by about 150-300 a. Three short-term Lateglacial cold intervals, corresponding to Greenland isotope substages Gl-1d, Gl-1c2 and Gl-1b, also show complex proxy responses that vary in time.

The core was dated to 2100 cal BP based on accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) C-14 dating combined with the constant rate of supply (CRS) model. We identified five palaeoclimatic stages based on the down-core trace elemental characteristics. From ca. 2100 to 1650 cal BP (Stage I), Mn-MAR (mass accumulation rates) and Fe-MAR showed no correlations with Mo-MAR, suggesting that anaerobic conditions limited the adsorption of Mo onto Mn-Fe oxides. From ca. 1650 to 1050 cal BP (Stage II), we identified a weakened aerobic environment, coinciding with the Dark Ages Cold Period due to a decrease in the organic matter (OM), nutrients, Fe-MAR, and Zn-MAR, which inhibited Mo deposition. Salinity (Sr/Ba) did not influence the trace elemental fluxes, OM, or nutrients throughout Stages I and II. We identified aerobic conditions during Stage III (between ca. 1050 and 650 cal BP), coinciding with the Medieval Warm Period, with observed lower salinity that facilitated Al-MAR, Mn-MAR, and Pb-MAR deposition. During the Little Ice Age (between ca. 650 and 30 cal BP; Stage IV), MnMAR, Zn-MAR, and Fe-MAR showed no correlation with Mo-MAR, implying anaerobic conditions. We also identified high salinity and OM concentrations that facilitated trace element deposition. Over the past 95 years (Stage V), high salinity levels have produced the deposition of Al-MAR, Mn-MAR, Zn-MAR, and Fe-MAR. However, the redox conditions in the lake sediment are difficult to interpret due to anthropogenic influences on trace elemental fluxes. We identified a salinity periodicity (Sr/Ba) of 100-150 years and a redox periodicity (Mo-MAR) of 100-260 years using the wavelet power spectrum. Our results indicate a gradual weakening of the East Asian summer monsoon, which may be controlled by insolation in the Dali Lake basin.

Analysis of its status, distribution and the potential causes for the decline in Europe has been undertaken, but there has never been a review of its status in the major part of its breeding range across Russia to the Pacific coast. Methods We reviewed the scientific literature and unpublished reports, and canvassed expert opinion throughout Russia to assess available knowledge about changes in the species distribution and abundance since the 1980s. Results While accepting available information may not be representative throughout the entire eastern range of the species, the review found marked declines in Pochard breeding abundance in the last two decades throughout European Russia. Pochard have also declined throughout Siberia. Declines throughout the steppe region seemed related to local drought severity in recent years, necessitating further research to confirm this climate link at larger spatial scales. Declines in the forest and forest-steppe regions appeared related to the major abandonment of fish farms in western Russia that had formerly provided habitat for breeding Pochard. However, hyper-eutrophication of shallow eutrophic lakes, cessation of grazing and haymaking in floodplain systems necessary to maintain suitable nesting habitat and disappearance of colonies of the Black-headed Gull (Chroicocephalus ridibundus) in a number of wetlands were also implicated. Increasing invasive alien predator species (e.g. American MinkNeovison visonand Raccoon DogNyctereutes procyonoides) and increasing spring hunting were also thought to contribute to declines. Reports of expansion in numbers and range only came from small numbers occurring in the Russian Far East, including on the border with China and the long-established isolated population on Kamchatka Peninsula. Conclusions Widespread declines throughout the eastern breeding range of the Pochard give continued cause for concern. Although we could address all the potential causal factors identified above by management interventions, we urgently need better information relating to key factors affecting site-specific Pochard breeding success and abundance, to be able to implement effective actions to restore the species to more favourable conservation status throughout its breeding range.					; Sukhanova, Olga/X-3615-2018; Kharitonov, Sergey/A-4697-2016	Vaitkuviene, Daiva/0000-0001-6353-3291; 													2053-7166					JUL 14	2020	11	1							23	10.1186/s40657-020-00209-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40657-020-00209-6													WOS:000552844900001
J	Mizuno, H; Fukuta, N				Mizuno, H; Fukuta, N			Natural ice nucleus measurement under high supersaturation	JOURNAL OF THE METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN												To understand ice nucleation under high supersaturation in clouds, measurements of natural ice nuclei for supersaturation with respect to water (S-w) up to 10% from -20 to -24 degrees C were carried out using a horizontal gradient, continuous flow, ice thermal diffusion chamber after solving the spurious count problem due to ice crystal protrusion on the bottom plate with the addition of a small amount of ethylene glycol. The measurements were made with continental air masses in early summer of 1993 at Salt Lake City, Utah in the United States of America. The measured ice nucleus concentration under the condition of -20 degrees C and S-w 5% showed a daily variation. The ice nucleus concentration changed from about 10 l(-1) in a warm air mass to about 1 l(-1) in a cold air mass, respectively, before and after the passage of a cold front in the synoptic scale. It was inferred that the instability of the warm air mass helps raise the particulates from or near the ground to increase the ice nucleus concentration. In order to pick out the supersaturation dependence at the various temperatures, the ratio of the ice nucleus concentration (N) to that at water saturation (N-o) was estimated. On average, S-w increases of 5 and 10% raised the N/N-o ratio by as much as a factor of two or more, respectively. It was found that a general relationship exists between N/N-o and S-w, and the slope further steepens above water saturation.																			0026-1165	2186-9057				DEC	1995	73	6					1115	1122		10.2151/jmsj1965.73.6_1115	http://dx.doi.org/10.2151/jmsj1965.73.6_1115													WOS:A1995TQ28500009

We characterize an episode of rapid episodic uplift occurring between 2002 and 2003 following similar episodes of 1979-1980, 1983, 1989-1990, and 1997-1998. This most recent episode was the first to be observed by a dense array of 13 continuous Global Positioning System (GPS) stations. Similar to previously observed episodes of deformation, uplift is quasi-radially symmetric and is mostly explained by a compact pressure source located similar to 3 km west of the resurgent dome. The maximum uplift during the 2002-2003 episode is similar to 35 +/- 8 mm, about 1/3 the magnitude but with a similar time-dependent behavior as the 1997-1998 episode. The horizontal source location is well constrained at -118.930 degrees, 37.678 degrees, for a small spherical source, and indistinguishable from the location of a vertically dipping prolate spheroidal source. A trade-off between depth and volume change is observed for both spherical and prolate models, with depth between 7.5 and 13.5 km and a volume change of 0.01-0.03 km(3) at 95% confidence. For prolate spheroidal models, depth and volume change are additionally affected by the source axis ratio (b/a), which is greater than 0.55. Though the background seismicity remained low during the 2002-2003 episode, we identified a significant spike in activity during the maximum rate of uplift, similar to observations in both the much larger episodes in 1989-1990, and 1997-1998. More interestingly, we additionally find that all three episodes begin immediately after a short period of seismic quiescence, with background seismicity falling to levels below background levels following the prior uplift event. With the dense GPS coverage, we also identify increased opening of the Mono-Inyo volcanic chain after the 2002-2003 episode suggesting potential interaction of magmatic fluids between the two systems.

Trophic state data were analyzed for the Northeast as a whole and for each of its three major ecoregions-the Adirondacks (ADI), the New England Uplands (NEU), and the Coastal Lowland and Plateau (CLP)-and inferred to the entire population of lakes greater than or equal to 1 ha (N = 11,076). Results were compared to a large, nonrandomly sampled data set for the same area compiled by Rohm and others and contrasted with lake trophic state information published in the National Water Quality Inventory: 1994 Report to Congress [305(b) report. Lakes across the entire Northeast were identified by EMAP data as 37.9% (+/-8.4%) oligotrophic, 40.1% (+/-9.7%) mesotrophic, 12.6% (+/-7.9%) eutrophic, and 9.3% (+/-6.3%) hypereutrophic. Lakes in the ADI and NEU generally are at a low, nearly identical trophic state (96% oligotrophic/mesotrophic), while those in the CLP are much richer (45% eutrophic). EMAP results are similar to results of the Rohm data set across the entire region. In the CLP, however, EMAP identified approximately 45% of the lakes as eutrophic/hypereutrophic, while the Rohm data set identified only 21% in these categories. Across the entire Northeast, the 305(b) report identified a much higher proportion (32.2%) or lakes in eutrophic condition and a much smaller proportion (19.8%) in oligotrophic condition than did the EMAP survey data(12.5% +/- 7.9% and 37.9% +/- 8.5%, respectively). Probability sampling has several advantages over nonrandom sampling when regional resource condition assessment is the goal.																			0364-152X					SEP-OCT	1998	22	5					789	801		10.1007/PL00006707	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/PL00006707								9680546					WOS:000075196600013

Abundance and composition of invertebrate-feeding leeches in relation to fish status in ponds	EUROPEAN ZOOLOGICAL JOURNAL												Leeches feeding on invertebrates are an important component of freshwater communities, including those dominated by fish, but the effects of fish on their abundance and distribution are not well explored. The relative densities and assemblage structure of two leech families, Erpobdellidae and Glossiphoniidae, were studied from May to August 2014 in ponds stocked with low biomass densities of young common carp Cyprinus carpio, too small to prey on leeches (low-fish ponds), and in ponds containing high biomass densities of large (one- or two-year-old) carp (high-fish ponds), using two types of activity traps (placed either on the bottom or near the water surface). The most common and numerous species were Erpobdella octoculata, Helobdella stagnalis, and Erpobdella nigricollis. The traps near the water surface captured relatively small numbers of leeches, yet the catches showed that in summer some of the leeches moved to the upper layers of the water column, which was free of macrophytes. No differences in leech species richness or diversity were found with respect to fish status of ponds; however, bottom erpobdellids were more abundant in high-fish ponds. Redundancy analysis identified the fish status of the ponds and total nitrogen concentration in water as the only significant variables explaining the distribution of leeches among ponds. Species distribution was nested, but the nestedness pattern was not affected by the fish status of the pond. While fish are generally believed to adversely affect macroinvertebrate diversity and abundance, our study shows that some predatory leech species can persist in the presence of fish and possibly indirectly benefit from it.

The study was designed to obtain data on the concentrations of selenium in surface water, sediment and aquatic biota at about 30 sites, including areas upstream (reference sites) and downstream of four coal mines located in west-central Alberta. Sample sites were mostly in lotic systems, but also included an end pit lake and a reference lake. Data from all surveys showed low concentrations of selenium in water at the reference sites. Most of these concentrations were less than the CCME water quality guideline for the protection of freshwater aquatic life. The highest selenium concentrations, often an order of magnitude greater than both the CCME and US-EPA chronic guidelines, were found at sites immediately downstream of 3 mines. Similar high concentrations of selenium were found in the end pit lake compared to the reference lake. Selenium concentrations generally decreased downstream of the mines. Almost all of the selenium in the water samples was in the dissolved form. Selenium concentrations in samples of littoral sediments were always higher in the pit lake than in the reference lake. Selenium concentrations in rainbow trout eggs were greater than in muscle. Selenium in eggs was positively related to selenium in muscle tissues. With few exceptions, the lowest concentrations of selenium in muscle and eggs were found at the reference sites compared to the remaining sites. Greatest mean concentrations of selenium in both muscle and egg tissues were found at the pit lake and stream site closest to one mine. Mean selenium concentrations in rainbow trout muscle and eggs showed a positive correlation with selenium concentrations in surface waters.

J	Higashi, Y; Ytow, N; Saida, H; Seki, H				Higashi, Y; Ytow, N; Saida, H; Seki, H			In situ gradostat for the study of a natural phytoplankton community with an experimental nutrient gradient	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												A new in situ gradostat was devised to study the dynamics of natural communities having nutrient gradients within aquatic habitats. This semi-enclosed mesocosm consisted of three components: i.e. three transparent, concentric cylindrical culture chambers, with diameters of 70, 60 and 40 cm, and 20 cm deep, supported by four flotation buoys, a medium reservoir, and a pump to supply the medium to the mesocosm. Water exchange between compartments was achieved via holes in the cylindrical walls, the number and size of the holes being chosen to regulate the rate of exchange. Sterile culture medium was pumped into the central (first) chamber and diffused outwards into the second and third chambers through the perforated walls. Suitable perforations could achieve a concentration gradient of up to 9.5 times between the first and third chambers within 12 h. The system was designed with the following characteristics: (1) an experimental semi-enclosed system in the natural environment; (2) to maintain equivalence with the external water except for the experimental factors; and (3) to form a manipulable gradient of experimental factors across the mesocosm. Using the in situ gradostat, the response of a natural phytoplankton community to a nitrate gradient was determined. A gradient from oligotrophic to eutrophic was maintained for 10 days in an oligotrophic pond. The mean growth rate of phytoplankton was lower in the eutrophic zone than that in the mesotrophic zone, where the highest mean growth rate was observed. The growth rate of each dominant phytoplankter showed its own pattern, but all rates were highest in the mesotrophic environment of the second chamber. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Reconstruction of climate and ecology of Skagit Valley, Washington, from 27.7 to 19.8 ka based on plant and beetle macrofossils	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Glacial lake sediments exposed at two sites in Skagit Valley, Washington, encase abundant macrofossils dating from 27.7 to 19.8 cal ka BP. At the last glacial maximum (LGM) most of the valley floor was part of a regionally extensive arid boreal (subalpine) forest that periodically included montane and temperate trees and open boreal species such as dwarf birch, northern spikemoss, and heath. We used the modern distribution and climate of 14 species in 12 macrofossil assemblages and a probability density function approach to reconstruct the LGM climate. Median annual precipitation (MAP) at glacial Lake Concrete (GLC) was similar to 50% lower than today. In comparison, MAP at glacial Lake Skymo (GLS) was only similar to 10% lower, which eliminated the steep climate gradient observed today. Median January air temperature at GLC was up to 10.8 degrees C lower than today at 23.5 cal ka BP and 8.7 degrees C lower at GLS at 25.1 cal ka BP. Median July air temperature declines were smaller at GLC (3.4 degrees C-5.0 degrees C) and GLS (4.2 degrees C-6.3 degrees C). Warmer winters (+2 degrees C to +4 degrees C) and increases in MAP (+200 mm) occurred at 27.7, 25.9, 24.4, and 21.2-20.7 cal ka BP. These changes accord with other regional proxies and Dansgaard-Oeschger interstades in the North Atlantic.

J	KREUTZWEISER, DP; THOMAS, DR				KREUTZWEISER, DP; THOMAS, DR			EFFECTS OF A NEW MOLT-INDUCING INSECTICIDE, TEBUFENOZIDE, ON ZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITIES IN LAKE ENCLOSURES	ECOTOXICOLOGY												A potent ecdysone agonist, tebufenozide, has recently been developed as a molt-inducing insecticide to control defoliating lepidopterans. As part of continuing research efforts to assess the effectiveness and environmental safety of this material for insect pest management in Canadian forests, tebufenozide (RH-5992-2F) was applied to large lake enclosures and the effects on zooplankton communities were evaluated. There were significant treatment effects at all test concentrations (0.07-0.66 mg L(-1) tebufenozide). Concentration-dependent reductions in the abundance of cladocerans indicated that there were direct toxic effects of tebufenozide on this group of macrozooplankton. There were no indications of direct toxic effects on copepods. Significant increases in abundance of rotifers in treated enclosures at the three higher test concentrations were coincident with reductions in cladocerans and indicated secondary effects of the insecticide on the abundance of microzooplankton. There were no significant differences among treated and control enclosures in chlorophyll a concentrations, indicating that tebufenozide did not have direct effects on phytoplankton biomass, nor did the alterations in the zooplankton communities of treated enclosures have measurable secondary effects on phytoplankton biomass. Daytime dissolved oxygen concentrations were significantly higher in treated enclosures than in controls, indicating that the perturbation to biotic communities of some treated enclosures was sufficient to induce measurable changes in system-level functional attributes. Recovery of zooplankton communities in the enclosures occurred within 1-2 months at 0.07 and 0.13 mg l(-1) and by the following summer (12-13 months) at 0.33 and 0.66 mg l(-1).																			0963-9292	1573-3017				OCT	1995	4	5					307	328		10.1007/BF00118597	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00118597								24197798					WOS:A1995RZ49500003

Relative abundance, site fidelity, and survival of adult lake trout in Lake Michigan from 1999 to 2001: Implications for future restoration strategies	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We compared the relative abundance of lake trout Salvelinus namaycush spawners in gill nets during fall 1999-2001 in Lake Michigan at 19 stocked spawning sites with that at 25 unstocked sites to evaluate how effective site-specific stocking was in recolonizing historically important spawning reefs. The abundance of adult fish was higher at stocked onshore and offshore sites than at unstocked sites. This suggests that site-specific stocking is more effective at establishing spawning aggregations than relying on the ability of hatchery-reared lake trout to find spawning reefs, especially those offshore. Spawner densities were generally too low and too young at most sites to expect significant natural reproduction. However, densities were sufficiently high at some sites for reproduction to occur and therefore the lack of recruitment was attributable to other factors. Less than 3% of all spawners could have been wild fish, which indicates that little natural reproduction occurred in past years. Wounding by sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus was generally lower for Seneca Lake strain fish and highest for strains from Lake Superior. Fish captured at offshore sites in southern Lake Michigan had the lowest probability of wounding, while fish at onshore sites in northern Lake Michigan had the highest probability. The relative survival of the Seneca Lake strain was higher than that of the Lewis Lake or the Marquette strains for the older year-classes examined. Survival differences among strains were less evident for younger year-classes. Recaptures of coded-wire-tagged fish of five strains indicated that most fish returned to their stocking site or to a nearby site and that dispersal from stocking sites during spawning was about 100 km. Restoration strategies should rely on site-specific stocking of lake trout strains with good survival at selected historically important offshore spawning sites to increase egg deposition and the probability of natural reproduction in Lake Michigan.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				FEB	2007	27	1					137	155		10.1577/M05-214.2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M05-214.2													WOS:000245301700013
J	SLY, PG				SLY, PG			INTERSTITIAL WATER-QUALITY OF LAKE TROUT SPAWNING HABITAT	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Coarse substrates used by spawning lake trout may be degraded when fine sediment fills inter-particulate space, and by the breakdown of organic matter trapped within the substrate. Comparative substrate data were obtained to show how interstitial conditions reflect habitat degradation, and the range of measured values associated with some key parameters. Although some spawning habitats are clearly degraded, the extent to which this influence effects reproductive success remains uncertain. Small dialysis chambers were placed in cobble-gravel substrates, at sites used by spawning lake trout. These were filled with nitrogen-purged distilled water and were allowed to equilibrate with substrate water at depths of about 4-8 cm below sediment surface. Open boxes of artificial substrate (0.25 m2) were placed flush with this surface to collect bedload and deposited fines. Recoveries were made at 1- to 2-week intervals throughout the fall. In two Algonquin lakes where lake trout reproduction is successful, DO concentrations were mostly > 5 mg L-1, dissolved CO2 was generally < 6 mg L-1, and non-ionized ammonia was negligible. At sites in eastern Lake Ontario [USA], there were great differences in water quality depending upon proximity to weed beds and local wind/wave conditions. Low DO (< 0.5 mg L-1) and relatively high non-ionized ammonia (> 30 .mu.g L-1) were associated with degradation of milfoil and, to a lesser extent, Cladophora. In the Finger Lakes, substrate quality was much lower in Seneca Lake (hatchery supported lake trout stock) than in Keuka Lake (wild lake trout stock). Depression of DO followed periods of high particulate flux and this stress was greatest after lake trout spawning, and when rates of degradation are still relatively high.																			0380-1330						1988	14	3					301	315		10.1016/S0380-1330(88)71560-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(88)71560-9													WOS:A1988Q160100006

Long-term effects of a 1940s fertilization experiment on diatoms from Cache Lake (Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada)	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Cache Lake, an ultra-oligotrophic Precambrian Shield lake located in Algonquin Provincial Park (Ontario, Canada), was manipulated in the summers of 1946 and 1947 when approximately 9.4 tons (cumulatively) of 12-24-12 (nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium) fertilizer was added to promote plankton growth and the possible enhancement of fish populations. Little is known about the long-term impacts of this lake manipulation, nor the effects of previous disturbances such as logging in the late-1800s, increased tourism following the extension of the Grand Trunk Railway to Cache Lake in 1895, limited cottage development starting ca. 1905, and subsequent construction of Highway 60 in the 1930s. We used a diatom-based paleolimnological approach to track limnological changes during the past similar to 200 years. Prior to the 1940s, assemblage changes were minimal, although small increases in, for example, Aulacoseira ambigua likely tracked modest nutrient inputs from historical watershed disturbances. The most striking changes were an increase in planktonic Fragilaria tenera and the near extirpation of the previously abundant Discostella stelligera from the sediment record, concurrent with the 1946-1947 lake-fertilization experiment. Although other lake sediment archives in the region record increases in D. stelligera with limnological changes linked to recent climate warming, this taxon never recovered to pre-disturbance abundances in Cache Lake following nutrient enrichment, but continued to be replaced by other planktonic taxa, also linked to recent warming (e.g., F. tenera, Asterionella formosa). The 1940s experimental fertilization has left a long-term legacy on Cache Lake diatoms, despite its return to ultra-oligotrophic conditions.					; Smol, John/A-8838-2015	Ruhland, Kathleen/0000-0003-3994-3666; Smol, John/0000-0002-2499-6696; Wilkins, Christopher/0000-0003-2595-6028; Paterson, Andrew/0000-0002-4296-9528													0921-2728	1573-0417				DEC	2023	70	4					361	370		10.1007/s10933-023-00299-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-023-00299-4		SEP 2023											WOS:001070711000001

The forest elements largely consisted of Betula and its broad-leaved allies viz., Quercus, Corylus and Carpinus interspersed with meadow grasses, Asteraceae, Impatiens, etc. under a warm and moderately humid climate from around 17,100 to 14,700 cal yr BP. Additionally, the increase in organic carbon, enrichment of immobile elements (TiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3) and moderate values of the Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA = similar to 72) reinforce the warm and moderately humid climate in the catchment. Subsequently, at around 14,700 to 10,600 cal yr BP, an increase in alpine-scrub vegetation dominated by Betula, Corylus and Carpinus was observed. The enrichment of (TiO2, Ni and Cr) and slightly higher CIA values (72-78) indicated relatively more humid conditions than earlier climatic conditions. The climate turned cold and dry between 10,600 and 5400 cal yr BP as deduced from the abrupt reduction in the alpine-scrubs and meadow constituents. During this period immobile elements (Al2O3, TiO2, Fe2O3, and Cr) also decreased. In contrast, mobile elements (CaO, Na2O, Sr, and Ba) increased along with a gradual decrease in CIA (minimum at 42.5 cm) and organic carbon content supporting cold and dry climatic conditions. From around 5400 until similar to 1600 cal yr BP, the region saw a return of alpine-scrubs and conifers, indicating a relatively warm and humid climate. Increasing CIA values, organic carbon, and concentration of immobile elements also reaffirm relatively warm and humid climatic conditions. In the most recent phase (around 1600 cal yr BP to present), the climate deteriorated as reflected by the depletion of Betula and broad-leaved associates and an increase in dry elements such as Juniperus and Ephedra. The decrease in CIA values, organic carbon and immobile elements (TiO2, Al2O3, and Fe2O3) substantiate this observation.																			1040-6182	1873-4553				AUG 20	2022	629						53	64		10.1016/j.quaint.2020.12.029	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2020.12.029		JUN 2022											WOS:000833419900001

A method using a priori knowledge and the measured data was proposed to partition particulate scattering and absorption into contributions of phytoplankton and non-algal particles. The results showed that phytoplankton weakly contributed to the particulate scattering and backscattering with the mean b (ph)/b (p) values usually below 10% and b (bph)/b (bt) values of 0.3-3.9% in the whole visible light spectrum, and an approximate relationship of b (bt) a parts per thousand b (bp) a parts per thousand b (bnap) was regarded as reasonable in Lake Taihu. In contrast with scattering and backscattering, phytoplankton made more contributions to the particulate absorption with the mean a (ph)/a (p) values varying in a wide range of about 20-70%. Both the scattering and absorption spectra of non-algal particles can be modeled well by corresponding methods. A power function model was used to simulate the scattering spectra, which presented high predictive accuracies with MAPE values usually below 5% and RMSE values below 1.5 m(-1), while the spectral absorption model also performed well with mean S (nap) being 0.0052 nm(-1) (standard deviation, SD = 0.0010 nm(-1)). As to the phytoplankton absorption, a quadratic function model used was considered to have a good performance with corresponding parameters being supported at each wavelength in the spectral range of 400-700 nm. Additionally, two basic bio-optical parameters were determined, that is, b (nap) (*) (550) = 0.604 m(2) g(-1) and a (ph) (*) (675) = 0.0288 m(2) mg(-1). Overall, these results obtained in the present study supply us with new knowledge about optical properties of suspended particulates in an inland and highly turbid lake (Lake Taihu), which are beneficial to the development of analytical models of water color remote sensing.

In the water cycle analysis, the land surface wetness information plays an important role. TRMM/TMI is a new kind of microwave image unit, and has great potential application in land characteristics analysis, especially in remote sensing of land surface wetness information and the monitoring of flood and drought situations. In this study, the wetness index analysis method was used to analysis surface wetness during the summer of 1998 over Boyang and Tongting lake area in China, and we retrieved the land surface emissivity over the same area to estimate the land surface wetness. To accomplish this, we have first studied the TRMM/TMI forward characteristics. By using the VIDSORT model, we developed wetness indexes BWI by combining three window channels of TRMM/TMI. According to our analysis results, the wetness BWI10 are better than the other indexes. So we use the best wetness indexes (BWI10) sensitive to the land surface wetness changes to do our flood classification and monitoring. In our calibration/validation test, the data from the China L-SAR (located on an airplane) and the Canadian Radar-SAR aboard on the Radarsat were used. At the same time we also have tried to retrieve the surface microwave emissivity from the TMI data. We use the emissivity product to estimate the land surface wetness, and we also got a good result. Future work will focus on investigating possible improvements to the algorithm and extending the testing of the algorithm to other regions.																			0177-7971	1436-5065					2002	80	1-4					59	63		10.1007/s007030200014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s007030200014													WOS:000177090600006
J	Teranes, JL; Bernasconi, SM				Teranes, JL; Bernasconi, SM			The record of nitrate utilization and productivity limitation provided by δ15N values in lake organic matter - A study of sediment trap and core sediments from Baldeggersee, Switzerland	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The response of nitrogen isotopic composition of organic matter to changes in nitrate utilization, N-limitation and lake productivity was studied in Baldeggersee, a small eutrophic lake in central Switzerland. Nitrogen isotope ratios were measured on organic matter accumulation in sediment traps, collected daily from March 1995 through October 1996, and on individually sampled light and dark annual laminae from a 108-yr sediment core sequence (1885-1993). Nitrogen accumulation in the sediment traps averaged 0.04 g N m(-2) d(-1). delta(15)N values of the sediment trap material increased from 11 parts per thousand to 13 parts per thousand (atmospheric N-2) as primary productivity decreased surface water [NO3-] from 1.4 to 0.7 mg N L-1 during the seasonal stratified periods. Very small amounts of isotopically enriched organic matter (delta(15)N similar to 15-20 parts per thousand) of heterotrophic and/or detrital origin accumulated in the winter months. Nitrogen accumulation in the core sediments average 4 g N m(-2) per year. delta(15)N values of the sediment core material increased up-core (from delta(15)N similar to 6 parts per thousand to delta(15)N similar to 11 parts per thousand); several abrupt positive isotope shifts (>2 parts per thousand) occur in the upper Dart of the record. Comparison between sediment delta(15)N values and surface water [NO3-] measurements for the period of 1976-1993 reveals that the abrupt positive delta(15)N shifts occurred in years where unusually large phytoplankton blooms depleted surface waters nitrate to concentrations of <0.7 mg N L-1. A 3 parts per thousand negative delta(15)N shift, observed between 1973-1975 at the time of maximum anoxic conditions and meromixis, can be attributed to phytoplankton incorporation of ammonia, which was present in concentrations of up to 0.7 mg L-1 in the epilimnion. Preservation of isotopic shifts in the sediment core which are clearly related to water column processes, and the similarity of core top delta(15)N values to the weighted average N-isotopic composition of sediment trap material indicate that the sediment record reliably reflects the surface-generated delta(15)N signal. Our results from sediment trap and uppermost core samples provide the first conclusive evidence that N-isotopes in lacustrine organic matter record the increasing isotopic enrichment of surface water NO3- due to its utilization by phytoplankton. Artificial aeration of the Baldeggersee bottom water since 1982 has effectively reduced water column anoxia. Thus, water column denitrification, which could considerably increase the isotopic composition of residual nitrate, does not occur in the present lake. Even so, present day nitrogen isotopic values in the sediment core data are higher than most all previous periods suggesting that water column denitrification has never been a dominant influence on sediment delta(15)N values. Instead, the up-core 6 parts per thousand increase in delta(15)N values better corresponds to the documented history of external N-loading from agricultural runoff in the watershed over the last 100 years. These nitrogen sources have characteristically high delta(15)N values (10-20 parts per thousand) and could lead to progressive N-15-enrichment of the Baldeggersee dissolved inorganic nitrogen pool.

This study evaluated the impacts of extreme drought on waterbird populations in Dongting Lake and surrounding wetlands by analyzing land use, vegetation, and human disturbance. From 2022 to 2024, three synchronous surveys of wintering waterbirds were conducted in Dongting Lake and its surrounding wetlands to gather habitat information. The results indicated that waterbirds tended to disperse to surrounding wetlands following extreme drought in 2023. In 2023, the waterbird population in the managed lakes was higher than that in the four protected areas of Dongting Lake, whereas in 2022 and 2024, the protected areas maintained larger waterbird populations. The redundancy analysis (RDA) results showed that the temperature vegetation drought index (TVDI; characterizing the degree of drought) and the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI; characterizing the distribution of water bodies) were the most important factors influencing the distribution of all waterbird populations. Not all dietary groups of waterbirds showed a positive correlation with the MNDWI in terms of population size, but they exhibited a negative correlation with the TVDI. Meanwhile, habitat quality, food availability, and human disturbance were also important factors affecting the population size of all waterbird species. Waterbirds with different diets exhibited variations in the factors, such as food availability, foraging environment, and human disturbance, impacting their foraging behavior and habitat use. Our study suggested that, following a drought, waterbirds dispersed to surrounding wetlands outside the core nature reserve to cope with the negative impact of drought on habitat suitability. However, not all waterbirds with different diets showed dispersal, reflecting different response patterns to drought due to varying feeding habits and foraging methods. Our findings help better understand waterbirds' responses to extreme drought, which is crucial for wetland management and biodiversity conservation.					tian, yuxin/KTI-5465-2024; Shi, Jiawei/KDU-6911-2024														2045-7758					APR	2025	15	4							e71258	10.1002/ece3.71258	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.71258								40270790					WOS:001472695300001

Introgression of hatchery rainbow trout in naturalized steelhead populations of western Lake Superior	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Fisheries managers and anglers in Minnesota have long been concerned that reproduction in the wild by a hatchery strain of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), called kamloops, could reduce the fitness of naturalized steelhead (migratory rainbow trout) populations in Lake Superior. A previous study found no evidence of kamloops introgression, but a new evaluation is warranted in light of continued stocking and genetic advancements over the past 25 years. We used genotypes from 10 microsatellite DNA loci to assess kamloops ancestry in adult and age-0 rainbow trout samples from 40 streams in Minnesota, one stream in Wisconsin, and two adult broodstocks. We also evaluated genetic population structure for impacts of kamlooops introgression. Overall, the average estimated kamloops ancestry was 8% (range 2-44%) in age-0 juveniles and 4% (1-19%) in adults. The average percentages of kamloops descendants in age-0 and adults were 8% (0-54%) and 5% (0-40%), respectively. Kamloops descendants were found in many Minnesota streams and in Wisconsin's Bois Brule River, but were most prevalent in streams near the source hatchery, near recent stocking locations, and in lower reaches of longitudinally sampled streams. Feral steelhead broodstock had 9% and 6% kamloops descendants in two years while captive broodstock had no kamloops descendants. Minnesota's populations showed little spatial genetic structure but were distinct from the Bois Brule population and from kamloops, which indicated that kamloops introgression had not substantially altered structure. Kamloops introgression into Minnesota steelhead populations and impacts on other jurisdictions contributed to the decision to discontinue the kamloops stocking program.

J	Pisaric, MFJ; Holt, C; Szeicz, JM; Karst, T; Smol, JP				Pisaric, MFJ; Holt, C; Szeicz, JM; Karst, T; Smol, JP			Holocene treeline dynamics in the mountains of northeastern British Columbia, Canada, inferred from fossil pollen and stomata	HOLOCENE												Changes in pollen and stomata assemblages in sediment cores recovered from tundra and forest-tundra lakes in alpine regions of northeastern British Columbia reflect vegetation and inferred climatic change throughout the Holocene. Pollen and stomata records are presented from two lakes, BC2 located in the alpine-tundra zone and Dead Spruce Lake at the present elevation of subalpine treeline. The pollen and stomata records from BC2 indicate that an ephemeral shrub and herb assemblage was rapidly replaced by an aspen (Populus)-spruce (Picea)-birch (Betula) woodland at similar to10600 cal. yr BP. The occurrence of stomata suggests that treeline was at least 235 m higher than present from similar to10 600 until similar to7500 cal. yr BP and temperatures were at least 1.4degreesC warmer than at present. Analyses from Dead Spruce Lake indicate that the density of trees was also higher between 9000 and 4800 cal. yr BP. High concentrations of macroscopic charcoal between similar to9800 and 8000 cal. yr BP suggest that conditions were also drier at this time. Changes in the position of treeline during the early to mid-Holocene appear to track closely shifts in climate, while forest development at our forest-tundra site reflects a combination of both heightened summer insolation and increased fire activity. The fossil stomata record from BC2 suggests that a rapid cooling event at similar to8200 cal. yr BP may have been the trigger that resulted in the downslope movement of treeline to its present elevation. Increased Picea percentages, pollen-accumulation rates (PARs) and concentration of stomata between similar to3600 and 2700 cal. yr BP provide evidence for a late-Holocene increase in forest-tundra density in response to warmer temperatures.

Buck Lake is located in southern Oregon just east of the crest of the Cascade Range, Lacustrine sediments, from 5.2 to 19.4 m in depth in core, contain tephra layers with ages of approximate to 300-400 ka at 9.5 m and approximate to 400-470 ka at 19.9 m, in these sediments magnetic properties reflect the absolute amount and relative abundances of detrital Fe-oxide minerals, titanomagnetite and hematite. The lacustrine section is divided into four zones on the basis of magnetic properties. Two zones (19.4-17.4 m and 14.5-10.3 m) of high magnetic susceptibility contain abundant Fe oxides and correspond closely to pollen zones that are indicative of cold, dry environments. Two low-susceptibility zones (17.4-14.5 m and 10.3-5.3 m) contain lesser amounts of Fe oxides and largely coincide with zones of warm-climate pollen. Transitions from cold to warm climate based on pollen are preceded by sharp changes in magnetic properties. This relation suggests that land-surface processes responded to these climate changes more rapidly than did changes in vegetation as indicated by pollen frequencies. Magnetic properties have been affected by three factors: (1) dissolution of Fe oxides, (2) variation in heavy-mineral content, and (3) variation in abundance of fresh volcanic rock fragments. Trace-element geochemistry, employing Fe and the immobile elements Ti and Zr, is utilized to detect postdepositional dissolution of magnetic minerals that has affected the magnitude of magnetic properties with little effect on the pattern of magnetic-property variation. Comparison of Ti and Zr values, proxies for heavy-mineral content, to magnetic properties demonstrates that part of the variation in the amount of magnetite and nearly all of the variation in the amount of hematite are due to changes in heavy-mineral content. Variation in the quantity of fresh volcanic rock fragments is the other source of change in magnetite content, Magnetic-property variations probably arise primarily from changes in peak runoff. At low to moderate flows magnetic properties reflect only the quantities of heavy minerals derived from soil and highly weathered rock in the catchment. At high flows, however fresh volcanic rock fragments may be produced by breaking of pebbles and cobbles, and such fragments greatly increase the magnetite content of the resulting sediment. Climatically controlled factors that would affect peak runoff levels include the accumulation and subsequent melting of winter snow park, the seasonality of precipitation, and the degree of vegetation cover of the land surface, Our results do not distinguish among the possible contributions of these disparate factors.																			0016-7606					OCT	1996	108	10					1328	1341		10.1130/0016-7606(1996)108<1328:ROMPCC>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0016-7606(1996)108<1328:ROMPCC>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1996VM22300009
J	ROBERTS, MC; CUNNINGHAM, FF				ROBERTS, MC; CUNNINGHAM, FF			POSTGLACIAL LOESS DEPOSITION IN A MONTANE ENVIRONMENT - SOUTH THOMPSON RIVER VALLEY, BRITISH-COLUMBIA, CANADA	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												In the late Wisconsinan, the South Thompson River valley, British Columbia, was occupied by an ice-dammed lake. After the lake drained, the exposed lacustrine silt became the source material for a Holocene loess. The purpose of this paper is to establish the stratigraphic, depositional and geomorphic framework of loess occurring along the South Thompson River valley immediately east of Kamloops, British Columbia. This montane environment of loess deposition was characterised by active slope and fluvial processes depositing sediments contemporaneously with the accumulation of loess. The loess reaches an average of 4 m in thickness in the central part of the valley and thins towards the valley sides. Two tephras-Mount St Helens Y (3.4 ka) and Mount Mazama (6.8 ka)-occur in the loess and are invaluable stratigraphic markers. Most of the loess was probably deposited between 8.2 ka and 3.4 ka, a period coinciding with mid-Holocene increased summer temperatures and decreased precipitation in south-central British Columbia. Debris flows and small streams, originating on the valley sides, flowed out on to the loess depositing sand and gravel beds. These deposits form a definite proximal-distal relation across valley with the slope-derived sediments decreasing and the loess increasing in thickness towards the centre of the valley. The lactustrine silt particles were mobilised by diurnal mountain and valley, gravity, and canalised winds flowing within the South Thompson valley. An analysis of contemporary wind-flow data was undertaken to provide a possible analogue for valley wind flows in the mid-Holocene.																			0267-8179					DEC	1992	7	4					291	301		10.1002/jqs.3390070404	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jqs.3390070404													WOS:A1992KJ76800003

Effects of Fish Populations on Pacific Loon (Gavia pacifica) and Yellow-billed Loon (G. adamsii) Lake Occupancy and Chick Production in Northern Alaska	ARCTIC												Predator populations are vulnerable to changes in prey distribution or availability. With warming temperatures, lake ecosystems in the Arctic are predicted to change in terms of hydrologic flow, water levels, and connectivity with other lakes. We surveyed lakes in northern Alaska to understand how shifts in the distribution or availability of fish may affect the occupancy and breeding success of Pacific (Gavia pacifica) and Yellow-billed Loons (G. adamsii). We then modeled the influence of the presence and abundance of five fish species and the physical characteristics of lakes (e.g., hydrologic connectivity) on loon lake occupancy and chick production. The presence of Alaska blackfish (Dallia pectoralis) had a positive influence on Pacific Loon occupancy and chick production, which suggests that small-bodied fish species provide important prey for loon chicks. No characteristics of fish species abundance affected Yellow-billed Loon lake occupancy. Instead, Yellow-billed Loon occupancy was influenced by the physical characteristics of lakes that contribute to persistent fish populations, such as the size of the lake and the proportion of the lake that remained unfrozen over winter. Neither of these variables, however, influenced chick production. The probability of an unoccupied territory becoming occupied in a subsequent year by Yellow-billed Loons was low, and no loon chicks were successfully raised in territories that were previously unoccupied. In contrast, unoccupied territories had a much higher probability of becoming occupied by Pacific Loons, which suggests that Yellow-billed Loons have strict habitat requirements and suitable breeding lakes may be limited. Territories that were occupied had high probabilities of remaining occupied for both loon species.

Water vapour plays an essential part in atmospheric dynamics. For example, the release of large amounts of latent heat, due to the condensation in convective clouds, plays an important role in the general circulation. Knowledge of the distribution of clouds and its transport is essential to understand atmospheric dynamics. Clouds can have a positive as well as a negative contribution to the greenhouse effect. A cloud cover climatology in a 15 km grid resolution has been retrieved by means of the APOLLO (AVHRR Processing scheme Over clouds, Land and Ocean) algorithm using the 5 calibrated AVHRR channels. The monthly means of total cloud cover are about 15 % too high compared to conventional data, the standard deviation is +/-12 %. The high resolution cloud cover maps show topometeorological features like 'Fohn' on single days but not in monthly means, because these events are too rare. But increased cloud cover in the luff regions are detected in monthly means as well as some cloud sparse regions like Lake Garda, Ticino or the Swiss Phone valley. The different annual cycles of cloud cover show the different climatic regions, which are temperate, Alpine, and Mediterranean climate. This is indicated, for example, by the remarkably smaller cloud cover in the Alpine region in winter as compared to the northern and southern forelands.																					0-8194-2365-3				1996	2961						33	44		10.1117/12.262494	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.262494													WOS:A1996BH01V00004

The wolf population in Michigan's Upper Peninsula may now be reaching saturation, with evidence that some dispersing individuals have traversed the Straits of Mackinac during ice-over winter conditions indicating potential recolonization of northern Lower Michigan. While previous research suggests suitable habitat exists in northern Lower Michigan to support a small wolf population, habitat availability at other hierarchical levels, including den habitat and the ability of individuals to disperse successfully among suitable habitat patches, has not been assessed. We evaluated the den habitat availability and landscape connectivity using a multi-scale modeling approach that integrates hierarchical habitat selection theory as well as spatial structure to assess whether corridors exist for wolves to successfully recolonize and raise pups in northern Lower Michigan. We used expert opinion, scientific literature, and geographical information systems to develop models of landscape suitability, resistance, and least-cost path analysis to identify dispersal corridors throughout the Upper and northern Lower Peninsulas of Michigan. Based on our models, the Upper Peninsula was almost entirely amenable to wolves for both denning and dispersing, particularly in the western portion of the peninsula. Our estimates indicate that over 1900 km(2) of high quality den habitat exists in northern Lower Michigan, but landscape permeability between these habitat patches appeared relatively low relative to Upper Michigan. We delineated several corridors of high quality habitat in the Upper Peninsula that may facilitate dispersal in to Lower Michigan. Dispersal corridors were of moderate quality in northern Lower Michigan, representing higher mortality risk but potentially capable of promoting re colonization of high-quality habitat areas. Conservation efforts within these identified corridors may further increase the potential for successful recolonization and establishment of viable long-term breeding populations of gray wolves in northern Lower Michigan.

Bio-optical properties and estimation of the optically active substances in Lake Tianmuhu in summer	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Bio-optical properties in an optically complex and biologically productive region of Lake Tianmuhu were determined in three cruises from June to August 2006. The concentrations of three optically active substances, tripton C Tripton (calculated from total suspended matter and chlorophyll-a (Chla) and phaeophytin-a (Pa)), phytoplankton pigment C Chla+Pa , and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) a CDOM(440), were predicted from the estimated irradiance reflectance based on in situ measurements and laboratory analyses. The total relative contributions of phytoplankton, tripton, CDOM and pure water over the range of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) (400-700nm) were 36.1%, 24.2%, 15.9% and 23.8%, respectively. The dominant contribution of phytoplankton to the total absorption was due to high phytoplankton pigment concentration. The range and variation in irradiance reflectance and diffuse attenuation coefficient derived from a bio-optical model, based on inherent optical properties, compared well with the measured variability. A reasonably strong relationship (R2=0.92) was observed between irradiance reflectance at 780nm R(780) and C Tripton. For our data set, the best algorithm for C Chla+Pa used the three-band reflectance model [R -1(688)-R -1(717)]xR(747). The a CDOM(440) could be estimated using the ratio of irradiance reflectance R(682)/R(555). The retrieval accuracy (R2) of tripton, phytoplankton pigment and CDOM was 0.92, 0.87 and 0.91, respectively, while the rms. error was 0.90mgl-1 (18.2%), 3.27 mu gl-1 (14.8%) and 0.073m-1 (15.3%), respectively. Estimation of the concentrations of the three optically active substances was reasonably accurate based on inherent optical properties measurement.

Occurrence and Origins of Cerium Dioxide and Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticles in the Loire River (France) by Single Particle ICP-MS and FEG-SEM Imaging	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												The need to quantify engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) in the environment is due to the increasing incorporation of these particles in the daily products, which threatens human health and can possibly impact natural systems. Ceria NPs (CeO(2)NPs) and titanium dioxide NPs (TiO(2)NPs) are two of the most used ENPs in the world. In this study their occurrence was determined in river waters with accurate and relevant techniques such as single particle ICP-MS (spICPMS). In the Loire River (France), the variation of both CeO(2)NPs and TiO(2)NPs could be assessed locally, with an increase of the concentrations near a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) outlet as well as in a lake connected to the river and dedicated to outdoor activities. In the upstream river water, supposedly less impacted by NPs, 6.4 +/- 1.2 x 10(4)part mL(-1)Ce-bearing and 13.4 +/- 1.8 x 10(4)part mL(-1)Ti-bearing particles were measured. These values increased to 33.9 +/- 3.4 x 10(4)part mL(-1)Ce-bearing and 80.3 +/- 3.4 x 10(4)part mL(-1)Ti-bearing particles near the WWTP outlet. Equivalent size for sphere distributions ranged from 24 nm to 70 nm for CeO(2)and from 80 nm to 500 nm for TiO(2)in the river water. In the lake, a raise of the concentrations has been observed with 38.3 +/- 2.0 x 10(4)part mL(-1)and 71.6 +/- 2.1 x 10(4)part mL(-1)containing Ce and Ti, respectively, with similar size distributions. FEG-SEM imaging confirms the occurrence of Ce- and Ti-bearing particles in the water samples. On the contrary, NPs seem to undergo strong heteroaggregation in the Loire river water. The Ce/La elemental ratios does not evolve from upstream to downstream the WWTP outlet, suggesting that a natural origin cannot be excluded to explain the increase observed in NPs number concentration. On the contrary, the Ce/La ratio increases in the outdoor activities center, which suggests the contribution of NPs potentially related to the cars parked nearby. Besides, elemental ratios Ti/V and Ti/Y have been assessed to highlight an anthropogenic source of Ti in both sampling sites, possibly to the sunscreens used during the summer.

NH4Cl-P was depleted with less than half the recommended dose of Al in Lake Vallentuna sediments that contained a low concentration (0.1 mg P g(-1) DW) of BD-P. Lake Finja, on the other hand, with high concentration of BD-P (2.3 mg P g(-1) DW), required three limes the recommended Al dose to deplete NH4Cl-P, indicating that BD-P correlated with NH4Cl-P. Six times the recommended Al-dose converted all BD-P (Fe-P) to NaOH-rP (Al-P) under anoxic conditions in the BD-P rich sediment, while one dose was enough in Lake Vallentuna. Other P-pools, defined by P-fractionations, remained constant. In order to simulate a summer resuspension event, sediments were placed In "resuspension chamber" through which oxygen-saturated water with pH 9.5 passed at 100 cm day(-1). The iron-rich sediment released 1 mg BD-P g(-1) DW of an initial 2.3 mg BD-P g(-1) DW after one day. With addition of 90 mg Al g(-1) DW (6 x recommended dose) the subsequent release when resuspended was only 0.25 mg P g(-1) DW after one day, showing a general increase in P retention capacity with large doses of Al. It is concluded that by transforming all Fe-P to Al-P in surface sediments, this should drastically reduce internal loading of P caused by anoxic hypolimnetic water. Thus, the burial rate of potentially mobile P in accumulation sediments would increase. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Coho salmon emerged 2-3 weeks earlier and were 6-8 mm longer than brook or brown trout at emergence during 1979 in Lake Michigan tributaries where the species were sympatric. During the first summer of life, coho salmon generally were 6-21 mm (7-54%) longer and weighed 0.3-4.1 g more than brook and brown trout. Size at emergence and first-year growth were similar among brook trout and brown trout. In laboratory stream experiments with pairs of the three species, coho salmon dominated brook or brown trout of equal size, and brook trout dominated equal-size brown trout. Competitive superiority of dominant species was based on the ability of fish to defend energetically profitable stream positions during sympatry. When released from competition, subordinate species shifted to use more profitable positions. Specific growth rates of coho salmon in the laboratory equalled rates measured in Lake Michigan tributaries. However, brook and brown trout grew more slowly in the laboratory than in the field, probably because intraspecific competition was high due to lack of cover affording visual isolation. Results suggest that the larger size and competitive superiority of coho salmon should give them an advantage over juvenile brook and brown trout in Great Lakes tributaries when resources become limiting.

J	Battle, JM; Jackson, JK; Sweeney, BW				Battle, Juliann M.; Jackson, John K.; Sweeney, Bernard W.			Annual and spatial variation for macroinvertebrates in the Upper Mississippi River near Cape Girardeau, Missouri	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												We sampled macroinvertebrates at four sites in the Open River section of the Upper Mississippi River near Cape Girardeau, Missouri (Rkm 106-114). In 1999, 2000, and 2002-2004, macroinvertebrates were sampled in the fine sediments downstream of four wing dikes with a Ponar dredge. In 1999 and 2001, macroinvertebrates on rocks were sampled on the upstream face of those same wing dikes with rock baskets. We identified 68 taxa in the fine sediments and 50 taxa on the rocks, with only 27 taxa being found in both. In both habitats, annual variability in population densities and community structure exceeded spatial variability. Macroinvertebrate densities in the fine sediments ranged from approximately 3700 to 11,700 individuals/m(2) with oligochaetes comprising 77-95% of total density. Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling ordination suggests that annual differences in the fine sediment assemblage reflect variation in hydrological conditions (high spring flow and low annual flow). Macroinvertebrate density on the rocks ranged from approximately 57,800 to 163,000 individuals/m(2) with hydropsychid caddisflies (Hydropsyche bidens/orris and Potamyia flava) comprising 82-97% of total density. This dominance of oligochaetes in fine bottom substrates and caddisflies on hard substrates is consistent with many other studies on big rivers in the Mississippi River Basin (e. g., Upper and Lower Mississippi, Ohio, Illinois, and Missouri Rivers), and may be the current "reference condition" for these big rivers. This makes traditional water quality monitoring and assessment efforts using macroinvertebrates more difficult because increased dominance by more pollution tolerant taxa is perceived as evidence of water or habitat degradation. However, macroinvertebrate assemblages in our study reach seem less stressed than other big rivers known to be impaired. Specifically, densities of the pollution-sensitive mayfly Hexagenia indicate that conditions in our study reach have improved markedly since the 1960's.

Combining field observations, 3D hydrodynamic modeling, and particle tracking, we demonstrate that previously undetected V2 Kelvin waves are common in Lake Geneva (Switzerland/France) during summer. V2 Kelvin waves with a 5-d period persisted for over one month in 2021 and 2022. Modeling revealed a complex, spatially heterogeneous vertical structure. Since the lower nodal line depth varied from similar to 150 to 200 m near the shores to similar to 75 m in the lake center, V2 Kelvin waves were restricted to the deep eastern basin (maximum depth 309 m), and nearshore current profiles observed at similar to 110-m depth did not show the typical V2 modal structure. The waves produced large vertical isotherm displacements (similar to 25 m) and strong currents (similar to 28 cm s(-1)) in the nearshore thermocline and induced alongshore transport over nearly half the basin length. Currents were strongest similar to 1 km from shore and decreased exponentially toward the lake center. Our findings explain why previous studies in Lake Geneva's nearshore regions (out to similar to 75-m depth) only detected V1 Kelvin waves and no V2 Kelvin waves. Modeling revealed that V2 Kelvin waves are consistently excited under typical summer stratification and wind forcing conditions. Our results suggest that these waves occur in other large deep lakes having a Burger number , with important implications for the transport and dispersion of sediments, nutrients, and pollutants. Plain Language Summary Wind can generate different types of waves in the interior of stratified lakes that drive basin-wide transport and thereby impact lake biogeochemical development. In large lakes, the Earth's rotation transforms certain waves into shore-hugging waves that travel around the basin. These are called Kelvin waves and play a crucial role in nearshore dynamics. Various types of Kelvin waves exist, for example, vertical mode-one (V1) waves, having two layers where currents flow in opposite directions, which are well documented and vertical mode-two (V2) waves, with a three-layer current structure, which have rarely been observed and whose role is unknown. Combining 3D modeling and observations, we reveal that V2 Kelvin waves are actually common in Lake Geneva (Switzerland/France), traveling around the basin in similar to 5d. They generate (a) currents of similar to 30 cm s(-1), (b) vertical water mass displacements of similar to 25 m near the shores, and (c) strong alongshore transport. They impact nearshore water movement, with important implications for river plume spreading, and transport and mixing of sediments, nutrients, and pollutants. Our results can explain why previous nearshore studies only detected V1 Kelvin waves and indicate that V2 Kelvin waves are probably more common in large, deep lakes than the scarce literature suggests.																			2169-9275	2169-9291				SEP 30	2025	130	10							e2025JC022353	10.1029/2025JC022353	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2025JC022353													WOS:001585590900001

The eastern side of the city has the largest population in Sao Paulo and twenty-four municipal parks. The aim of this study was to investigate Culicidae fauna in two parks on this side of the city and to determine which of the Culicidae species identified have the potential to act as bioindicators and vectors of human pathogens. Culicidae were collected monthly between March 2011 and February 2012 in Carmo Park and Chico Mendes Park with battery-powered aspirators, Shannon traps and CDC traps for adult mosquitoes, and larval dippers and suction samplers for immature mosquitoes. To confirm sample sufficiency, the EstimateS program was used to plot sample-based species accumulation curves and estimate total richness by the Jackknife 1 method. In all, 1,092 culicids from nine genera (Aedes, Anopheles, Coquillettidia, Culex, Limatus, Mansonia, Trichoprosopon, Toxorhynchites and Uranotaenia) and nineteen taxonomic units were collected in Carmo Park. Coquillettidia venezuelensis (Theobald 1912), Aedes scapularis (Rondani 1848) and Culex (Culex) spp. Linnaeus 1758 were the most abundant adults, and Culex (Melanoconion) spp. Theobald 1903 and Anopheles strodei Root 1926 the most abundant immature mosquitoes. In Chico Mendes Park 4,487 mosquitoes in six genera and eighteen taxonomic units were collected. Culex (Cux.) spp. and Ae. scapularis were the most abundant adults, and Ae. albopictus (Skuse 1984) the most abundant immature mosquitoes. The species accumulation curves in both parks were close to the asymptote, and the total richness estimate was close to the observed richness. Some culicid taxons are bioindicators of environmental conditions in the areas they inhabit. It is important to monitor native fauna in municipal parks in Sao Paulo as various species in this study were found to have vector competence and capacity to transmit pathogens, such as arboviruses.					de Sousa, Antônio/X-5615-2019; Ceretti, Walter/F-7916-2014; Medeiros de Sousa, Antonio Ralph/K-2508-2015; Marrelli, Mauro/H-2568-2013	Medeiros de Sousa, Antonio Ralph/0000-0002-9493-8731; Marrelli, Mauro/0000-0002-0312-8777													1676-0603	1676-0611				JUL-SEP	2015	15	3							e20140026	10.1590/1676-0611-BN-2014-0026	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1676-0611-BN-2014-0026													WOS:000375865200003

The effect of calcium on acute sodium chloride toxicity in Daphnia species	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Chloride concentrations in freshwater are rising, with toxic effects on aquatic life. In temperate regions with cold winters, road salt used for deicing paved surfaces is a primary cause. There is evidence that water hardness can modify salt toxicity, but data are insufficient to inform policy. Because calcium is a primary ion influencing water hardness and there is widespread calcium decline in lakes, we examined the effects of varying calcium concentrations on acute salt toxicity in three Daphnia species to gain a greater understanding of the water hardness-salt toxicity relationship. We conducted 48-hr acute sodium chloride (NaCl) toxicity tests, using chloride concentrations as our metric, on neonates less than 24 hrs old in six calcium treatments: 1.5 to 128 mg/L (hardness similar to 7 to 323 mgCaCO3/L). We determined the effective concentration of chloride that was lethal to 10%, 25%, and 50% of the sample populations from each iso-female line in each calcium treatment. Acute NaCl toxicity decreased as calcium concentrations increased. The relationship between NaCl toxicity and calcium concentration differed among Daphnia, such that Daphnia catawba and Daphnia pulex were more sensitive to NaCl in lower calcium treatments and less sensitive in higher calcium treatments compared to Daphnia pulicaria. Our results provide evidence that water quality guidelines are not protective enough for aquatic life in very soft water (<= 3 mg Ca2+/L, 11.3 mg CaCO3/L) because most ECxx values we found for Daphnia were significantly lower than Canada's national guidelines for short-term chloride exposure. There are already many lakes with calcium concentrations below 3 mg/L, and global widespread calcium decline may put more aquatic ecosystems at risk of experiencing NaCl toxicity.																			0730-7268	1552-8618				JAN 23	2025	44	3					718	727		10.1093/etojnl/vgae066	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/etojnl/vgae066		JAN 2025						39849615					WOS:001402908200001
J	Kminek, G; Botta, O; Glavin, DP; Bada, JL				Kminek, G; Botta, O; Glavin, DP; Bada, JL			Amino acids in the Tagish Lake meteorite	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE												High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) based amino acid analysis of a Tagish Lake meteorite sample recovered 3 months after the meteorite fell to Earth have revealed that the amino acid composition of Tagish Lake is strikingly different from that of the CM and Cl carbonaceous chondrites. We found that the Tagish Lake meteorite contains only trace levels of amino acids (total abundance = 880 ppb), which is much lower than the total abundance of amino acids in the Cl Orgueil (4100 ppb) and the CM Murchison (16 900 ppb). Because most of the same amino acids found in the Tagish Lake meteorite are also present in the Tagish Lake ice melt water, we conclude that the amino acids detected in the meteorite are terrestrial contamination. We found that the exposure of a sample of Murchison to cold water lead to a substantial reduction over a period of several weeks in the amount of amino acids that are not strongly bound to the meteorite matrix. However, strongly bound amino acids that are extracted by direct HCl hydrolysis are not affected by the leaching process. Thus even if there had been leaching of amino acids from our Tagish Lake meteorite sample during its 3 month residence in Tagish Lake ice and melt water, a Murchison type abundance of endogenous amino acids in the meteorite would have still been readily detectable. The low amino acid content of Tagish Lake indicates that this meteorite originated from a different type of parent body than the CM and CI chondrites. The parent body was apparently devoid of the reagents such as aldehyldes/ketones, HCN and ammonia needed for the effective abiotic synthesis of amino acids. Based on reflectance spectral measurements, Tagish Lake has been associated with P- or D-type asteroids. If the Tagish Lake meteorite was indeed derived from these types of parent bodies, our understanding of these primitive asteroids needs to be reevaluated with respect to their potential inventory of biologically important organic compounds.

Reassortants of the Highly Pathogenic Influenza Virus A/H5N1 Causing Mass Swan Mortality in Kazakhstan from 2023 to 2024	ANIMALS												In the winter of 2023/2024, the mass death of swans was observed on Lake Karakol on the eastern coast of the Caspian Sea. From 21 December 2023 to 25 January 2024, 1132 swan corpses (Cygnus olor, Cygnus cygnus) were collected and disposed of on the coast by veterinary services and ecologists. Biological samples were collected from 18 birds for analysis at different dates of the epizootic. It was found that the influenza outbreak was associated with a high concentration of migrating birds at Lake Karakol as a result of a sharp cold snap in the northern regions. At different dates of the epizootic, three avian influenza A/H5N1 viruses of clade 2.3.4.4.b were isolated from dead birds and identified as highly pathogenic viruses (HPAIs) based on the amino acid sequence of the hemagglutinin multi-base proteolytic cleavage site (PLREKRRRKR/G). A phylogenetic analysis showed that the viruses isolated from the swans had reassortations in the PB2, PB1, and NP genes between highly pathogenic (HP) and low-pathogenic (LP) avian influenza viruses. Avian influenza viruses A/Cygnus cygnus/Karakol lake/01/2024(H5N1) and A/Mute swan/Karakol lake/02/2024(H5N1) isolated on 10 January 2024 received PB2, PB1, and NP from LPAIV, while A/Mute swan/Mangystau/9809/2023(H5N1) isolated on 26 December 2023 received PB1 and NP from LPAIV, indicating that the H5N1 viruses in this study are new reassortants. All viruses showed amino acid substitutions in the PB2, PB1, NP, and NS1 segments, which are critical for enhanced virulence or adaptation in mammals. An analysis of the genomes of the isolated viruses showed that bird deaths during different periods of the epizootic were caused by different reassortant viruses. Kazakhstan is located at the crossroads of several migratory routes of migratory birds, and the possible participation of wild birds in the introduction of various pathogens into the regions of Kazakhstan requires further study.					; Aubakirov, Nurdos/AGX-4868-2022; Sultankulova, Kulyaisan/AAB-4768-2022; Orynbayev, Mukhit/E-5622-2018; Argimbayeva, Takhmina/AGV-6196-2022; Melisbek, Aibarys/ITT-7701-2023; Karamendin, Kobey/ABF-8722-2021; Burashev, Yerbol/E-5310-2015; Kydyrmanov, Aidyn/P-6522-2017; Kerimbayev, A/AAH-8633-2019; Chervyakova, Olga/H-3095-2015	Burashev, Yerbol/0000-0002-4701-1992; Orynbayev, Mukhit/0000-0002-5882-4964; Argimbayeva, Takhmina/0000-0002-5656-0678; Karamendin, Kobey/0000-0003-0829-3330; Chervyakova, Olga/0000-0002-7954-6246													2076-2615					NOV	2024	14	22							3211	10.3390/ani14223211	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani14223211								39595266					WOS:001363607900001

Spatiotemporal patterns of distributed slip in southern Owens Valley indicated by deformation of late Pleistocene shorelines, eastern California	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												High-resolution elevation surveys of deformed late Pleistocene shorelines and new luminescence dating provide improved constraints on spatiotemporal patterns of distributed slip between normal and strike-slip faulting in southern Owens Valley, eastern California. A complex array of five subparallel faults, including the normal Sierra Nevada frontal fault and the oblique-normal Owens Valley fault, collectively form an active pull-apart basin that has developed within a dextral transtensional shear zone. Spatiotemporal patterns of slip are constrained by post-IR-IRSL (post-infrared-infrared stimulated luminescence) dating of a 40.0 +/- 5.8 ka highstand beach ridge that is vertically faulted and tilted up to 9.8 +/- 1.8 m and an undeformed suite of 11-16 ka beach ridges. The tectono-geomorphic record of deformed beach ridges and alluvial fans indicates that both normal and dextral faulting occurred between the period of ca. 16 and 40 ka, whereas dextral faulting has been the predominant style of slip since ca. 16 ka. A total extension rate of 0.7 +/- 0.2 mm/yr resolved in the N72 degrees E direction across all faults in Owens Lake basin is within error of geodetic estimates, suggesting extension has been constant during intervals of 10(1) -10(4) yr. A new vertical slip rate of 0.13 +/- 0.04 m/k.y. on the southern Owens Valley fault from deformed 160 +/- 32 ka shoreline features also suggests constant slip for intervals up to 10(5) yr when compared to paleoseismic vertical slip rates from the same fault segment. This record supports a deformation mechanism characterized by steady slip and long interseismic periods of 8-10 k.y. where the south-central Owens Valley fault and Sierra Nevada frontal fault form a parallel fault system.																			0016-7606	1943-2674				JUL-AUG	2020	132	7-8					1681	1703		10.1130/B35247.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/B35247.1													WOS:000545115400019

We evaluated the phytoplankton, metaphyton, epipelon, and epiphyton chlorophyll-a in a shallow marginal lake during a prolonged drought with a loss of river-lake connectivity in an artificial wetland system. We relate algal chlorophyll-a changes in different habitats to environmental conditions during the gradual lake volume reduction. Water and algal community samplings were performed monthly in pelagic, sublittoral, and eulittoral zones during a severe drought due to low rainfall in the summer. We used the chlorophyll-a concentration as a proxy for algal biomass. Differences in nutrient concentrations, water transparency, and depth were determined for two limnological phases. TP and light were significant predictors of algal chlorophyll-a. Lake volume continuously decreased and lost connectivity with the river. The drought increased the trophy, evidencing the tenuous threshold between mesotrophy and eutrophy in a subtropical lake. On a temporal scale, we observed the loss of chlorophyll-a in phytoplankton and epiphyton. The chlorophyll-a concentration fluctuated in the epipelon and increased in phytoplankton-metaphyton, especially in the eulittoral. The results showed a close connection between the pelagic and littoral zones. The phenomena that affect the morphometric variables, such as changes in the precipitation regime, can change trophic state lakes and algal community dynamics in marginal lakes. Our findings suggest that mesotrophic marginal lakes can become eutrophic due to the loss of river-lake connectivity, favoring high phytoplankton-metaphyton growth in wetland systems.

Postglacial hydroclimate in the southern interior of British Columbia (Canada): Lake ecosystem response to the Holocene Thermal Maximum and drivers of mid-to-late Holocene climate variability	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) is relatively well-understood both in terms of its external drivers and timing of its expression in different regions across the globe, and has previously been used to investigate lake ecosystem response to a warm and drier climate. However, connections between mid-to-late Holocene climate, associated drivers, and lake response are less understood, particularly in western North America (WNA) where complex topography and differences in proximity to the Pacific coast result in spatially variable responses to ocean-atmosphere processes. Here, we present a multi-proxy paleolimnological record spanning 11,000 years from a small lake in the semi-arid southern Interior Plateau (SIP) of British Columbia. Sub-fossil diatom, trace element (mu XRF via ITRAX), and pollen data indicate that our study lake was shallow, nutrient-poor, and poorly oxygenated during the HTM. High effective moisture (EM) is inferred throughout the mid-Holocene (similar to 6500-2000 calibrated years before present (cal yr BP)), followed by a return to low EM after 2000 cal yr BP. Synthesis of additional SIP diatom records show similarities in EM throughout the Holocene, but most notably, the decline in EM at similar to 2000 cal yr BP. Comparison of patterns in the SIP with additional climate proxy data across WNA, including lake sediment delta O-18 records that are interpreted to represent changes in Pacific ocean-atmosphere processes, suggest that shifts in the mean state of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and associated strength and position of the Aleutian Low, are linked with late Holocene declines in EM throughout the SIP.

J	MORING, JR; NICHOLSON, PH				MORING, JR; NICHOLSON, PH			EVALUATION OF 3 TYPES OF ARTIFICIAL HABITATS FOR FISHES IN A FRESH-WATER POND IN MAINE, USA	BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE												Three types of artificial structures (brush bundles, cinder blacks, tire bundles) were studied along transects in Lac D'or, a boreal, freshwater pond in central Maine. Observations were made of 1,397 adult and juvenile fishes by means of 18 dives during the day and 6 dives during the night in 1990. Cover attracted the five species of fishes in the pond (pumpkinseed, Lepomis gibbosus; chain pickerel, Esox niger; brown bullhead, Ameiurus nebulosus; common shiner, Luxilus cornutus; and golden shiner, Notemigonus crysoleucas). Numbers of fishes were significantly higher in areas with artificial cover (70% of fishes, average counts per transect), or in areas with natural weed beds (29%) than in areas without cover (1%). Pumpkinseeds were distributed about equally in areas with tire bundles (38%), cinder blocks (34%), and brush bundles (28%), whereas golden and common shiners were attracted primarily to brush bundles (62%). Numbers of fishes associated with artificial habitat were significantly higher al night. Common and golden shiners occupied locations on the periphery of structures, whereas pumpkinseeds frequently inhabited recesses of cinder blocks and brush bundles. Associations with artificial habitat decreased rapidly in October when water temperature declined to below 12 degrees C. By early November, as water temperatures decreased to 7 degrees C, fishes moved to the bottom, away from cover, and markedly reduced their movements. Artificial habitats were re-examined in June 1991 following winter ice cover. All structures remained intact, except several branches from submerged brush bundles had been removed by animals, probably beaver Castor canadensis (Castoridae). Although artificial habitat may only serve to redistribute fishes in a lake or pond, such structures are recommended as a long-term option for freshwaters where cover limits carrying capacity of fishes.																			0007-4977	1553-6955				SEP	1994	55	2-3					1149	1159																WOS:A1994QB58400072
J	PHILLIPS, AC; SMITH, ND				PHILLIPS, AC; SMITH, ND			DELTA SLOPE PROCESSES AND TURBIDITY CURRENTS IN PRODELTAIC SUBMARINE CHANNELS, QUEEN INLET, GLACIER BAY, ALASKA	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Large submarine channels lead away from the coarse-grained fjord-head delta in Queen Inlet, Glacier Bay, Alaska. Coarse sediment loads from Carroll Glacier are transported down the delta foreslope and through the submarine channels, and finer material is dispersed throughout the fjord from overflow plumes. Slides and slumps occur intermittently on the delta foreslope. A recording current meter positioned in a submarine channel 1 m above the bottom and 2.7 km seaward from the delta brink indicated during July 1989 predominantly quasi-continuous downfjord currents, although several small surges were also observed. Flows occurred throughout the daily tidal cycle in both neap and spring periods for intervals of up to several hours, often beginning and ending rapidly. Current velocities ranged from 0 to 120 cm.s-1, averaging 12 cm.s-1 over one 56 h period, and 16 cm.s-1 over a 13 h period. Suspended sediment concentrations 1 m above bottom commonly exceeded 2 g.L-1 and attained 8.2 g.L-1. The density added to the bottom flow by high turbidity compensated for density lowered by a slight decrease of salinity attained through mixing with fresh meltwater. The contrast between sporadic surges on the delta foreslope and predominantly quasi-continuous turbidity currents downstream in the submarine channels is interpreted as due to attenuation and overlapping of sediment gravity flows of various sizes and velocities originating at the delta front. The relatively low-density, low-velocity, quasi-continuous currents transport large volumes of sediment through the channels, and probably play an important role in maintaining channel form.					; Smith, Norman/W-1201-2019	Phillips, Andrew/0000-0002-4624-7442; 													0008-4077	1480-3313				JAN	1992	29	1					93	101		10.1139/e92-010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/e92-010													WOS:A1992HL57100011

Elemental proxy evidence for late Quaternary palaeoenvironmental change in southern African sedimentary records: interpretation and applications	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY												Sediments are the most important source of Late Quaternary palaeoclimate information in southern Africa, but have been little studied from a geochemical perspective. However, recent advances in analytical techniques that allow rapid and near-continuous elemental records to be obtained from sedimentary sequences has resulted in the increasing use of elemental indicators for reconstructing climate. This paper explores the diverse information that can be acquired from the inorganic component of sediments and reviews some of the progress that has been made over the last two decades in interpreting the climatic history of southern Africa using elemental records. Despite the general scarcity of elemental records, excellent examples from the region exist, which provide some of the longest and most highly resolved sequences of environmental change currently available. Records from Tswaing crater and marine deposits on the southern KwaZulu-Natal coastline have provided rare glimpses into hydroclimate variability over the last 200 000 years, suggesting that summer rainfall in the region responded predominantly to insolation forcing on glacial interglacial timescales. Over shorter timescales, lakes and wetlands found in the Wilderness embayment on the southern Cape coast and along the Maputaland coast in north-eastern South Africa have yielded highly-resolved elemental records of Holocene environmental change, providing insight into the changing interactions between tropical (e.g., El Nino-Southern Oscillation) and temperate (e.g., mid-latitude westerlies) climate systems affecting rainfall variability in the region. The examples discussed demonstrate the multiple environmental processes that can be inferred from elemental proxies and the unique insight this can provide in advancing our understanding of past climate change on different timescales. The interpretation of geochemical data can be complicated by the complex nature of sedimentary environments, various proxy assumptions and analytical challenges, and the reliability of sediment-based climate reconstructions is substantially enhanced through multi-proxy approaches.

(Cnidaria: Myxosporea) from the gills of muskellunge Esox masquinongy Mitchill(Esociformes: Esocidae)	SYSTEMATIC PARASITOLOGY												Henneguya Thelohan, 1892 is the second most species rich genus of myxozoans, with reports from freshwater and marine fish worldwide. In the Great Lakes region of North America, muskellunge Esox masquinongy is an important game fish species that serves as an apex predator in the ecosystems of many inland lakes. The myxozoan fauna of esocid fish, especially muskellunge, remains largely understudied. During fish health assessments, muskellunge were examined for parasitic infections and myxozoan pseudocysts were observed on gill clip wet mounts. When ruptured under pressure, the intralamellar pseudocysts released thousands of myxospores consistent with those of the genus Henneguya. The myxospores were 67.3-96.6 (79.1 +/- 5.9) mu m in total length. The spore body was 18.6-22.6 (20.9 +/- 1.0) mu m x 5.4-6.9 (6.3 +/- 0.4) mu m in valvular view and 3.5-4.0 (3.8 +/- 0.3) mu m wide in sutural view. The two pyriform polar capsules positioned at the anterior of the spore body were 6.4-7.7 (7.0 +/- 0.4) mu m x 1.8-2.1 (2.0 +/- 0.1) mu m and each contained a tightly coiled polar filament with 9-10 turns. Two tapering caudal processes extended from the posterior of the spore body and were 47.3-75.6 (58.3 +/- 5.8) mu m in length. Histologically, large intralamellar polysporic plasmodia were surrounded by plump pillar cells and a distinct layer of plasma. Mild inflammation was present peripherally, with small numbers of necrotic germinative cells and intraplasmodial phagocytes internally. Ribosomal 18S rRNA gene sequence data were obtained from three gill pseudocysts. The three similar to 2000-bp sequences were identical, but shared no significant similarity with any publicly available sequence data. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated sequence data from this Henneguya fell within a well-supported Glade of Henneguya spp. reported from northern pike Esox lucius in Europe. Based on the distinct morphological, histological and molecular data, this species is designated as Henneguya michi-ganensis n. sp. from muskellunge in Michigan, USA.					; Loch, Thomas/AAC-1475-2020; faisal, M/GQB-4757-2022	Griffin, Matt/0000-0002-7920-3446; Loch, Thomas/0000-0002-6985-2477; 													0165-5752	1573-5192				APR	2021	98	2					119	130		10.1007/s11230-021-09965-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11230-021-09965-5		MAR 2021						33687653					WOS:000626795600002

In this study, we propose a novel framework integrating quantile regression with interpretable machine learning. In the first stage of the framework, we estimate the upper boundary of a driver-response relationship using quantile regression. Next, we calculate "potentials " of the response variable depending on the driver, which are defined as vertical distances from the estimated upper boundary of the relationship to observations in the driver-response variable scatter plot. Finally, we identify key factors impacting the potential using a machine learning model. We illustrate the necessary steps to implement the framework using the total phosphorus (TP)-Chlorophyll a (CHL) relationship in lakes across the continental US. We found that the nitrogen to phosphorus ratio (N:P), annual average precipitation, total nitrogen (TN), and summer average air temperature were key factors impacting the potential of CHL depending on TP. We further revealed important implications of our findings for lake eutrophication management. The important role of N:P and TN on the potential highlights the co-limitation of phosphorus and nitrogen and indicates the need for dual nutrient criteria. Future wetter and/or warmer climate scenarios can decrease the potential which may reduce the efficacy of lake eutrophication management. The novel framework advances the application of quantile regression to identify factors driving observations to approach the upper boundary of driver-response relationships.

Among the matrices used for OHCs biomonitoring, feathers are particularly useful as they can be collected in a minimally or non-invasive manner. In this study, concentrations of various legacy OHCs -polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polybmminated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs)-, as well as emerging OHCs -per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and organophosphate ester flame retardants (OPEs)- were determined in feathers of 72 Eurasian eagle-owls (Bubo bubo) from Norway, with the goal of studying spatiotemporal variation using a non-invasive approach. Molted feathers were collected at nest sites from northern, central and southern Norway across four summers (2013-2016). Additionally, two museum-archived feathers from 1979 to 1989 were included. Stable carbon (delta 13C) and nitrogen isotopes (delta 15N) were used as dietary proxies. In total, 11 PFAS (sum range 8.25-215.90 ng g(-1)), 15 PCBs (4.19-430.01 ng g(-1)), 6 OCPs (1.48-220.94 ng g(-1)), 5 PBDEs (0.21-5.32 ng g(-1)) and 3 OPEs (4.49-222.21 ng g(-1)) were quantified. While we observed large variation in the values of both stable isotopes, suggesting a diverse diet of the eagleowls, only delta 13C seemed to explain variation in PFAS concentrations. Geographic area and year were influential factors for delta 15N and delta 13C. Considerable spatial variation was observed in PFAS levels, with the southern area showing higher levels compared to northern and central Norway. For the rest of OHCs, we observed between-year variations; sum concentrations of PCBs, OCPs, PBDEs and OPEs reached a maximum in 2015 and 2016. Concentrations from 1979 to 1989 were within the ranges observed between 2013 and 2016. Overall, our data indicate high levels of legacy and emerging OHCs in a top predator in Norway, further highlighting the risk posed by OHCs to wildlife.

Opal-A in Glassy Pumice, Acid Alteration, and the 1817 Phreatomagmatic Eruption at Kawah Ijen (Java), Indonesia	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												At Kawah Ijen (Indonesia), vigorous SO2 and HCl degassing sustains a hyperacid lake (pH similar to 0) and intensely alters the subsurface, producing widespread residual silica and advanced argillic alteration products. In 1817, a VEI 2 phreatomagmatic eruption evacuated the lake, depositing a widespread layer of muddy ash fall, and sending lahars down river drainages. We discovered multiple types of opaline silica in juvenile low-silica dacite pumice and in particles within co-erupted laharic sediments. Most spectacular are opal-replaced phenocrysts of plagioclase and pyroxene adjacent to pristine matrix glass and melt inclusions. Opal-bearing pumice has been found at numerous sites, including where post-eruption infiltration of acid water is unlikely. Through detailed analyses of an initial sampling of 1817 eruption products, we find evidence for multiple origins of opaline materials in pumice and laharic sediments. Evidently, magma encountered acid-altered materials in the subsurface and triggered phreatomagmatic eruptions. Syn-eruptive incorporation of opal-alunite clasts, layered opal, and fragment-filled vesicles of opal and glass, all suggest magma-rock interactions in concert with vesiculation, followed by cooling within minutes. Our experiments at magmatic temperature confirm that the opaline materials would show noticeable degradation in time periods longer than a few tens ofminutes. Some glassy laharic sedimentary grains aremore andesitic than themain pumice type and may represent older volcanic materials that were altered beneath the lake bottom and were forcefully ejected during the 1817 eruption. A post-eruptive origin remains likely for most of the opal-replaced phenocrysts in pumice. Experiments at 25 degrees C and 100 degrees C reveal that when fresh pumice is bathed in Kawah Ijen hyperacid fluid for 6 weeks, plagioclase is replaced without altering either matrix glass or melt inclusions. Moreover, lack of evidence for high-temperature annealing of the opal suggests that post-eruption alteration of pumice is more likely than pre-eruption envelopment of euhedral opal-replaced phenocrysts in dacitic melt. At Ijen and elsewhere, the ascent of magma into hydrous acid-altered mineral assemblages (e.g., opal, kaolinite, alunite) could induce rapid dehydration of hydrous minerals and amorphous materials, generating considerable steam and contributing to magmatic-hydrothermal and phreatomagmatic explosions.

Effects of Hypoxia on Habitat Quality of Reservoir Largemouth Bass, Saugeye, and White Crappie	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Hypoxia induced by eutrophication and high summer temperatures is common in most Midwestern reservoirs, with uncertain effects on resident fishes. To evaluate the potential influence of low dissolved oxygen (DO) and high-temperature conditions on habitat quality for three common sport fishes (Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides, saugeye [Walleye Sander vitreus x Sauger S. canadensis], and White Crappie Pomoxis annularis), we used spatially explicit bioenergetics models to measure growth rate potential (GRP) in three Ohio reservoirs of varying productivity and size. Dissolved oxygen, temperature, and prey biomass data were collected throughout each study reservoir during August in 2015 or 2016, when temperature and hypoxia levels were expected to be at or near their peak. Growth rate potential was generally low in hypoxic bottom waters and higher in the epilimnion due to prey concentrating above the oxycline. The amount of high-quality habitat (HQH; i.e., GRP > 0 g/g/d) always declined owing to hypoxia; however, the extent of the decline depended on the modeled species and reservoir. Among species, hypoxia-induced losses of HQH were small, differing by less than 8% in each reservoir. Among-reservoir differences in HQH were greater; reductions in HQH ranged from 31.3% to 42.5% among species in the reservoir with the lowest DO (mean +/- SE = 2.7 +/- 0.04 mg/L) and highest gape-appropriate prey biomass (5.1 +/- 0.07 to 5.3 +/- 0.07 g/m(3)), whereas they varied by 0.3-0.6% in the reservoir with the highest DO (5.1 +/- 0.07 mg/L) and lowest gape-appropriate prey biomass (0.2 +/- 0.004 to 0.6 +/- 0.01 g/m(3)). Even so, the reservoir with the lowest mean DO (i.e., greatest hypoxic extent) had the highest mean GRP and percentage HQH owing to high prey biomass. Collectively, our findings indicate that bottom hypoxia can reduce sport fish habitat quality in temperate reservoirs, but high prey biomass may mitigate the negative effect of hypoxia.					; Ludsin, Stuart/F-2925-2010; Conroy, Joseph/C-4463-2008	Dillon, Rebecca/0000-0003-0665-7794; Conroy, Joseph/0000-0002-9561-7294; Budnik, Richard/0000-0003-4639-8563													0002-8487	1548-8659				JAN	2021	150	1					75	88		10.1002/tafs.10272	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tafs.10272		JAN 2021											WOS:000607258600001

Two well-preserved outcrops -8 km apart and inferred to be within similar to 10-50 km from source represent the discontinuously exposed, layered, paleosol-bounded, phreatomagmatic AO Member. They show an identical phenocrystal assemblage of feldspar, biotite and amphibole without weathered zones or signs of erosion, that suggest deposition in one eruption phase lasting hours to months. The succession contains three subunits: 1) subunit A, 1.8 m thick, a series of well-sorted fine to coarse ash or lapilli tuff layers with constant thickness; 2) subunit B, 2.1 m thick, a series of normal-graded layers with an upper fine-grained zone containing abundant ash aggregates with a coarser-grained core and distinctively finer-grained outer rim; 3) subunit C, 4.5 m thick, a massive, poorly to well-sorted coarse ash with gas escape structures and ash aggregates at its base. The upward change of these lithofades implies an initially sustained dry fallout-dominated deposition of ash and pumice lapilli resulting in subunit A. Subsequently, multiple wet and dilute Pyroclastic Density Currents (PDCs) dispersed subunits B and C. The general abundance of PDC-related ash aggregates in the middle-upper part of the succession (particularly in subunit B), and the transformation of a fall-dominated to a collapsing depositional regime producing wet dilute PDCs, imply the increasing influence of water during the eruption (Phreatoplinian sensu lato). The presence of water is related to an epicontinental sea during Middle to Late Miocene in the Carpatho-Pannonian region. The transition from an initial dry magmatic phase generated fallout activity followed by the emplacement of wet PDCs' rich in ash aggregates, when external water infiltrated from a surrounding lake or sea water entered the vent.

J	Kaakinen, A; Lunkka, JP				Kaakinen, A; Lunkka, JP			Sedimentation of the Late Miocene Bahe Formation and its implications for stable environments adjacent to Qinling Mountains in Shaanxi, China	JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES												An important key site along the Babe River in the Lantian area, Shaanxi Province, northern China exposes a conformable sedimentary sequence that records the transition from early Late Miocene fluvial sediments into Late Miocene and Pliocene aeolian Red Clay, and finally into Pleistocene loess. Although the Red Clay and Pleistocene loess in northern China have been intensively studied over the years, the Bahe Formation, beneath the Red Clay in the Lantian area, has been less well studied. Here we present the preliminary results of a detailed lithostratigraphical investigation of the Bahe Formation on the northern slopes of the Bailuyuan Plateau and discuss the style of sedimentation during its deposition. The Bahe Formation in the Lantian area, is composed of fluvial and lacustrine deposits laid down in the Weihe Graben during the Late Miocene. Six main facies assemblages have been distinguished: (1) massive or crudely bedded conglomerates, (2) cross-stratified conglomerate and sandstone deposits, (3) minor sandstone deposits, (4) fine-grained deposits, (5) gritty mudstone and sandstone deposits and (6) marl deposits. These assemblages represent the deposits of active channels, crevasse splays, sheet floods, and floodplains with paleosols and lakes. Thick and laterally pervasive units of fine-grained sediments, formed as suspension fall-out on the floodplain, indicating low-energy conditions and a relatively gentle surface gradient in the area, are by far the most common sedimentary component. Channel-related sandstones and conglomerates indicate that the rivers had a low-sinuosity and were braided, to anastomosing types. The Bahe fluvial system operated for several million years in a tectonically inactive setting in a vegetated area under a relatively arid climate. This environmental interpretation is consistent with that derived from the interpretation of the vertebrate fossil fauna recovered from the sediments. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Environmental modulators of diluted bitumen effects in juvenile pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha)	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Recent and potential expansions in the transportation of diluted bitumen (dilbit) through marine terminals in coastal regions of British Columbia require the examination of potential risks to estuarine species such as Pacific salmon. The estuarine habitat of out-migrated pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) exhibits dynamic temperature and salinity regimes, possibly modifying dilbit exposure, bioavailability and/or its effects. To examine dilbit toxicity and its modification by environmental stressors, juvenile pinks were subchronically exposed for 3 months to the water-accommodated fraction (WAF) of Cold Lake Blend dilbit (winter) in seawater at three salinities (7, 14, and 28%o [temperature 12.5 degrees C]) and three temperatures (8.5, 12.5, and 16.5 degrees C [salinity of 28%o]). Temperature and salinity alone did not affect any measured endpoints in control fish. Dilbit exposure induced higher mortality at high (16.5 degrees C) and low temperatures (8.5 degrees C) as well as at higher salinity (28%o) in fish exposed to the highest dilution of WAF [total polycyclic aromatic compounds (TPAC) = 128.9 mu g/L]. A concentration-dependent reduction of growth was evident in fish exposed to the medium (TPAC = 97.3 mu g/L) and high dilution of WAF at higher temperatures (12.5 and 16.5 degrees C) and high salinity (28%o). At 28%o, swimming performance (Uburst) was decreased in fish exposed to the highest concentration of dilbit at all 3 temperatures. Gill Na+-K+-ATPase activity, white muscle lactate, glycogen, and triglyceride concentrations were altered by dilbit exposure and modified by temperature and salinity. In addition, gene expression associated with phase I biotransformation, energy metabolism, mitochondrial activity, and inflammation showed significant upregulation with exposure and temperature stress. Dilbit exposure at PAC concentrations in the ppb range, affected pink salmon at the molecular, biochemical, and whole organism level; effects that were exacerbated by environmental temperature and salinity.

Historical data on densities of fingernail clams were obtained from regional scientists and published literature. We also sampled benthos in six navigation pools in summer 1991, finding very few fingernail clams. The combined data set, including historical data and sampling results, extended from 1973 to 1992 and was sufficient to statistically evaluate trends in densities of fingernail clams in eight pools. Populations of fingernail clams declined significantly in five of the eight pools examined (Pools 2, 5, 7, 9, and 19), which spanned a 700-km reach on fingernail clam abundance, averaged 30000 m(-2) in 1985 and progressively declined to zero in 1990. Combined data from all eight pools showed a significant decline in abundance of fingernail clams. An evaluation of potential causal factors led us to hypothesize that the population declines in Pools 2 to 9 were linked to point-source pollution rather than to dredging activity or commercial navigation traffic. In Pool 19, the declines of fingernail clams may have resulted from low-flow conditions during drought periods, but the causal mechanisms by which low flow influences fingernail clam abundance are unclear. The decrease in fingernail clam populations may adversely affect certain fish and wildlife, such as migrating lesser scaup Aythya affinis, which feed heavily on the small mollusk. Moreover, the decreases in populations of this pollution-sensitive mollusk may signal a large-scale deterioration in the health of this riverine ecosystem.					; Sparks, Richard/B-6121-2015	Newton, Teresa/0000-0001-9351-5852; 													0018-8158					MAY 19	1995	304	3					209	220		10.1007/BF02329315	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02329315													WOS:A1995RH46200005

Estimated exposure to mercury from fish consumption among women anglers of childbearing age in the Great Lakes region	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Women of childbearing age (WCBA) are advised by state, tribal, and federal agencies to limit their consumption of certain fish, in part, because of concerns about the ingestion of methylmercury and its impact on the development of fetuses. We studied the fish-eating habits of WCBA who had a fishing license and lived near the Great Lakes, where mercury in locally-caught fish is a concern, as these women were likely at greater risk of elevated mercury exposure than the general population. We used a web-based diary method to gather fish consumption data from WCBA anglers over a 4-month period in the summer of 2014. We estimated mercury intake based on reported mercury content of species consumed, frequency of consumption, and meal portion size, and calculated percent exceeding the USEPA reference dose (RfD). Based on these calculations, we estimated that study participants (n = 1395) ingested 0.031 +/- 0.002 (95% CI) ug/kg/d of methylmercury (arithmetic mean). We also found that 3.4% of study participants exceeded the RfD when we averaged estimated intake over the 4-month study period. While most (82%) of the fish meals WCBA anglers ate were purchased fish meals generally low in mercury, study participants ingested a disproportionate amount of mercury from locally caught fish meals (18% of meals contributed 37% of mercury intake). We estimated 11% of WCBA anglers who did not follow state and federal guidelines in effect at the time of our study exceeded the mercury RfD, whereas fewer than 1% of WCBA anglers who followed the guidelines exceeded the RfD. These findings highlight the importance of encouraging WCBA to follow guidelines from agencies for locally-caught fish, in combination with guidelines for purchased fish.																			0013-9351	1096-0953				APR	2019	171						11	17		10.1016/j.envres.2019.01.005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2019.01.005								30641368					WOS:000460081300002
J	Chen, H; Maun, MA				Chen, H; Maun, MA			Population ecology of Cirsium pitcheri on Lake Huron sand dunes.: III.: Mechanisms of seed dormancy	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												Growth chamber studies were conducted to examine seed dormancy and germination requirements of Pitcher's thistle (Cirsium pitcheri (Torr. ex Eaten) Torr. & Gray), a threatened species endemic to the shoreline sand dunes of the Great Lakes. We determined the effects of different, environmental regimes on breaking seed dormancy of this monocarpic perennial. The data showed that seeds of C. pitcheri possessed innate dormancy that was caused by a hard seed coat as well as inhibitory compounds within the seed. Seed germination requirements were very specific. Exposure of seeds to different temperatures and photoperiods in a growth chamber had little effect on breaking seed dormancy unless the seeds had been pretreated. Pretreatment of seeds by cold stratification and its duration, scarification by sand paper or sulphuric acid, and application of gibberellic acid were also not very effective for breaking dormancy of C. pitcheri. High germination was obtained only when seeds were pretreated either by surgically removing the seed coat or by nicking the seed on the radicle or cotyledonary end. After this pretreatment seeds germinated over a temperature range of 15-30 degrees C, but the highest proportion of seeds germinated when temperatures were above 20 degrees C. Under natural conditions, germination of C. pitcheri seeds occurs in spring after they have overwintered and experienced the pretreatment of stratification and scarification through freezing and thawing of the substrate. Aqueous extract of C. pitcheri seeds had a strong inhibitory effect on germination of Oenothera biennis L. seeds indicating an allelopathic chemical in the seed. There was no relationship between the seed size of C. pitcheri and the germinability of seeds.																			0008-4026					APR	1998	76	4					575	586		10.1139/b98-029	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b98-029													WOS:000075420600003

Nonetheless, when prey availability declines, interspecific competition among consumers should increase and could lead to increased intraguild predation. We examined these potential effects in a generalist predator of the tundra, the Glaucous Gull (Larus hyperboreus), over a 7-yr period characterized by large fluctuations in lemming abundance, a potential prey item for gulls. We studied diet by analyzing regurgitated pellets collected at nests and blood nitrogen and carbon stable isotopes, and we monitored annual nesting density and reproductive success on Bylot Island, Nunavut, Canada. Stable isotopes revealed a relatively similar contribution of terrestrial and marine food sources to the gull diet, although the terrestrial contribution increased in the year of high lemming abundance. According to analysis of pellets, diet during incubation was dominated by geese and lemmings, whereas geese were the main prey during chick-rearing. As expected for a generalist predator, annual variation in diet during incubation reflected overall lemming abundance, and the increased consumption of geese during chick-rearing was associated with an influx of goose families into the study area at that time. Gull nest density, laying date, clutch size, and mass gain of chicks did not vary with lemming population fluctuations. Hatching success, on the other hand, was positively related to lemming abundance and was greater for nests located on islets than for those along the shores of ponds and lakes. Intraguild predation on gull eggs by predators such as Arctic foxes, which primarily feed on lemmings during the summer, was probably the main cause of nest failure. Although a generalist predator like the Glaucous Gull has a diversified diet and may feed only opportunistically on lemmings, our results suggest that large cyclical fluctuations in lemming abundance may still affect gull reproductive success through intraguild predation.					; Gilles Gauthier, Gilles/AEK-9959-2022	Gauthier, Gilles/0000-0002-2624-3508; Legagneux, Pierre/0000-0002-6366-0554; 														1938-4254				JUL	2015	132	3					735	747		10.1642/AUK-14-273.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1642/AUK-14-273.1													WOS:000358289000020

Heterotrophic Bacteria Dominate Catalase Expression during Microcystis Blooms	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CHABs) threaten freshwater ecosystems globally through the production of toxins. Toxin production by cyanobacterial species and strains during CHABs varies widely over time and space, but the ecological drivers of the succession of toxin-producing species remain unclear. In the oligotrophic oceans, key autotrophs depend on "helper" bacteria to reduce oxidative stress from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the extracellular environment. H2O2 is also a ubiquitous stressor in freshwaters, but the effects of H2O2 on autotrophs and their interactions with bacteria are less well understood in freshwaters. Naturally occurring H2O2 in freshwater systems is proposed to impact the proportion of microcystin-producing (toxic) and non-microcystin-producing (nontoxic) Microcystis in blooms, which influences toxin concentrations and human health impacts. However, how different strains of Microcystis respond to naturally occurring H2O2 concentrations and the microbes responsible for H2O2 decomposition in freshwater cyanobacterial blooms are unknown. To address these knowledge gaps, we used metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to track the presence and expression of genes for H2O2 decomposition by microbes during a cyanobacterial bloom in western Lake Erie in the summer of 2014. katG encodes the key enzyme for decomposing extracellular H2O2 but was absent in most Microcystis cells. katG transcript relative abundance was dominated by heterotrophic bacteria. In axenic Microcystis cultures, an H2O2 scavenger (pyruvate) significantly improved growth rates of one toxic strain while other toxic and nontoxic strains were unaffected. These results indicate that heterotrophic bacteria play a key role in H2O2 decomposition in Microcystis blooms and suggest that their activity may affect the fitness of some Microcystis strains and thus the strain composition of Microcystis blooms but not along a toxic versus nontoxic dichotomy. IMPORTANCE Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CHABs) threaten freshwater ecosystems globally through the production of toxins. Toxin production by cyanobacterial species and strains during CHABs varies widely over time and space, but the ecological drivers of the succession of toxin-producing species remain unclear. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is ubiquitous in natural waters, inhibits microbial growth, and may determine the relative proportions of Microcystis strains during blooms. However, the mechanisms and organismal interactions involved in H2O2 decomposition are unexplored in CHABs. This study shows that some strains of bloom-forming freshwater cyanobacteria benefit from detoxification of H2O2 by associated heterotrophic bacteria, which may impact bloom development.					; Cory, Rose/C-4198-2016; Dick, Gregory/D-8901-2012; Kling, George/C-7867-2015	Smith, Derek/0000-0002-0895-5712; 													0099-2240	1098-5336				JUL 26	2022	88	14								10.1128/aem.02544-21	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/aem.02544-21		JUL 2022						35862723					WOS:000823132700002
J	Sychra, J; Adámek, Z				Sychra, Jan; Adamek, Zdenek			The impact of sediment removal on the aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblage in a fishpond littoral zone	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Bottom sediment removal, a widely used technique in restoration management of standing water bodies, has a strong influence on communities of aquatic organisms. As most information on the impact of sediment removal on the aquatic environment comes from studies on lakes, the aim of this study was to describe macroinvertebrate assemblage succession in a fishpond (Stepanek fishpond, Bohemian-Moravian highlands, Czech Republic) littoral zone following restoration by sediment removal during the winter of 2003/2004. Semi-quantitative hand net sampling was undertaken one year before (2003) and in each of the following five years (2004-2008) after sediment removal. A significant decrease in both abundance (approx. 90% of individuals) and diversity (approx. 30% of taxa) of macroinvertebrates was detected immediately after pond restoration. The values gradually increased over subsequent years, reaching comparable abundance and diversity three years after sediment removal. A significant shift was recorded in the taxonomic and functional composition of the macroinvertebrate assemblage after sediment removal. Mayfly larvae were the dominant invertebrates before restoration, while chironomid larvae and oligochaetes dominated after sediment removal. Phytophilous taxa, grazers and scrapers, and swimming or diving invertebrates were common in 2003, whilst open-water taxa preferring mud and other mostly inorganic microhabitats, gatherers/collectors, and burrowing/boring invertebrates were relatively common after sediment removal. In 2008, the assemblage reverted towards the situation before sediment removal, probably connected with a lower water level and accelerated macrophyte bed succession. Principal Component Analysis on the species data confirmed the differences in invertebrate taxonomic structure among sampling years. Succession of the fishpond invertebrate assemblage in the years following sediment removal was mainly influenced by fish farming practice and local conditions, i.e. the presence of macrophyte beds, mesohabitat changes following restoration, and the presence of other water bodies in the surroundings.

J	Derlet, RW; Carlson, JR				Derlet, RW; Carlson, JR			Coliform bacteria in Sierra Nevada wilderness lakes and streams: What is the impact of backpackers, pack animals, and cattle?	WILDERNESS & ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE												Objective.-The presence of coliform bacteria indicates a watershed risk for harboring microbes capable of causing human disease. We hypothesized that water from watersheds that have different human- or animal-use patterns would have differing risks for the presence of coliform bacteria. Methods.-Water was collected in wilderness areas of the Sierra Nevada range in California. A total of 60 sites from lakes or streams were selected to statistically differentiate the risk categories: 1) high use by backpackers, 2) high use by pack animals, 3) cattle- and sheep-grazing tracts, and 4) natural areas rarely visited by humans or domestic animals. Water was collected in sterile test tubes and Millipore coliform samplers during the summer of 2004. Water was analyzed at the university microbiology lab, where bacteria were harvested and then subjected to analysis by standardized techniques. Confirmation was performed with a Phoenix 100 bacteria analyzer. Statistical analysis to compare site categories was performed with Fisher exact test. Results.-Only I of 15 backpacker sites yielded coliforms. In contrast, 12 of 15 sites with heavy pack-animal traffic yielded coliforms. All 15 sites below the cattle-grazing areas grew coliforms. Differences between backpacker and cattle or pack-animal areas were significant (P :.05). Only I of the 15 wild sites rarely visited by humans grew coliforms. All colifornis were identified as Escherichia coli. All samples grew normal aquatic bacteria of the genera Pseudomonas, Ralstonia, and Serratia and nonpathogenic strains of Yersinia. No correlation could be made with temperature or elevation. Sites below cattle-grazing tracts and pack-animal usage areas tended to have more total bacteria. Conclusions.-Alpine wilderness water below cattle-grazing tracts or areas used by pack animals are at risk for containing coliform organisms. Areas exclusively used by backpackers were nearly free of coliforms.																			1080-6032	1545-1534				SPR	2006	17	1					15	20		10.1580/PR05-05.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1580/PR05-05.1								16538940					WOS:000236041900003
J	Willison, JHM; Li, RX; Yuan, XZ				Willison, J. H. Martin; Li, Ruoxi; Yuan, Xingzhong			Conservation and ecofriendly utilization of wetlands associated with the Three Gorges Reservoir	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River in China has created a major reservoir in which the water level fluctuates annually by about 30 m, generating a drawdown zone of up to 350 km(2) in summer. Since construction of the dam, there has been scientific and public interest in how to use the drawdown zone resources in environmentally sustainable ways. To this end, and with government support, an international conference was held in Chongqing Municipality (China) in October 2011 on the subject of conservation and ecofriendly utilization of wetlands in the Three Gorges Reservoir. The conference proceedings were subsequently published in the Journal of Chongqing Normal University. The proceedings reports are reviewed here in the context of other relevant literature. The proceedings included papers on ecology, ecodesign and ecological engineering, erosion control, plant production and carbon sequestration, phytoremediation of pollution, hydrosystem management, and others. Several of the reports derive from experimental work conducted at a research field station on the Three Gorges Reservoir situated in Kaixian County, Chongqing Municipality. Plant communities in the drawdown zone are declining in diversity and evolving. Experimental plantings of flood-tolerant edible hydrophytes in a dike-pond system reveal their potential to provide economic returns for farmers, and flooding-tolerant trees, such as cypresses, also show promising results for stabilizing soils in the drawdown zone. Flood-tolerant natural plant communities vary strongly with depth and their composition provides useful indicators for revegetation strategies. In the region surrounding the reservoir, remnant natural broad-leaved evergreen forests are most effective in sequestering carbon, and within the drawdown zone, carbon is mostly stored below ground. There is strong interest in the potential of aquatic plants for removal of pollutants, notably N and P, from the reservoir water by means of floating beds. Other examples of applying ecodesign and ecological engineering strategies for restoration and management of rivers and lakes are also given. Scientific studies have provided valuable advice for ecofriendly utilization of the reservoir drawdown zone and further studies of the evolving condition of the reservoir can be expected to pay additional practical dividends.

J	Rabalais, MR; Magoulick, DD				Rabalais, MR; Magoulick, DD			Influence of an invasive crayfish species on diurnal habitat use and selection by a native crayfish species in an Ozark stream	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												The crayfish Orconectes neglectus chaenodactylus has recently been introduced into the Spring River drainage in southern Missouri and northern Arkansas and appears to be displacing the native species O. eupunctus. To determine if O. eupunctus and O. neglectus chaenodactylus compete for habitat, we examined if either species shift habitat's when in the presence of one another. Habitat use of juvenile and adult crayfish was determined in six habitat types (backwater, pool, riffle, run, stream margin and vegetation) with a quadrat sampler during July/August 2003 at three sites: (1) an upstream site where O. neglectus chaenodactylus occurs, (2) a zone of overlap where both species occur and (3) a downstream site where O. eupunclus occurs. Habitat selection was determined by comparing habitat use to habitat availability. Redundancy Analyses were used to determine the relationship between crayfish densities and measured environmental variables (current velocity, water depth and percent boulder, cobble, pebble and sand). Orconectes eupunctus showed no shift in habitat use, habitat selection and species-environmental relationships between the downstream site and the zone of overlap. However, O. neglectus chaenodactylus did show a shift in habitat use and habitat selection between the upstream site and the zone of overlap, although no shift in species environmental relationships was found. Competition for habitat between O. eupunctus and O. neglectus chaenodactylus did not appear to cause the habitat shift by O. neglectus chaenodactylus since O. neglectus chaenodactylus shifted into habitat's used and selected by O. eupunctus. This study suggests that O. eupunclus and O. neglectus chaenodactylus may not compete for habitat. It is possible that habitat is not limiting in this system or that competition is taking place, but at a microhabitat level. Further study is needed to examine other potential mechanisms causing the displacement of O. eupunctus.

These ecosystems face threats from climate change and anthropogenic activities. Snowmaking reservoirs have emerged across the globe as a response to snow rarefaction and increasing winter tourism, and despite efforts to assess their environmental impact, our understanding of their ecological quality after being built remains limited. In the present study, we evaluated representative snowmaking reservoirs in French Alpine counties (d & eacute;partements) and their potential to serve as aquatic ecosystems. A comprehensive approach was employed encompassing ski resort surveys and geographical analyses of 136 reservoirs, complemented by investigations into abiotic characteristics and biodiversity surveys in 28 sampled reservoirs. The findings indicated that the multiplication and proximity of these reservoirs to freshwater habitats make them components of the alpine aquatic landscape. Terrestrial vegetation, although sparse, was commonly present on the banks of these reservoirs, but they systematically lacked aquatic vegetation. Faunal diversity appeared to be limited, and consisted of both indigenous and non-native species. Comparisons of snowmaking reservoirs with mountain lakes revealed similarities in water quality, implying the potential for similar oligotrophy and biotic communities. However, differences in conductivity, alkalimetry and pH were observed, possibly linked to distinct differences in water sources or retention times. Snowmaking reservoirs displayed unique habitat features through their structure and functioning. Although these reservoirs are attractive in terms of their biodiversity, there are concerns regarding their capacity to support species due to observations of drowned mammals and stranded amphibians and dragonflies. Our observations reveal potential ecological traps in the design, exploitation and uses of snowmaking reservoirs. Recommendations are made to enhance existing structures and future designs by increasing ecological processes and better protecting biodiversity.																			1015-1621	1420-9055				JAN	2025	87	1							9	10.1007/s00027-024-01136-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-024-01136-0													WOS:001349555100001
J	Moser, M; Weisse, T				Moser, Michael; Weisse, Thomas			The most acidified Austrian lake in comparison to a neutralized mining lake	LIMNOLOGICA												This study investigated two mining lakes located in the north of Lower Austria. These lakes arose 45 years ago when open cast lignite mining ceased. The lakes are separated by a 7-m wide dam. Due to the oxidation of pyrite, both lakes have been acidified and exhibit iron, sulphate, and heavy metal concentrations several orders of magnitude higher than in circumneutral lakes. The water column of both lakes is divided into two layers by a pronounced chemocline. The smaller mining lake (AML), with pH close to of 2.6, is the most acidic lake in Austria, whereas flooding with stream water and by drainage from the surrounding fields neutralized the adjacent larger pit lake. The goal of our study was to investigate the effect of flooding on its physical, chemical and biological properties, in comparison to the pristine AML Even relative to other extremely acidic lakes, the flora and fauna in the AML was reduced and composed of only two flagellate, one ciliate, and one rotifer species. The simplified pelagic food web in the mixolimnion consisted of heterotrophic bacteria, the mixotrophic flagellates Chlamydomonas acidophila and Ochromonas sp., the ciliate Oxytricha sp., and the rotifer Cephalodella sp. The latter two are as yet undescribed new species. The heliozoan Actinophrys sp. that may act as top predator occurred only in low abundance. The euglenid Lepocinclis buetschlii formed a stable deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) at 7 m depth. Highest cell numbers of L buetschlii in the DCM exceeded 10(8) L-1. The neutralized mining lake harboured higher plankton diversity similar to that of natural circumneutral lakes. A peak of at least 16 different phytoplankton taxa was observed during summer. The zooplankton consisted of several copepod species, daphnids and other cladocerans, and at least six different rotifer species. Several fish species occurred in the neutralized lake. Although the effect of non-permanent flooding was largely sustainable, interannual fluctuations of the pH affected the plankton community and reduced its species diversity. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

J	Smerdon, BD; Devito, KJ; Mendoza, CA				Smerdon, BD; Devito, KJ; Mendoza, CA			Interaction of groundwater and shallow lakes on outwash sediments in the sub-humid Boreal Plains of Canada	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The hydrologic controls on the interaction between a shallow lake and a groundwater flow system have been determined for a coarse-textured landscape on the Boreal Plains of Canada. Lake-groundwater interactions were studied to provide an understanding of the near-surface hydrologic processes in a sub-humid climate, where annual precipitation is equal to, or less than potential evapotranspiration. This study was initiated to assess potential landscape impact from forestry and energy industrial activity, and future scenarios of climate change expected in the Western Boreal Forest. A 39 ha lake on outwash sediments was studied for two consecutive years. Hydrometric measurements and stable isotopic analyses indicated that evaporation was the dominant hydrologic flux during ice-free months, and was primarily responsible for a 0.2 in decline in lake level during this study. A combination of summer rain and consistent supply of groundwater discharge throughout each year were the dominant sources of water. The near equivalence of precipitation and evaporation, and relative dominance of each of these processes during the hydrologic year, resulted in the formation of a water table mound downgradient of the lake, and its disappearance each year. The presence of these humid (mound) and and (complete disappearance) phenomena at one location within the same year, reveal the sensitivity of hydrologic systems in this sub-humid region to small variations in climate. The onset and duration of evaporation from the lake surface was a major controlling factor on groundwater exchange, to such a degree that the shallow lakes are thought to be evaporation windows in this landscape, creating sub-surface capture zones that depend on lake size and landscape position. These findings indicate a very dynamic relationship between atmospheric water fluxes and groundwater interaction, which could potentially conceal anthropogenic impacts within natural variability.

In the cold, mountainous desert of Eastern Pamir (Tajikistan), where scarce water bodies are influenced by extreme environmental conditions, photosynthetic cyanobacteria form diverse mats. The mats are characterized by different morphology and thickness. Their habitats exhibit a wide range of conditions; from oligosaline to hypersaline, oligotrophic to hypertrophic, and from cold ponds to hot springs. The aim of the present study was to reveal the taxonomic composition and structure of these mats and to examine which environmental factors influence them. MethodsFifty-one mats were collected from small water bodies around Bulunkul, Karakul, and Rangkul Lakes in 2015 and 2017. The physical and chemical properties of the water were measured in situ, while the concentration of nutrients was analyzed ex-situ. To reveal the taxonomic composition of the mats, the hypervariable V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was examined using NGS technology. ResultsThe results of bioinformatic analyses were compared with microscopic observations. They showed that Cyanobacteria was the dominant phylum, constituting on average 35% of bacterial ASVs, followed by Proteobacteria (28%), Bacteroidota (11%), and Firmicutes (9%). Synechococcales, Oscillatoriales, and Nostocales orders prevailed in Oxyphotobacteria, with a low contribution of Chroococcales, Gloeobacterales, and Chroococcidiopsidales. Occasionally the non-photosynthetic Vampirivibrionia (Melainabacteria) and Sericytochromatia from sister clades to Oxyphotobacteria were noted in the samples. Moreover, there was a high percentage of unidentified cyanobacterial sequences, as well as the recently described Hillbrichtia pamiria gen. et sp. nov., present in one of the samples. Salinity, followed by Na and K concentrations, correlated positively with the composition and structure of Oxyphotobacteria on different taxonomic levels and the abundance of all bacterial ASVs. DiscussionThe study suggests that the investigated communities possibly host more novel and endemic species. Among the environmental factors, salinity influenced the Oxyphotobacteria communities the most. Overall, the microenvironmental factors, i.e. the conditions in each of the reservoirs seemed to have a larger impact on the diversity of microbial mats in Pamir than the "subregional" factors, related to altitude, mean annual air temperature and distance between these subregions.

J	SCHENK, PE; VONBITTER, P; MATSUMOTO, R				SCHENK, PE; VONBITTER, P; MATSUMOTO, R			DEEP-BASIN DEEP-WATER CARBONATE-EVAPORITE DEPOSITION OF A SALINE GIANT - LOCH-MACUMBER (VISEAN), ATLANTIC CANADA	CARBONATES AND EVAPORITES												The Carboniferous saline giant of Atlantic Canada is approximately 500 m thick and extends over an area of 250 x 10(3) km(2). It consists of three lithologies: 1. a relatively thin (usually less than 5 m) extensive carbonate sheet containing buildups, 2. an overlying thick (up to 400 m) evaporite complex of sulphates and chlorides, and 3. wedge-shaped units of conglomerate, breccia, and sandstone (up to 200 m). The latter interfinger with the preceding lithologies but locally may underlie the carbonate sheet. The basaI carbonate occurs mainly as fine, laminar couplets of alternating peloidal grainstones and bituminous films; these pass laterally into peloidal marlstones and mounds. Laminites and marlstones have incipient brecciation, recumbent folds, siliciclastic and carbonate turbidites, rubble, and olistostromes. Fossils are rare. They are restricted in space to the basal decimeter and in diversity to conodonts and crustaceans. A Nereites ichnofauna occurs at one locality. Mounds consist mainly of turbid fans of fascicular-optic calcite and botryoids of laminated calcite. Their fauna shows low diversity but high density of some species; tube worms and microbial growths are noteworthy. The overlying evaporites are mainly anhydrite with lateral and vertical transition into halite and potash. Siliciclastic sediments thicken toward boundary faults. Both the base and top of the giant are unconformities, the former abrupt, the latter karstic. The basal carbonate accumulated subaqueously in deep, physically and chemically stratified water. Initially, the desert floor of the complex rift basin was below ambient sea level. After catastrophic submergence, basal waters were at first dysaerobic and restricted marine, but changed to anoxic and pene- to hypersaline as the water column became stratified. Its sedimentary record corresponds to a giant, meromictic, saline lake - Loch Macumber. The laminite records either seasonal changes in rainfall and temperature, or episodic storms punctuating normal chemical sedimentation. Sulphate-reducing bacteria fed on terrestrial organic matter preserved in anoxic bottom water, and precipitated peloidal calcite. Concentrations of bacteria over hot springs may also have supported chemosynthetic organic communities and precipitated petroliferous and sulphide-rich mounds. Siliciclastic rocks increase toward basin margins. Locally steep depositional surfaces caused mass movements of sediment down basin margins. A long term increase in salinity resulted in precipitation of initially corroded and subsequently euhedral crystals of gypsum. Thick sulphates and chlorides followed. Sedimentary rock of Loch Macumber records topographic filling of a deep rift basin. Isostatic analysis suggests that both depth of the subaerial desert basin and initial water depth after submergence were considerably less than the preserved thickness of the saline giant. Its record corresponds closely to that expected from Schmaltz's model of deep-basin/deep-water carbonate-evaporite deposition.																			0891-2556						1994	9	2					187	210		10.1007/BF03175230	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF03175230													WOS:A1994PU58000006
J	Attiogbe, FK; Mohammed, AR; Kingslove, Q				Attiogbe, Francis K.; Mohammed, Abdul Rahim; Kingslove, Quarm			Assessing the potential health impact of selected heavy metals that pollute lake amponsah in Bibiani, Western North region, Ghana	SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN												Gold mining contributes significantly to social, economic, and infrastructural development in Ghana. Apart from these benefits, mining activities have negative impacts on the environment as well as the health of fringe communities who depend on the environmental resources for survival. However, despite the increase in small scale mining in the Bibiani Anhwiaso Bekwai Municipal, the extent to which these activities have impacted on the quality of the Amponsah lake is largely unknown. This study, therefore, assessed whether or not the activities of small- scale miners have impacted the quality of the Amponsah lake as well as the health of the people living in the fringe communities who depend on it for survival. The study used qualitative and quantitative data obtained from the laboratory analysis of water samples as well as the thoughts and opinions of occupants of the fringe communities to achieve the objectives of the study. Findings showed that aside total suspended solids, all the physical parameters assessed were below the Ghana Environmental Protection Agency standards. The mean recorded values for pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, total dissolved solids, and total suspended solids were 7.20, 29 degrees C, 4.80 mg/cm, 383.00 mu S/cm, 185 ml/l and 132.40 mg/l respectively. Also, mean concentrations of 0.0053 mg/l, 0.3110 mg/l, 0.0372, and 0.0440 mg/l were recorded for Hg, As, Cd, and Zn respectively with the concentration of zinc only falling below the Ghana Environmental Protection Agency standards. Further, human activities such as small-scale mining, discharge of waste from nearby communities as well as leachate from a dumping site, are the major contributing factors causing pollution in the lake. Mercury source in Lake Amponsah could be through activities of small- scale miners operating around the lake over the years. The unusually high concentration of As could be likely due to the geology of Bibiani. In conclusion, the physicochemical characteristics of the Lake Amponsah have been compromised pointing to a polluted status except for Zn and total suspended solids. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

J	Harris, L; Kotamarthi, VR				Harris, L; Kotamarthi, VR			The characteristics of the Chicago Lake breeze and its effects on trace particle transport: Results from an episodic event simulation	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY												The lake-breeze circulation that forms over Lake Michigan during the summer influences the Chicago, Illinois, metropolitan area's weather in several ways. Of particular significance is the circulation's effect on the dispersion of pollutants such as ozone and aerosols produced in and around the city. To investigate these effects, the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University-National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model (MM5) was used to perform numerical simulations for two lake-breeze events-one in July 1999 and another in July 2002. The model runs were verified with data from several locations around the Chicago area. The simulated breeze circulation decreased the rate of increase in air temperature while penetrating roughly 12 km inland and lasting about 8 h, in reasonable agreement with observations. Furthermore, the inland penetration distance was related to the strength of the maximum vertical velocity within the front. Calculations of trajectories and transport of particles showed that the breeze tended to transport particles trapped within it to the north when release occurred before the circulation came ashore, whereas particles released at the time of the breeze's landfall or afterward moved more northeasterly, in the direction of the prevailing wind. Thirty-four percent of all released particles were trapped by the circulation and raised to a height of at least 300 m, and 20% of the particles remained in the lowest 100 m above the surface. In addition, sensitivity tests showed little change in the modeled breeze when measured surface temperatures for Lake Michigan were used as initial conditions and boundary conditions in the place of surface skin temperature ( as derived by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction). Raising the lake temperatures significantly in the simulation yielded a more elongated vertical circulation and a briefer lake-breeze event that did not reach as far inland.

Wetland Waterbird Food Resources Increased by Harvesting Invasive Cattails	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												The conservation of many freshwater marsh waterbirds (i.e., waterfowl, shorebirds, wading birds, and secretive marshbirds) in the Laurentian Great Lakes requires managing invasive emergent macrophytes, which degrade waterbird habitat by creating dense, litter-clogged stands, and excluding plants that produce nutritionally balanced and high-energy food (seeds, tubers, and submerged aquatic vegetation). The most commonly used management approach in the United States Great Lakes region involves the application of herbicides, which can stimulate waterbird forage plants but does not address the accumulation of plant litter, the underlying cause of plant community diversity loss and habitat degradation. We experimentally evaluated the effects of an alternative approach, harvesting invasive plants and their litter followed by flooding, on plant communities, focusing on the effects of these treatments to increase the abundance of high-energy wetland plants. At the Shiawassee National Wildlife Refuge in Michigan, USA, we experimentally treated an invasive cattail (Typha x glauca)-dominated wetland in August and September of 2016, 2017, and 2018, using a randomized block design with 4 blocks and 3 treatments (sediment surface harvest, above ground harvest, and control). We monitored the effects of these treatments on the abundance and dominance of waterbird forage-producing plants, plant diversity, and plant communities prior to (Jul 2016) and during the summer following each treatment (late Jul or early Aug 2017, 2018, and 2019). Additionally, we used pre- and post-treatment waterbird use-day data collected at the unit scale and compared values with satellite imagery-derived land cover changes. Compared to control plots, 3 years of harvesting and flooding significantly increased plant species diversity, increased the abundance of waterbird seed- and tuber-producing plant species by 5 times, and increased annual plant dominance by more than 10 times, while substantially reducing all measures of cattail and its litter. Use-days increased for total waterbirds, including waterfowl and dabbling ducks, following treatment. Cattail cover decreased and open water and non-cattail emergent vegetation cover increased. Harvesting invasive plant biomass coupled with flooding promoted a plant community composition and structure beneficial to waterbirds. (c) 2020 The Wildlife Society.

J	Williamson, CE; Neale, PJ; Grad, G; De Lange, HJ; Hargreaves, BR				Williamson, CE; Neale, PJ; Grad, G; De Lange, HJ; Hargreaves, BR			Beneficial and detrimental effects of UV on aquatic organisms: Implications of spectral variation	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) may have beneficial as well as detrimental effects on living systems. For example, UV-B radiation (280-320 nm) is generally damaging, while UV-A radiation (320-400 nm) may cause damage or stimulate beneficial photorepair of UV-B damage. The nature of both direct and indirect effects of UVR in nature depends on both the photon flux density and the spectral composition of the radiation incident on aquatic organisms across environmental UVR gradients in space (depth, transparency, elevation) and time (diel, seasonal, interannual). Here we use the common and widespread freshwater cladoceran Daphnia pulicaria as a model organism to demonstrate the potential importance of these wavelength-specific effects of UVR to the ecology of aquatic organisms. UVR-exposure experiments are used to manipulate both natural solar and artificial UVR sources to examine the beneficial as well as detrimental effects of different wavelengths of UVR. Changes in the spectral composition of solar radiation are also examined along several natural environmental gradients including diel gradients, depth gradients, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) gradients. The implications of variation in the spectral composition of UVR for aquatic organisms are discussed. The first biological weighting function (BWF) for a freshwater cladoceran is presented here. It demonstrates that the shortest UV-B wavelengths in sunlight are potentially the most damaging per photon. However, due to the greater photon flux density of longer wavelength UVR in sunlight, the net potential damage to Daphnia in nature is greatest for the longer wavelength UV-B and shorter wavelength UV-A radiation in the 305-322 nm range. Overall the contribution of UV-B to the total mortality response of Daphnia exposed to full-spectrum solar radiation for 7 h on a sunny summer day is 64% while UV-A contributes 36%. The BWF for Daphnia is used with the transmission spectrum for Mylar D to demonstrate that Mylar D cuts out only about half of the damaging UVR in sunlight. Following exposure to damaging UV-B, Daphnia exhibits a dramatic increase in survival in the presence of longer wavelength UV-A and visible radiation due to the stimulation of photoenzymatic repair. We present data that demonstrate the importance of both atmospheric ozone and DOC in creating strong environmental gradients in the intensity (irradiance) and spectral composition of solar UVR in nature. The light-absorbing component of DOC, chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), is particularly important in creating depth refugia from damaging UV-B in freshwater ecosystems. CDOM may also cause intense variations in the ratio of potentially beneficial UV-A to detrimental UV-B radiation to which aquatic organisms are exposed. In addition to changes in atmospheric ozone, future changes in CDOM related to climate change or other environmental disturbances may substantially alter the underwater exposure of a variety of aquatic organisms to different wavelengths of solar UVR.

Climate and conspecific density inform phenotypic forecasting of juvenile Pacific salmon body size	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Predicting effects of climate on fitness-linked phenotypic traits, such as body size, is important for the management and conservation of species in the face of global change. During sensitive life stages, small changes in mean trait values can have large effects on survival and population productivity. The transition from freshwater to saltwater by migrating anadromous fishes such as Pacific salmon (genus Oncorhynchus) is a critical life history transition, where survival is mediated by the size of migrating individuals. For salmon that spend extended periods rearing in freshwater, the size at ocean entry (i.e., smolt length) may be sensitive to changes in freshwater conditions shaped by biotic and abiotic factors, yet long-term phenotypic time series for exploring these responses are rare. We reconstructed a four-decade time series of smolt length from archives of returning adult scales to quantify population-specific responses to climate and conspecific density in a small watershed. Dynamic linear modeling found that the relationship between a proxy for cohort density and smolt length at ocean entry was consistently negative, suggestive of competition. In contrast, there was a positive, yet dynamic, relationship between a proxy for density of emerging fry during the second summer of growth and smolt length. The effect of temperature on smolt length was not consistent between two populations of sockeye salmon O. nerka that likely use distinct habitats within the watershed. A positive relationship between smolt length and temperature was only detected for the less abundant, early returning population. Predictions of smolt length showed variable responses under scenarios of increasing temperature and high and low densities of conspecifics. Collectively, these results reveal population-specific responses to temperature and density, suggesting that local habitat conditions may filter larger-scale climate drivers.

Previous studies have proposed processes whereby an overlying ice layer captures salinity from a freezing, subsurface reservoir. However, few field investigations have been conducted to investigate chemical partitioning and aqueous chemistry in freezing brine reservoirs in terrestrial analogs. Here we report results of winter field surveys to ice-covered, closed-basin saline lakes in the Valley of the Gobi Lakes, Mongolia. We found that the surface ice exhibited complex features, including both pressure ridges formed by compressive forces and wet cracks formed by tensile forces. The latter provides salinity to the ice layer and surface. In addition to wet cracks, saline lake bottom-water, along with suspended matter, was continuously captured within the pores of the ice layer during downward freezing. Using a combined mass balance and low-temperature aqueous chemistry model, we reproduced the ice salinity due to entrapment of Na+, Cl-, and SO42-, suggesting that chemical partitioning of these species in freezing brine reservoirs on icy bodies can be understood based on our current knowledge. In the lake bottom-water, the metastable phase of carbonates (i.e., amorphous Mg-carbonate and monohydrocalcite) play key roles in controlling the concentrations of precipitable Mg2+ and Ca2+ and alkalinity, highlighting the importance of metastable phase of carbonate in the aqueous chemistry of subsurface brine reservoirs on icy bodies. Metastable phases might be indicators of freshly erupted materials from brine reservoirs.

J	Gajewski, AJ; Kirschner, AKT; Velimirov, B				Gajewski, AJ; Kirschner, AKT; Velimirov, B			Bacterial lipolytic activity in a hypertrophic dead arm of the river Danube in Vienna	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The kinetic parameters of lipase, bacterial secondary production (BSP) and bacterial numbers (BN) were determined fortnightly during the development of the summer phytoplankton bloom at two stations of Alte Donau, a hypertrophic stagnant dead arm of the river Danube in Vienna. Until the middle of August we observed a gradual increase in lipase activity as well as BN and BSP rates to the maximum of 19.9 nmol 1(-1) h(-1), 4.5 x 10(9) cells 1(-1) and 8.1 mu g C 1(-1) h(-1), respectively. At the end of August and during September we found a marked decrease in all bacterial parameters, coinciding with a progressing increase of chlorophyll a concentrations at both sampling sites. The maximal values of lipase V-max were determined in the bottom water layer (avg. 13.7 +/- 6.5 nmol 1(-1) h(-1)) probably owing to the predominating importance of polymeric matter in the substrate pool for microheterotrophs in this water zone. Differential filtration experiments showed that 20.1% to 56.3% of the total lipase activity and 4.2% to 9.0% of the total bacterial numbers in Alte Donau water samples occurred in 0.2-mu m filtrate. Further experiments indicated that the high contribution to lipase activity in the 0.2-mu m filtrate was rather due to the presence of 0.2 mu m filterable bacteria than to soluble enzyme molecules. Moreover, we observed higher bacterial lipase activity in the 0.2 mu m filtrate than in unfiltered samples. The possible influence of limiting factors on the metabolism of bl situ bacteria is discussed.

J	Boudreau, BP; Leblond, PH				Boudreau, Bernard P.; Leblond, Paul H.			A SIMPLE EVOLUTIONARY MODEL FOR WATER AND SALT IN THE BLACK SEA	PALEOCEANOGRAPHY												This paper presents a time-dependent variable-size box model for the total fluid and salinity balances of the Black Sea. In addition to the advective flows due to riverine and Mediterranean inputs of water, the model accounts for entrainment flows which are parameterized using the theory of Ellison and Turner (1959) and employs a modified version of the Gargett (1984) formulation for eddy diffusivity in describing cross-pycnocline mixing flows. The variable volume of the boxes permits explicit simulation of the replacement of the preexisting late Pleistocene lake water by the inflow of denser Mediterranean water. Our results indicate that the time needed to displace the old deep water with new saltier water is 2000 years or less. Because of the effects of mixing, the salinity of both the surface and deep waters requires a greater time interval to obtain present-day values, i.e., similar to 4000 years if the inflow of Mediterranean water is constant in time at its present value and similar to 6000 years if this input changes with time in approximation to the rate of sea level rise. The occurrence of the marine coccolithophorid Emiliania huxleyi in the Holocene sapropel layer requires a minimum surface salinity of 11 parts per thousand, which takes some 1600 to 3100 years to develop. This range is a result of the uncertainty in the history of the Mediterranean water input. The model is also employed to investigate the freshening of the Black Sea after cutoff of Mediterranean input. The salinity of both surface and deep waters is found to fall below 11 parts per thousand in less than 3000 years, and the freshening process is complete in similar to 9000 years.

Diffuse and focused venting of hydrothermal water and gas occurs in the intertidal and shallow subtidal areas down to 15 m along a NW-SE-trending onshore-offshore fault. Temperatures in the fluid discharge area vary from 50 degreesC at the sea bottom up to 87 degreesC at a depth of 10 cm in the sediments. Chemical analyses revealed that thermal water is enriched in Ca, As, Hg, Mn, Ba, HCO3, Li, Sr, B, I, Cs, Fe and Si, and it has lower concentrations of Cl, Na, SO4 and Br than seawater. The chemical characteristics of the water samples indicate the occurrence of mixing between seawater and a thermal end-member. Stable isotopic oxygen and hydrogen composition of thermal samples plot close to the Local Meteoric Water Line on a mixing trend between a thermal end-member and seawater. The composition of the thermal end-member was calculated from the chemistry of the Submarine samples data by assuming a negligible amount of Mg for the thermal end-member. The results of the mixing model based on the chemical and isotopic composition indicate a maximum of 40% of the thermal end-member in the submarine vent fluid. Chemical geothermometers (Na/Li, Na-K-Ca and Si) were applied to the thermal end-member concentration and indicate a reservoir temperature of approximately 200 degreesC. The application of K-Mg and Na/Li geothermometers for vent fluids points to a shallow equilibrium temperature of about 120 degreesC. Results were integrated in a hydrogeological conceptual model that describes formation of thermal fluids by infiltration and subsequent heating of meteoric water. Vent fluid is generated by further mixing with seawater. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

J	Boxrucker, J				Boxrucker, J			Rescinding a 254-mm minimum length limit on white crappies at Ft. Supply Reservoir, Oklahoma: The influence of variable recruitment, compensatory mortality, and angler dissatisfaction	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												A 254-mm minimum length limit on crappies Pomoxis spp. was implemented on January 1, 1990, in Ft. Supply Reservoir, Oklahoma, to improve population size and age structure and angler catch rates but was rescinded 6 years later because of angler complaints. Before the regulation, the population was characterized by fast-growing and short-lived white crappies P. annularis; the spring fishery was supported by age-2 fish. Size structure fluctuated widely before the length limit was implemented, ranging from 1% to 40%, but stabilized after the length limit, exceeding 20% in 5 of the next 6 years. Age structure (percent age 3 and older) never exceeded 10% before the length limit, was greater than 10% the first 4 years after the length limit was imposed, and then declined to less than 10% in 1994-1995. Before the length limit, estimated conditional natural mortality was 45% and exploitation was 40%. Survival from age I to age 2 averaged 27% before the length limit and did not change substantially following its implementation. Abundance of quality-size (200-249 mm) and preferred-size (>250 mm) white crappies increased after the length limit was imposed. Angler catch rates increased following the regulation, but harvest rates were unchanged and harvest by number and yield declined. A Beverton-Holt equilibrium yield model, fitted using the pre-length-limit data, accurately predicted a reduction in yield. It was apparent from this study that typical fish population metrics are insufficient for managing a crappie fishery. Angler effort declined dramatically after the length limit was imposed, and vocal anglers registered their displeasure with their inability to harvest crappies. Reservoir-specific or lake-specific human dimensions data are also needed to properly assess angler desires before regulations are imposed. Managers should be flexible with regulations and be responsive to changing angler and fishery needs.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				NOV	2002	22	4					1340	1348		10.1577/1548-8675(2002)022<1340:RAMMLL>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8675(2002)022<1340:RAMMLL>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000179651100032

The presence of heavy metals, phosphates, nitrates, and Escherichia coli in the lake waters of the urban areas render it unfit for domestic use and irrigation. The crops cultivated utilizing these waters are hazardous, when ingested by humans and cattle, this may lead to bioaccumulation. The system designed aims at purifying the lake water, solely using solar power, chemicals, and natural filtration techniques. The experiment was conducted at New Horizon College of Engineering, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India (latitude12 degrees 93 ' N, longitude 77 degrees 69 ' E). The system uses flocculation, adsorption, micro-filtration, and distillation to purify the water. Novel integration of a Fresnel lens and a thermoelectric cooler in the solar distillation unit has improved the rate of distillation and efficiency. The distillate obtained could later be exploited for domestic purposes. An efficiency of over 78% was achieved for mercury removal, while the other polluting parameters were on par with the lake water standards set by the lake development authorities in Bengaluru, Karnataka, India. As for the solar distillation unit, the experimental results in comparison with other researches show that, the distillate output increases by coupling a Fresnel lens concentrator and a thermoelectric cooler to over 57%.

J	Belete, MD				Belete, Mulugeta Dadi			Ecohydrology to harmonize industrialization and ecological safety in urban environment: Case of Hawassa Lake, industries and Cheleleka wetland	ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY												In response to the recent efforts of the government to foster industrial transformation, the number of industries in Ethiopia have been growing, and ensuring ecological safety is becoming a challenge as a consequence. This study assesses the sustainability potential of industries in Hawassa City, Lake Hawassa and the Cheleleka wetland, Ethiopia. The study investigates the shrinkage rate of the open water portion of the Cheleleka wetland over the last 45 years. Effluents from three large industries were collected and analyzed to measure the degree of stress on the ecosystem. In addition, the potential functional performance of the wetland was modeled based on fifteen field indicators. In addition, a scheme of the proposed constructed wetland system is conceptualized and the required theoretical treatment area of the proposed system is estimated using volumetric and areal-based process design models. The temporal trend analysis found that the open water portion of the Cheleleka wetland to fall from 12 km(2) in 1972 to 5 km(2) in 1986, 3 km(2) in 1995 and 1 km(2) in 2000; very little area remained in 2007 and 2016. The current functional performance is estimated to be high for water quality improvement (2.3 out of 3 points approximate to 77%); medium for ground water recharge (2 out of 3 points approximate to 67%) and peak flood attenuation (1.2 out of 3 points approximate to 40%). To purify a BOD5 of 463 mg/l (actual) to a BOD5 of 50 mg/l (design target), a total required treatment area of approximate to 20,689 m(2) is required according to the volumetric process design model, and 64,276 m(2) by the areal-based model.

J	Gervais, BR; MacDonald, GM; Snyder, JA; Kremenetski, CV				Gervais, BR; MacDonald, GM; Snyder, JA; Kremenetski, CV			Pinus sylvestris treeline development and movement on the Kola Peninsula of Russia:: pollen and stomate evidence	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 A sediment core recovered from Poteryanny Zub Lake on the Kola Peninsula of Russia (68degrees48'91' N, 35degrees19'32' E) provides fossil pollen and stomate evidence for Pinus sylvestris treeline development and movement. The site today lies in birch forest tundra, approximately 25 km north of the pine treeline and 90 km south of the Murman Coast. 2 The record begins approximately 10 050 (14) C years before present (bp). The post-glacial tundra, typified by various herbaceous taxa and Artemisia , was followed by Betula -dominated woodland forest with Polypodiaceae-Gramineae pollen types. Such vegetation assemblages are not analogous to any in the western Kola Peninsula today. 3 Stomate evidence demonstrates that Pinus sylvestris immigrated to the study site as early as 8150 (14) C bp. Pine forest probably expanded northwards from sparse or small disjunct populations, which established c . 1000 (14) C bp before the expansion evident in the pollen and wood macrofossil records (7200 (14) C bp). Betula and other shrub and herb taxa declined at this time, possibly as a result of shading by the pine canopy. 4 The presence of fossil Pinus sylvestris stomates and wood, together with AP : NAP ratios, indicates that the pine treeline was some 100 km north of its present position by the end of the middle Holocene warming (7000-6000 (14) C bp). This places it near the Barents Sea coast, currently tundra vegetation. An approximate 2 degreesC increase in regional summer temperatures would be necessary to move the treeline to the present-day coastline. 5 From 6000 (14) C bp the pine treeline gradually retreated southward to its present modern position. Birch woodland has grown at the site since c . 3000 (14) C bp.																			0022-0477					AUG	2002	90	4					627	638		10.1046/j.1365-2745.2002.00697.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2745.2002.00697.x													WOS:000177368400004
J	HULEN, JB; NIELSON, DL				HULEN, JB; NIELSON, DL			EVOLUTION OF THE WESTERN VALLES CALDERA COMPLEX, NEW-MEXICO - EVIDENCE FROM INTRACALDERA SANDSTONES, BRECCIAS, AND SURGE DEPOSITS	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH AND PLANETS												Scientific core drilling in the Pleistocene Valles caldera complex (encompassing the Valles (1.13 Ma) and coaxial Toledo (1.50 Ma) calderas) of north central New Mexico has provided new insight into the origins of sandstones, breccias, and pyroclastic surge deposits interbedded with the thick intracaldera ignimbrite sequence. These rocks were previously interpreted from geothermal drill cuttings as dominantly fluvial in origin. As such, representing significant erosional intervals, they formed much of the basis for subdividing the intracaldera ignimbrite sequence (up to 2000 m in apparent thickness where drilled) into four major units: the lower tuffs (> 1.50 Ma); the Otowi (1.50 Ma) and Tshirege (1.13 Ma) members of the Bandelier Tuff; and a new unit, the upper tuffs, believed to be post-Bandelier in age (< 1.13 Ma). All but the upper tuffs correspond to mapped outflow facies ignimbrite sheets. However, Continental Scientific Drilling Program core holes VC-2A (completed in 1986) and VC-2B (completed in 1988), in the Sulphur Springs area of the Valles caldera, have provided continuous cores, revealing for the first time that some intracaldera rocks previously thought to be exclusively clastic actually have multiple origins. Some of these rocks are probably pyroclastic surge deposits; others could be lithic-rich breccias of various origins incorportated nearly instantaneously in ignimbrites during ash flow eruption and concomitant caldera collapse. These new findings demonstrate the value of continuous core for subsurface characterization and correlation of complex intracaldera lithologies; they also necessitate revision of Nielson and Hulen's (1984) cuttings-based intracaldera stratigraphic framework. For example, the hematitic S2 "sandstone" was initially interpreted as marking an erosional interval between the Tshirege Member of the Bandelier Tuff and the overlying, petrographically similar upper tuffs. Core from VC-2A and VC-2B, however, shows that the S2 cuttings could also represent disaggregated, Permian red bed-rich, lithic lag breccias or caldera collapse mesobreccias. If this is the case, then most or all of the upper tuffs are actually uppermost Tshirege Member ignimbrites. In similar fashion and upon review of previously applied correlation criteria the "lower tuffs" of the western Valles caldera complex could represent both genuine pre-Bandelier ignimbrites and those of the lowermost Otowi Member. The core, however, shows that in the Sulphur Springs subsurface the lower tuffs are separated from overlying ignimbrite sheets by prominent erosional and eruptive breaks; they appear to be slightly more mafic than the overlying tuffs and host distinctive pumice lapilli. At this site the lower tuffs almost certainly predate the Otowi Member and are probably correlative with the outflow facies San Diego Canyon ignimbrites (1.78 Ma). Cores from VC-2A and VC-2B support earlier interpretation of the S3 "sandstone" as a major marker horizon separating the intracaldera Otowi and Tshirege members of the Bandelier Tuff but clearly shows that this important unit is not, as previously thought, entirely a simple intracaldera epiclastic apron. In VC-2A the S3 has the superficial appearance of a sandstone but contains abundant blocky shards as well as accretionary and armored lapilli; it is also soft-sediment-deformed and invades overlying nonwelded tuff as small clastic dikes. We believe that here the S3 was emplaced by a wet pyroclastic surge. In nearby corehole VC-2B the S3 consists of a basal, massive, sediment-gravity-flow (?) sandstone overlain by sandstone and dacite breccias with accretionary and armored lapilli-bearing tuffaceous matrices. These deposits are probably caldera collapse mesobreccias that were formed simultaneously with early Tshirege Member ash flow eruptions through or into a Toledo caldera lake.																			0148-0227					MAY 10	1991	96	B5					8127	8142		10.1029/91JB00374	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/91JB00374													WOS:A1991FL38800012

Understanding the key drivers of supraglacial lake formation is therefore essential for assessing the vulnerability and future stability of Antarctic ice shelves. In this study, we combine high-resolution simulation from the regional climate model Mode`le Atmosphe<acute accent>rique Re<acute accent>gional (MAR) with satellitederived records of supraglacial lakes in coastal Dronning Maud Land to investigate the role of topographic downslope winds on spatial lake distribution. We find that persistent katabatic winds and episodic foehn winds are key controls on the observed regional patterns of lakes. Katabatic winds, most persistent in eastern Dronning Maud Land, exert a sustained impact near grounding zones through snow erosion, scouring and sublimation. Foehn winds predominantly affect ice shelves on the lee (western) side of large ice rises and promontories, causing considerable surface warming. While these downslope winds directly contribute to surface melt and ponding during summer, they also precondition the surface year-round through wind-driven warming and sublimation. Statistical analysis of downslope wind exposure further allows us to identify other Antarctic ice shelves that may become vulnerable to future ponding as firn retention capacity is diminished.																			0012-821X	1385-013X				SEP 15	2025	666								119482	10.1016/j.epsl.2025.119482	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2025.119482													WOS:001513367200001

Coring in the present-day lake area revealed Early Holocene stream deposits overlain by marine deposits. The area was transgressed by the sea at c. 8500 cal. years BP and a 12 km long, narrow fjord was formed. In the beginning, the fjord housed a species-poor marine or brackish-water fauna with molluscs Hydrobia sp. (mudsnail), Littorina littorea (winkle), Mytilus edulis (blue mussel) and Cerastoderma sp. (cockle). This phase was followed by a phase during which the fjord housed a species-rich fauna that included Ostrea edulis (European flat oyster) and Ruditapes decussatus (palourde clam). During this phase the salinity and summer water temperatures were higher than in present day Aarhus Bugt and we also see evidence for strong bottom currents. This phase was probably characterised by a fairly large tidal amplitude. Two radiocarbon ages of O. edulis shells of c. 6250 and 6700 cal. years BP indicate that such conditions peaked during the period of the Ertebolle culture. The high-salinity phase was followed by a phase with a more species-poor fauna, this phase was also characterised by a high sedimentation rate - a feature seen in other fjords in the region. We suggest that the shift could be due to a decrease in tidal amplitude. Brabrand Fjord was eventually transformed into a lake due to land uplift and closure of the connection to Aarhus Bugt due to longshore sediment transport but the timing of the transition from fjord to lake is still unknown.

INCIDENCE OF MICROCYSTINS (HEPATOTOXINS) IN FLOATING SCUMS IN THE SWARTSPRUIT RIVER, SOUTH AFRICA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												A study which probed the bioaccumulation, detection and quantitative variations of microcystins in floating scums of Microcystis flos-aquae employing optimized solid phase extraction liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was undertaken. A quantitative profile and dominance of MCYST-LR over MCYST-YR and MCYST-RR congeners across sampled sites, as well as the occurrence of MCYST-(H-4) YR and (D-Asp(3), Dha(7)) MCYST-RR during the summer months was observed. Analysis of maximum and minimum concentrations of quantified MCYSTs showed 270, 14.10 (mu g toxin/g DW), 141.5, 1.43 (mu g toxin/g DW) and 72.28, 0.15 (mu g toxin/g DW) for MCYST-LR, MCYST-RR and MCYST-YR respectively. One way ANOVA showed there was significant difference between mean MCYSTs concentrations across the sampling sites (P < 0.05) and a marginal significant difference in mean MCYSTs concentrations among variants (P = 0.04). The results suggest that the most prevalent bloom forming species is Microcystis flos-aquae, often producing hepatotoxic microcystins, which can negatively impact aquatic animals and human health. The identification of sites with higher MCYST-YR, MCYST-LR, MCYST-RR concentrations and distributions in the pond and MCYST-LR dominance will be of particular importance to the metropolitan authorities, researchers and general public of the water safety quality of this freshwater reservoir.

The blocking of the River Weser valley led to the formation of glacial Lake Rinteln where most of the sediment was deposited by meltwater. Two subaqueous fan complexes have been identified, which formed lakeward of retreating ice-lobes during an overall lake-level rise. The sediment transport on the fans has been dominated by sustained gravity-flows, mainly cohesionless debris flows or high-and low-density turbidity currents, reflecting discharge of semi-continuous meltwater flows. Intercalations of surge-type high-and low-density turbidites increase towards the mid-and lower-fan slopes, indicating more ice-distal and periodic deposition. Individual fan bodies commonly have a coarse-grained proximal core of steeply dipping gravel, overlain by gently to steeply dipping mid-to outer fan deposits. During glacier retreat commonly fine-grained sediments, rich in ice-rafted debris, were deposited on the ice-distal and ice-proximal slopes of the abandoned fans. Climbing-ripple cross-laminated sand may onlap coarse-grained upper fan gravel and in some cases overtop the older fan deposits. Phases of glacier still-stands are characterised by fan systems that display an upward flattening of fan clinoforms and minor vertical facies changes. The position of ice marginal fans was controlled by the combination of bedrock topography and water depth. At the eastern lake margin topographic highs served as pinning points for the retreating glacier and facilitated ice margin stabilisation. A strong lake-level fall probably triggered a major drainage event that tapped previously unconnected reservoirs of englacial and subglacial meltwater.																			0141-3600		978-1-4443-0443-5				2007	39						121	148				10.1002/9781444304435												WOS:000286655000012
J	Stottlemyer, R				Stottlemyer, R			Stream water chemistry in watersheds receiving different atmospheric inputs of H+, NH4+, NO3-, and SO42-1	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Weekly precipitation and stream water samples were collected from small watersheds in Denali National Park, Alaska, the Fraser Experimental Forest, Colorado, Isle Royale National Park, Michigan, and the Calumet watershed on the south shore of Lake Superior, Michigan. The objective was to determine if stream water chemistry at the mouth and upstream stations reflected precipitation chemistry across a range of atmospheric inputs of H+, NH4+, NO3-, and SO42-. Volume-weighted precipitation H+, NH4+, NO3-, and SO42- concentrations varied 4 to 8 fold with concentrations highest at Calumet and lowest in Denali. Stream water chemistry varied among sites, but did not reflect precipitation chemistry. The Denali watershed, Rock Creek, had the lowest precipitation NO3- and SO42- concentrations, but the highest stream water NO3- and SO42- concentrations. Among sites, the ratio of mean monthly upstream NO3- concentration to precipitation NO3- concentration declined (p < 0.001, R-2 = 0.47) as precipitation NO3- concentration increased. The ratio of mean monthly upstream to precipitation SO42- concentration showed no significant relationship to change in precipitation SO42-. concentration. Watersheds showed strong retention of inorganic N (> 90 percent inputs) across inputs ranging from 0.12 to > 6 kg N ha(-1) y(-1). Factors possibly accounting for the weak or non-existent signal between stream water and precipitation ion concentrations include rapid modification of meltwater and precipitation chemistry by soil processes, and the presence of unfrozen soils which permits winter mineralization and nitrification to occur.																			0043-1370					AUG	1997	33	4					767	779		10.1111/j.1752-1688.1997.tb04104.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.1997.tb04104.x													WOS:A1997XY94100006

Their fossils provide information on past changes in lake environments. However, few studies have quantitatively examined the relationships between contemporary and sub-fossil cladoceran assemblages and no investigations are available from Mediterranean lakes where salinity, eutrophication and top-down control of large-bodied cladocerans are known to be important. Here we compared contemporary Cladocera assemblages, sampled in summer, from both littoral and pelagic zones, with their sub-fossil remains from surface sediment samples from 40 Turkish, mainly shallow, lakes. A total of 20 and 27 taxa were recorded in the contemporary and surface sediment samples, respectively. Procrustes rotation was applied to both the principal components analysis (PCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA) ordinations in order to explore the relationship between the cladoceran community and the environmental variables. Procrustes rotation analysis based on PCA showed a significant accord between both littoral and combined pelagic-littoral contemporary and sedimentary assemblages. RDA ordinations indicated that a similar proportion of variance was explained by environmental variation for the contemporary and fossil Cladocera data. Total phosphorus and salinity were significant explanatory variables for the contemporary assemblage, whereas salinity emerged as the only significant variable for the sedimentary assemblage. The residuals from the Procrustes rotation identified a number of lakes with a high degree of dissimilarity between modern and sub-fossil assemblages. Analysis showed that high salinity, deep water and high macrophyte abundance were linked to a lower accord between contemporary and sedimentary assemblages. This low accord was, generally the result of poor representation of some salinity tolerant, pelagic and macrophyte-associated taxa in the contemporary samples. This study provides further confirmation that there is a robust relationship between samples of modern cladoceran assemblages and their sedimentary remains. Thus, sub-fossil cladoceran assemblages from sediment cores can be used with confidence to track long-term changes in this environmentally sensitive group and in Mediterranean lakes, subjected to large inter-annual variation in water level, salinity and nutrients.

Sediment drill cores recovered from Lake Baikal provide essential records not only for comparison with oceanic records of marine processes, but also benchmarks which can be used to help interpret other continental records including other lake archives scheduled to be drilled in the near future. Drilling of Lake Baikal made it possible for the first time to have a continental archive with the same scientific and chronostratigraphic integrity as marine records to address critical questions of the Quaternary and Pliocene. The Lake Baikal drilling project (BDP) rapidly progressed from piston coring and seismic reflection studies to conducting the first scientific drilling in 4 short years and to very deep drilling in over 8 years. BDP has taken advantage of the harsh Siberian winters by using the frozen surface of Lake Baikal as a drilling platform. The positioning of the drill sites was selected using seismic and piston coring surveys. By continuously improving the drilling operations and technology, BDP has achieved new core recovery and depth records over the last ten years and become the world's leader in pioneering the recovery of high-quality, extremely long lacustrine sediment sequences from deep water. The success of BDP came at a time of growing interest in lake drilling among members of the paleoclimate community with few recent large-scale coordination efforts to draw upon. At the organizational, technological and financial levels, some recent changes are favorable for the development of a global lake drilling initiative, which could become as successful and efficient as the ocean drilling program.

Sedimentary pigments as indicators of cyanobacterial dynamics in a hypereutrophic lake	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Lac Saint-Augustin is an urban lake located on the outskirts of Quebec City, one of North America's oldest cities. Anthropogenic inputs from land clearing, agriculture, highway development and urbanization in the surrounding catchment have resulted in strong impacts on the limnology of the lake throughout the past three centuries. In recent years, this lake has experienced severe eutrophication, including persistent cyanobacterial blooms. In winter 2011, a sediment core was extracted from the deepest area of the lake. A detailed paleopigment analysis was used to assess eutrophication processes in the lake and to determine the timing and appearance of cyanobacterial blooms and their subsequent variability. Extracted chlorophyll a, its degradation products and 11 carotenoid pigments were identified and quantified via reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography to examine relative changes in the phytoplankton. The results revealed large variations in the phytoplankton community structure of Lac Saint-Augustin over the past 356 years. Chlorophyll a concentrations per unit organic matter (OM) increased significantly from the base of the core to present day, rising more than 15-fold from 18.4 A mu g (g OM)(-1) at the base of the core to 287 A mu g (g OM)(-1) in the most recent strata. Biostratigraphical analysis revealed three major periods of enrichment, with episodes of cyanobacterial abundance from the 1890s onwards. The greatest changes occurred in the most recent period (from the 1960s to the present) relative to earlier periods, with pigment increases for all phytoplankton groups. The cyanobacterial pigments canthaxanthin, echinenone and zeaxanthin (also a marker for green algae) showed concentrations in the surface sediments that were significantly above values at the bottom of the core, and these differences were large, even giving consideration to the lesser pigment degradation near the surface. Overall, the results indicate that cyanobacterial blooms are not a recent feature of Lac Saint-Augustin but began to occur soon after catchment modification 150 years ago. The pigment records also imply that cyanobacterial and associated algal populations have risen to unprecedented levels over the last few decades of ongoing development of the Lac Saint-Augustin catchment. This study highlights the utility of multiple pigment analysis of lake sediments for identifying the timing and magnitude of anthropogenic impacts.

J	Behera, D; Chauhan, PR				Behera, Diptimayee; Chauhan, Parth R.			Investigating possible links between Holocene environmental changes and cultural transitions across India	HOLOCENE												From the early Holocene onward, the Indian Subcontinent has accommodated a range of diverse human cultures and associated ecological adaptations and lifestyles. Around 10 kyrs ago, the Subcontinent has witnessed the development of later Mesolithic hunter-gatherers and their subsequent regional transitions to pastoralist (Neolithic) and agricultural (Chalcolithic) lifeways. The Holocene climate records reveal discrepancies in the timing and duration of climatic events, which can be attributed to a vast geographic isolation, the influence of height, elevation, and local climatic conditions. These changing climatic patterns including the development of a geographically variable monsoon directly impacted these various cultures including the Harappans and their contemporaries as well as younger Historical and Medieval empires across India, at various levels. In some regions, environmental changes led to uneven cultural transitions, geographic migrations, and the development of regionally-distinct material cultures along with establishment of sedentary life-ways. This paper attempts to present a review broadly correlating general climatic patterns throughout the Holocene period of India with regional cultural dynamics. All geomorphic-climatic zones of the Subcontinent showed strong inter-proxy coherence between 9 and 5 kyrs in response to increased precipitation. After this warming period ends, we see a moderate dry period as a result of a weakening monsoon and an overall tendency toward aridity throughout all zones (after 4 kyrs). The temporal variation of human habitation and respective adaptive responses suggest broad linkages to the varying climatic and physiographic features at a regional scale. Learning how this shaped human eco-dynamics in the past can help us expand our understanding of human history and implement lessons for the present as well as the future.

As a significant proportion of marine carbonate older than the Cambrian is microbially-mediated, the utility of delta Cr-53 values in ancient carbonates hinges on whether these sediments accurately capture the isotope composition of their environment. We report Cr concentrations (Cr) and delta Cr-53 values of modern marginal marine and non-marine microbial carbonates. These data are supported by stable C and O isotope compositions, as well as rare earth elements and yttrium (REY) concentrations. In addition, we present data on ancient analogs from Precambrian strata. Microbial carbonates from Marion Lake (Australia, delta Cr-53 approximate to 0.99 parts per thousand) and Mono Lake (USA, approximate to 0.78 parts per thousand) display significantly higher delta Cr-53 values compared with ancient microbialites from the Andree Land Group in Greenland (720 Ma, approximate to 0.36 parts per thousand) and the Bitter Springs Formation in Australia (800 Ma, approximate to-0.12 parts per thousand). The delta Cr-53 values are homogenous within microbialite specimens and within individual study sites. This indicates that biological parameters, such as vital effects, causing highly variable delta Cr-53 values in skeletal carbonates, do not induce variability in delta Cr-53 values in microbialites. Together with stable C and O isotope compositions and REY patterns, delta Cr-53 values in microbialites seem to be driven by environmental parameters such as background lithology and salinity. In support, our Cr and delta Cr-53 results of ancient microbial carbonates agree well with data of abiotically precipitated carbonates of the Proterozoic. If detrital contamination is carefully assessed, microbialites have the potential to record the delta Cr-53 values of the waters from which they precipitated. However, it remains unclear if these delta Cr-53 values record (paleo-) redox conditions or rather result from other physico-chemical parameters.

Shortly after, centimetre-thick, beige-colored sinter-crusts were observed in the river bed. An environmental monitoring program launched in order to understand the rapid precipitation process revealed pH values up to 12.9 and high Ca2+ concentrations (196 mg/l) at near-freezing water-temperatures. A first set of crystal aggregates collected was found to disintegrate into a light-colored calcite powder at ambient temperature within few days only. Thus, the metastable precipitates were recovered in original solution and stored in a constantly-cooled refrigerator box. Immediate XRD, FT-IR and ESEM analyses revealed "ikaite" - calcium carbonate hexahydrate - being the rarely documented mineral never reported from such an environmental setting before. Ikaite typically forms in a narrow temperature range (<4-8 degrees C) from strongly supersaturated solutions, e.g. some specific lake-, sea-and spring-water mixing locations, Arctic-and Antarctic sea-ice. In the present case, enhanced portlandite (Ca[OH](2)) dissolution from the concrete river basement by water inflowing during wintertime provided exceptional hydrochemical conditions suitable for rapid ikaite crystallization, e.g. of up to 2 kg d(-1) m(-2) in a particular stream section. Sampling sites from which ikaite was documented yielded pH > 11 probably reflecting some lower limit of ikaite formation. Our findings do not support nucleation inhibitors (aqueous phosphate, magnesium, organic constituents), strongly elevated ionic strength (brines), or water-mixing as a crucial demand for ikaite precipitation. In this "natural laboratory" distinct ikaite vs. calcite spatial distribution encountered along the stream, and thus the spatiotemporal evolution of fluid-solid interaction could be studied. Finally, the prominent and widespread ikaite precipitates vanished rapidly during pronounced springtime air-and water-temperature rise > 6 degrees C superimposed on more gradual hydrochemical changes, e.g. decrease of pH and Ca2+. The latter development highlights the critical temperature restriction of ikaite occurrence and stability. Anthropogenic combined with natural hydrogeochemical processes observed in this study are of interest for both applied and fundamental environmental research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Tammert, H; Ott, I; Kisand, V				Tammert, Helen; Ott, Ingmar; Kisand, Veljo			Ecophysiological status of bacteria in freshwater lakes during steep summer stratification	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Bacterioplankton as a whole comprises a variety of individual cells ranging in physiological status from dead to highly active. Insight into the physiological status of bulk bacterioplankton allows the functional role of bacteria in a particular environment to be better understood. In the present study, three sharply stratified freshwater lakes were studied because such lakes provide a wide variety of ecological niches in a relatively small scale. Water samples were taken from the major layers of the water column and the total number and productivity of bacteria were measured. Two staining methods were used to determine the abundance of cells with respiratory activity and cell membrane integrity. The proportions of dead, intact and respiring bacteria were highly variable. The highest percentage of dead cells observed was close to 90 %, while the highest proportion of respiring bacteria was 31 %. Assuming that only respiring bacteria were responsible for bacterial production, the observed generation times ranged from 7 h to 30 days. When all cells (total number of bacteria) were assumed to grow actively, the calculated generation time increased to 2 years. The relationship between biomass and production indicated that respiring bacteria had lower growth efficiency in a shallow lake with high primary production; growth efficiency was higher in a deep lake with lower primary production.

Here, we present a synthesis of 268 continental paleo-moisture records collected from monsoonal systems in the Eastern Hemisphere, including the East Asian Monsoon (EAsM), the Indian Monsoon (IM), the East African Monsoon (EAfM), and the Australian Monsoon (AuM) covering the last 18,000 years. The overall pattern of late Glacial to Holocene moisture change is consistent with those inferred from ice cores and marine records. With respect to the last 10,000 years (10 ka), i.e. a period that has high spatial coverage, a Fuzzy c-Means clustering analysis of the moisture index records together with "Xie-Beni" index reveals four clusters of our data set. The paleoclimatic meaning of each cluster is interpreted considering the temporal evolution and spatial distribution patterns. The major trend in the tropical AuM, EAfM, and IM regions is a gradual decrease in moisture conditions since the early Holocene. Moisture changes in the EAsM regions show maximum index values between 8 and 6 ka. However, records located in nearby subtropical areas, i.e. in regions not influenced by the intertropical convergence zone, show an opposite trend compared to the tropical monsoon regions (AuM, EAfM and IM), i.e. a gradual increase. Analyses of modern meteorological data reveal the same spatial patterns as in the paleoclimate records such that, in times of overall monsoon strengthening, lower precipitation rates are observed in the nearby subtropical areas. We explain this pattern as the effect of a strong monsoon circulation suppressing air uplift in nearby subtropical areas, and hence hindering precipitation. By analogy to the modern system, this would mean that during the early Holocene strong monsoon period, the intensified ascending airflows within the monsoon domains led to relatively weaker ascending or even descending airflows in the adjacent subtropical regions, resulting in a precipitation deficit compared to the late Holocene. Our conceptual model therefore integrates regionally contrasting moisture changes into the Global Monsoon hypothesis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

One poorly studied subject is the glacial dynamics during interstadial Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 (57-29 ka). To better constrain the southern margin of the Laurentide Ice Sheet during this time period, we re-examined a stratigraphic sequence in southeast Manitoba, Canada, and provide robust evidence for advance and retreat of ice. Around 46.6 +/- 5.1 ka (1 sigma error), fluvial sands were deposited under similar precipitation and significantly cooler summer temperatures than present-day. Ice then advanced south over the area, before retreating once again and a return to boreal forest and grassland conditions. The area was then covered by proglacial Lake Vita, dammed by ice to the north. Geochronology constraints indicate Lake Vita existed from ca. 44.3 +/- 3.6 to 30.4 +/- 2.3 ka (1 sigma error), although gaps in the optical and finite radiocarbon ages suggest either a lack of data or plausible temporary ice-margin advances during this time period. Ice covering most of Manitoba during MIS 3 is in line with global delta O-18 records, and glacially influenced sediment deposition in the Mississippi River basin.					; Gauthier, Michelle/LZH-6899-2025; Finkelstein, Sarah/K-8202-2012	Dalton, April Sue/0000-0002-0725-1385; Gauthier, Michelle/0000-0001-7176-9202; Finkelstein, Sarah/0000-0002-8239-399X; Hodder, Tyler James/0000-0003-3702-384X; Lian, Olav/0000-0002-2810-6806; 													0033-5894	1096-0287				JAN	2025	123						83	105		10.1017/qua.2024.34	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/qua.2024.34		DEC 2024											WOS:001370883500001
J	Wagner, B; Bennike, O				Wagner, Bernd; Bennike, Ole			Holocene history of Fiskesø, Prinsesse Ingeborg Halvø, eastern North Greenland	BULLETIN OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF DENMARK												Sediment cores up to 92 cm in length were recovered with gravity and Russian peat corers from Fiskes & oslash;, Prinsesse Ingeborg Halv & oslash;, eastern North Greenland, during the summer 2014. The correlated sediment succession consists of clastic sediments that are interspersed in the upper part with layers of organic material and likely record the environmental history of the lake since deglaciation. The paucity of macrofossil remains hampered radiocarbon dating of the sediments from Fiskes & oslash;. According to published data, the deglaciation of the region took place c. 10 cal. ka BP. Relative sea-level reconstructions from the region suggest that the Fiskes & oslash; basin, which is today located at 33 m above sea level, was characterised by marine conditions until c. 8.1 cal. ka BP. Marine fossils in the lower part of the sediment succession support the prevalence of marine conditions. A reliable radiocarbon age from 5 cm above the isolation horizon in Fiskes & oslash; sediments indicates an age of 6.1 cal. ka BP and supports the isolation of the basin prior to this time. Cooling is indicated in the upper part of the sediment succession and is reported to have taken place in the region stepwise shortly after 6.1 cal. ka BP and at c. 4.5-4.0 cal. ka BP. Despite the poor chronology the data from Fiskes & oslash; support existing terrestrial and marine reconstructions from the region.

Lawrence			Using Long-Lived Thorium Isotopes to Quantify the Lithogenic Inputs to the Lakes in Qaidam Basin, China	MINERALS												In the last decade, the Th-232-Th-230 system has gained popularity as a tracer to quantify lithogenic sources of trace elements to the marine environment. Thorium (Th) isotopes were utilized to quantify the supply of lithogenic inputs to Keluke Lake and Tuosu Lake in Qaidam Basin, China. A total of 33 water samples were collected from Keluke Lake, Tuosu Lake, and Bayin River to measure the concentrations of dissolved Th-232 and Th-230. The relationship of Th-232 concentration in the water was in the order Bayin River > Keluke Lake > KLK-TS River > Tuosu Lake, confirming the input of variable lithogenic material sources. Three sources dominate the flux of lithofacies into the lakes: the river input, the deposition of dust and the local input from the sediments surrounding the lakes. On an interannual timescale, the lithogenic flux of Keluke Lake was mainly derived from river input. In summer, the dust flux in the study area could be estimated as 0.133 g/m(2)/year, while the flux of lithologic material from Bayin River to Keluke Lake was 12.367 g/m(2)/year. In contrast, the fluvial input to the Tuosu lake was small in comparison to the dust contribution of lithogenic flux. The high Th232-concentration and the vertical sediment flux in this lake may have been caused by resuspension of bottom sediments.

This study investigated water quality of the lake, a crucial element in protecting the ecological characteristics of a lake, and ensuring its sustainable use. The study involved use of Geographical Information Systems software to analyze the temporal and spatial changes in nutrient element concentrations that may deteriorate water quality and ecological characteristics of the lake. In the framework of the study, surface water samples were collected on the Lake Aktas in June, July, and August 2014 from nine stations selected at intervals in accordance with spatial analysis. The collected samples were measured for temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, ammonium nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, and orthophosphate. The obtained results were compared with the concentrations specified in Surface Water Quality Management Regulation published by the T. R. Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. According to the findings, surface water classification and distribution for Lake Aktas included the following categories class I ( WS-I/natural) in terms of oxygen, ammonium, and nitrate nitrogen, and class II (WS-II/undeveloped) in terms of nitrite. It was found that ammonium and phosphate levels have considerably increased in the last ten years, based on the comparisons made with the study sampled in Aktas Lake during 2004-2005 (Ozbay and Kilinc 2008).

The life cycle and cryptic habits of T. piniperda make its detection difficult. T. piniperda adults feed in shoots in the summer, overwinter in the bark at the base of live Dine trees, then oviposit into galleries in the bark of dead or dying trees. In 1992 and 1993, we characterized shoot damage and overwintering behavior of T. piniperda in the Great Lakes region of the United States. Shoot-feeding tunnels of T. piniperda were detectable in 7.4% of the shoots of Scots pine trees, Pinus sylvestris, sampled in northern Ohio in early October 1992. Adults of T. piniperda fed primarily in the upper third of the tree crowns. Live T. piniperda adults were present in the majority of shoots that exhibited discolored needles and drooping shoots. However, many shoots with T. piniperda adults present exhibited no visible symptoms of attack. In early October, live adults were more common in tunnels constructed in current-year shoots than in l-yr-old shoots. Scots, white (P. strobus), red (P. restnosa), and Austrian (P. nigra) pines attacked by T. piniperda developed yellow and brown needles, accompanied by drooping shoots only in Scots and white pines. In 1992 and 1993, the departure of T. piniperda adults from Scots pine shoots to their overwintering sites was correlated with subfreezing temperatures during late October through December. Bolts of Scots, white, and Austrian pines were readily used by T. piniperda for overwintering sites, but bolts of blue spruce were not.																			0022-0493					FEB	1998	91	1					182	190		10.1093/jee/91.1.182	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/91.1.182													WOS:000073139800025

To compensate for the conventional satellite observations, several types of ground-based radiometers are operated by AOD measurement programs. This study compares the Bratts Lake climate station's long-term AOD measurements from 1999 to 2012 which are derived from two ground-based programs with high accuracy: the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) UV-B Monitoring and Research Program (UVMRP) and the AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) program. The comparison shows that, in the 14-year period, the AOD values have an excellent agreement at six wavelengths (368, 415, 500, 610, 665, and 860 nm) with varying slopes (ranging from 0.95763 to 1.04089), intercepts (ranging from 0.0219 to 0.03945), correlation coefficients (R) (ranging from 0.82005 to 0.96155), and root mean square errors (RMSE) (ranging from 0.02639 to 0.03663). The correlations of both monthly and hourly averaged AOD measurements are highly consistent for each band. Specifically, the shorter (with larger AOD values) the wavelength is, the better the correlation is. Also, the results show that the peaks of relative errors generally occur in summer each year, and at noon each day. Our analyses suggest that AOD products derived from UVMRP are accurate and can serve as an alternative ground-based validation source for satellite AOD measurements.

However, based on delta O-18 or delta H-2 records alone, it can be challenging to distinguish between changes of the precipitation signal and changes caused by evaporation. Here we propose a coupled, delta O-18-delta H-2 biomarker approach that provides the possibility to disentangle between these two factors. The isotopic composition of long chain n-alkanes (n-C-33, n-C-27, n-C-31) were analyzed in order to establish a 16 ka Late Glacial and Holocene delta H-2 record for the sediment archive of Lake Panch Pokhari in High Himalaya, Nepal. The delta H-2(n-alkane) record generally corroborates a previously established delta O-18(sugar) record reporting on high values characterizing the deglaciation and the Older and the Younger Dryas, and low values characterizing the Bolling and the Allerod periods. Since the investigated n-alkane and sugar biomarkers are considered to be primarily of aquatic origin, they were used to reconstruct the isotopic composition of lake water. The reconstructed deuterium excess of lake water ranges from +57 parts per thousand to -85 parts per thousand and is shown to serve as proxy for the evaporation history of Lake Panch Pokhari. Lake desiccation during the deglaciation, the Older Dryas and the Younger Dryas is affirmed by a multi-proxy approach using the Hydrogen Index (HI) and the carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) as additional proxies for lake sediment organic matter mineralization. Furthermore, the coupled delta O-18 and delta H-2 approach allows disentangling the lake water isotopic enrichment from variations of the isotopic composition of precipitation. The reconstructed 16 delta O-18(precipitation) record of Lake Panch Pokhari is well in agreement with the delta O-18 records of Chinese speleothems and presumably reflects the Indian Summer Monsoon variability.

Sars, 1907 (Crustacea: Mysidacea) was recorded for the first time in the Netherlands in 1997. In the summer of 1998 extremely high densities (> 6 ind. l(-)1) of this neozoon were recorded in one of the Biesbosch reservoirs (Honderd en Dertig). This high abundance can not be explained by a recent invasion. Either H. anomala reached the Netherlands via the River Rhine, probably aided by shipping, or through transport with ballast water from the Baltic or Black Sea. The invasion had dramatic effects on the zooplankton composition and abundance: from the end of August onwards hardly any Anomopoda, Ostracoda, Rotifera and invertebrate predators (Leptodora kindti and Bythotrephes longimanus) were present. Copepod densities, however, were not influenced. Chlorophyll-a concentrations were significantly lower compared to previous years, possibly the result of mysids feeding on the algae. Laboratory experi ments revealed that H. anomala is a voracious predator and also an omnivorous feeder. Life history characteristics and behaviour of H. anomala fit into general mysid ecology. The hidden life style of H. anomala during the day makes it difficult to assess its present geographical distribution. More attention should therefore be given to appropriate sampling of this mysid. Because of its broad prey-size range H. anomala may pose a threat to existing lake restoration programmes (biomanipulation) in the Netherlands. In addition to the records of the Biesbosch reservoirs, H. anomala was found in the River Meuse and in reservoir Andijk, in the northern part of the Netherlands.

For this period, sulfur and water budgets were calculated using a hydrochemical model developed for well-mixed nonstratifying lakes. Total atmospheric deposition of S decreased significantly after 1986 at both locations. A model describing the sulfur budget in terms of input, output and reduction/oxidation processes predicted a fast decrease of pool water SO42- concentrations after a decrease of atmospheric input. However, SO42- concentrations in the surface water was lowered only slightly or remained constant. Apparently a source within the lake caused the unexpectedly high SO42- concentrations. The possible supply of SO42- from the sediment through regulation by (K-)Al-SO4 containing minerals or desorption of SO42- from positively charged surfaces in the sediment was evaluated. Solubility calculations of pore water with respect to alunite, basaluminite and jurbanite indicated that SO42- concentration was not regulated by these minerals. lt is suggested here (1) that desorption of SO42- from peaty sediments may account for the estimated SO42- supply provided that the adsorption complex is periodically recharged by partial oxidation of the upper bottom sediments and (2) that because of exposure of a part of the pool bottom to the atmosphere during dry summers and subsequent oxidation of reduced S, the amount of SO42- may be provided which complements the decreasing depositional SO42- input. In future research these two mechanisms need to be investigated.

Length and scale samples collected during tournament weigh-in at thirteen lakes and impoundments were used to summarize age, growth, and mortality. Scale samples were also collected from a lake not used as a tournament site. The conceptual requirement of a trade-off between growth and reproduction was the basis on which life history patterns of smallmouth bass were addressed. The von Bertalanffy growth model was used to represent this trade-off and parameters, such as asymptotic size and the growth coefficient, were used within the framework of life history invariants for inferring size at maturity. Estimates for size at maturity fell within known ranges for smallmouth bass after uncovering the life history invariant of relative size at maturity (L-mat /L-infinity = 0.6) for this data set. Production-to-biomass ratios (P/B) were determined for each population based on inferred weight at maturity. The mean P/B ratio for Nova Scotia smallmouth bass matched a P/B ratio for this species from other life history data. Instantaneous natural mortality rate, estimated by doubling the von Bertalanffy growth coefficient (M = 2 x K), closely matched estimates provided by a review of North American data on age and growth of smallmouth bass. Fish community structure appears to play a role in determining asymptotic size of smallmouth bass in Nova Scotia. The presence of chain pickerel Esox niger, as well as sites with only one other co-existing fish species, generally result in lower asymptotic size for smallmouth bass.																			0892-2284		1-888569-38-7				2002	31						535	544																WOS:000180817600043

Water balance components for LUB were estimated for the 2001-2011 period, using RS-based datasets for precipitation, actual evapotranspiration, soil moisture and snow storage. Ground-based data were used for validation of RS data as well as water balance closure purpose. GRACE terrestrial water storage data were also used to validate the water balance method results.New hydrological insights for the region: GRACE results confirmed an average WSC of -921 million cubic meters per year (MCM/yr) (-17.6 mm over the basin area). WSC time series in the basin floor (average:-913 MCM/yr, or-53 mm over the basin floor area) was estimated by summing the related water storage components, and then subtracted from the basin WSC to estimate the mountain block WSC time series (average:-8 MCM/yr, or-0.2 mm over the mountain block area). To evaluate its authenticity, the estimated mountain block WSC time series was then compared to mountain block rivers' base flow and springs' discharge, showing a considerable correlation between the time series. Considering the faster water resources depletion in the basin floor (where anthropological factors are significant) than in the mountain block (where anthro-pological factors are rare), one can conclude that anthropological factors may have the primary role in deteriorating water resources conditions in the basin.					; Guan, Huade/E-9262-2015	Aghayi, Mohammad Mahdi/0000-0002-9031-151X; Guan, Huade/0000-0001-5425-6974														2214-5818				OCT	2023	49								101511	10.1016/j.ejrh.2023.101511	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2023.101511													WOS:001148084600001

Here, the approach is evaluated in its applicability to lakes, demonstrated through a case study in the west of Ireland. Surface water temperature patterns generated from Landsat 7 ETM+ Thermal Infrared (TIR) images are used to detect groundwater inputs captured as anomalous cold plumes visibly emanating from shallow lake margins during summer months. Qualitative assessments of groundwater inputs are completed using natural tracers (radon (Rn-222, t(1/2) = 3.8 days) and conductivity) to verify the presence of groundwater and to identify localized seepage sites or groundwater "hotspots". Despite the difficulties in acquiring cost-and cloud free satellite imagery and the inevitable mismatch between satellite image acquisition and in-situ lake survey dates, the results are extremely promising. Temperature values generated from the thermal images reveal a strong negative correlation with measured radon activity which implies that decreases in surface water temperatures are associated with increases in radon activity and hence groundwater inputs to the lake. The study demonstrates the suitability of the approach as a comprehensive and cost-effective preliminary assessment tool for identification and localization of groundwater discharge entry points for use potentially in any region where discernible temperature differences exist. Understanding where groundwater discharge occurs is the first step towards more in-depth geochemical surveys that seek to clarify the role played by groundwater in lacustrine biogeochemical budgets.

After about A. D. 1826, glacier retreat led to a fall in lake level and to exposure of the former shoreline, which includes well-developed platforms cut in metamorphic bedrock. The rock platforms, up to 5.3 m wide and backed by cliffs up to 1.55 m high, are partially covered by large angular boulders which form pavements. Accurate levelling has permitted correlation of platform fragments, overflow cols and related features of the shoreline, such as benches eroded in moraines, ice-push ridges, a perched delta, vegetation trim-lines, lichen limits and a ''lichen-kill'' zone. The evolution of the lake, the chronology of deglaciation and the period of formation of the rock platforms have been dated by lichenometry, supported by 14C dating, Schmidt hammer ''R''-values and historical data. The morphology of the rock platforms, together with estimates of their rate of erosion ranging from 1.4 to 7.1 cm/year, indicate the importance of frost shattering (frost riving, frost wedging or macrogelivation) at the lake margin under a periglacial climate, while the permanence of such platforms as landscape features suggests their use in the reconstruction of former periglacial environments. A semiquantitative model is outlined for the development of rock platforms which emphasises deep penetration of the annual freeze-thaw cycle, the movement of unfrozen lake water towards the freezing plane, and the growth of segregation ice in fissures and cracks at the interface between lake ice and bedrock. Ice-push and ice-pull processes are involved primarily as transporting agents in the formation of boulder pavements and in the removal of debris from the platforms. Analogous processes may occur on polar coasts producing coastal rock platforms.																			0300-9483	1502-3885					1986	15	1					33	50		10.1111/j.1502-3885.1986.tb00741.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1502-3885.1986.tb00741.x													WOS:A1986C627700004

The hydrothermal illites characterize an extensive zone of quartz-sericite-pyrite alteration beneath two deeply rooted bodies of magmatic-related, quartz-alunite altered rock. Nineteen illites from a 3000 ft vertical drill hole were analyzed by XRD using the PVP-10 intercalation method and the computer program MudMaster (Bertaut-Warren-Averbach technique). Mean crystallite thicknesses, as determined from 001 reflections, range from 5-7 nanometers (nm) at depths from 0-1700 ft, then sharply increase to 10-16 nm at depths between 1800-2100 ft, and decrease again to 4-5 nm below this level. The interval of largest particle thickness correlates strongly with the zone of most intense quartz-sericite-pyrite alteration (QSP) and attendant high-density stockwork fracturing, and with the highest concentrations of Mo within the drill core. CTD shapes for the illite particles fall into two main categories: asymptotic and lognormal. The shapes of the CTDs are dependent on conditions of illite formation. The asymptotic CTDs correspond to a nucleation and growth mechanism, whereas surface-controlled growth was the dominant mechanism for the lognormal CTDs. Lognormal CTDs coincide with major through-going fractures or stockwork zones, whereas asymptotic CTDs are present in wallrock distal to these intense fracture zones. The increase in illite particle size and the associated zone of intense QSP alteration and stockwork veining was related by proximity to the dacitic magma(s), which supplied both reactants and heat to the hydrothermal system. However, no changes in illite polytype, which in other studies reflect temperature transitions, were observed within this interval.																			0003-004X					NOV-DEC	2002	87	11-12					1546	1556																WOS:000179416100005

Use of stable isotopes to document lake to stream movements of brook charr Salvelinus fontinalis: a case study from southern Lake Superior	ICHTHYOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Migrations between spawning, growth and refuge habitats are critical for many fish species. Partially migratory populations of brook charr Salvelinus fontinalis (known as brook trout in the United States), in which a portion of the population migrates, were once widespread in the Great Lakes region of North America, but are now scarce and a rehabilitation priority. Great Lakes fishery managers lack a simple, non-lethal means to determine whether a large brook charr caught in a Great Lakes accessible stream reach represents a stream-resident fish or migrant that previously spent time foraging and growing in Great Lakes waters. We explored a relatively inexpensive and non-lethal stable isotope approach for documenting lake to stream movements of brook charr, using fin clips from brook charr captured in streams in fall prior to spawning. Using fin tissue from juvenile and adult coho salmon captured in Michigan tributaries to Lake Superior, we confirmed distinct stable isotope signatures indicative of prior stream and Lake Superior foraging. We identified brook charr from tributaries accessible to Lake Superior whose stable isotope signatures were similar to those of lake-captured brook charr, lake charr and splake (a brook charr-lake charr hybrid) and distinct from stable isotope signatures of brook charr in streams inaccessible to Lake Superior fishes, suggestive of an adfluvial migratory pattern. Brook charr from two streams had elevated delta N-15 values, indicative of previous residency in a downstream lake receiving water from a sewage treatment facility. Our findings demonstrate the utility of stable isotope analysis as a non-lethal technique for confirming adfluvial movements of brook charr from Lake Superior to streams.																			1341-8998	1616-3915				NOV	2024	71	4			SI		529	539		10.1007/s10228-024-00961-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10228-024-00961-5		APR 2024											WOS:001202041800002

This condition originates in part from the dearth of absolute chronological controls. The occurrence of discrete tephra layers across this region may provide an opportunity to address this deficiency if a tephrochronological framework can be established. The potential of such a project is assessed within the context of a pilot study constrained within alluvial sequences of central western Argentina proximal to potential source vents in the Southern Volcanic Zone. The intersite discrimination and correlation of tephra layers on a geochemical basis is examined, with indirect chronological control for the eruption of each generated by optical dating. Alluvial sediments on either side of each of five tephra units at a type site were dated using the optically stimulated luminescence of fine-silt-sized quartz, thus providing an age control on each tephra (ca. 24,000, 30,000, 32,000, 39,000, and 48,000 yr). The geochemical composition of each tephra was derived. Using these data, tephra layers at other sites in the study area were geochemically analyzed and, in instances of statistical concordance in major oxide structure, correlated to the type site and therefore ascribed ages. This methodology identified a further sixth volcanic event between ca. 24,000 and 30,000 yr not registered by type-site tephras. The extension of this initial tephrochronological framework beyond the alluvial sequences of central western Argentina is encouraged by the occurrence of geochemically distinct tephra verified and dated in this study.

J	LaybournParry, J; Perriss, SJ				LaybournParry, J; Perriss, SJ			The role and distribution of the autotrophic ciliate Mesodinium rubrum (Myrionecta rubra) in three Antarctic saline lakes	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The microbial plankton of three saline lakes (Highway Lake, Ace Lake and Lake Abraxas) in the Vestfold Hills oasis, eastern Antarctica was investigated during the austral summer of 1993. The three lakes span the salinity range from brackish to seawater. In the two deeper meromictic lakes (Ace and Abraxas) the distribution of the microbial components was related to the chemical and physical characteristics of the water column. Heterotrophic flagellates and ciliates were most abundant above the chemocline in oxygenated epilimnetic waters, while bacteria numbers increased dramatically in the water below the chemocline. In Highway Lake, where the water column has a uniform conductivity and temperature, vertical distribution of the microbial plankton displayed a different pattern. Abundances of bacteria in epilimnetic water ranged between 1.02-1.2x10(8) l(-1) in Ace Lake and 3.6-3.8x10(8) l(-1) in Lake Abraxas. In Highway Lake bacterial concentrations averaged 0.54-1.06x10(8) l(-1). Nanoflagellate concentrations in Ace and Highway Lakes were in the region of 450-3000x10(3) l(-1), while in Lake Abraxas they were much lower: 92-790x10(3) l(-1), which reflected the much lower bacterial food resources in this lake. The ciliate concentration in Highway Lake was extremely high, on occasions in excess of 200x10(3) l(-1). Mesodinium rubrum was abundant in all three lakes during November and December and ranged from 34-48% of the total ciliate community in Highway Lake, 83-99% in Ace Lake and 82-88% in Lake Abraxas. Primary production measurements in Ace Lake and Highway Lake indicate that Mesodinium may be contributing between 15-40% of carbon fixation in the phytoplankton.																			0003-9136					DEC	1995	135	2					179	194																WOS:A1995TN68100002
J	Ibbeken, H; Warnke, D				Ibbeken, H; Warnke, D			The Hanaupah-Fan shoreline deposit at Tule Spring, a gravelly shoreline deposit of Pleisticene Lake Manly, Death Valley, California, USA	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The Hanaupah-Fan Shoreline Deposit (HSD) is an as yet undescribed occurrence of shoreline sediments of late Pleistocene Lake Manly in Death Valley, California. It is located in the southern part of Death Valley, at the northeastern periphery of Hanaupah Fan. The HSD is a gently sloping, WSW-ENE elongated ridge, about 600 m long, 165 m wide and 8 m high. Its surface extends from -12 to +28 m in elevation, i.e. it has a vertical range of 40 m. We interpret the deposit as a sediment body that extended from the Hanaupah Fan east into the lake. Rising lake level, and waves approaching both from the north and south eroded fan materials, and produced a sediment body with a complex architecture. Fetch for waves approaching from either direction was about 40 km. The sedimentary inventory consists of cross-stratified gravel beds of various size ranges, dipping towards the north, south, and east, and of horizontal berm gravel beds, and horizontal silt layers. A discordant gravel layer covers the entire surface of the deposit, probably produced by wave action during the last phase of lake regression. This uniform gravel layer forms a surface that is distinctly different from the surrounding fan surfaces. It is relatively fine grained, much better sorted, and densely packed. Rock varnish is very well developed, and imparts a dark color to the surface, which makes it easily recognizable on aerial photographs. No absolute age date is available as yet, but circumstantial evidence places the formation of the deposit at the peak of marine isotope stage 2 (Wisconsinan/Weichsellian glacial maximum).																			0921-2728	1573-0417				APR	2000	23	4					439	447		10.1023/A:1008187713442	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1008187713442													WOS:000087069200007

Relative sea level changes and glacio-isostatic modelling in the Beagle Channel, Tierra del Fuego, Chile: Glacial and tectonic implications	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The Beagle Channel crosses the southernmost tip of South America (Tierra del Fuego), connecting the South Atlantic with the Southeastern Pacific. Raised beaches occur up to 10 m above mean sea level (m a.m.s.l.), especially along the northern (Argentinian) shore, and have been dated using marine shells. The southern (Chilean) shore is well-known for its abundance of shell middens at different levels above the present shore, particularly along the island of Isla Navarino, but the relative sea level history in this glacially impacted landscape has not previously been investigated. In this study we present postglacial relative sea level changes on Isla Navarino, based on sediment cores from six lagoons, bogs or lakes, and stratigraphic investigations of three open sections, of which one is of MIS 5e age. In addition, one core from a lagoon in the south- western Beagle Channel has been analysed and a system of terraces was mapped in the north-western Beagle Channel. The analyses of the core sites have resulted in two tentative relative sea level curves, displaying a rapid sea level rise at 8500-6500 cal yr BP, amounting to similar to 10 and 14 m in eastern and western Isla Navarino, respectively, and reaching levels of similar to 8 and > 10 m, respectively, followed by a slow relative sea level fall. Our sea level observations have been compared with a range of modelling results of glacial-isostatic adjustments (GIA) for estimating timing of deglaciation and ice sheet thicknesses. Based mainly on the GIA modelling of the altitude of the MIS 5e beach sediments, situated at 13 m, we can conclude that no other uplift than GIA is needed to explain their altitude. Regarding the modelling of postglacial sea levels we can conclude that no model has been found that satisfies all of the observational evidence, but that deglaciation most likely preceded Northern Hemisphere main deglaciation by at least 3 kyr, which agrees with the deglaciation age of Isla Navarino (>16 000 cal yr BP). In addition, our model runs imply that the Patagonian and Tierra del Fuego ice sheet thicknesses were in the order of similar to 1500 m. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The more evolved phonolitic white pumice exhibits well-developed, stratigraphically controlled chemical gradients in all major and trace elements whereas the tephriphonolitic grey pumice is compositionally less variable and lacks such gradients. Incompatible elements are mostly enriched in the white pumice, whereas the grey pumice shows higher contents of compatible elements such as Ti and Mg. The difference in chemical composition between white and grey pumice is interpreted in terms of fractional crystallization of clinopyroxene, sanidine and leucite. The well-developed gradients of the white pumice indicate a stable layering within the upper phonolitic magma body, which is thought to originate from diffusion processes of highly incompatible elements. The lack of a similar stratigraphy-related zonation within the grey pumice indicates a more homogeneous tephriphonolitic magma resulting from continuous convective mixing within the lower part of the magma chamber. The transition from white to grey pumice is characterized by a boundary zone containing. besides white and grey pumice clasts, a third type of pumice. ''the boundary pumice'', which is light grey in color; this pumice is internally homogeneous, without evidence of physical mingling between ''white'' and ''grey'' glass, and is typically characterized by intermediate MgO, K2O and Ba contents. It is interpreted to represent a third magma component in the magma chamber, the interface magma layer, resulting from mixing and diffusion processes across the phonolitic/tephriphonolitic magma boundary.																			0935-1221	1617-4011				MAY-JUN	1994	6	3					387	395																WOS:A1994NN79400009

Lake oxygen isotopes as recorders of North American Rocky Mountain hydroclimate: Holocene patterns and variability at multi-decadal to millennial time scales	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Lake sediment oxygen isotope records (calcium carbonate-delta O-18) in the western North American Cordillera developed during the past decade provide substantial evidence of Pacific ocean-atmosphere forcing of hydroclimatic variability during the Holocene. Here we present an overview of 18 lake sediment delta O-18 records along with a new compilation of lake water delta O-18 and delta H-2 that are used to characterize lake sediment sensitivity to precipitation delta O-18 in contrast to fractionation by evaporation. Of the 18 records, 14 have substantial sensitivity to evaporation. Two records reflect precipitation-delta O-18 since the middle Holocene, Jellybean and Bison Lakes, and are geographically positioned in the northern and southern regions of the study area. Their comparative analysis indicates a sequence of time-varying north-south precipitation-delta O-18 patterns that is evidence for a highly non-stationary influence by Pacific ocean-atmosphere processes on the hydroclimate of western North America. These observations are discussed within the context of previous research on North Pacific precipitation-delta O-18 based on empirical and modeling methods. The Jellybean and Bison Lake records indicate that a prominent precipitation-delta O-18 dipole (enriched-north and depleted-south) was sustained between-3.5 and 1.5 ka, which contrasts with earlier Holocene patterns, and appears to indicate the onset of a dominant tropical control on North Pacific ocean-atmosphere dynamics. This remains the state of the system today. Higher frequency reversals of the north-south precipitation-delta O-18 dipole between-2.5 and 1.5 ka, and during the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age, also suggest more varieties of Pacific ocean-atmosphere modes than a single Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) type analogue. Results indicate that further investigation of precipitation-delta O-18 patterns on short (observational) and long (Holocene) time scales is needed to improve our understanding of the processes that drive regional precipitation-delta O-18 responses to Pacific ocean-atmosphere variability, which in turn, will lead to a better understanding of internal Pacific ocean-atmosphere variability and its response to external climate forcing mechanisms.

Of first remarked was the occurrence of series of long-chain (C-21-C-32) branched alkenes, alkenes, alcohols and alkanoic acids, which showed quite small odd-even carbon number preferences with the maximum abundance in the range of C-28-C-30. These long-chain branched compound series have been observed almost ubiquitously in moderately acidic (pH = 3-6) but neither in circumneutral nor strongly acidic (pH < 2) lake sediments in Japan. Mass spectra of the branched alkanes and alkenes with strong fragment ions of (M-29)(+) and (M-30)(+), respectively, showed that both series possess an anteiso (3-methyl or (omega-2)-methyl) structure. A relatively large intensity of 57(+) ion in the mass spectra of the branched alcohols (as TMS ethers) and alkanoic acids (as methyl esters) indicated that they also have the same anteiso, i.e., (omega-2)-methyl structure. Occurrence of these anteiso compounds was accompanied by a significant decrease of the odd or even carbon-number preference of concomitant straight-chain compounds, which suggested the source of these anteiso compounds might be bacteria. Intimate relationship between these characteristic lipid compositions and the acidic nature of the lake water was substantiated by the observation of core sediments, since the acidification of the Lake Tazawa-ko was onset in 1940 due to artificial introduction of the River Tamagawa water charged with a strongly acidic hot spring water.																			0016-7002	1880-5973					1996	30	2					111	130		10.2343/geochemj.30.111	http://dx.doi.org/10.2343/geochemj.30.111													WOS:A1996UV86500005

Bacterial GDGTs in Holocene sediments and catchment soils of a high Alpine lake: application of the MBT/CBT-paleothermometer	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												A novel proxy for continental mean annual air temperature (MAAT) and soil pH, the MBT/CBT-paleothermometer, is based on the temperature (T) and pH-dependent distribution of specific bacterial membrane lipids (branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers - GDGTs) in soil organic matter. Here, we tested the applicability of the MBT/CBT-paleothermometer to sediments from Lake Cadagno, a high Alpine lake in southern Switzerland with a small catchment of 2.4 km(2). We analysed the distribution of bacterial GDGTs in catchment soils and in a radiocarbon-dated sediment core from the centre of the lake, covering the past 11 000 yr. The distribution of bacterial GDGTs in the catchment soils is very similar to that in the lake's surface sediments, indicating a common origin of the lipids. Consequently, their transfer from the soils into the sediment record seems undisturbed, probably without any significant alteration of their distribution through in situ production in the lake itself or early diagenesis of branched GDGTs. The MBT/CBT-inferred MAAT estimates from soils and surface sediments are in good agreement with instrumental values for the Lake Cadagno region (similar to 0.5 A degrees C). Moreover, downcore MBT/CBT-derived MAAT estimates match in timing and magnitude other proxy-based T reconstructions from nearby locations for the last two millennia. Major climate anomalies recorded by the MBT/CBT-paleothermometer are, for instance, the Little Ice Age (similar to 14th to 19th century) and the Medieval Warm Period (MWP, similar to 9th to 14th century). Together, our observations indicate the quantitative applicability of the MBT/CBT-paleothermometer to Lake Cadagno sediments. In addition to the MWP, our lacustrine paleo T record indicates Holocene warm phases at about 3, 5, 7 and 11 kyr before present, which agrees in timing with other records from both the Alps and the sub-polar North-East Atlantic Ocean. The good temporal match of the warm periods determined for the central Alpine region with north-west European winter precipitation strength implies a strong and far-reaching influence of the North Atlantic Oscillation on continental European T variations during the Holocene.

Dual Discharge Approach to Accessing Assimilative Capacity: Probabilistic Analysis and Management Application	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												A dual discharge strategy has been proposed for management of the effluent from the Syracuse Metropolitan Treatment Plant (Metro). The approach involves routing the discharge to the Seneca River when assimilative capacity is available there and to Onondaga Lake when it is not. Application of a deterministic modeling approach has demonstrated that the dual discharge strategy is effective in meeting water-quality standards/goals in both the river [dissolved oxygen (DO)] and the lake [total phosphorus (TP)] under summer average conditions of river flow and upstream boundary condition DO. Here, that analysis is extended to include a probabilistic treatment of the impact of natural variability in river flow and DO boundary conditions on the feasibility of this management option. Model simulations, incorporating these key sources of system variability, indicate that the dual discharge strategy will meet the lake management goal for TP similar to 94% of the time, with no attendant violation of river DO standards. Excursions from the lake TP goal, occurring similar to 6% of the time, range from 1-5 mu g.L-1, are within the range of uncertainty in indicators applied in identifying trophic status. This novel management option is compared with an in-lake discharge alternative in terms of technical and economic feasibility and public acceptance of resultant water quality. Additional management actions, recommended to accompany implementation of the dual discharge strategy, are discussed.																			0733-9372	1943-7870				JUL	2010	136	7					666	673		10.1061/(ASCE)EE.1943-7870.0000209	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)EE.1943-7870.0000209													WOS:000278909200002

The concentrations of the most common toxicants fluctuated widely during the study in each of the lakes. Meg Lake was the most polluted, with the concentrations of As, Pb, cyanide and Cu reaching 3.0, 0.65, 0.60 and 0.65 g/m3, respectively. Although the levels of As and Pb in the other 2 lakes were roughly similar to those recorded in Meg Lake, cyanide and Cu usually fell below detectable limits. Changes in the level of contamination were poorly correlated with variations in the abundance of the flora and fauna. While phytoplankton (Chlamydomonas lapponica, Aphanothece microspora) were common in Meg Lake, reaching densities of 200 mg/m3, zooplankton were either rare or absent. Algal populations in Keg and Peg Lakes, which were dominated by C. lapponica and Oocystis parva, attained maximum densities of 200 and 150 mg/m3, respectively. The most common zooplankter, Keratella quadrata, maintained populations of up to 20-40 .times. 104 animals/m3, and was followed in abundance by Daphnia middendorffiana and Cyclops bicuspidatus thomasi. The prevalent species may have developed a resistance to metals. Taxa not previously associated with heavy metal contamination may have the ability to adapt to pollution. High As and Pb levels probably had less impact on zooplankton than on phytoplankton, under field conditions.																			0043-1354	1879-2448					1979	13	12					1193	1202		10.1016/0043-1354(79)90163-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(79)90163-5													WOS:A1979HY52500010

Assessing the relative impacts of land-use change and river regulation on Burdekin River (Australia) floodplain wetlands	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												The Burdekin River floodplain wetlands are internationally important and act as a sink for sediments and nutrients that would otherwise enter the World Heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef lagoon. The Burdekin River has the highest natural discharge of any Great Barrier Reef catchment and contributes the greatest mass of sediment to the reef. The river and its catchment have been substantially modified by land clearance, river regulation introduced in the 1960s, the construction of the Burdekin Falls Dam in 1987 and invasive aquatic plants. We hypothesised that the natural variability of Burdekin River discharge would render its wetland ecosystems resistant to human-induced pressures. Diatoms were analysed from the sediments of two lower Burdekin River floodplain wetlands with contrasting regulation histories. Labatt Lagoon has a long history of flow alteration, whereas Swan's Lagoon has experienced limited regulation. Both wetlands experienced dramatic increases in sedimentation as a result of land clearance, yet the Swan's Lagoon diatom record indicates that the wetland's ecology remains within the range of natural variability. In contrast, Labatt Lagoon is markedly different from its pre-settlement state. It is now permanent, having been ephemeral for more than 1000 years before European settlement. The conversion to artificial permanence facilitated aquatic plant invasion, resulting in more marked changes than widespread pastoralism. Modern diatom assemblages from 28 lower Burdekin River floodplain wetlands indicate that the contemporary flora of Swan's Lagoon is unusual. Most wetlands have similar assemblages to those in the Labatt Lagoon record in its present, altered state. It is possible, therefore, that the ecological shift registered in Labatt Lagoon is widespread. Diatom records highlight the striking impact that river regulation has had on the trajectory of the Burdekin floodplain wetlands. It is likely that wetland rehabilitation can be facilitated by the re-introduction of a variable hydrological regime.					; Cadd, Haidee/GSM-8389-2022	Cadd, Haidee/0000-0001-5770-3557; Tibby, John/0000-0002-5897-2932; Marshall, Jonathan/0000-0002-7177-4543; 													1052-7613	1099-0755				OCT	2019	29	10					1712	1725		10.1002/aqc.3151	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.3151		AUG 2019											WOS:000479835200001

Distribution and Habitat Associations of Radio-Tagged Adult Lost River Suckers and Shortnose Suckers in Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Radiotelemetry was used to investigate the summer distribution and diet habitat associations of endangered adult Lost River suckers Deltistes luxatus and shortnose Suckers Chasmistes brevirostris ill northern Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon. From 2002 to 2004, Lost River and shortnose Suckers were tracked by boat. and water depth and water quality were Measured at each fish location. A series of water quality monitors were deployed in northern Upper Klamath Lake to provide temporal information oil ambient temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen, and water samples were collected to assess chlorophyll a concentration. Stickers moved into northern Upper Klamath Lake during June and began to leave lit late September cacti year. Kernel density estimates revealed differences in the distribution in the northern portion of Upper Klamath Lake lit 2002 and 2004. lit 2003, however, both Lost River and shortnose suckers were commonly located within and offshore front Pelican Bay, a shallow (1.0-2.0 m), ground water-influenced area of Upper Klamath Lake. This was especially obvious beginning in late July of 2003, concurrent with reduced dissolved oxygen levels (<4.0 mg/L) in the northern portion of Upper Klamath Lake that resulted from a die-off of the cyanobacterium Aphanizomenon flos-aquae. Both Lost River and shortnose suckers were generally associated with water depths greater than the mean depth (2.9 m) of northern Upper Klamath Lake. Evidence ratios did not suggest died differences in depth, temperature, dissolved oxygen, or pH at sticker locations. Both Lost River and shortnose suckers generally occupied depths greater than 2.0 m. except when suckers Sought refuge in Pelican Bay during periods of poor water quality. Despite the potential for increased avian predation, suckers appeared to benefit front moving into Pelican Bay rather than staying in areas where dissolved oxygen was low. Pelican Bay appears to he an important refugium and thus, may be important for sucker conservation.																			0002-8487					JAN	2009	138	1					153	168		10.1577/T07-252.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T07-252.1													WOS:000268500900014

Analysis of the Lake Michigan data shows that mean polychlorobiphenyl (PCB) concentrations declined from a maximum of 22.91 mg/kg in 1974 to 5.63 mg/kg in 1982. Mean total DDT concentrations declined from 19.9 mg/kg in 1970 to 2.74 mg/kg in 1982. The decline in both contaminants closely followed first order loss kinetics. If the current declines continue, PCB concentrations will decline to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) tolerance of 2.0 mg/kg in 1988. Mean total DDT concentrations will fall to the International Joint Commission (IJC) objective of 1.0 mg/kg by 1991. Mean dieldrin concentrations increased significantly from 0.20 mg/kg in 1971 to 0.58 mg/kg in 1979 before declining to 0.21 mg/kg in 1982. The decline from 1979-1982 followed first order loss kinetics. As this decline is not reflected in other species (bloater chubs, smelt) it will require additional years of monitoring to determine if dieldrin concentrations between 1979 and 1982 truly represents a declining trend. The only statistically significant trend other than in Lake Michigan was for total DDT which declined significantly in Lake Superior lake trout. Large data variance and the short time frame covered (1977-1982) interfered with detection of trends on Lakes Superior and Huron.																			0090-4341	1432-0703					1986	15	4					349	356		10.1007/BF01066401	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01066401													WOS:A1986C769500004

The suitability of a dynamic coastal lake to support the diadromous fish Galaxias maculatus	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Context Globally, intermittently closed and open lakes and lagoons (ICOLLs) can constitute highly productive coastal environments that support a range of fisheries. With growing pressures on fish communities, understanding the role of ICOLL management in population dynamics is increasingly important for conservation. Aims To determine whether the flood-driven management and environmental degradation of New Zealand's largest coastal lake, Te Waihora-Lake Ellesmere, has created a conflict with the life history of diadromous inanga, Galaxias maculatus Jenyns, potentially limiting persistence of this species. Methods The timing of post-larval migration of inanga was assessed over 2 years (2021 and 2022) and compared with historic patterns of managed lake openings. Immigrating inanga individuals were tagged to assess subsequent development, before potential reproductive output was quantified using artificial spawning substrates. Key results Peak migration periods were mismatched with the timing of most lake openings. After quickly transiting into tributaries, inanga seemingly died within a few months. No spawning was detected. Conclusions and implications The mismatch between lake opening management and the annual life history of inanga prevents the reliable supply of post-larvae needed to sustain a persistent population, with severe environmental degradation being likely to restrict subsequent survival through summer conditions. This study has highlighted the need for management interventions to be tuned to the life histories of at-risk species.

Ecosystem Alterations and Species Range Shifts: An Atlantic-Mediterranean Cephalaspidean Gastropod in an Inland Egyptian Lake	PLOS ONE												The eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean marine Cephalaspidea gastropod Haminoea orbignyana was collected from Lake Qarun (Fayoum, Egypt), a landlocked lake that has undergone a shift from freshwater to estuarine conditions in the past 100 years. Species identity was confirmed by both morphological (anatomical dissection and scanning electron microscopy) and molecular methods (COI gene phylogeny). Observations suggested a robust population of H. orbignyana in the lake with a density of ca. 64 individuals/m(2) and ca. 105 egg masses/m(2) during surveys conducted in the summer of 2013. The vast majority of snails and egg masses were found under rocks. Observations of egg masses in the lab showed a gradual change from whitish to yellow-green as the eggs matured and the release of veliger larvae alone after about a week. Although adult cephalaspideans readily consumed filamentous red and green algae, and cyanobacteria, laboratory trials showed that they consumed significantly more of the red alga Ceramium sp., than of the green alga Cladophora glomerata, with consumption of Oscillatoria margaritifera being similar to those on the two algae. When grown on these resources for 16 days, H. orbignyana maintained their mass on the rhodophyte and cyanobacterium, but not in starvation controls. No cephalaspideans grew over the course of this experiment. Lake Qarun has been periodically restocked with Mediterranean fishes and prawns since the 1920s to maintain local fisheries, which represents a possible route of colonization for H. orbignyana. Yet, based on literature records, it seems more likely that invasion of the lake by this gastropod species has occurred only within the last 20 years. As human activities redistribute species through direct and indirect means, the structure of the community of this inland lake has become unpredictable and the long-term effects of these recent introductions are unknown.

The polyunsaturated fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) plays an important role in aquatic food webs, in particular at the primary producerconsumer interface where keystone species such as daphnids may be constrained by its dietary availability. Such constraints and their seasonal and interannual changes may be detected by continuous measurements of EPA concentrations. However, such EPA measurements became common only during the last two decades, whereas long-term data sets on plankton biomass are available for many well-studied lakes. Here, we test whether it is possible to estimate EPA concentrations from abiotic variables (light and temperature) and the biomass of prey organisms (e.g. ciliates, diatoms and cryptophytes) that potentially provide EPA for consumers. 2. We used multiple linear regression to relate size- and taxonomically resolved plankton biomass data and measurements of temperature and light intensity to directly measured EPA concentrations in Lake Constance during a whole year. First, we tested the predictability of EPA concentrations from the biomass of EPA-rich organisms (diatoms, cryptophytes and ciliates). Secondly, we included the variables mean temperature and mean light intensity over the sampling depth (020 m) and depth (08 and 820 m) as factors in our model to check for large-scale seasonal- and depth-dependent effects on EPA concentrations. In a third step, we included the deviations of light and temperature from mean values in our model to allow for their potential influence on the biochemical composition of plankton organisms. We used the Akaike Information Criterion to determine the best models. 3. All approaches supported our proposition that the biomasses of specific plankton groups are variables from which seston EPA concentrations can be derived. The importance of ciliates as an EPA source in the seston was emphasised by their high weight in our models, although ciliates are neglected in most studies that link fatty acids to seston taxonomic composition. The large-scale seasonal variability of light intensity and its interaction with diatom biomass were significant predictors of EPA concentrations. The deviation of temperature from mean values, accounting for a depth-dependent effect on EPA concentrations, and its interaction with ciliate biomass were also variables with high predictive power. 4. The best models from the first and second approaches were validated with measurements of EPA concentrations from another year (1997). The estimation with the best model including only biomass explained 80%, and the best model from the second approach including mean temperature and depth explained 87% of the variability in EPA concentrations in 1997. 5. We show that it is possible to predict EPA concentrations reliably from plankton biomass, while the inclusion of abiotic factors led to results that were only partly consistent with expectations from laboratory studies. Our approach of including biotic predictors should be transferable to other systems and allow checking for biochemical constraints on primary consumers.

Dynamics, diversity, and roles of bacterial transmission modes during the first asexual life stages of the freshwater sponge Spongilla lacustris	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOME												Background Sponge-associated bacteria play important roles in the physiology of their host, whose recruitment processes are crucial to maintain symbiotic associations. However, the acquisition of bacterial communities within freshwater sponges is still under explored. Spongilla lacustris is a model sponge widely distributed in European rivers and lakes, producing dormant cysts (named gemmules) for their asexual reproduction, before winter. Through an in vitro experiment, this study aims to describe the dynamics of bacterial communities and their transmission modes following the hatching of these gemmules. Results An overall change of bacterial beta-diversity was observed through the ontology of the juvenile sponges. These temporal differences were potentially linked, first to the osculum acquisition and the development of a canal system, and then, the increasing colonization of the Chlorella-like photosymbionts. Gemmules hatching with a sterilized surface were found to have a more dispersed and less diverse microbiome, revealing the importance of gemmule epibacteria for the whole holobiont stability. These epibacteria were suggested to be vertically transmitted from the maternal tissues to the gemmule surface. Vertical transmission through the incorporation of bacterial communities inside of the gemmule, was also found as a dominant transmission mode, especially with the nitrogen fixers Terasakiellaceae. Finally, we showed that almost no ASVs were shared between the free-living community and the juveniles, suggesting that horizontal recruitment is unlikely to happen during the first stages of development. However, the free-living bacteria filtered are probably used as a source of nutrients, allowing an enrichment of copiotrophic bacteria already present within its microbiome. Conclusions This study brings new insight for a better understanding of the microbiome acquisition during the first stages of freshwater sponge development. We showed the importance of epibacterial communities on gemmules for the whole holobiont stability, and demonstrated the near absence of recruitment of free-living bacteria during the first stages.

Diel variation in gillnet catches and vertical distribution of pelagic fishes in a stratified European reservoir	FISHERIES RESEARCH					Conference on Fish Stock Assessment Methods for Lakes and Reservoirs - Toward the True Picture of Fish Stock	SEP, 2007	Ceske Budejovice, CZECH REPUBLIC					The diet changes in gillnet catch rates and vertical distributions of pelagic fishes were determined in a deep, moderately eutrophic European reservoir. In late summer, when steep vertical gradients in temperature and dissolved oxygen developed in the reservoir, monofilament gillnets (12.5-70 mm bar mesh) covering the upper 7.5 m of the water column were set at two open-water locations over 44- and 46-h periods, respectively. Gillnets divided the sampled strata (i.e., the epilimnion and metalimnion) into five horizontal layers each 1.5 m thick. Captured fish were removed from the nets at regular 2-h intervals. The catches were numerically dominated by bleak Alburnus alburnus, roach Rutilus rutilus, perch Perca fluviatilis, bream Abramis brama and asp Aspius aspius. Catch rates varied considerably with the time of day. The total gillnet catch per 2-h was on average 3-4 times higher at twilight than during the day or at night. Decreased net visibility and increased fish activity were likely responsible for the high gillnet catches at dusk and dawn periods. The catches of individual species were not distributed uniformly across the five sampled depth layers. The majority of bleak and asp were captured in the surface layer (0-1.5 m), irrespective of day, twilight or night. During the daytime, roach were most abundant in the layer just above the thermocline (3-4.5 m), but at night they occupied the upper part of the epilimnion (0-3 m). Perch inhabited the lower epilimnion and the upper metalimnion (1.5-6 m), and were caught only during daytime and twilight. For bleak and roach, greater proportions of larger individuals were caught during the day, while proportions of smaller fish increased in twilight and night catches. This implies that individuals of the two species made diet migrations between pelagic and littoral habitats. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Deng, HW; Xiao, Y; Ma, LX; Jiang, ZL				Deng Hongwen; Xiao Yi; Ma Lixiang; Jiang Zhenglong			Genetic type, distribution patterns and controlling factors of beach and bars in the Second Member of the Shahejie Formation in the Dawangbei Sag, Bohai Bay, China	GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL												As an important reservoir type in the Bohai Bay Basin, China, lacustrine beach and bar sands which refer to the shallow water complex deposited mainly by nearshore, delta-rim and buried hill-related beaches as well as longshore bars were developed in a particular stage in the evolution of those faulted Cenozoic continental depressions. In the Chezhen Depression, for example, the Second Member of the Oligocene Shehejie Formation (abbr. as Es2 hereafter) formed during the rifting-to-thermal subsidence transitional stage. Although well developed in Es2, beach and bar sands are difficult to recognize owing to their relative thinness. The paper summarizes sedimentary characteristics of lacustrine beach and bar sands on cores and logs. Low-angle cross-stratification, swash stratification, as well as occasional small-scale hummocky cross-stratification resulted from storms can be observed in beach and bar sands. The paper distinguishes bars and beaches from each other in Es2 mainly based on the grain-size, bed thickness, facies succession and log responses. In order to predict the distribution of beach and bars, a chrono-stratigraphic correlation framework of Es2 in the study strata is established using a high-resolution sequence stratigraphic approach. Es2 strata are sub-divided into six medium-scale cycles and the mapping of the high-frequency cycles allows the geographic and stratigraphic distribution of both beach and bar sands to be predicted. The study shows that beach and bars are better developed in times of base-level fall than in base-level rise. Factors such as lake-level fluctuation, sediment supply, palaeogeomorphology and palaeowind direction have exerted control on the formation and distribution of beach and bar sands. Finally, the genetic pattern of beach and bar sands in the Es2 unit has been constructed, which provides a foundation for the prediction of beach and bars reservoir in continental basins in general.

Wavelet analysis is applied to a 10-yr record of cirrus cloud ruby (0.694 mu m) lidar backscatter data as a function of cloud height in order to study the presence of periodic cloud structures, such as the signatures of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, cirrus mammata, and uncinus cells (all with length scales of similar to 1-10 km), as well as mesoscale cloud organizations generally believed to be induced by gravity waves. About 8.4% of the data display structures after passing a 95% confidence level test, but an 80% confidence level, which seems better able to resolve structures spread over long periods, yields 16.4%. The amount of identified cloud structures does not change significantly with length scale from 0.2 to 200 km, although the frequency of mesoscale cloud structures tends to increase as length scales increase. The middle-to-lower portion of cirrus clouds contains the most identified cloud structures, which seems related to the mesoscale organization of fall streaks from cloud-top-generating cells. The variability of cirrus cloud optical depth tau (defined by the standard deviation over mean tau) derived from a combined lidar and infrared radiometer (LIRAD) analysis is shown to be largely independent of tau. Because visual examination of the lidar displays also indicates that few cirrus layers can be considered horizontally homogeneous over our typical 3-h lidar data collection period, the authors conclude that the clouds in their sample are inherently inhomogeneous even though most cirrus structures are not revealed as periodic by wavelet analysis.

HOUSEHOLD ECOLOGY AND FUEL GATHERING TRADITIONS OF RUSSIAN RURAL POPULATION OF THE SOUTH OF WESTERN SIBERIA DURING THE WAR YEARS, 1941-45: ON THE BASIS OF FIELD RESEARCH	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL												The aim of the research was to reveal the means of providing Russian rural population with fuel. The objectives of the research include studying the traditions of gathering. According to the hypothesis, gathering was based on the interaction of a peasant family and the natural environment, as well as on the non-waste nature of agricultural production. The author analyses the types of fuel, ways of gathering and transportation, distribution of chores in the family, manufacturing of transportation means, kinds of draught animals in different natural and ethno-climatic zones. The sources were materials of historical ethnographic expeditions; the methods were technologies of ethnography and oral history on the basis of historical memory of tradition bearers. The author considers that in the Russian Siberians' culture household heating during long winters was the most important element of the life sustaining culture. Two types of fuel were identified -natural materials and homesteading wastes. During the war years, they were the predominant types. The methods of their stocking up was gathering. The specific character of fuel types was determined by the natural-geographic conditions of the regions. The most advantageous zones were forest territories, with forest by-products as the main objects of gathering - branch timber, cones, brushwood. In steppe territories, resources for heating were limited - dead-grass, sagebrush, clay balls, waste products of farming and cattle breeding (straw, hay leftovers, dry dung). In lakeside territories, reed and sedge were gathered; in mountainous territories, dead-grass was gathered. The universal types of fuel were waste products of vegetable gardening - waste products of sunflowers, cabbage and potatoes. The author asserts that fuel gathering became an important life sustaining strategy. Traditions of gathering, transportation and stocking up were determined by types of fuel, its volume, its weight, the distance and family composition. Gathering in immediate surroundings were children's duty with fixed norms. Old men were involved in gathering connected with danger; women and teenagers were involved in long-distance gathering. There existed two ways of transportation -manual transportation and transportation with the help of draught animals. Draught animals for adults were cows, for children dogs. In case of manual transportation, people used bags and baskets, or carried bound fuel - bunches, bundles. Transportation means adapted for different seasons were made: wheel carts or sledge coaches. A universal transportation means was a travois. Male adults with disabilities and teenagers made them. Houses and farms had special spaces for storing the gathered fuel.

The lake was artificially divided into four sub-basins: two western basins receiving humic substances from an adjacent Sphagnum bog and two eastern basins isolated from this acidic inflow with installed curtains. Within the northeast (NE) and southwest (SW) basin compartments, one of each group were studied. In the peat influenced western basins the pH-values in the water columns were kept low and increased in the others. The stratification period increased in all four compartments from some weeks to some months, from April to October, with the development of anoxic hypolimnia in all compartments after the installation of the curtains. The layer with the most active methane production moved from a sediment depth of more than 20 cm before separation to close to the surface sediments in all compartments. Methanogenic micro-organisms were found in the whole sediment core - from surface sediments to a depth of 25 cm. The proportion of methanogens was approximately 15% of total microbial cell numbers, which were approximately 2 x 10(6) cells/ml sediment. Oligonucleotide probes targeting nearly all families of the phylum Euryarchaeota were tested with fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH). In both basins, with and without the influence from peat, oligonucleotide probe (MSMX) targeting Methanosarcinaceae could be detected only as methanogens. The finding of only acetate-using methanogens by FISH indicated acetate as a major methanogenic substrate. Concentration profiles of CH4 as a function of sediment depth were characterized in both basins by high concentrations in the top layers. Methane bubbles were released in the late summer in the eastern sub-basin only, likely from oversaturation in the surface sediments.

As the only Late Glacial lake known in the northern Jura Mountains, its existence has been documented by historical chronicles up to its final drainage in the late 16th century. Geological mapping indicates that former Lake Seewen originated when rocks from the Homberg Mountain slid into a river gorge near Fulnau and blocked the flow of the river Seebach. Age dating of the older lake sediments using radiocarbon and pollen indicates that this landslide happened around 13,000 to 13,500 BP. The lake extended upstream in an easterly direction leaching its maximum extension in the late sixth ol early seventh century AD. Although the lake sediments reach a thickness of more than 23 m above debris deposits, the water depth appears to have been limited to not more than 10 m. These lake sediments are highly cohesive, rich in clay and organic matter with silty layers. X-ray investigations revealed the existence of numerous "dropstones" in Late Glacial deposits. Holocene sedimentation took place at rates averaging 1.5 mm/a back to 7,000 BP and 2.6 mm/a between 7,000 and 9.000 BP. whereas the Late Glacial sedimentation rates are somewhat lower at 2.1 mm/a. Thin silty-sandy layers allow a correlation of different drill cores and indicate short-term changes in the sedimentation conditions which might he triggered by exceptional flood-events, storms, subaquatic slumping or earthquakes.

J	Dabrowski, JM; de Klerk, LP				Dabrowski, J. M.; de Klerk, L. p			An assessment of the impact of different land use activities on water quality in the upper Olifants River catchment	WATER SA												Routine sampling of water quality was conducted at sites along a longitudinal gradient from upstream to downstream in the Olifants River to determine spatial trends in nutrient and metal concentrations and to relate these trends to changes in land use activities in the catchment. In addition, once-off sampling was conducted at a number of sites located downstream of current mining, abandoned mining, agriculture, wastewater treatment works (WWTWs) and industry. Nutrient concentrations were relatively high and a number of sites within the catchment had average N:P ratios that were indicative of eutrophic to hypertrophic conditions. Routine and once-off sampling indicated that wastewater treatment works contribute high nutrient loads to the system. Trend analysis of Department of Water Affairs (DWA) data indicated significant positive trends in ortho-phosphate at 12 of 14 stations in the catchment. An increase in sulphate concentrations from upstream to downstream indicates that mining activities have a progressively greater impact on water quality with increasing distance downstream. While dissolved metal concentrations frequently exceeded chronic and acute effect aquatic ecosystem health guidelines (particularly aluminium, copper and zinc), there was no observable trend from upstream to downstream. Once-off sampling showed high variability in water quality parameters downstream of current mining activities, and some sites showed higher metal concentrations in comparison to other land use activities. However, the contribution of current mining activities to metals is low in comparison to the contribution from abandoned mines. Hydrological data showed that acidic rivers contribute proportionally higher flow volumes in comparison to neutral rivers during the drier winter months, which may significantly impact on the lower stretches of the upper Olifants River and into Loskop Dam. A prolonged drought period will most likely result in severe impacts to the lower reaches of the Olifants River and to Loskop Dam. Improved management and maintenance of wastewater treatment works and rehabilitation and/or treatment of abandoned mines and associated acid mine drainage are crucial. Proper rehabilitation of current mining activities is essential to avoid or minimise acid mine drainage related impacts in the future.

This study investigated the physiological responses and transcriptomic characteristics of E. nuttallii under high-temperature stress (HTS). The results indicated that HTS significantly reduced the absolute growth rate (AGR) and photosynthetic efficiency of E. nuttallii while concurrently elevating antioxidant enzyme activities, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and concentrations of osmotic adjustment compounds. Furthermore, the apical segments of E. nuttallii demonstrated greater sensitivity to HTS compared to the middle segments. Under exposure to 35 degrees C and 40 degrees C, antioxidant enzyme activities, MDA content, and osmotic adjustment compound levels were significantly higher in the apical segments than in the middle segments. Transcriptomic analysis revealed 7526 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the apical segments at 35 degrees C, a number substantially exceeding that observed in the middle segments. Enrichment analysis of DEGs revealed significant upregulation of key metabolic regulators under HTS, including carbohydrate metabolism genes (HXK, FRK) and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis enzymes (4CL, COMT). This transcriptional reprogramming demonstrates E. nuttallii's adaptive strategy of modulating carbon allocation and phenolic compound synthesis to mitigate thermal damage. Our findings not only elucidate novel thermotolerance mechanisms in aquatic plants but also provide candidate genetic targets (HXK, 4CL) for molecular breeding of heat-resilient cultivars through transcriptomic screening.																				2079-7737				AUG 4	2025	14	8							993	10.3390/biology14080993	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology14080993								40906168					WOS:001557916000001

H.			3D modelling of dreissenid mussel impacts on phytoplankton in a large lake supports the nearshore shunt hypothesis and the importance of wind-driven hydrodynamics	AQUATIC SCIENCES												A three-dimensional hydrodynamic model (ELCOM) coupled with a biological model (CAEDYM) was calibrated with field data from Lake Simcoe (2008) and used to examine the expected impact of dreissenid mussels on the distribution of phytoplankton and nutrients, mussel energetic, and the interactions with hydrodynamic conditions. In accordance with the near-shore shunt hypothesis and the actual distribution of mussels, the model predicted a considerable impact of mussels on phytoplankton in nearshore areas (< 15 m depth; -38 % phytoplankton). Horizontal advection could account for the lower (-15 % phytoplankton) offshore impact despite the absence of mussels within this region of the lake. These predictions were similar to observed long-term changes in phytoplankton biomass after the dreissenid mussel invasion. Simulated decreases in the initial mussel biomass by 50 % led to increased phytoplankton nearshore, increased mussel growth and decreased phosphorus excretion relative to ingestion. In contrast, increases in initial mussel biomass by 50 % resulted in minor changes in phytoplankton, since near-bottom depletion of phytoplankton caused growth and energy-limitation of mussels. The model, which was the first to capture metabolically-driven variations of mussel-mediated nutrient cycling, predicted a partial uncoupling of carbon and phosphorus cycling by mussels, driven by varying controls on mussel growth. A 60 % increase in the intensity of three storms during the summer had little net-effect on phytoplankton biomass, but reduced energy-limitation of mussels and increased mussel growth due to increased supply of phytoplankton. Our model demonstrates that near-bottom depletion of phytoplankton is an important process limiting the impact of mussels, and indicates that it affects the mussels' cycling of energy and nutrients. It further suggests that stronger storm events could lead to further increase of flux of organic matter from the pelagic zone to the benthos, further altering energy pathways in the lake.

J	Krézsek, C; Filipescu, S				Krézsek, C; Filipescu, S			Middle to Late Miocene sequence stratigraphy of the Transylvanian Basin (Romania)	TECTONOPHYSICS					4th Stephan Muller Topical Conference of the European-Geosciences-Union	MAY 31-JUN 05, 2003	Cheile Butii, ROMANIA	ISES				The history of Middle to Late Miocene evolution of the Transylvanian Basin was determined by the bordering Carpathian orogen evolution, the tectonic events being well recorded by the sedimentary history. The basin evolved in a back-are setting, under a regional, compressional stress field. The major tectonic events produced during the Late Sarmatian and Post-Pannonian were related to the reactivation of the pre-Badenian fault systems. The Transylvanian Basin got uplifted after the Late Pannonian (? during the Pliocene), and at least 500 in of sedimentary cover was eroded. Based on seismic and well-log interpretation, core and outcrop sedimentology, and microfauna, eight sequences were defined. The early Middle Miocene sequences are roughly synchronous to five 3rd order global sea-level cycles. Most of the recognized sequence boundaries are enhanced by regional tectonic events. The sedimentary evolution was also strongly influenced by salttectonics, active starting with the Late Sarmatian. Two sequences were identified in the Lower Badenian deposits. The third sequence (late Early Badenian to early Mid Badenian) preserves information about deeper shelf settings. The lowstand of the following sequence was responsible for the deposition of the salt formation (late Mid Badenian), an important lithostratigraphic marker in the sedimentary record of the basin. In general, the Upper Badenian deposits (parts of the 4th and 5th sequences) belong to deep marine submarine fan systems. The Sarmatian (partially 5th, 6th and partially 7th sequences) was characterized by diverse salinity conditions, stretching from brackish to hypersaline, and by high tectonic instability, which induced several significant relative sea-level falls. During that time, deltaic (north) and fandeltaic (east) systems fed submarine fans, stacked between salt-related submarine heights ("channeled" deep-marine depocenters). Most of the Pannonian deposits (partially 7th and 8th sequences) belong to submarine fan systems, but shallower facies were also found in the western and eastern part of the basin.

Estimates were made using ground-based UV-B data (Brewer spectrophotometers), solar radiation models, GIS tools, field characterization of vegetative features, and quantification of DOC concentration and spectral absorbance. UV-B dose estimates were made for the summer solstice, at a depth of 1 cm in each wetland. The mean dose across all wetlands and parks was 19.3 W-h m(-2) (range of 3.4-32.1 W-h m(-2)). The mean dose was lowest in Acadia (13.7 W-h m(-2)) and highest in Rocky (24.4 W-h m(-2)). Doses were significantly different among all parks. These wetland doses correspond to UV-B flux of 125.0 mu W cm(-2) (range 21.4-194.7 mu W cm(-2)) based on a day length, averaged among all parks, of 15.5 h. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), a key determinant of water-column UV-B flux, ranged from 0.6 (analytical detection limit) to 36.7 mg C L-1 over all wetlands and parks, and reduced potential maximal UV-B doses at 1-cm depth by 1%-87%. DOC concentration, as well as its effect on dose, was lowest in Sequoia and highest in Acadia (DOC was equivalent in Acadia, Glacier, and Rocky). Landscape reduction of potential maximal UV-B doses ranged from zero to 77% and was lowest in Sequoia. These regional differences in UV-B wetland dose illustrate the importance of considering all aspects of exposure in evaluating the potential impact of UV-B on aquatic organisms.

To quantify the extent to which these maternal traits may ultimately affect an organism's fitness, we undertook laboratory and field experiments with Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). To control for confounding effects caused by correlated traits, manipulations of the timing of fertilization combined with intraclutch comparisons were used. In the wild, a total of 1462 juveniles were marked at emergence from gravel nests. Recapture rates suggest that up to 83.5% mortality occurred during the first four months after emergence from the gravel nests, with the majority (67.5%) occurring during the initial period ending 17 days after median emergence. Moreover, the mortality was selective during this initial period, resulting in a significant phenotypic shift toward an earlier date of and an increased length at emergence. However, no significant selection differentials were detected thereafter, indicating that the critical episode of selection had occurred at emergence. Furthermore, standardized selection gradients indicated that selection was more intense on date of than on body size at emergence. Timing of emergence had additional consequences in terms of juvenile body size. Late-emerging juveniles were smaller than early-emerging ones at subsequent samplings, both in the wild and in parallel experiments conducted in seminatural stream channels, and this may affect success at subsequent size-selective episodes, such as winter mortality and reproduction. Finally, our findings also suggest that egg size had fitness consequences independent of the effects of emergence time that directly affected body size at emergence and, in turn, survival and size at later life stages. The causality of the maternal effects observed in the present study supports the hypothesis that selection on juvenile traits may play an important role in the evolution of maternal traits in natural populations.					; Fleming, Ian/I-7217-2012	Fleming, Ian/0000-0002-5541-824X; Einum, Sigurd/0000-0002-3788-7800; 													0014-3820	1558-5646				APR	2000	54	2					628	639		10.1111/j.0014-3820.2000.tb00064.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0014-3820.2000.tb00064.x								10937238					WOS:000086886500027
J	Guo, X; Chafetz, HS				Guo, Xuan; Chafetz, Henry S.			Trends in δ18O and δ13C values in lacustrine tufa mounds: Palaeohydrology of Searles Lake, California	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Four tufa facies have been identified in abundant tufa mounds that accumulated in Searles Lake, California, USA, during the Pleistocene. Covariance of delta O-18 and delta C-13 values within the tufa facies has been analysed and correlated with palaeo-lake history. This study demonstrates that characteristics of delta O-18 and delta C-13 values are different in each of the tufa facies and can be related to palaeo-lake stages. The first facies of tufa formation (P) has relatively low average delta O-18 and delta C-13 values (delta O-18 = -27 parts per thousand and delta C-13 = +1.2 parts per thousand, n = 14). These low values are attributed to rapid increases in the lake volume. This increase was followed by higher average delta O-18 and delta C-13 values of both the nodular (N) facies (delta O-18 = +1.8 parts per thousand and delta C-13 = +4.1 parts per thousand, n = 24) and the columnar (C) facies (delta O-18 = +0.6 parts per thousand and delta C-13 = +4.0 parts per thousand, n = 7). These higher values are interpreted to record a decrease in lake volume due to high evaporation and increased biogenic productivity. Following formation of facies C, the lake was essentially dry during formation of the finely laminated (LC) facies. Facies LC formed subaerially as spring water flowed up through the central conduit of the mounds and cascaded down their periphery. The relatively high delta O-18 and delta C-13 values for this facies (delta O-18 = +1.4 parts per thousand and delta C-13 = +4.4 parts per thousand, n = 12) are due to evaporation and fast CO2 degassing. Although covariant trends are well-displayed, variations in lake chemistry alter some of these trends due to periods of hyper-alkalinity. This study confirms the utility of stable isotopic analyses of lacustrine tufa facies to determine palaeo-lake history.																			0037-0746	1365-3091				JAN	2014	61	1					221	237		10.1111/sed.12085	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sed.12085													WOS:000328957800009

The mineralogical and geochemical signatures of core 01GC support the hypothesis of the gradual opening of Nares Strait between 8.8 and 8.2 cal ka BP and suggest a progressive retreat of glaciers surrounding Smith Bay. Lower sedimentation rates (<14 cm ka(-1)) recorded in core 01GC during the Middle Holocene, combined with the presence of coarse-grained sediments, indicate a landward retreat of Mittie Glacier and sea-ice free conditions during summer in Smith Bay from 5.4 to 3 cal ka BP. During the Late Holocene, the deposition of six coarse-grained layers close to Mittie Glacier seems to have been triggered by subglacial lake discharges upstream of its western arm. The only known surge of Mittie Glacier, recorded between 1992 and 2007, is identified in the core 23BC by a marked increase in coarse-grained sediment input.

J	LAWRENCE, MJF; HENDY, CH				LAWRENCE, MJF; HENDY, CH			CARBONATE DEPOSITION AND ROSS SEA ICE ADVANCE, FRYXELL BASIN, TAYLOR VALLEY, ANTARCTICA	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS												Mechanisms of carbonate deposition in Lake Fryxell, Taylor Valley, Antarctica (75.degree. 35''S, 163.degree. 35''E) have been investigated. The lake lies within an area once covered by Ross Sea 1 ice (c. 20000 years ago) and its proglacial lake. Lake sediments consist of five units, unit A being the lowermost deposit cored and unit E the uppermost. Three phases of carbonate deposition are evident in these sediments and result from climate changes associated with ice advances and retreat. (1) About 20000 years ago, a calcareous mud (unit B) was deposited in a deep proglacial Lake Washburn. The carbonate is of biogenic origin, and mixed calcite/aragonite mineralogy. Aragonite is the dominant phase. (2) About 10000 years ago the ice had retreated beyond the basin margins and the large volume of water then covered areas once under ice. This spreading of lake waters increased the ablation surface, resulting in evaporative concentration of lake waters, and a reduction in lake levels. Brine concentration caused the precipitation of the aragonite unit D. .delta.13C values indicate that biogenic processes continued to operate but were overshadowed by inorganic carbonate deposition. (3) Following the complete retreat of the Ross Sea ice, alpine glaciers then readvanced. Meltwaters therefrom flowed into the lake basin refilling the lake. Evaporated brines then rediffused up into the water column resulting in the present chemical stratification. Modification of the water column in the upper euphotic zone, mainly by photosynthetic algae, causes the precipitation of calcite which falls as a pelagic rain to the lake bed. Where the lake bed is within the euphotic zone, stromatolitic deposition occurs. In addition to the three depositional mechanisms, there may be diagenetic alteration of the carbonates in units B and D.																			0028-8306	1175-8791					1989	32	2					267	277		10.1080/00288306.1989.10427588	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288306.1989.10427588													WOS:A1989DE67500008

Polyurethane foam (PF) substrates were placed at .apprx. 15 cm depth in five lentic habitats (three lakes, a bog, and a marsh) in northern Michigan during the summer of 1983. Three substrates were removed after 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 42 d of field exposure, and presence or absence of protozoan species was recorded from living material, while diatoms were enumerated from preserved samples. Concurrent with PF substrate removal, morning water samples were collected and analyzed for pH, temperature, alkalinity, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, chloride, silica, ammonium, and ortho- and total phosphate. Physico-chemical variables examined singly and collectively revealed that the bog and marsh were quite different from each other and the lakes, while the three lakes were similar in physico-chemical composition. Factor analysis revealed three factors that collectively explained 84.89% of the environmental variability. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) performed on the biological presence-absence data revealed clusters of diatom samples for each of the lentic habitats. The DCA plots of protozoan communities suggested that bog an marsh samples were different; however, samples from the three lakes were similar. In addition, pH showed the strongest correlation between both community divisions. The DCA samples scores, when correlated with the environmental data, showed that diatom communities had the greatest number of significant correlations with environmental variables. This, coupled with the greater clustering of the diatom samples, implied a greater degree of relationship between diatom communities and the physico-chemical environment.																			0003-9365						1987	134	4					331	341		10.1016/S0003-9365(87)80005-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0003-9365(87)80005-2													WOS:A1987L529300004

Range extent and stand selection for roosting and foraging in forest-dwelling northern long-eared bats and little brown bats in the Greater Fundy Ecosystem, New Brunswick	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT					90th Annual Meeting of the Ecological-Society-of-America/9th International Congress of Ecology	AUG, 2005	Montreal, CANADA	Ecol Soc Amer				To understand bat biology and appreciate their dependence on and role within forested ecosystems, the biological resolution at which studies are directed must elucidate species and gender patterns. We studied species- and gender-specific aspects of summer range extent and stand selection in northern long-eared bats (Myotis septentrionalis) and little brown bats (M. lucifugus) in the Greater Fundy Ecosystem, New Brunswick, Canada, using trapping, radiotelemetry, and ultrasonic monitoring. Our results suggested that this 2-species system is comprised of 4 ecologically distinct groups with respect to site selection and range extent for roosting and foraging. All bats exhibited an affinity to specific roosting areas. Myotis septentrionalis roosted and foraged in the forest interior. The roosting and foraging areas for females were 6.1 times and 3.4 times larger, respectively, than for males. Both genders foraged in site types in proportion to their availability. Myotis lucifugus females roosted in buildings outside the core study area, and those captured in the forested landscape were transients. Compared to male and female M. septentrionalis, male M. lucifugus had intermediate-sized roosting areas but the largest foraging areas. Water sites were selected during foraging more than expected. Bat foraging activity, measured acoustically at 8 site types, was greatest at lakes and least above the forest canopy. Male M. lucifugus activity levels were positively associated with temperature and the amount of mature coniferous forest and water within 1 km of the sampling site, and they were negatively associated with the amount of mature deciduous forest within 1 km of the site. Our results suggested that understanding gender effects is crucial for accurate characterization of forest bat habitats. Studies of bats that combine data for genders, species, or guilds may produce spurious results and may be of minimal value for, or actually hinder, bat conservation and management programs.					; Woodley, Stephen/AAA-1985-2021; Broders, Hugh/C-9087-2011	Broders, Hugh/0000-0002-6151-8079; 													0022-541X	1937-2817				NOV	2006	70	5					1174	1184		10.2193/0022-541X(2006)70[1174:REASSF]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.2193/0022-541X(2006)70[1174:REASSF]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000242932700002
J	Miftode, ID				Miftode, Ioana Delia			AREAS WITH FLOOD POTENTIAL RISK IN THE LOWER UZ CATCHEMENT (ROMANIA). PROTECTION AND MITIGATION MEASUREMENTS	PRESENT ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT												The identification of areas with flood potential risk is important concerning the rational management of emergencies in case of floods. The most significant floods in the history of Romania occurred in the catchment basin of Siret (Uz River being an indirect tributary) and Prut. The analysis focused on the identification of flood potential risk index. The study involves the analysis of natural and anthropogenic physical and geographic factors: lithology, land declivity, soil texture, profile curvature and land use. The weighting of each analyzed factor for the contribution to floods was obtained using the AHP extension of the ArcGIS software. This methodology was applied for the lower Uz river basin, situated downstream from Lake Poiana Uzului. The catchment basin of Uz was affected by major floods in the summer of 2005, while the Uz River recorded a maximum historic discharge of 132 m(3)/s, at the precipitation station of Darmanesti, situated upstream from the Poiana Uzului reservoir. The consequences of the historic high water were serious. Extended surfaces within the major riverbed were flooded, numerous houses were partially damaged and some destroyed. The study highlights that the highest values of flooding index range between 3.96 and 4.71 and that they affect 14% of the entire surface of the studied area.																			1843-5971	2284-7820				JUN	2018	12	1					215	227		10.2478/pesd-2018-0017	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/pesd-2018-0017													WOS:000438197100017

Effect of wave exposure dynamics on gut content mass and growth of young-of-the-year fishes in the littoral zone of lakes	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Total length, body mass and gut content mass of young-of-the-year (YOY) perch Perca fluviatilis, dace Leuciscus leuciscus and bleak Alburnus alburnus were recorded over the summer of 2006 at three littoral sites at Upper Lake Constance. In P. fluviatilis and L. leuciscus, gut content mass correlated positively with wave-induced energy flux (E-F) of the respective site and sampling day, while no correlation of gut content mass with E-F was found in A. alburnus. It was assumed that benthivorous P. fluviatilis and L. leuciscus profited from suspended or uncovered benthic food items generated by wave action at sites and periods with high E-F. Alburnus alburnus, in contrast, feeding mainly on zooplankton in upper parts of the water column, could not profit from increased E-F. In P. fluviatilis, increased gut content mass during periods of high E-F resulted in higher growth rates. For L. leuciscus, no real growth rates in local fish populations could be determined, as individuals were less sedentary, and when increased growth occurred at sites during the periods of high E-F, migration of fish levelled out the resulting size differences within few days. The results of this study show that dynamic habitat variables affect site profitability in the littoral zone of lakes, especially in benthivorous fishes. Therefore, dynamic habitat variables should be considered in addition to fixed habitat properties in analyses of habitat choice of fishes in the littoral zone of lakes.

J	Pointner, G; Bartsch, A; Dvornikov, YA; Kouraev, A				Pointner, Georg; Bartsch, Annett; Dvornikov, Yury A.; Kouraev, Alexei, V			Mapping potential signs of gas emissions in ice of Lake Neyto, Yamal, Russia, using synthetic aperture radar and multispectral remote sensing data	CRYOSPHERE												Regions of anomalously low backscatter in C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery of lake ice of Lake Neyto in northwestern Siberia have been suggested to be caused by emissions of gas (methane from hydrocarbon reservoirs) through the lake's sediments. However, to assess this connection, only analyses of data from boreholes in the vicinity of Lake Neyto and visual comparisons to medium-resolution optical imagery have been provided due to a lack of in situ observations of the lake ice itself. These observations are impeded due to accessibility and safety issues. Geospatial analyses and innovative combinations of satellite data sources are therefore proposed to advance our understanding of this phenomenon. In this study, we assess the nature of the backscatter anomalies in Sentinel-1 C-band SAR images in combination with very high resolution (VHR) WorldView-2 optical imagery. We present methods to automatically map backscatter anomaly regions from the C-band SAR data (40m pixel spacing) and holes in lake ice from the VHR data (0.5m pixel spacing) and examine their spatial relationships. The reliability of the SAR method is evaluated through comparison between different acquisition modes. The results show that the majority of mapped holes (71 %) in the VHR data are clearly related to anomalies in SAR imagery acquired a few days earlier, and similarities to SAR imagery acquired more than a month before are evident, supporting the hypothesis that anomalies may be related to gas emissions. Further, a significant expansion of backscatter anomaly regions in spring is documented and quantified in all analysed years 2015 to 2019. Our study suggests that the backscatter anomalies might be caused by lake ice subsidence and consequent flooding through the holes over the ice top leading to wetting and/or slushing of the snow around the holes, which might also explain outcomes of polarimetric analyses of auxiliary L-band Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (PALSAR-2) data. C-band SAR data are considered to be valuable for the identification of lakes showing similar phenomena across larger areas in the Arctic in future studies.

The objective was to contribute to the understanding of the hydrological and hydrochemical processes of the Lop Nor basin by analysis of the chemical composition of different water sources and associated mineralogical characteristics of the playa sediments. The dominant river inflow waters to the Lop Nor basin are of the Na-Mg-Ca-SO4-Cl-HCO3 type. Spring inflow is dominated by Na+ and Cl-. Present-day concentrated groundwater brines vary little in the study area and are consistently rich in Na+ and Cl- and poor in Ca2+ and HCO3-+ CO32-, but also contain a considerable amount of Mg2+ and SO42-. EQL/EVP (equilibrium/evaporation), a brine equilibrium model, simulated evaporation of inflow water and groundwater brines in an open system and showed good agreement between theoretically predicted and observed minerals in the Lop Nor basin. Brine chemical modeling cannot however explain the massive amounts of glauberite (Na2SO4 center dot CaSO4) and polyhalite (K2SO4 center dot MgSO4 center dot 2CaSO(4)center dot 2H(2)O) deposits found in a 230 m deep core ZK1200B from the Lop Nor basin. EQL/EVP simulations under a closed system allowed brine reactions with previously formed minerals and indicate that glauberite forms by back reaction between brine, gypsum and anhydrite and polyhalite forms by reaction between brine and glauberite. Diagenetic textures related to recrystallization and secondary replacement were commonly observed in core ZK1200B, indicating significant mineral-brine interaction during crystallization of glauberite and polyhalite. Mineral assemblages predicted from the evaporation of Tarim river water match closely with natural assemblages and abundances, which can explain the unusual glauberite deposits in the Lop Nor basin. It is suggested that the Tarim river inflow is the dominant source over the lake's history. The distribution of minerals in the cored sediments documents the history of inflow water response to wet and dry periods in the Lop Nor basin. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Ozone Fluxes Over a Boreal Lake Exhibit Enhanced Deposition at Nights	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												A few studies on ozone deposition over lake water are available and so far only one using the eddy covariance technique (Wesely et al., 1981, ). A 23-day field campaign was held in August-September 2012 at the Lake Kuivajarvi in Hyytiala, Finland. The results showed a mean flux of -30 +/- 1 ng m-2 s-1 and deposition velocity of 0.86 +/- 0.05 mm s-1. Deposition velocity showed a weak diurnal cycle over the lake with elevated values during the nighttime. The daytime and nighttime portions of the data set differed statistically. Analysis showed that waterside convective mixing enhanced deposition and such conditions pre-dominantly occurred during nighttime. We compared the measured deposition velocities with the dry deposition model of air-sea exchange, adjusted for the chemical sinks relevant for the lake. We suggest that the buoyant mixing and unaccounted chemistry can be responsible for the difference between the model results and observations. Ozone deposition was studied over lake in Southern Finland. Deposition velocity showed elevated values during the nighttime. Higher ozone deposition at night was related to enhanced convective mixing in uppermost water layers. Ozone deposition over the lake is enhanced by waterside buoyancy velocityWind speed and friction velocity had minor or no impact on ozone deposition, instead waterside convective mixing enhanced depositionIn late summer, over diurnal course higher deposition velocities occurred at night					Mammarella, Ivan/E-7782-2016; Vesala, Timo/C-3795-2017; Fung, Pak Lun/ABG-9705-2021	Mammarella, Ivan/0000-0002-8516-3356; Fung, Pak Lun/0000-0003-3493-1383; Vesala, Timo/0000-0002-4852-7464; 													0094-8276	1944-8007				DEC 16	2023	50	23							e2023GL104354	10.1029/2023GL104354	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023GL104354													WOS:001115835800001

Major water quality parameters of the prepared eutrophic water were determined, and the microbial community was analyzed during 2 years. The results showed that removal rates of total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were 90.7-95.9%, 84.5-92.4%, 87.9-95.8%, and 68.3-82.7%, respectively, indicating the high efficiency of the bioreactor in the eutrophic water treatment. Although the bioreactor had been operated for 2 years, water from the treatment group was much clearer and odorless than from the control group, exhibiting the long service life of the bioreactor. Stopping operation in August caused significant decrease of the removal rates of major water quality parameters (p < 0.05). This operational stop event and high temperature in summer exerted a dual effect on the bioreactor, whereas the impact could be minimized when the bioreactor was running. Moreover, the total bacteria under +Rpf (active resuscitation-promoting factor) treatment were higher than under -Rpf (inactive resuscitation-promoting factor) treatment, implying that Rpf could resuscitate VBNC bacteria in the eutrophication ecosystem. Nine strains of VBNC bacteria were isolated based on the BLAST results of the 16S rRNA gene. Also, these bacteria might contribute to the eutrophic water treatment based on their functions of phosphorus collecting and denitrification. These results provided new insights for engineering technology innovations, and consequently these findings had benefits in eutrophic water treatment.																			0944-1344	1614-7499				NOV	2021	28	42					59821	59833		10.1007/s11356-021-14924-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-14924-0		JUN 2021						34148168					WOS:000663506000001

Operation: Topography was acquired by a corneal topography mapping system (Orbscan, Orbtek, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT). These data were processed to obtain a customized altimetric ablation profile, which was transferred to a flying-spot laser (Laserscan 2000, Lasersight, Orlando, FL). Main Outcome Measures: Data on uncorrected (UCVA) and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), predictability, and stability of refraction and any complications were analyzed. Results: Mean follow-up was 13.2 months. At the last postoperative examination, 26 eyes (92.8%) in the hyperopic group and 12 eyes (85.7%) in the myopic group had an UCVA superior to 20/40. Twelve hyperopic eyes (42.8%) and five myopic eyes (35.7%) had a UCVA of 20/20. All patients fell between 1 diopter of attempted correction in the spherical equivalent. Only 1 (2.4%) of the 42 eyes, belonging to the hyperopic group, lost 1 Snellen line of BCVA. We did not observe any decentration and/or haze after photorefractive keratectomy treatment or any irregularity in the flap-stroma interface in the three laser in situ keratomileusis operations performed in this study. Conclusions: The combination of topographic data with computer-controlled flying-spot excimer laser ablation is a suitable solution for correcting irregular astigmatism due to different causes.

Identifying priority mitigation areas for human-osprey conflict	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Raptor nests on human-built structures represent a significant source of conflict, as they can result in bird mortality, fires, or power outages due to falling nest materials or animals connecting with energized conductors. Power companies typically try to mitigate these conflicts to avoid service disruptions. Performing mitigation measures across all potentially problematic power infrastructure is generally not a practical solution given logistical, time, or budgetary constraints. Therefore, there is a need for quantitative, landscape-scale tools to identify conflict risk and prioritize mitigation. We examined the influence of habitat and transmission infrastructure distribution on the potential risk of osprey (Pandion haliaetus) nesting-infrastructure conflict in the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) power service area within Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Virginia, USA, using osprey nesting and conflict records from 1990-2020. We modeled risk using a 3-stage approach, which intersected a nesting habitat suitability model and density of infrastructure to evaluate the potential risk of conflict. Habitat suitability was greater on or near open water and closer to developed areas. Transmission line density was low (0.14 +/- 0.29 lines/km(2)) and heterogenous across the service area with more lines within urban centers and near power facilities. Integrating habitat suitability and transmission infrastructure information revealed that very low and low-risk areas comprised 99% of the service area. Less than 1% comprised 1,113.7 km(2) of moderate and 82.2 km(2) of high or very high risk, mostly concentrated along major rivers and lakes, and around urban centers. Risk was more prevalent in the northeastern portion of the service area. This work presents a top-down approach to mitigating osprey-power infrastructure conflict, which allows for the prioritization of mitigation actions and can facilitate long-term coexistence with this protected species.					; Rush, Scott/AAI-9848-2020; Dorr, Brian/AAX-9033-2020	/0009-0008-8652-0707; Rush, Scott/0000-0001-5920-7768; Murphy, Natasha/0009-0006-5534-9746													0022-541X	1937-2817				APR	2024	88	3								10.1002/jwmg.22540	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.22540		JAN 2024											WOS:001143770300001

Daily temperature variation explains zooplankton community differences in freshwater mesocosms recovering from a natural drought	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Drought events are typically studied as a single stressor. However, multiple environmental variables are altered under drought conditions, including water level and daily temperature variation. Here, we experimentally manipulated both variables in 16 outdoor mesocosms to disentangle how they impact freshwater zooplankton communities. During a natural drought in summer 2022, we maintained water level in eight mesocosms while allowing eight to almost dry out. We reduced daily temperature variation using insulation in half of these outdoor mesocosms to give a fully factorial design with four replicates for each of the four treatments: Control, Low water level, Insulated, Insulated + Low water level. We found a lasting effect of low water level over the 150-day study period; community recovery was incomplete despite natural precipitation restoring the Low water level treatment to a similar depth as Controls. However, our results consistently identified daily temperature variation as more important than water depth in explaining drought effects, with amplified daily temperature variation strongly associated with the initial divergence of zooplankton community structure and reductions in net biomass. Since daily temperature variation may be higher in small outdoor mesocosms than larger natural freshwaters, we recommend that this is considered in the design of mesocosm experiments. By taking a multiple stressor perspective, our findings indicate that temperature variation can be more important than water level in structuring freshwater invertebrate communities.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				2025 SEP 12	2025										10.1002/lno.70181	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.70181		SEP 2025											WOS:001569395900001

However, the presence of prokaryotes supports populations of bacterivorous ciliates and heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF). Nevertheless, protistan bacterivory rates and the major hypolimnetic ciliate bacterivores are poorly documented. We conducted a high frequency sampling (three-times a week) in the oxic hypolimnion of a stratified mesoeutrophic reservoir during summer, characterized by stable physicochemical conditions and low water temperature. Using fluorescently labeled bacteria we estimated that ciliates and HNF contributed, on average, 30% and 70% to aggregated protistan bacterivory, respectively, and collectively removed about two thirds of daily hypolimnetic prokaryotic production. The ciliate community was analyzed by the quantitative protargol staining method. One scuticociliate morphotype dominated the hypolimnetic ciliate community, accounting for 82% of total ciliates and over 98% of total ciliate bacterivory, with average cell-specific uptake rate of 202 prokaryotes per hour. Moreover, long-amplicon sequencing revealed that the scuticociliate belongs to an unidentified clade closely related to the Ctedoctematidae and Eurystomatellidae families. The high-resolution sampling, microscopic, and sequencing methods allowed uncovering indigenous microbial food webs in the hypolimnetic environment and revealed a functional simplification of ciliate communities, dominated by a new bacterivorous scuticociliate lineage.

Short-term responses of littoral phytoplankton in a large shallow subtropical lake	ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS												The littoral zone is an essential compartment for lake biota because of its high productivity and diversity. Moreover, phytoplankton is expected to have non-equilibrium dynamics on it. The study's aimed to explore phytoplankton in the littoral zone of a shallow lake over a short -term scale. Daily sampling was conducted for 25 consecutive summer days in 2016, at two marginal points of a continuously warm, polymictic, and oligomesotrophic subtropical lake (Lake Mangueira, Brazil). Cyanobacteria and Chlorophyta contributed 86% of total biomass. We observed high variability in phytoplankton structure, with species turnover over diel cycles. Redundancy analysis indicated spatial differentiation for phytoplankton structure in relation to abiotic conditions. Nutrient dynamics and humic substances were significant drivers for phytoplankton variability. Phytoplankton was positively correlated with SRP and negatively with humic substances. Our results showed a non- equilibrium state for the littoral phytoplankton of Lake Mangueira, given the high variability of abiotic conditions, even at short distances. Due to its high temporal and spatial variability, the littoralzone seems to contribute to the recruitment and maintenance of phytoplankton biodiversity in shallow lakes. Further studies should consider the functional attributes of species and the complex biological interactions of phytoplankton and macrophytes along the littoral zone.

J	Norris, RD; Meagher, KL; Weaver, CS				Norris, RD; Meagher, KL; Weaver, CS			The 1936, 1945-1947, and 1950 earthquake sequences near Lassen Peak, California	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												Three vigorous earthquake sequences occurred near Lassen Peak in 1936, between 1945 and 1947, and in 1950; the latter two sequences included mainshocks of magnitude 5.0 and 5.5, respectively, and thousands of smaller events. No comparable earthquake sequences have occurred near Lassen Peak since 1950. The epicentral area lies within 20 km of the southern boundary of Lassen Volcanic National Park, in a northwest striking seismic zone that extends from Lake Tahoe to the vicinity of Mount Shasta. In comparing their time history and magnitude distribution with other earthquake sequences. that have occurred in regions of Cenozoic volcanism within and east of the Cascade Range and the Sierra Nevada, we find that the Lassen earthquake sequences show similar characteristics to two earthquake sequences that occurred on Basin and Range faults near Herlong, California, and Klamath Falls, Oregon. We interpret this similarity as evidence that the Lassen earthquakes were caused by Basin and Range extension and may have occurred on one or more Basin and Range faults in the Lassen region. However, the limitations of the data do not allow other possible sources, such as magmatic injection, to be ruled out. The most important implication of the Lassen earthquake sequences is that earthquakes of M 5 or greater may occur in the Lassen region, perhaps quite close to Lassen Peak or other volcanoes. The record of Holocene volcanism and fault displacements in the region indicates that earthquake sequences driven by either tectonic or magmatic processes may occur near Lassen Peak, and any significant earthquake sequence should be carefully monitored to assess its nature.																			2169-9313	2169-9356				JAN 10	1997	102	B1					449	457		10.1029/96JB02793	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/96JB02793													WOS:A1997WC62800003

Bi-weekly samples were taken during the summers of 1987 and 1988. Four taxa of chironomids were found. The population density and sizes of chironomids, and the proportion that each taxon comprised of the midge assemblage, varied significantly in time and space. In an attempt to examine whether the variability noted was related to sediment accretion in the lake, sedimentation rates were measured. There were few correlations among sedimentation rate or the organic matter content of the collected sediment and the structure of the midge assemblage. Those few correlations that were statistically significant were low and often paradoxical. For example negative relationships were found between the density and size of Chironomus spp., a detritivore, and the amount of sediment deposited or its organic matter content. Also no significant relationships were found between the density of the predator Cryptochironomus spp. and the density of other chironomids (potential prey). These negative findings indicate that factors other than food, such as sediment texture, may be more important than food availability in structuring chironomid assemblages in backwater areas. There was spatial variability in the densities and sizes of chironomids that may be explained by differences in sediment texture and organic matter. This suggests that short-term inputs of sediment (as ascertained by sediment traps) may not greatly influence midge assemblages while the long-term changes in sediment composition may have large influences.																			0018-8158					FEB 19	1993	252	2					133	141		10.1007/BF00008151	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008151													WOS:A1993KY41900002

Long-term trends in nutrient budgets of the western Dutch Wadden Sea (1976-2012)	JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH												Long-term field observations of nitrogen [N] and phosphorus [P] concentrations were used to construct nutrient budgets for the western Dutch Wadden Sea between 1976 and 2012. Nutrients come into the western Dutch Wadden Sea via river runoff, through exchange with the coastal zone of the North Sea, neighbouring tidal basins and through atmospheric deposition (for N). The highest concentrations in phosphorus and nitrogen were observed in the mid-1980s. Improved phosphorus removal at waste water treatment plants, management of fertilization in agriculture and removal of phosphates from detergents led to reduced riverine nutrient inputs and, consequently, reduced nutrient concentrations in the Wadden Sea. The budgets suggest that the period of the initial net import of phosphorus and nitrogen switched to a net export in 1981 for nitrogen and in 1992 for phosphorus. Such different behaviour in nutrient budgets during the rise and fall of external nutrient concentrations may be the result of different sediment-water exchange dynamics for P and N. It is hypothesized that during the period of increasing eutrophication (1976-1981) P, and to a lesser degree N, were stored in sediments as organic and inorganic nutrients. In the following period (1981-1992) external nutrient concentrations (especially in the North Sea) decreased, but P concentrations in the Wadden Sea remained high due to prolonged sediment release, whilst denitrification removed substantial amounts of N. From 1992 onwards, P and N budgets were closed by net loss, most probably because P stores were then depleted and denitrification continued. Under the present conditions (lower rates of sediment import and depleted P stores), nutrient concentrations in this area are expected to be more strongly influenced by wind-driven exchange with the North Sea and precipitation-driven discharge from Lake Ijssel. This implies that the consequences of climate change will be more important, than during the 1970s and 1980s. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Palaeoclimate records reveal complex and shifting influences over East Asia that have varied across space and time during past episodes of abrupt climate change. Untangling teleconnections that affect East Asian climate requires replicable, high resolution and precisely dated records, yet these are sparsely distributed worldwide. The varved sediments of Lake Suigetsu, Japan, are one such archive, offering significant potential to investigate millennial-scale variability in the East Asian monsoon. Here, we infer lake primary productivity as a tracer of regional climate during the last glacial period from 55 to 20 cal ka BP using sedimentary total organic carbon, biogenic silica and siderite, measured using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analyses. Lake productivity exhibits distinct millennial-scale events that align with palaeoclimate inferred from other lakes and speleothems in central Japan which, in turn, indicate a coherent picture of regional-scale hydroclimate variability. The Lake Suigetsu data varies with respect to synchronicity to Greenland ice core records, challenging the assumed spatial and temporal dominance of the North Atlantic and westerly winds on the East Asian monsoon, and supporting an alternative hypothesis of periodic dominance from the Southern Hemisphere.																			0277-3791	1873-457X				DEC 1	2025	369								109624	10.1016/j.quascirev.2025.109624	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2025.109624		SEP 2025											WOS:001577630100001

The analysis is based on more than 10 years of paired monitoring of the effluent (total ammonia and total phosphorus) of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) that discharges to the lake as well as the lake itself (including total ammonia, nitrite, total and dissolved forms of phosphorus, plankton biomass and composition, Secchi disc transparency, and zebra mussel density). Major reductions in total ammonia and total phosphor-us loading relative to the preceding decade are reported for the WWTP for the November 1998 through October 1999 interval. Dramatic and, in some cases, unanticipated changes in the lake's water quality and biota in response to the reductions in loading are documented for the April to October interval of 1999 including: (1) major decreases in total ammonia concentrations and improved status with respect to ammonia toxicity standards, (2) development of dense populations of zebra mussels, (3) decreases in fall concentrations of nitrite and improved status with respect to the related toxicity standard, (4) decreases in total phosphorus and total dissolved phosphor-us concentrations, and (5) a severe Microcystis (phytoplankton) bloom that caused nuisance conditions and poor clarity. The zebra mussel invasion is attributed to the reductions in total ammonia concentrations to below toxic levels. The Microcystis bloom was probably related to the abrupt increase in the zebra mussel population. Additional reductions in phosphorus loading from the WWTP will be required to limit phytoplankton production and avoid the potential for continued nuisance conditions. Potential complications in resolving lake responses to future reductions in loading associated with the zebra mussel invasion are considered.																			1061-4303					NOV-DEC	2001	73	6					691	703		10.2175/106143001X143439	http://dx.doi.org/10.2175/106143001X143439								11833763					WOS:000173422200008

Restoration of Florida scrub vegetation in an old field through 23 years after planting	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Florida scrub, a fire-maintained, xeromorphic shrubland, hosts many rare and declining species, but most scrub habitat has been lost to development and agriculture. Formerly cultivated sites offer an opportunity to restore Florida scrub. In this 23-year study, we test whether scrub species could be restored to an old field and whether scrub vegetation composition and structure could be reestablished over time. Scrub oaks were planted in a section of an old field in 1992 after the site was cleared and treated with herbicide. Additional oaks and other scrub species were planted in 1993. We determined survival and growth annually of a marked sample of scrub species. We sampled vegetation cover in two height strata annually on 10 permanent line-intercept transects in the old grove and on 20 transects in adjacent, intact scrub. Initial survival of Quercus geminata exceeded that of Q. chapmanii or Q. myrtifolia. Cover of scrub oaks greater than 0.5 m increased from 1.3% in 1992 to 65.2% in 2010. However, the vegetation structure of large Q. geminata did not resemble that of native scrub. Adaptive management led to cutting large oaks in the fall of 2010, and burning the site in early 2011. Cutting and burning appeared to stimulate sprouting and clonal spread of scrub oaks. Ordination analysis indicated directional change related to increasing scrub oak cover and time since planting but the old field still differed from intact scrub. Vegetation has developed toward scrub composition and structure but exotic grasses persist.

Because of elevated water levels in the Mississippi River in the spring of 1997, the Bonnet Carre Spillway was opened on March 17 and fully closed on April 18. The total volume of water discharged into Lake Pontchartrain was approximately 11.8 km(3), or two times the volume of the lake, and the total mass of sediment discharged into the lake was approximately 7.1 x 10(8) kg (780,000 US tons). In 1996, 757 surface sediment samples were collected in Lake Pontchartrain and were analyzed by x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy for major cation constituents. These same sites were revisited following the 1997 Mississippi River discharge event. Analysis of the 1996 and 1997 lake-bed sediment samples was accomplished utilizing fundamental statistical and graphical methods. Element concentration contour maps and variograms for the major cations illustrate meaningful differences between the pre- and postspillway sediment samples that are not readily apparent in the analysis of the descriptive statistics alone. Major cations exhibited significantly greater spatial continuity in the postspillway samples relative to the preceding year. The concentrations of aluminum and silicon in the postspillway sediments are considered to reflect, respectively, relative variations in clay and silt contribution to total sediment. The higher concentrations of magnesium in samples collected prior to the river diversion represent adsorption of magnesium onto exchange sites in surface sediments due to exposure to more saline waters.																			0749-0208	1551-5036				FAL	2009					54		127	140		10.2112/SI54-010.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2112/SI54-010.1													WOS:000209448000013

Antonia; Bernard, Alain			Geochemical characterisation Of Taal volcano-hydrothermal system and temporal evolution during continued phases of unrest (1991-2017)	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Taal volcano (Luzon Island, Philippines) has last erupted in 1977 but has known some periods of increased activity, characterised by seismic swarms, ground deformation, increased carbon dioxide flux and in some cases temperature anomalies and the opening of fissures. We studied major, trace element and sulphur and strontium isotopic composition of Taal lake waters and hot springs over a period of 25 years to investigate the geochemical evolution of Taal volcano's hydrothermal system and its response to volcanic unrest. Long-term evolution of Main Crater Lake (MCL) composition shows a slow but consistent decrease of acidity, SO4, Mg Fe and Al concentrations and a trend from light to heavy sulphate, consistent with a general decrease of volcanic gases dissolving in the hydrothermal system. Na, K and Cl concentrations remain constant indicating a non-volcanic origin for these elements. Sulphate and strontium isotopic data suggest this neutral chloride-rich component represents input of geothermal water into Taal hydrothermal system. A significant deviation from the long-term baseline can be seen in two samples from 1995. That year, pH dropped from 2.6 to 2.2, F, Si and Fe concentrations increased and Na, K and Cl concentrations decreased. Sulphate was depleted in S-34 and temperature was 4 degrees C above baseline level at the time of sampling We attribute these changes to the shallow intrusion of a degassing magma body during the unrest in 1991-1994. More recent unrest periods have not caused significant changes in the geochemistry of Taal hydrothermal waters and are therefore unlikely to have been triggered by shallow magma intrusion. A more likely cause for these events is thus pressurisation of the hydrothermal reservoir by increasing degassing from a stagnant magma reservoir. Our study indicates that new magmatic intrusions that might lead to the next eruption of Taal volcano are expected to change the geochemistry of MCL in the same way as in 1994-1995, with the most notable effects being changes in temperature, pH, F and Si concentrations.

Evaluating the impacts of agricultural land management practices on water resources: A probabilistic hydrologic modeling approach	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Evaluating the effectiveness of agricultural land management practices in minimizing environmental impacts using models is challenged by the presence of inherent uncertainties during the model development stage. One issue faced during the model development stage is the uncertainty involved in model parameterization. Using a single optimized set of parameters (one snapshot) to represent baseline conditions of the system limits the applicability and robustness of the model to properly represent future or alternative scenarios. The objective of this study was to develop a framework that facilitates model parameter selection while evaluating uncertainty to assess the impacts of land management practices at the watershed scale. The model framework was applied to the Lake Creek watershed located in southwestern Oklahoma, USA. A two-step probabilistic approach was implemented to parameterize the Agricultural Policy/Environmental eXtender (APEX) model using global uncertainty and sensitivity analysis to estimate the full spectrum of total monthly water yield (WYLD) and total monthly Nitrogen loads (N) in the watershed under different land management practices. Twenty-seven models were found to represent the baseline scenario in which uncertainty of up to 29% and 400% in WYLD and N, respectively, is plausible. Changing the land cover to pasture manifested the highest decrease in N to up to 30% for a full pasture coverage while changing to full winter wheat cover can increase the N up to 11%. The methodology developed in this study was able to quantify the full spectrum of system responses, the uncertainty associated with them, and the most important parameters that drive their variability. Results from this study can be used to develop strategic decisions on the risks and tradeoffs associated with different management alternatives that aim to increase productivity while also minimizing their environmental impacts.

Age and growth of round goby Neogobius melanostomus associated with depth and habitat in the western basin of Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Round goby Neogobius melanostomus were examined from the Bass Islands area in the western basin of Lake Erie, U.S.A., to determine age and growth correlations. A total of 188 specimens were collected and examined during summer 2011 with 90 aged using scale analysis. Fish were grouped by sex, depth of habitat and habitat type (anthropogenically modified shallows, natural shallows and open lake deep water). Fish ranged from 17 to 117 mm total length (L-T) and 0+ to 3+ years. Males dominated the population (194:1) and backcalculated age showed that both sexes grew exponentially, with male growth rate increasing faster than female. Males were significantly larger than females in L-T and mass (both P < 0001). The relative mass index (W-r) was low for the sampled population (mean +/- s.d. = 3200 +/- 2687 g), implying that the health of the Bass Island area population is very poor when compared with the species throughout its range. This could be due to a lack of food resources related to population size or that the fish is not optimally utilizing the available food resources. In contradiction to these findings, regression slope coefficient (b), calculated using Fulton's condition factor (K) (mean +/- s.d. =150 +/- 020), was very low for each habitat, implying a healthy population throughout. This seemingly opposite effect may be due to more individuals per unit area in shallow waters, which would cause increased competition for resources. Poor condition may indicate that the Lake Erie population has reached saturation or may reflect indirect fitness costs associated with increasing anoxic or hypoxic hypolimnion conditions.

This study investigated the occurrence of microplastics (MPs) in sediment samples obtained from Dal Lake, situated in the northwest Himalayas, India. Thirty-two sediment samples collected from different sites inside the lake were thoroughly analyzed using a stereomicroscope. The research showed that the average concentration of microplastics (MPs) in the sediment was 416 +/- 38 MP/kg (mean +/- standard error, n = 32) based on the weight of the dry sediment. The most frequently seen colours of MPs were blue, white, black, red, and orange. The majority of the total consists of fiber-shaped particles, accounting for 86.5%, while fragments make up 11%, and films make up 2.5%. Raman spectroscopy revealed the high occurrence of Polyamides, namely Nylon, comprising 62.5% of the sample. Small amounts of Polyethylene, Polyvinylchloride, and Polypropylene were also detected. The findings of this research suggest that tourism, fishing activities, and untreated wastewater are major contributors to the presence of microplastics (MPs) in the lake. In addition, local community habits, such as the use of packaging materials, automobiles, and cosmetics, also contribute to microplastic pollution. Sediment quality was assessed using hazard indicators such as the Polymer Hazard Index (PHI), Pollution Load Index (PLI), and Potential Ecological Risk Index (PERI). The occurrence of high levels of PHI (> 1000) in some regions is attributed to the presence of high-risk polymers such as polyamide (PA) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The sediments were classified as medium-risk according to the PERI values, whereas the PLI values revealed a relatively low contamination level (< 10), falling into Hazard Category I. The results of this research provide a crucial understanding of the categories, dispersion, and sources of microplastics (MPs) in Dal Lake. This understanding serves as the basis for focused efforts to protect the lake's biological balance and ensure the well-being of humans, both now and in the future.

As a result, intense earthquake activity and associated surface deformation are manifesting in this region. To implement and promote citizen earthquake science in Taiwan, we have developed several web-based platforms with multi-purpose themes, such as earthquake science information, popular science education, and crowdsourcing systems. First, with the rapid earthquake report issued from the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau (CWB), the available near real-time scientific results obtained from the Taiwanese seismology community are collected and published to a platform, the Taiwan Earthquake Science Information System (TESIS). The scientific information archived at TESIS includes CWB earthquake reports, focal mechanisms, shake maps, and finite source models (for strong earthquakes). All real-time results are integrated into a GIS system with background geospatial information, such as geological maps, traces of active faults, background seismicity, and inter-seismic GPS velocity fields. Second, by collaborating with Stanford University to maintain a regional Quake-Catcher Network (QCN) server in Taiwan, we have promoted citizen seismology in Asia by bringing earthquake information and scientific knowledge to the public. More than 200 school teachers have already installed the QCN sensors in Internet-enabled computers. Through two web-based educational platforms, users are able to access the guidelines and further interact with the recorded waveforms. Third, we also developed an earthquake damage reporting system - the Taiwan Scientific Earthquake Reporting (TSER) system - to encourage the citizen to collect field observation for significant earthquake-induced ground damages such as surface fault rupture, landslide, rock fall, liquefaction, and landslide-triggered dam or lake. The TSER system is constructed under the Ushahidi mapping platform, which has been widely used in crowdsourcing for the geospatial archiving of events. Trained high school teachers and public volunteers can send their ground damage observations, including photographs, through the TSER system. Most of these products and online systems are now being operated by the Taiwan Earthquake Research Center (TEC). With these newly developed platforms and materials, we aim to not only raise earthquake awareness and preparedness, but also encourage public participation in earthquake science in Taiwan.

The Bonneville lake cycle began prior to 26,000 yr B.P.; the lake reached the Bonneville shoreline about 16,000 yr B.P. Poor dating control limits our knowledge of the timing of subsequent events. Lake level was maintained at the Bonneville shoreline until about 15,000 yr B.P., or somewhat later, when catastrophic downcutting of the outlet caused a rapid drop of 100 m. The Provo shoreline was formed as rates of isostatic uplift due to this unloading slowed. By 13,000 yr B.P., the lake had fallen below the Provo level and reached one close to that of Great Salt Lake by 11,000 yr B.P. Deposits of the Little Valley lake cycle are identified by their position below a marked unconformity and by amino acid ratios of their fossil gastropods. The maximum level of the Little Valley lake was well below the Bonneville shoreline. Based on degree of soil development and other evidence, the Little Valley lake cycle may be equivalent in age to marine oxygen-isotope stage 6. The proposed lake history has climatic implications for the region. Because the fluctuations of Lake Bonneville and Lake Lahontan during the last cycle of each were apparently out of phase, there may have been significant local differences in the timing and character of late Pleistocene climate changes in the Great Basin. Although the Bonneville and Little Valley lake cycles were broadly synchronous with maximum episodes of glaciation, environmental conditions necessary to generate large lakes did not exist during early Wisconsin time.																			0033-5894	1096-0287					1983	20	3					261	285		10.1016/0033-5894(83)90013-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0033-5894(83)90013-3													WOS:A1983RU82100001
J	vanNiejenhuis, A; Parker, WH				vanNiejenhuis, A; Parker, WH			Adaptive variation in jack pine from north central Ontario determined by short term common garden tests	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE												To improve our understanding of adaptive variation in jack pine, Pinus banksiana Lamb, from north central Ontario, 64 seed sources were grown in three common garden tests, and relationships were determined between seedling performance and environment at seed origin. Twenty-three growth and phenological variables were studied, including seedling heights, needle flushing dates, timing of shoot elongation, fall foliage colour change, and drought survival. Significant components of variation were expressed among seed sources for all growth traits and many phenological characters. Linear regressions were run between seedling traits and climatic variables as well as spatial, soil, and vegetative variables that described the environment at seed origin. Resulting coefficients of determination were as high as 0.30. Principal component analysis was used to summarize the variation, with 33% and 21% of the variation accounted for by the first and second components, respectively. Regressions and mapping of principal component analysis scores indicated that the patterns of variation in this portion of the range of jack pine were clinal in nature: the patterns could be predicted by environment at seed origin. The greater growth potential of seedlings from the southwestern portion of the range, in contrast with those of the north shore of Lake Superior, reflected clinal trends seen in previous studies. Multiple regressions were run on the first and second sets of factor scores produced from principal component analysis against the climate variables, resulting in coefficients of determination of 0.30 and 0.38, respectively. Including soil and vegetative variables in the models resulted in only slightly higher coefficients. Thus, climate at seed origin should be considered as the prime factor when seed transfers are necessary in this area.																			0045-5067					NOV	1996	26	11					2006	2014		10.1139/x26-226	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x26-226													WOS:A1996VV33200014
J	WELCH, HE				WELCH, HE			ECOLOGY OF CHIRONOMIDAE (DIPTERA) IN A POLAR LAKE	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												The 6 common genera of Chironomidae (Diptera) in Char Lake, Resolute, Northwest Territories (75.degree.42''N latitude [Canada]) were studied intensively from 1969-1972. Heterotrissocladius oliveri Saeth. and a Trissocladius sp. are characteristic of the sediment zone, while 2 spp. of Orthocladius [O. lappiconus (Goetgh.) and Orthocladius sp.], Pseudodiamesa arctica (Mall.), Paracladius quadrinodosus (Hirv.) and Lauterbornia sp. are restricted mainly to the rocky and moss zones. Life cycles are 2 or 3 yr, depending upon the species. Year-classes could be discriminated by instar frequency distribution. Populations increased steadily during the study period, for an average increase in strength of 5 times between the 1968 and 1971 year-classes, Summer emergence and egg-laying conditions are of overriding importance to year-class strength. Mortality within year-classes is undetectable until the last 4 mo. of larval life, when mortality due to char predation is about 65% between April and the time of emergence. The physiology of these chrionomids does not seem unusual aside from continuing activity down to 0.degree. C, and there is no indication of metabolic compensation. Net growth efficiency averages 36%. Assimilated energy (growth + respiration) at 8.6 kcal m-2 yr-1 is very low compared with temperate zone populations, but is more similar as a percent of photosynthesis, 4.1%. The relatively large detritus pool and the presence of both 2- and 3-yr species tend to stabilize chironomid energy flow. Definition of long-term averages for chironomid populations in Char Lake would require a decade or more of study.																									1976	33	2					227	247		10.1139/f76-034	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f76-034													WOS:A1976BG41200006

High resolution lake sediment record reveals self-organized criticality in erosion processes regulated by internal feedbacks	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Reconstruction of high-frequency erosion variability beyond the instrumental record requires well-dated, high-resolution proxies from sediment archives. We used computed tomography (CT) scans of finely laminated silt layers from a lake-sediment record in southwest Oregon to quantify the magnitude of natural landscape erosion events over the last 2000years in order to compare with palaeorecords of climate, forest fire, and seismic triggers. Sedimentation rates were modeled from an age-depth relationship fit through five C-14 dates and the 1964AD Cs-137 peak in which deposition time (yrmm(-1)) varied inversely with the proportion of silt sediment measured by the CT profile. This model resulted in pseudo-annual estimates of silt deposition for the last 2000years. Silt accumulation during the past 80years was strongly correlated with river-discharge at annual and decadal scales, revealing that erosion was highly responsive to precipitation during the logging era (1930-present). Before logging the frequency-magnitude relationship displayed a power-law distribution that is characteristic of complex feedbacks and self-regulating mechanisms. The 100-year and 10-year erosion magnitude estimated in a 99-year moving window varied by 1.7 and 1.0 orders of magnitude, respectively. Decadal erosion magnitude was only moderately positively correlated with a summer temperature reconstruction over the period 900-1900AD. Magnitude of the seven largest events was similar to the cumulative silt accumulation anomaly, suggesting these events returned the system' to the long-term mean rate. Instead, the occurrence of most erosion events was related to fire (silt layers preceded by high charcoal concentration) and earthquakes (the seven thickest layers often match paleo-earthquake dates). Our data show how internal (i.e. sediment production) and external processes (natural fires or more stochastic events such as earthquakes) co-determine erosion regimes at millennial time scales, and the extent to which such processes can be offset by recent large-scale deforestation by logging.

J	Basu, BK; Kalff, J; Pinel-Alloul, B				Basu, BK; Kalff, J; Pinel-Alloul, B			The influence of macrophyte beds on plankton communities and their export from fluvial lakes in the St Lawrence River	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. To determine the influence of macrophyte beds on plankton abundance within fluvial lakes of the St Lawrence River, planktonic components (macrozooplankton, heterotrophic bacteria, and phytoplankton as chlorophyll-a [Chl-a]) were sampled in Lake St Francis and Lake St Pierre during summer 1998. We tested the hypothesis that the abundance of planktonic components was higher within macrophyte beds in comparison to the more rapidly flushed open water areas of the fluvial lakes. 2. The large cross channel variation in zooplankton biomass was indeed correlated with the presence of dense beds of submerged macrophytes. Total macrozooplankton biomass was nine-fold greater within the beds (mean = 180 mug L-1 dry mass) than in either the open water or areas with only sparse vegetation (mean = 20 mug L-1 dry mass). 3. Chl-a and heterotrophic bacterial abundance were also higher in the beds, but only slightly so. There was no difference in total phosphorus or dissolved organic carbon concentrations between areas of dense vegetation, sparse vegetation or open water. 4. Macrophyte beds on the margins of the fluvial lakes allow the development of high planktonic abundance relative to the fast flowing central channel. Macrozooplankton biomass was much higher at the outflows of the lakes (similar to 50 mug L-1 dry mass) in comparison to the inflows (<20 <mu>g L-1 dry mass). The increase is due to the transfer of organisms from submerged macrophyte beds into the central channel in the downstream quarter of the two lakes where the marginal littoral waters enter central channel waters. 5. Along rivers, shallow fluvial lakes appear to act as sources of plankton which is exported downstream during years of extensive littoral macrophyte development.

Paleohydrological records provide important evidence for developing scenarios for future changes in the availability of freshwater resources. This study presents a synthesis of a sedimentological, archeological, and chronological dataset collected from Lake Annecy (eastern France) to reconstruct a lake-level record documenting the whole Holocene. This dataset shows a pronounced minimum in the lake level during the Holocene thermal maximum (HTM) (ca. 9000-7000 cal BP), preceded by a general lowering trend (early Holocene), and followed by a general rising trend (Neoglacial). On both the millennial and centennial scales, the Lake Annecy record appears to match the regional pattern of Holocene lake-level fluctuations established for West-Central Europe. In agreement with other extra-regional paleoclimatic records, it shows the dominant influence of orbital forcing. The high magnitude of the lake-level lowering (more than 5 m) during the HTM, with a 2-2.5 degrees C difference between the HTM and the pre-industrial mean summer temperatures, suggests possible drastic lake-level lowering phases in the near future depending on the IPCC scenarios following climate change. This would mean dramatic impacts on human activities and the preservation of exceptional archeological remains in regional lake basins.					brigand, robin/G-4650-2014	Hinschberger, florent/0000-0002-8584-9059													2571-550X					JUN	2024	7	2							25	10.3390/quat7020025	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/quat7020025													WOS:001256560500001

A Neural Network model for the estimation of bioclimatic indexes	AIR POLLUTION XVIII	WIT Transactions on Ecology and the Environment				18th International Conference on Modelling, Monitoring and Management of Air Pollution	JUN, 2010	Kos Isl, GREECE	WIT, Transact Ecol & Environm				Many researches have highlighted the influence of climate on mortality, showing a high increase in mortality in the summer time during "heat waves", periods of very high temperature and humidity levels. The bioclimatic indexes are used in urban climate studies to describe the level of thermal sensation that a person experiences due to the modified climatic conditions of an urban area. The index provides a meaningful and realistic indicator that can not only be used as an information as to how hot it feels, but also as a readily identifiable warning for individuals subject to the physiological dangers of heat exposure. The authors have developed a methodology that, by means of the Neural Network (NN), permits one to predict the values of meteorological data and then the calculation of the bioclimatic indexes. The meteorological data required for the calculation of the bioclimatic index concerning hourly values of air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed have been used according to the records of the meteorological station of the Pergusa Lake (EN), for the year from 2003 to 2006 NN-estimated, the bioclimatic indexes values were compared with coincident bioclimatic indexes values obtained from air temperature and relative humidity observations recorded at standard meteorological stations. Statistical analysis showed a good agreement between the NN-estimated and the station-observed bioclimatic indexes values, with a root mean square error (RMSE) < 1%. The proposed methodology demonstrates the potential of using the NN for defining the bioclimatic indexes and its feasibility as an indicator to pre-alert authority to heat related risks and dangers of heat waves					; Nocera, Francesco/C-4712-2013; Gagliano, Antonio/AAB-7045-2020; Gagliano, Antonio/O-2243-2015; Caponetto, Riccardo/I-8919-2019	patania, francesco/0000-0002-9200-4759; Caponetto, Riccardo/0000-0002-9574-7187; Nocera, Francesco/0000-0001-5673-5418; Gagliano, Antonio/0000-0002-0462-7586; 													1743-3541		978-1-84564-450-5				2010	136						237	+		10.2495/AIR100211	http://dx.doi.org/10.2495/AIR100211													WOS:000306447900021

'Snake River (SR)-type' volcanism at the Yellowstone hotspot track: distinctive products from unusual, high-temperature silicic super-eruptions	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												A new category of large-scale volcanism, here termed Snake River (SR)-type volcanism, is defined with reference to a distinctive volcanic facies association displayed by Miocene rocks in the central Snake River Plain area of southern Idaho and northern Nevada, USA. The facies association contrasts with those typical of silicic volcanism elsewhere and records unusual, voluminous and particularly environmentally devastating styles of eruption that remain poorly understood. It includes: (1) large-volume, lithic-poor rhyolitic ignimbrites with scarce pumice lapilli; (2) extensive, parallel-laminated, medium to coarse-grained ashfall deposits with large cuspate shards, crystals and a paucity of pumice lapilli; many are fused to black vitrophyre; (3) unusually extensive, large-volume rhyolite lavas; (4) unusually intense welding, rheomorphism, and widespread development of lava-like facies in the ignimbrites; (5) extensive, fines-rich ash deposits with abundant ash aggregates (pellets and accretionary lapilli); (6) the ashfall layers and ignimbrites contain abundant clasts of dense obsidian and vitrophyre; (7) a bimodal association between the rhyolitic rocks and numerous, coalescing low-profile basalt lava shields; and (8) widespread evidence of emplacement in lacustrine-alluvial environments, as revealed by intercalated lake sediments, ignimbrite peperites, rhyolitic and basaltic hyaloclastites, basalt pillow-lava deltas, rhyolitic and basaltic phreatomagmatic tuffs, alluvial sands and palaeosols. Many rhyolitic eruptions were high mass-flux, large volume and explosive (VEI 6-8), and involved H2O-poor, low-delta O-18, metaluminous rhyolite magmas with unusually low viscosities, partly due to high magmatic temperatures (900-1,050 degrees C). SR-type volcanism contrasts with silicic volcanism at many other volcanic fields, where the fall deposits are typically Plinian with pumice lapilli, the ignimbrites are low to medium grade (non-welded to eutaxitic) with abundant pumice lapilli or fiamme, and the rhyolite extrusions are small volume silicic domes and coulees. SR-type volcanism seems to have occurred at numerous times in Earth history, because elements of the facies association occur within some other volcanic fields, including Trans-Pecos Texas, Etendeka-Parana, Lebombo, the English Lake District, the Proterozoic Keewanawan volcanics of Minnesota and the Yardea Dacite of Australia.					; Andrews, Graham/AAN-8676-2020	Branney, Michael/0000-0002-9126-7178; Andrews, Graham/0000-0002-7911-702X; Barry, Tiffany/0000-0001-6853-6838; 													0258-8900	1432-0819				JAN	2008	70	3					293	314		10.1007/s00445-007-0140-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00445-007-0140-7													WOS:000252160100004

Monoecious hydrilla-A review of the literature	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												Hydrilla verticillata is a submersed aquatic weed that has become one of most expensive and difficult to manage in the United States. It disrupts water flow, interferes with recreation, displaces native vegetation, and can negatively impact nonplant species. There are two biotypes of hydrilla found in the United States a triploid dioecious and a triploid monoecious biotype. The monoecious biotype is typically found from North Carolina northward and is rapidly spreading, whereas dioecious hydrilla is common further south and is not currently demonstrating significant range expansion. Monoecious hydrilla behaves as a herbaceous perennial with shoots senescing over winter and repopulation occurring through prolific turions. This is in contrast to dioecious hydrilla, which has more persistent stems and root crowns, but produces fewer turions. Monoecious hydrilla turions also sprout at a far greater rate under cooler temperatures than dioecious hydrilla. Differences in biology between the two U.S. biotypes have been reported in genetic profiles, with monoecious biotypes, possibly originating from hybridization between two distinct dioecious biotypes. Cryptic speciation of hydrilla biotypes is an interesting consideration that has recently been suggested, and additional research is needed on hydrilla genetic diversity worldwide to determine if this has occurred. The body of research focusing strictly on the monoecious biotype is much smaller than that of the dioecious, as reflected in the literature. Many publications on hydrilla make no mention of biotype; therefore only an educated guess can be made based on study locations to decipher biotype. Thus, as monoecious hydrilla continues to spread and now presents a distinct threat to glacial lakes, additional research focused on this biotype is needed. The impact of latitudinal climate changes on monoecious growth and competition with native plants has not been well documented. The native-species spectrum of northern U.S. lakes is different than in traditional monoecious areas. Research needs to evaluate the ecological impact of hydrilla invasion as well as best management techniques for removing monoecious hydrilla from these plant communities. In addition, although seed production of monoecious hydrilla has been reported, it is poorly understood in situ. Seed production, viability, and potential dispersal also represent areas that have not been adequately documented.																			0146-6623					JAN	2016	54						1	11																WOS:000367965100001

Spatiotemporal drivers of water quality and phytoplankton communities in a cyanobacteria-dominated reservoir provide management insights	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Reservoirs serve critical roles providing drinking water, irrigation, flood control, hydropower, recreation, fisheries, and aquatic habitat. Yet their physical position, complex shape, and large watersheds make reservoirs especially susceptible to eutrophication and harmful algal bloom (HAB) production. Boysen Reservoir, WY, is a high priority for proactive nutrient management because it is an important source for drinking water and recreation, and has a history of toxic cyanobacterial blooms. We combined four years of comprehensive monitoring efforts by state and federal agencies to characterize the spatiotemporal patterns of nutrient inflow, internal water quality dynamics, and phytoplankton community shifts in Boysen Reservoir. We found nutrient inflow was hydrologically driven, with snowmelt runoff transporting high nutrient loads. Our findings suggest physicochemical and nutrient conditions of the reservoir were strongly different between the furthest reaches of the reservoir, but less variable among the intermediate sites. Space did not play a role in phytoplankton community dynamics, but time was an important factor. Cyanobacteria dominated phytoplankton communities by mid-summer across the reservoir and were driven mainly by temporal physicochemical conditions, like stratification and water temperature. The two most dominant phytoplankton taxa across the four years of sampling were N-fixing, toxin producing cyanobacteria. Extensive monitoring efforts and data analyses can illuminate strategies to safeguard water resources via understanding the drivers of water quality changes and HAB production.

Although microcystins (MCs) have been detected in many freshwater ecosystems in China, little is known about the other cyanotoxins. An investigation of six eutrophic lakes (i.e. Hulun Lake, Wuliangsuhai Lake, Chaohu Lake, Taihu Lake, Xingyun Lake, and Dianchi Lake) in different geographical locations of China was performed during the summer of 2022 to determine the occurrence of various cyanotoxins (i.e. anatoxin-a (ATX), cylindrospermopsin (CYN), and MCs) in water column and their possible risks, and to evaluate the related environmental factors. MCs levels in sediment of these lakes were also investigated. MCs were the primary cyanotoxins in the water column of investigated lakes. The mean MCs contents in water column of Hulun Lake, Wuliangsuhai Lake, Chaohu Lake, Taihu Lake, Xingyun Lake, and Dianchi Lake were 3.61, 0.13, 3.60, 2.18, 0.57, and 2.56 mu g/L, respectively. The total MCs levels in water column exceeded 1 mu g/L in some areas of these lakes except Wuliangsuhai Lake. Replete nitrogen and/or phosphorus levels seemed to be related to MCs production. ATX can be detected in these lakes except Xingyun Lake at ng/L levels. CYN can be detected in all lakes at ng/L levels. However, the levels of ATX and CYN appear to be not significantly associated with environmental factors. MCs and CYN can pose a high or moderate risk for humans and aquatic organisms in some areas of these lakes, while ATX can pose a low or no risk for humans and aquatic organisms in most areas of these lakes. MCs can also be detected in sediment of all lakes at ng/g levels. This research emphasizes the necessity for long-term monitoring of different cyanotoxins in eutrophic lakes, and the implementation of nutrient control and management strategies.

J	Wang, Q; Anderson, NJ; Yang, XD				Wang, Qian; Anderson, N. John; Yang, Xiangdong			Climate and land-cover controls of aquatic carbon dynamics since the last glacial maximum: Evidence from stable carbon isotopes of subfossil Cladocera	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Lake metabolism and associated emissions of CO2 in lakes are heavily subsidized by terrestrial carbon. However, how land-cover change and long-term climate interact to influence landscape biogeochemistry remains unclear. A similar to 26,000-year sediment record from a lake in Southwest China shows how terrestrial-aquatic carbon dynamics responded to climate changes, atmospheric CO2 levels, and changing land-cover (vegetation composition) prior to cultural disturbances. Decoupled and coupled variations in the delta C-13 of Zooplankton (Bosmina) and sedimentary organic carbon from the Last Glacial Maximum tracked changes in atmospheric CO2 and the delta O-18 records of monsoonal intensity (Dykoski et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2005), highlighting a primary climatic control on coupled terrestrial-aquatic carbon dynamics. Zooplankton and algal production, alongside Bosmina delta C-13-inferred lake CO2 concentrations, exhibited synchronous variations with the intensification of the southwest monsoon from similar to 10 cal kyr BP, reflecting both increased aquatic production and enhanced terrestrial carbon export driven by forest expansion. These results highlight the critical role of monsoon-driven hydrological changes in regulating terrestrial organic matter inputs to lakes and shaping aquatic carbon dynamics at timescales of 10(2)-10(3) year.					; Yang, Xiangdong/GRJ-4189-2022	Wang, Qian/0000-0002-7562-258X; 													1040-6182	1873-4553				JAN 1	2025	715								109597	10.1016/j.quaint.2024.109597	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2024.109597		DEC 2024											WOS:001375371200001
J	Turner, EC; Jones, B				Turner, EC; Jones, B			Microscopic calcite dendrites in cold-water tufa: implications for nucleation of micrite and cement	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Dendritic calcite forms in an active cold- water tufa system in association with extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that discontinuously coat bryophytes and cyanobacteria. Dendrites consist of 100 - 200 nm thick calcite fibres that form 3D lattice- like domains. In each dendrite domain, fibres have three structurally equal orientations, which correspond in disposition to radii from the centre of a calcite unit cell to the convex triple face junctions on its surface. Fibres do not form in the orientation of the c- axis. The external form of each dendrite has the shape of half of a shortened octahedron, with an upper triangular surface parallel to the substrate. Dendrite nucleation takes place on or in microbial EPS, whether microbial cells are present or not, and is probably effected by attraction of Ca2+ cations to negatively charged EPS, together with CO2-degassing and concomitant pH increase of supersaturated spring water in stream splash zones. Ensuing dendrite growth is abiogenic and controlled by diffusion. Dendrite c- axes are perpendicular to the substrate, probably because the negative charge of EPS forces the orientation of Ca2+ and CO32- planes within the developing dendrite crystal to be parallel to the EPS film surface. Dendrites are eventually filled and overgrown by solid, syntaxial calcite, which gradually and completely obliterates the dendrites as more familiar calcite crystal forms develop. No trace of the dendritic nucleus remains in the rock record. Calcite crystal nucleation may take place by this mechanism in many marine and meteoric settings, given that microbial EPS is now assumed to be virtually ubiquitous in these environments. This phenomenon could contribute to the development of familiar fabrics such as marine micrite cement and fibrous calcite cement, radial ooids, peloids, ' abiogenic ' stromatolites, sea floor precipitates, microbialites, tufa, travertine, speleothems, and some meteoric cements. It may also contribute to the substrate-normal orientation of c-axes of common cement fabrics.					; Turner, Elizabeth/GZK-6745-2022	Jones, Brian/0000-0003-3088-5543; 													0037-0746	1365-3091				OCT	2005	52	5					1043	1066		10.1111/j.1365-3091.2005.00741.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3091.2005.00741.x													WOS:000231676600008

Seventeen years of grass carp: an examination of vegetation management and collateral impacts in Ball Pond, New Fairfield, Connecticut. Lake Reserve Manage. 33:84-100.Ball Pond is a 32ha meso-eutrophic lake located in the Marble Valley of Connecticut. The local bedrock geology and watershed influences have resulted in a hardwater system with limited plant community diversity and an assemblage dominated by the nonnative species Myriophyllum spicatum. By 1996, M. spicatum dominated 32% of the waterbody, and residents were concerned their property values would fall as the recreational value of the lake diminished. In an attempt to remedy this issue, 400 grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella; approximate to 30cm length) were released in 1997 at a rate of 38 per vegetated hectare. As a requirement of the state permit, the plant community, water quality, and the fish community were monitored throughout the initiative (1997-2014) to examine the impact of grass carp at multiple ecological levels of the lentic system. M. spicatum was significantly reduced in biomass and cover between 1997 and 2014, with no change in plant community richness. Concordant with the decrease in M. spicatum, the cover of Ceratophyllum demersum increased significantly and became more dominant in the plant community as M. spicatum was reduced. Our results also suggest there was no change in water quality or fish community density/diversity during the study period; however, fish community richness was reduced. Bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) density and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) size distribution both increased during this study. We assert that grass carp can be an effective approach to nonnative plant management in a northern meso-eutrophic lake.																			1040-2381	2151-5530				MAR	2017	33	1					84	100		10.1080/10402381.2017.1284966	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2017.1284966													WOS:000396042900009

For a period of 5 wk we followed the spring development of the epilimnetic microbial community in an oligo-mesotrophic lake. Changes in bacterial size distributions and growth parameters were quantified and compared with the abundance, biomass and bacterivory of the heterotrophic nanoflagellate (HNF) community. We observed pronounced shifts within 2 distinct size ranges of the bacterioplankton. Short, rod-shaped cells between 0.4 and 1.2 mu m cell length formed between 30 to 70 % of total bacterial biomass; cells >2.4 pm were responsible for another 20 to 50%. High HNF community grazing rates (>100 % of newly produced cells) were reflected in a biomass drop of bacteria between 0.4 and 1.2 mu m cell length, whereas large cells (>2.4 pm) were almost half of total bacterial biomass during this period. When HNF abundance and bacterivory decreased, the opposite pattern was observed. [H-3]Thymidine and [C-14]leucine uptake per respiring bacterial cell were maximal during the period of rapid increase of bacterial cells between 0.4 and 1.2 mu m. Both flagellate total grazing and individual clearance rates were negatively correlated with growth per active bacterial cell. The biomass of 'grazing-resistant' bacteria was correlated with flagellate bacterivory and biomass, and size-selective protistan grazing influenced the size structure of bacterioplankton as well as the mean per-cell growth of the active bacterial fraction. We suggest a model that divides freshwater bacterioplankton into 4 size ranges of different vulnerability to size-selective protistan grazing.

Although substantial efforts have been accomplished to restore phytoplankton-dominated shallow lakes to a clear state with high coverage of submerged macrophytes, the phenomenon, driving mechanism, and threshold range of such nonlinear regime shifts remain unclear. Here, we constructed an aquatic ecological model based on PCLake, simulated and pre-dicted the aquatic ecological changes before and after treatments of Xinglong Lake, a subtropical artificial shallow lake that had been completed ecological restoration in Chengdu, China. The model included the future prediction of TN, TP, Chl-a, and aquatic vegetation biomass, as well as the threshold of regime shifts using bifurcation analysis. We also quantified the impact of some common management measures (point and non-point source pollution control, water level regulation) on the stability of the lake's aquatic ecosystem. The results showed that the thresholds of Xinglong Lake from a clear state to a turbid state were 1.405 mg/m2/day and vice versa 0.68 mg/m2/day, indicating its initial turbidity and transitional state after treatment. After treatment, phosphorus loads still exceeded the threshold for a clear-water state, while the non-point source pollution of Xinglong Lake accounted for more than 80%. To prevent the aquatic ecosystem from collapsing in the future, it is necessary to combine upstream water quality improvement, runoff and air pollution control to reduce total pollution by 60%. Reasonable water level regulation, such as adjusting the water level downwards by 0.5 m in spring, is beneficial in maintaining the health and stability of aquatic ecosystems. The present study can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the management measures of Xinglong Lake as well as to provide scientific support for the management of shallow lakes.

To understand the characteristics of the bacterial community in Wuliangsuhai Lake in spring, we explored the influence of environmental factors on the community structure of particle-attached bacteria (PA) and free-living bacteria (FL) in the water column of Wuliangsuhai Lake. In this study, we analyzed the bacterial community characteristics of 10 sampling sites in Wuliangsuhai Lake in April 2019 based on the high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was used to analyze the influence of environmental factors on bacterial communities in lake water. The results showed the following: (1) The relative abundance of bacteria in Wuliangsuhai Lake did not significantly differ among the 10 sampling sites, and the dominant bacterial phyla were Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. In addition, the community diversity of particle-attached (PA) was higher than that of free-living (FL). (2) The relative abundance of Bacteroidetes in PA (28.83%similar to 54.67%) was significantly higher than that of FL (10.56%similar to 28.44%), the relative abundance of Actinobacteria in the number of PA (20.02%similar to 61.61%) was lower than that of FL (8.18%similar to 16.71%), and the relative abundance of Verrucomicrobia in the PA (0.55%similar to 13.11%) was higher than that of FL (0.05%similar to 6.31%). (3) The redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that transparency, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and NH4+-N were the main factors influencing the dominant bacterial communities in Wuliangsuhai Lake. This study provides the basis for further research on bacterial communities in freshwater lakes and may help local governments in the management of the water resources of Wuliangsuhai Lake.					shi, XIAOHONG/KRP-1855-2024; Li, Wenbao/HQZ-4391-2023; Cui, Zhimou/KOC-9369-2024; Liu, Yu/HNQ-3822-2023															2073-4441				MAR	2023	15	5							836	10.3390/w15050836	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15050836													WOS:000947435900001

Freshwater populations of many species play an important role, both by trophic base offered to different consumers groups, and by involvement in organic matter flow, implicitly in water self-purification processes. In addition, the ability of many species to adapt to varying conditions of inland waters allows them to be good biological indicators for assessing the health status of the aquatic ecosystems they inhabit([1]). Lake Siutghiol is a strong anthropised limnetic system; the western and southern extremities are highly urbanized, cities of Constanta and Ovidiu recording significant expansion in recent years; the eastern extremity of the lake is marked by the summer resort of Mamaia. The lake is characterized by the presence of several types of habitat, among sedimentary ones predominant being the habitats with muddy fractions. Analyzed chironomid species that make the subject of this paper may be encountered in different habitats([2]) and have a specific food regime; the type and availability of trophic resources in occupied habitats led to differentiations of the buccal apparatus of each species. This paper aims to emphasize and correlate adaptations of bucal apparatus in two species of chironomids: a sedimentophyl one, with detritivorous trophic regime and the other one associated to phytal substrate (reeds) and with vegetal-detritivorous trophic regime.																			1314-2704						2012							171	+																WOS:000348536400024
J	Sullivan, AM; Picard, AL; Madison, DM				Sullivan, AM; Picard, AL; Madison, DM			To avoid or not to avoid? Factors influencing the discrimination of predator diet cues by a terrestrial salamander	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR												Many prey species use chemical cues deposited by predators to assess predation risk, and some prey are capable of discriminating among predator chemical traces based on the predator's recent diet. Here we test the influence of genetic relatedness (degree of genetic similarity between prey) and ecological relatedness (degree of refuge and trophic overlap between syntopic prey) on the evolution of predator-diet discrimination by red-backed salamanders, Plethodon cinereus. In experiment 1, we examined whether red-backed salamanders from Binghamton University (Binghamton, New York, U.S.A.) would differentially respond to chemical traces from garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis) fed conspecific P. cinereus from four populations belonging to three phylogenetic groups: Group II from Mountain Lake, Virginia, Group III from Binghamton University, New York, Group III from Hawk Mountain, Pennsylvania, and Group IV from Cherry Springs, Pennsylvania, U.S.A. The test salamanders only avoided chemical traces from garter snakes fed salamanders from the two Group III sites, although the response to the Group III-Hawk Mountain treatment was intermediate to that for the Group III-Binghamton University treatment and the Group 11 and IV treatments. In experiment 2, we examined whether red-backed salamanders collected from two subpopulations, syntopic or allotopic with two-lined salamanders, Eurycea bislineata, vary in their response to chemical cues from garter snakes foraging on two-lined salamanders. Only red-backed salamanders syntopic with E. bislineata avoided chemical traces from garter snakes fed E. bislineata. These results suggest that both genetic and ecological relatedness play a role in the evolution of predator-diet discrimination in red-backed salamanders.

Lateglacial and Holocene vegetation and environmental change in the Jom-Bolok volcanic region, East Sayan Mountains, South Siberia, Russia	BOREAS												This study presents the first centennial-scale multi-proxy record from the East Sayan Mountains, which are part of the central Asian 'water tower' massif. The record from Lake Kaskadnoe in the Jom-Bolok area shows changes in vegetation and climate since c. 14.2 cal. ka BP. Although the study site is in an area with active volcanism, there is no clear evidence that volcanic eruptions influenced the local vegetation. At c. 14.2-12.9 cal. ka BP, regional climate was sufficiently warm and moist to allow scattered growth of Picea, Larix and Betula nana around the lake. A cooling episode at c. 12.9-11.5 cal. ka BP is coincident with the Younger Dryas and led to the predominance of shrub tundra in the basin. Cool and moist conditions c. 11.5-9.0 cal. ka BP resulted in the spread of Pinus sibirica in the catchment of Lake Kaskadnoe. The Middle Holocene, c. 9.0-4.5 cal. ka BP, featured a warmer and drier regional climate, which led to a decrease in high-elevation dark conifer forest. Subsequently, the onset of the Neoglacial and a cooler climate is indicated by the spread of Larix sibirica and Pinus sibirica in the study area. Lateglacial and Holocene moisture conditions in the East Sayan Mountains have primarily been controlled by the interaction of the westerlies and the East Asian Summer Monsoon and show a drying trend through time; long-term insolation changes affected both the Monsoon and regional temperatures. The pattern of moisture decrease in the latter part of the Holocene is seen at sites in adjacent regions of the central Asian mountains.

Trends in studying urban runoff: a retrospective analysis	AMAZONIA INVESTIGA												The paper is a retrospective analysis of trends in quantitative empirical and theoretical studies of urban surface runoff from the mid-19th century to the early 90s of the 20th century, when the largest Soviet scientific school for such studies in the city of Kharkov was dissolved. As shown in the paper, the calculation methods for estimating peak discharges of urban surface runoff can be traced back to a pioneering work by T.J. Mulvaney (1850), which laid the foundation for the "rational method". Later this method was developed in the works by E. Kuichling (1889) and D.E.Lloyd-Davies (1906). The significance of developing such a method was determined by frequent cases of flooding urban territories and by the need for rapid removal of large volumes of storm water through special collectors. This method is still widely used in simplified calculations of urban surface runoff, since it has a good physical justification (balance equation): the amount of precipitation falling on a given catchment area equals the amount of runoff less losses for infiltration, surface retention and evaporation, which are integrally included into a surface runoff coefficient. Along with accumulating empirical data, scientists began to pay more attention to the problem of pollution of urban surface runoff, as it causes pollution of rivers, lakes, seas, water storage reservoirs and other water bodies. First of such systematic studies were commenced in the 60-70s of the 20th century by the US governmental agencies. Having accumulated a large amount of empirical data and having understood the mechanisms determining the water quality of urban surface runoff, scientists began to develop continuous simulation models, which the paper reviews and dwells on.

J	Thompson, TA; Baedke, SJ				Thompson, TA; Baedke, SJ			Strand-plain evidence for late Holocene lake-level variations in Lake Michigan	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Lake level is a primary control on shoreline behavior in Lake Michigan. The historical record from lake-level gauges is the most accurate source of information on past lake levels, but the short duration of the record does not permit the recognition of long-term patterns of lake-level change (longer than a decade or two). To extend the record of lake-level change, the internal architecture and timing of development of five strand plains of late Holocene beach ridges along the Lake Michigan coastline were studied. Relative lake-level curves for each site were constructed by determining the elevation of foreshore (swash zone) sediments in the beach ridges and by dating basal wetland sediments in the swales between ridges. These curves detect long-term (30+ yr) lake-level variations and differential isostatic adjustments over the past 4700 yr at a greater resolution than achieved by other studies. The average timing of beach-ridge development for all sites is between 29 and 38 yr/ridge. This correspondence occurs in spite of the embayments containing the strand plains being different in size, orientation, hydrographic regime, and available sediment type and caliber. If not coincidental, all sites responded to a lake-level fluctuation of a little more than three decades in duration and a range of 0.5 to 0.6 m. Most pronounced in the relative lake-level curves is a fluctuation of 120-180 yr in duration. This approximate to 150 yr variation is defined by groups of four to six ridges that show a rise and fall in foreshore elevations of 0.5 to 1.5 m within the group. The 150 yr variation can be correlated between sites in the Lake Michigan basin. The approximate to 30 and 150 yr fluctuations are superimposed on a long-term loss of water to the Lake Michigan basin and differential rates of isostatic adjustment.					; Thompson, Todd/G-6579-2011	Thompson, Todd/0000-0001-6266-2630; 													0016-7606					JUN	1997	109	6					666	682		10.1130/0016-7606(1997)109<0666:SPEFLH>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0016-7606(1997)109<0666:SPEFLH>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1997XC64300004

DETERMINATION OF SEDIMENT PHOSPHATE SORPTION CHARACTERISTICS IN SHALLOW MOGAN LAKE, TURKEY	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												This study was conducted on sediment and overlying water samples from Mogan Lake, an important recreational area, in April, July and October 2015 and January 2016. The noteworthy data for this study were presented as follows: a) Sediment adsorption/desorption characteristics dependent on phosphate concentration, temperature and time were determined using models, and the relevant parameters were derived. b) Sediment equilibrium phosphate concentrations (EPC0) and the critical dissolved phosphorus in the overlyingwater were estimated. Presentation of the research data is as follows: a) Phosphorous adsorption in the sediment samples was theoretically between 421 mgP kg(-1) and 1,001 mgP kg(-1), and phosphorus sorption efficiency was estimated at 0.21-1.92 L mg(-1). Based on the Langmuir Model, the mean maximum adsorption capacity obtained for the July samples was significantly higher than that obtained for October (p < 0.05). Moreover, regarding the very low degree of sediment phosphorus desorption (<1%), it can be concluded that sediment does not behave as a desorbant material for phosphorus. b) Considering the EPC0 values (5.5 x 10(-3) and 46.6 x 10(-3) mg L-1), when the overlying water SRP concentrations fall below 0.008 mg L-1 in October and 0.046 mg L-1 in July, there will be a risk of phosphorus flux from the sediment to the lake water. Considering the overlying water SRP values reported for Lake Mogan, monitoring them in the months of October and July will prove to be decisive in predicting the internal phosphorus load of the lake.					; Topcu, Akasya/AAF-1769-2020; Pulatsü, Serap/AAF-1648-2020; Ulusoy, Ulvi/JSK-6906-2023	Pulatsu, Serap/0000-0001-5277-417X; 													1589-1623	1785-0037					2018	16	5					5971	5985		10.15666/aeer/1605_59715985	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1605_59715985													WOS:000448772700042

A Holocene sequence of vegetation change at Lake Eteza, coastal KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												Palynological and sedimentological data from a core extracted from Lake Eteza shed new light on the Holocene vegetation and climate history in KwaZulu-Natal and can be linked to regional and global climate change. A 2072 cm core with nineteen radiocarbon dates and chronological extrapolation to the bottom of the sequence suggests that sedimentation started ca. 10200 cal yrs BP. Between ca. 10200 and 6800 cal yrs BP pollen indicators point to a change from intermediately humid conditions to comparatively drier grassy environments. This is in good agreement with Sea Surface Temperature (SST) fluctuations from a core in the Mozambique Channel which influence precipitation in coastal KwaZulu-Natal, and the beginning of the Holocene Thermal Maximum ca. 10500 cal yrs BP. The lower section of the core corresponds to gradually increasing Holocene sea levels along the coast and development of freshwater or estuarine conditions at Lake Eteza. The middle Holocene (ca. 6800-3600 cal yrs BP), when the sea level reached its highest stand and SST peak, indicate humid climatic conditions that favoured an increase of forest trees, e.g. Podocarpus, and undergrowth plants like Issoglossa. As a consequence of higher precipitation and increase of the water table, conditions were favourable for the spread of mangrove, swamp and possibly riverine forest. During the late Holocene after ca. 3600 cal yrs BP a decrease of Podocarpus and other trees as well as an increase of Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthaceae, grasses and Phoenix coincide with a return to lower sea levels and drier conditions. The decrease of all trees including Phoenix at ca. 700 cal yrs BP, accompanied by rapid sedimentation rates, possibly reflect forest clearing and upland erosion induced by activities of Iron Age settlers. A dry period at the globally recognized onset of the Little Ice Age might have contributed to these changes. Late Iron Age settlers have probably already introduced Zea mays, which was detected in the profile since ca. 210 BP. The appearance of neophytes like Pinus, Casuarina and pollen of Ambrosia-type in the youngest sediments indicates increased disturbance of European settlements and land use since ca. 100 cal yrs BP.

This study therefore aimed to elucidate temporal and vertical shifts of microbial communities of planktonic and biofilm growth on artificial substrates in the WBLE water column at discrete depths, investigating the overlap of shared taxa between community types. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene revealed concurrent biofilm-plankton samples shared a low percentage (similar to 10%) of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) indicating distinct communities between free-living and substrate-attached bacteria. Plankton communities did not significantly differ between surface and bottom depths (1 and 8 m), whereas biofilm communities differed between upper (1-4 m) and lower (5-8 m) water columns. Temporal variation in community composition was observed in biofilm, with early periods (June-July) showing significant dissimilarity followed by compositional convergence in late summer onwards (August-October). With the expansion of artificial infrastructure in aquatic systems, there is novel substrate material to observe spatiotemporal patterns of microbial colonisation throughout the pelagic zone. These results demonstrate the complexity of bacterial biofilm communities from plankton in freshwater, providing insight into microbial assembly through temporal succession and across depth.

Lake Restoration Using Dissolved Air Flotation	FLOTATION TECHNOLOGY	Handbook of Environmental Engineering											The steps leading to the demise of a lake are discussed. One of the primary causes of the death of a lake is excessive biological growth, called eutrophication. Biological growth is limited primarily by the availability of the nutrients necessary for growth. It has been shown that phosphorus is most frequently the limiting nutrient to control biological growth in a lake, but nitrogen is also commonly limiting. Phosphorus may be permanently removed from a lake by various processes, whereas nitrogen is difficult to remove permanently due to the fact that certain blue-green algae can fix atmospheric nitrogen as a nitrogen source. Thus, emphasis has been placed on the removal of phosphorus. There are various methods for the treatment of wastewaters to remove the nutrients before being discharged to a body of water. Once in a lake, phosphorus removal is most frequently achieved by producing an insoluble aluminum salt of the phosphorus, but iron salts are effective under aerobic conditions. Calcium salts are effective in removing phosphorus, but they generally adversely increase the pH of the lake. Precipitated aluminum phosphate salts may be allowed to settle to the bottom of the lake, or they may be removed from the water column. A study showed that removing the phosphate-rich hypolimnetic waters from a summer stratified temperate climate lake, precipitating the phosphorus as either aluminum or iron salts, separating the precipitate by DAF, and returning the phosphate reduced water to the lake were very effective in controlling the phosphorus nutrient content in Devils Lake, WI.																					978-1-58829-494-4				2010	12						429	456		10.1007/978-1-60327-133-2_13	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-60327-133-2_13	10.1007/978-1-60327-133-2												WOS:000278933000013
J	Novak, B; Björck, S				Novak, B; Björck, S			Marine seismic studies in southern Kattegat, with special emphasis on longitudinal bars and their possible relationship to the drainage of the Ancylus Lake	GFF												Forty kilometres of high-resolution subbottom- and seismic reflection profiling was undertaken in southern Kattegat. In the 3.5 kHz subbottom profiler recordings five seismic facies were recognized and they are presented in isopach maps. Two vibrocore samples constituted the stratigraphic control, and on the basis of facies analysis and core lithology, an anomalous fluvial event is proposed. The event is clearly non-cyclic and the associated gravel-sand deposit is stratigraphically situated between two units of fines. The base of the seismic facies association shows unusually deep scours, high-angled chute cuts and an unbalanced morphology. Facies 1 - sheets is located at least 8 m higher than facies 5 - channel - but is stratigraphically the lowermost unit. Facies 1 to 5 represent gradually lower energies. Maximum water velocity was calculated to be more than 8 m/s in the scours. A peak flow with a duration of a few months initiated the event, whereafter the water level fell rapidly. The deposits are related to the drainage and lowering of the Ancylus Lake through the Storebaelt, into southern Kattegat. Instead of being a several hundred-year-long event, which has been implied earlier, this lowering seems to have occurred over a very short time. In a later and more long-lasting phase, the normal background discharge from the Baltic area dominated the flow style and the water velocity was in the order of 1 m/s.																			1103-5897					SEP	1998	120		3				297	306		10.1080/11035899809453223	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11035899809453223													WOS:000081232000006
J	Mion, JB; Stein, RA; Marschall, EA				Mion, JB; Stein, RA; Marschall, EA			River discharge drives survival of larval walleye	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Walleye (Stizosredion vitreum) in Lake Erie have historically experienced large fluctuations in recruitment success, which have important implications for walleye population dynamics as well as food web interactions, Because walleye year class strength in Lake Erie likely is set during the larval life stage, we explored factors underlying larval survival during out-migration in the Maumee and Sandusky rivers, Ohio's primary walleye spawning tributaries. To evaluate our expectation that survival of larval walleye would be positively related to discharge, we estimated daily larval production and used otoliths to estimate hatch dates of larvae surviving out-migration. Comparing daily larval production and survival distributions demonstrated strong temporal patterns of larval survival that were unrelated to daily larval production patterns. Daily survival varied greatly during the larval hatch (similar to 4 wk), with short, discrete periods (4-7 d) of high survival accounting for 75-84% of total survivors. Contrary to our original expectations, larval survival was inversely related to river discharge (P < 0.05). As river discharge increased, the amount of suspended sediments increased (r(2) > 0.6, P < 0.001), likely directly increasing larval mortality. Post-out-migration densities of larval walleye in Maumee and Sandusky bays were correlated strongly (Maumee Bay: r(2) = 0.99, Sandusky Bay: r(2) = 0.94) with Ohio Division of Wildlife estimates of late summer juvenile abundance of Lake Erie walleye (which historically have been correlated strongly with year class strength). Because high discharge events during the larval hatch likely reduce survival, variability in river discharge underlies variability of walleye year class strength. Managers could mitigate these effects by reducing exploitation of spawning walleye and improving watershed characteristics to reduce discharge fluctuations and suspended sediments.

Temporal Variation in the Physiological Responses in Largemouth Bass following Small Club Angling Tournaments	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Sublethal physiological disturbances and mortality were quantified in Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides subjected to small, club-style angling tournaments (<30 teams) held at two central Illinois lakes. Between April and October, physiological disturbances were assessed in four tournaments at Lake Bloomington, and mortality was assessed in four tournaments at Evergreen Lake. Indicators of physiological disturbances were evident in Largemouth Bass following club angling tournaments, with some temporal variation in responses. Plasma glucose concentrations increased in tournament-caught fish relative to reference fish in all months, except during October, when glucose concentrations did not change; plasma cortisol values among tournament fish also were lowest during October. Plasma potassium levels decreased only in April, whereas chloride levels were unaffected by tournaments. Sodium concentrations varied across months, but the magnitude of tournament-induced decreases were similar across all months. Whole-blood hemoglobin was lowest in May, and although hematocrit significantly decreased in tournament-caught fish in May, it remained unchanged in other months. Lactate increases occurred during all tournaments and were of similar magnitudes even though water temperatures ranged from 15.7 degrees C to 27.6 degrees C. Small, yet significant, temporal differences were observed in plasma sodium and in whole-blood hemoglobin concentrations from reference fish collected in each month via electrofishing, which indicated temporal changes in baseline values for some parameters. Mortality at tournaments was low (<5%) and did not appear to vary across months. Our results suggest that physiological responses of Largemouth Bass to small, club-style tournaments can vary temporally and are similar to those sustained during professional tournaments, even if mortality rates are generally low.

Carbon storage and greenhouse gases emission from a fluvial reservoir in an agricultural landscape	CATENA												The significance of organic carbon (C) burial in fluvial reservoirs on the global C cycle and atmosphere composition remains debatable. While the entrapment of eroded C in these systems could represent an important C sequestration mechanism, this must be weighed against the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) that may evolve in anoxic reservoir sediment. Over a 4-year period (2005-2008), dissolved concentrations and fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were monitored at a Central Indiana fluvial reservoir (built in 1967) fed by streams draining a predominantly agricultural watershed. Analysis of sediment cores revealed an annual sedimentation rate of 1.6 cm and C burial rate of 2.3-2.9 Mg C ha(-1). Reservoir waters were supersaturated with CO2 (mean: 2.55 mg CO2 L-1) and CH4 (9.44 mu g CO2 L-1). In the sediment, concentrations were 4-250 times higher reaching values up to 14,533 mu g CH4 L-1. The delta C-13 profile of CH4 (-57.7 parts per thousand at the bottom, -48.26 parts per thousand near the surface) indicated active CH4 oxidation during diffusive transport through the water column. Instances of N2O under-saturation were occasionally noted in mid-summers when NO3- level was <1 mg N L-1. Over the study period, GHG emission averaged 2.01 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1), 10.49 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) and 2.01 mg N2O m(-2) d(-1). These means were heavily influenced by the high CH4 and N2O fluxes (6 times the average) recorded during a mixing event that was triggered by a large discharge event that followed an extended dry period (discharge: 67% below normal). Based on their global warming potential, diffusive GHG fluxes averaged 2.82 g CO2 equivalents m(-2) d(-1) (range: 2.4-3.36) and completely offset reservoir C burial (2.61 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1)). These results underscore the sensitivity of the C budget of fluvial reservoirs to major hydrologic events that, through enhancement of GHG fluxes, can easily tip the reservoir C balance from sink to source.

These processes involved earth volumes from few to hundreds of thousands cubic meters and the formation of landslides scars with longitudes ranging from 10 to 100 m, and in quite a few cases of hundreds of meters. The mass movements were triggered by a four day long rainfall event, equaling 50-60% of the total annual rainfall in some localities. As a first approximation to the understanding of these hazards, the involved relief was classified in morphological units of three orders associated to six geologic units which encompass several Paleozoic to Quaternary formations. The phenomenon affected especially the upper slopes of the Sierra Madre Oriental, mainly the Triassic-Jurassic sedimentary rocks and the upper layer of volcanic rocks and weathered materials. Different landforms and processes were produced by this event, among them a new lake formed, which remains after five years; more than three meters of alluvium were accumulated in many mountain rivers; new gullies formed and others were sourced more than 20 m. The human influence was significant given the fact that many of these slope movements occurred on deforested hillslopes and roads (with averages of even two processes per km). A map of head of gullies frequency was developed The total measured number of head of gullies was about 19,000 for an area of 4, 000 km(2). Mean values are in the order of 5 head gullies heads per km(2), with a maximum of 13 stream heads per km(2). This indicates a strong relationship between mass movement processes and headword erosion in Holocen times.					; Orozco, José/H-5773-2015; Alcántara-Ayala, Irasema/G-8639-2017; Capra, Lucia/C-2371-2011	Capra, Lucia/0000-0003-3973-7264; Inbar, Moshe/0000-0002-4707-9508; 													1026-8774	2007-2902					2005	22	2					212	228																WOS:000231133100006

Resilience of alpine lake macroinvertebrate communities to climate change: a view from the South Carpathian Mountains	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Remote mountain lakes experience accelerating ecological change worldwide due to the ongoing warming. In this study, we analyze two alpine lakes, Lake Ana (1940 m) and Lake Peleaga (2122 m), from the Retezat National Park in Romania. The sediment cores cover similar to 400 years, and our aim is to reconstruct critical transitions, the rate of ecosystem change and its driving factors. The extent of human disturbance is weak at these lakes today. Therefore, we assumed the principal role of summer warming in potential ecosystem reorganizations. For verifying this assumption, we use a multi-proxy approach including Pb-210/Cs-137 dating, chironomid, pollen, Cladocera analyses, SPDU, element concentration, organic matter, total nitrogen, C/N ratio and delta N-15 measurements, chord-distance-analysis (RoC) and chironomid-based temperature reconstruction. The assemblages indicated cold, oligotrophic environment and remained relatively stable despite climate change and human pressure, in contrast to assemblages studied from higher altitude (> 2300 m) lakes in the Alps. Our temperature reconstructions show warming from the 2000's, but the results are influenced by fish introduction in the 1990s. We conclude that chironomid communities have not yet passed critical thresholds; the fauna reacted with restrained alterations, which is exceptional in the region, and highlight the importance of altitude and environmental protection.

According to the discovery of lake terraces and highstand lacustrine deposits at several places in Nam Co and its adjacent areas, the authors confirm the existence of an ancient large lake in the southeastern part of the northern Tibetan Plateau. On the basis of the U-series, C-14 and ESR dating, coupled with the levelling survey of lake deposits and geomorphology, the evolutionary process of the ancient large lake in the southeastern part of the northern Tibetan Plateau may fall into three stages: (1) the ancient large lake stage at 115-40 ka BP, when the ancient lake level was 140-26 m above the level of present Nam Co; (2) the outflow lake stage at 40-30 ka BP, when the ancient level was 26-19 m above the present lake level; and (3) the Nam Co stage since 30 ka BP, when the ancient lake level was <19 m above the present lake level. During the ancient large lake stage, a large number of modem large, medium-sized and small lakes, including Nam Co, Siling Co and Zhari Namco, in the southeastern part of the northern Tibetan Plateau, were connected into a single large ancient lake, rather than several separate lakes connected by river channels. Its areal extent may have gone beyond the watersheds of the modem endorheic and exorheic drainage systems; so it may be called the "ancient east lake", "ancient south lake" and "ancient west lake". It might also be connected with other ancient lakes in the southern and western parts of the northern Tibetan Plateau to form a unified "ancient large lake" on the northern Tibetan Plateau.																			1000-9515	1755-6724					2004	78	4					982	992																WOS:000225082500011

This problem is addressed with isotopic data from present-day Chara from a wide spread of freshwater environments in Britain and Ireland. VC values of stem encrustations from low water flow environments (lakes, ponds, ditches) are more positive than their coexisting gyrogonite values, by between 0.6 and 3.0parts per thousand, reflecting microenvironmental metabolic effects caused by photosynthesis. In stronger water flows, where dissolved inorganic carbon is well mixed, stem encrustation delta(13)C values are close to equilibrium. delta(18)O values in Chara stem encrustations are not equilibrium values, being typically offset to isotopically lighter compositions by about 1.5parts per thousand relative to equilibrium by kinetic effects during rapid calcification. Gyrogonite delta(18)O values are less negative than coexisting stem encrustation values by between 0.7 and 1.7parts per thousand. There is no clear evidence that gyrogonite delta(18)O or delta(13)C values are influenced by extensive disequilibrium but the data are difficult to interpret further without new experimental studies. Isotopic records in fossil lacustrine Chara marls (mainly stem encrustation calcites) should be interpreted with caution. Environmental records, essentially of relative changes in late summer water temperature or hydrology may be preserved, but these are unlikely to represent true equilibrium values. Gyrogonite calcification probably happens on a timescale of weeks, such that isotopic data represent 'snapshots' of the environmental conditions at the time of calcification. The timing of calcification in Chara may itself be variable depending on environment and temperature; it is a major unknown that currently hinders interpretation of isotopic data.

Two adjacent sediment cores were obtained from the Lake Bottom oxbow to better understand the depositional and environmental history of the site and region. Depositional ages were determined using radiocarbon dating (C-14) of pollen extracts, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) of sand, concentration of Cs-137 and Pb-210 radioisotopes, and the first occurrence of pollen from human-introduced crops (Zea mays) and trees and shrubs (Tamarix) found in the oxbow sediments. Age control from OSL, short-lived radioisotopes, and pollen are stratigraphically consistent and fit the geomorphic character of the partially filled oxbow, which suggests it is a late Holocene feature. In contrast, the C-14 results appear to be contaminated by old carbon and produced age overestimates of 3000-12,000 years. Our findings suggest that multiple dating methods should be employed when applying radiocarbon dating to settings that are susceptible to contamination by recycled old carbon, especially when dating pollen extracts that are difficult to determine organic purity. The OSL results suggest initial oxbow formation by 860 +/- 270 yr (+/- 2 sigma) and then rapidly infilled with fluvial sediment. The OSL age control indicates the oxbow formed during the Medieval Climate Anomaly, a time of enhanced summer moisture and active flooding in the Dolores River watershed. Similar low-elevation records in the arid Colorado Plateau are rare, making this site an important contribution to the regional paleoenvironmental record.

J	Renik, B; Christie-Blick, N				Renik, Byrdie; Christie-Blick, Nicholas			A new hypothesis for the amount and distribution of dextral displacement along the Fish Lake Valley-northern Death Valley-Furnace Creek fault zone, California-Nevada	TECTONICS												The Fish Lake Valley-northern Death Valley-Furnace Creek fault zone, a similar to 250 km long, predominantly right-lateral structure in California and Nevada, is a key element in tectonic reconstructions of the Death Valley area, Eastern California Shear Zone and Walker Lane, and central Basin and Range Province. Total displacement on the fault zone is contested, however, with estimates ranging from similar to 30 to similar to 63 km or more. Here we present a new synthesis of available constraints. Preextensional thrust faults, folds, and igneous rocks indicate that offset reaches a maximum of similar to 50 km. Neogene rocks constrain its partitioning over time. Most offset is interpreted as similar to 13-10 Ma, accruing at similar to 3-5 mm/yr in the middle of the fault zone and more slowly toward the tips. The offset markers imply similar to 68 +/- 14 km of translation between the Cottonwood Mountains and Resting Spring-Nopah Range (similar to 60 +/- 14 km since similar to 15 Ma) through a combination of strike slip and crustal extension. This suggests that a previous interpretation of similar to 104 +/- 7 km, based on the middle Miocene Eagle Mountain Formation, is an overestimate by similar to 50%. Our results also help to mitigate a discrepancy in the similar to 12-0 Ma strain budget for the Eastern California Shear Zone. Displacement has previously been estimated at similar to 100 +/- 10 km and similar to 67 +/- 6 km for the Basin and Range and Mojave portions of the shear zone, respectively. Our new estimate of similar to 74 +/- 17 km for the Basin and Range is within the uncertainty of the Mojave estimate.

Retention of Large-Format, Soft Visible Implant Alphanumeric Tags in Walleye	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We evaluated the effects of fish length, fish sex, and number of days posttagging on retention of large-format, soft visible implant (VI) alphanumeric tags that were injected underneath the clear tissue on the lower mandible of Walleyes Sander vitreus. We also evaluated whether the direction of insertion or the application of surgical-grade tissue adhesive to the tag incision site would affect tag retention. Adult Walleyes were collected with gill nets from natural lakes in Iowa during spring and then were transported to a hatchery, where they were measured, sexed, and tagged. One worker injected 752 Walleyes (mean TL = 21.8 in; SE = 0.16) with two identical VI tags; each side (left and right) of the lower mandible received one tag. Incisions were dried with a cloth, and tissue adhesive was applied to one of the two tag injection sites. Walleyes were released back into the lake and were recaptured with gill nets and by anglers. Of the 129 Walleyes recaptured up to 5years posttagging, 80 fish (62%) had retained both tags and the remaining 49 fish had retained one of the tags. Retention adjusted for fish that lost both tags (n = 8; probability = 0.09) was 58% (80 of 137). Tag retention was significantly related to fish size at the time of tagging, as smaller fish lost more tags. Consequently, males (mean TL = 20.5 in; SE = 0.39) were more likely to lose tags than females (mean TL = 24.3 in; SE = 0.26). Insertion direction, adhesive application, or the number of days posttagging at recapture did not influence VI tag retention. We recommend that in studies requiring high tag retention in Walleyes, the injection of large-format, soft VI tags into the clear tissue underneath the mandible should not be considered.

The Goldstein Peak Formation, central California: Record of a nonmarine intra-arc basin within the Early Cretaceous Sierra Nevada arc	GEOSPHERE												New mapping in the Lake Kaweah pendant of the southwestern Sierra Nevada batholith reveals a previously unrecognized nonmarine sequence of metamorphosed sedimentary and volcanic strata, defined herein as the Goldstein Peak Formation. The nonmarine origin distinguishes the Goldstein Peak Formation from all other Sierra Nevada metasedimentary pendants and from virtually all other coeval deposits associated with the Sierra Nevada arc. Basic structural relations, supplemented by new U-Pb zircon ages, suggest an Early Cretaceous depositional age, a time that is poorly represented within the stratigraphic record of California. This unusual age makes the Goldstein Peak Formation the youngest sedimentary deposit preserved within the metamorphic framework of the exhumed batholith, one that was deposited concurrently with some of the earliest deposits in the Great Valley forearc basin and just preceding the mid-Cretaceous Sierra Nevada arc surge. Preserved sedimentary and volcanic structures, along with whole-rock geochemistry, are consistent with deposition of Goldstein Peak conglomerates and sandstones within fluvial and alluvial fan environments, deposition of mud-rich sediments and air-fall tuffs within a lacustrine(?) environment, and subaqueous to subaerial extrusion of basaltic to dacitic arc volcanic rocks. This volcano-sedimentary section was intruded soon after deposition, with peak hornblende hornfels to low-pressure amphibolite facies metamorphism ultimately driven by intrusion of the surrounding Early Cretaceous Stokes Mountain ring dike complexes. Deposition of the nonmarine Goldstein Peak Formation within a fault-bounded, possibly transtensional, intra-arc basin during the transition from the low-standing, moderately extensional, Late Jurassic fringing arc to the high-standing, compressional mid- to Late Cretaceous arc indicates that at least one section of the Sierra Nevada arc was a fully emergent continental margin arc by the Early Cretaceous Epoch.

Paleochannels and their potential for artificial groundwater recharge in the western Ganga plains	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Over the last few decades, a steep general decline in the groundwater table is being observed in the western Ganga Plains (India), the average rate being about 0.15 m/year. The area comprises of dominantly vast stretches of alluvial plains within which there occur three major paleochannels of the Ganga river, characterized by serpentine-meandering pattern and having an average width of almost 4-6 km and strike length of about 60-80 km. From the point of view of artificial recharge of groundwater, the paleochannels hold a distinct promise. The paleochannel-aquifer geometry has been delineated by integrating satellite sensor and well-litholog data. The first aquifer (approximate to 25-30 m thick) in the alluvial plains is unconfined and consists of fine to medium sand whereas the second aquifer is confined. The paleochannel-aquifer is unconfined and is mainly composed of coarse sandy material along with boulder and pebbles beds and extends to a depth of about 65 m. The aquifer is well inter-connected with the adjacent alluvial aquifers. Analyses of soil samples from boreholes systematically sited on the paleochannel and its either flanks indicate that the value of hydraulic conductivity ranges from 30 to 75.3 m/day for samples falling in the paleochannel, and that between 13.5 and 22.3 m/day for the alluvial plain aquifers. The natural groundwater recharge rate due to precipitation, estimated using tritium tagging technique, is found to be 18.9-28.7% in the paleochannel area, and 6.3-8.9% in the alluvial plains. Data from stable isotopes of groundwater samples from the first unconfined aquifer indicates that the alluvial plains aquifer gets recharged by both rainfall and/or canal water, whereas rainfall is the dominant source for groundwater recharge in the paleochannel-aquifer. Monitoring of groundwater levels for 2 years (2006 and 2007), both during pre- and post-monsoon periods has been systematically carried out and it has been observed that groundwater flows away from the paleochannel in both pre- and post-monsoon periods, indicating that recharging of aquifers in alluvial plains is also through paleochannels. Thus, it may be inferred that such paleochannels can play a very important role in artificial recharge of groundwater. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	ELLIOTT, JM				ELLIOTT, JM			POPULATION REGULATION IN CONTRASTING POPULATIONS OF TROUT SALMO-TRUTTA IN 2 LAKE DISTRICT STREAMS	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												(1) The chief objective was to compare the population dynamics of Salmo trutta L. in Wilfin Beck, populated only by resident brown trout, and in Black Brows Beck which serves as a nursery for the progeny of migratory trout (a mixture of sea and estuarine trout). (2) Survivor density and loss-rates at different stages in the life cycle were strongly ''density-dependent'' on egg density in Black Brows Beck, but simple proportionate survival occurred in Wilfin Beck and loss-rates were more constant than those in Black Brows Beck. (3) Key-factor analysis showed that population density in Black Brows Beck was regulated by density-dependent survival in the early stages of the life cycle, and that there was no evidence for similar density-dependent regulation of the trout population in Wilfin Beck. (4) Summer droughts reduced survival in both populations, the effects being more marked for trout in their second year than for first-year trout. In contrast to Black Brows Beck, spates as well as droughts affected the survival of trout in Wilfin Beck and these extremes of flow were chiefly responsible for changes in population density. (5) From a discussion of the implications of this study, including possible genotypic differences between the populations, it is concluded that it provides support for Haldane''s hypothesis that changes in population density will be largely due to negative density-dependent factors in favourable areas with high density (e.g. Black Brows Beck) and to both positive density-dependent and density-independent factors in unfavourable areas with low density (e.g. Wilfin Beck), and that natural selection will be for different genotypes in the two types of habitat.																			0021-8790	1365-2656				FEB	1987	56	1					83	98		10.2307/4801	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4801													WOS:A1987F944200007

We investigated the n-alkane record of a sedimentary sequence from the Tianshui Basin, which reveals shifts in the productivity and sources of n-alkanes. The productivity of n-alkanes doubled many times during similar to 4.2-3.2 Ma, accompanied by the increased contribution from aquatic plants; in addition, non-emergent macrophytes occurred sporadically after similar to 4.2 Ma but became a significant n-alkane source after similar to 3.2 Ma. Changes in the inferred Late Miocene ecology of the region are consistent with the major climate transition in response to global cooling. The oscillations of the types and concentrations of n-alkanes during 4.2-3.2 Ma were likely related to the evolution of the East Asian monsoon (EAM), driven by the tectonic uplift of NE TP and global cooling. The major increase in aquatic plants and biological productivity of this region at similar to 3.2 Ma may have been caused by the strengthening of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) and the regional tectonic uplift.					li, fei/HJO-9520-2023															2296-6463				AUG 22	2023	11								1229346	10.3389/feart.2023.1229346	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2023.1229346													WOS:001061450800001

Survival of Whirling-Disease-Resistant Rainbow Trout Fry in the Wild: A Comparison of Two Strains	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC ANIMAL HEALTH												Introduced pathogens can affect fish populations, and three main factors affect disease occurrence: the environment, host, and pathogen. Manipulating at least one of these factors is necessary for controlling disease. Myxobolus cerebralis, the parasite responsible for salmonid whirling disease, became established in Colorado during the 1990s and caused significant declines in wild Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss populations. Attempts to re-establish Rainbow Trout have focused on manipulating salmonid host resistance. A Rainbow Trout strain known as GRxCRR was developed for stocking in Colorado by crossing a whirling-disease-resistant strain known as the German Rainbow Trout (GR) with the Colorado River Rainbow Trout (CRR). The GRxCRR fish exhibit resistance similar to that shown by GR, and survival and reproduction were expected to be similar to those of CRR. One disadvantage of stocking GRxCRR is that outcrossing and backcrossing could decrease resistance, and laboratory studies have indicated that this can occur. A potential disadvantage of stocking pure GR is lower survival due to domestication. To compare fry survival between the strains, a field experiment was conducted in 1.6-km reaches of nine Colorado streams. Each stream was stocked in August 2014 with 5,000 GRxCRR and 5,000 GR individuals. In October 2014, April 2015, and August 2015, apparent survival was assessed. Two laboratory predation experiments were also conducted. The field experiment revealed that short-term apparent survival was influenced by stream, and growth rate was influenced by strain and stream. However, after 12months, there was no difference in apparent survival or growth rate between the GR and GRxCRR strains. Laboratory experiments showed that survival did not differ between the strains when confronted with Brown Trout Salmo trutta predation. Our results indicate that the GR strain is a viable option for stocking in streams where M. cerebralis is enzootic. Further evaluation is needed to determine whether GR fish will survive to maturity and reproduce.

J	Koehler, RD				Koehler, Rich D.			Active faulting in the North Valleys region of Reno, Nevada: A distributed zone within the northern Walker Lane	GEOMORPHOLOGY					7th PATA Days Workshop on Paleoseismology, Active Tectonics, and Archaeoseismology	MAY 30-JUN 04, 2016	Crestone, CO					At the latitude of Reno, Nevada, USA, similar to 15-25% of the Pacific/North American plate boundary strain is accommodated east of the Sierra Nevada through a combination of normal oblique (dextral) slip along the eastern Sierra Nevada range front and dextral slip along faults in the northern Walker Lane. The North Valleys region sits within the northern Walker Lane directly east of the Sierra range front and is characterized by a series of small north striking basins bound by Quaternary active faults that accommodate dextral oblique extension. Geodetic studies of the North Valleys estimate that the faults collectively accommodate 0.9-1.7 mm/y of extension and <0.3 mm/y of dextral slip; however, few Quaternary geologic/paleoseismic studies have been conducted. In this paper, geologic observations on the tectonic geomorphic expression and relative activity of faults within and bounding the North Valleys are described, including the Last Chance, Petersen Mountain, Fred's Mountain, and Spanish Springs Valley fault zones, and several un-named faults in Lemmon and Hungry valleys. Geologic observations from the interpretation of lidar-derived hillshade images, aerial photographs, satellite imagery, and field reconnaissance indicate that the faults all exhibit evidence of late Quaternary deformation, including offset alluvial fan deposits and abrupt range-front escarpments. The results indicate that the faults of the North Valleys are capable seismic sources characterized by extension rates on the order of hundredths to tenths of millimeters per year. The faults act to transfer slip from the Sierra Nevada range front to the northeastern Walker Lane by accommodating dextral oblique extension consistent with pull-apart basin kinematics within a simple shear right-lateral system.
