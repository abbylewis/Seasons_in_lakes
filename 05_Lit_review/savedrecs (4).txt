Fish population structure and typology in three ancients arms of the Garonne river	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												A study of the structure and typology of the fish populations in three ancient arms of the Garonne river was performed during the period 1988 to 1990. Fish were sampled using two complementary methods, regular abundance sampling using electro-fishing of spot samples (E.P.A.) and using nets. The samples obtained through E.P.A make up the bulk of the data used in this study. The fish populations in the three ancient arms, which are generally similar, are dominated by the cyprinids. These ancient arms, all having direct access to the river, explain the important interactions and frequent migrations of populations from ancient arm to river and vice versa. The species in these ancient arms are comprised of different size classes each one corresponding to the different stages of development of the fish. Relationships between the presence of each species at a certain life stage and seasonal changes in environmental characteristics were studied. A correspondence analysis between species interactions helped to identify three spatial groups (i.e., corresponding to habitats) of fish populations. The bitterlings as well as cyprinid juveniles prefer the shallow littoral zones with fine sand-mud substrates near aquatic vegetation. Zones with semi-submerged aquatic plants offer a favorable habitat for the small carnivorous species such as the sunfish and juveniles of perch and black-bass. Moderately sloped ancient arm banks and zones of deeper water along walled banks of gravel substrates favour adult populations. Abundances of species from these three spatial groups depend upon the seasonal changes. However, three important tendencies had been identified, these are : summer and autumn recruitment of juveniles in the ancient arms, winter abundance of immature cyprinids and the preponderance of adults in spring.					lim, pascal/D-3422-2012; Bengen, Dietriech/AAK-6008-2020														0003-4088	2100-000X				JAN	1992	28	1					35	56		10.1051/limn/1992003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/1992003													WOS:000208073200004

Effects of conversion of coastal marshes to aquaculture ponds on sediment anaerobic CO2 production and emission in a subtropical estuary of China	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The extensive conversion of carbon-rich coastal wetland to aquaculture ponds in the Asian Pacific region has caused significant changes to the sediment properties and carbon cycling. Using field sampling and incubation experiments, the sediment anaerobic CO2 production and CO2 emission flux were compared between a brackish marsh and the nearby constructed aquaculture ponds in the Min River Estuary in southeastern China over a three-year period. Marsh sediment had a higher total carbon and lower C:N ratio than aquaculture pond sediment, suggesting the importance of marsh vegetation in supplying labile organic carbon to the sediment. Conversion to aquaculture ponds significantly decreased sediment anaerobic CO2 production rates by 69.2% compared to the brackish marsh, but increased CO2 emission, turning the CO2 sink (-490.8 & PLUSMN; 42.0 mg m- 2 h-1 in brackish marsh) into a source (6.2 & PLUSMN; 3.9 mg m- 2 h-1 in aquaculture pond). Clipping the marsh vegetation resulted in the highest CO2 emission flux (382.6 & PLUSMN; 46.7 mg m- 2 h-1), highlighting the critical role of marsh vegetation in capturing and sequestering carbon. Sediment anaerobic CO2 production and CO2 uptake (in brackish marsh) and emission (in aquaculture ponds) were highest in the summer, followed by autumn, spring and winter. Redundancy analysis and structural equation modeling showed that the changes of sediment temperature, salinity and total carbon content accounted for more than 50% of the variance in CO2 production and emission. Overall, the results indicate that vegetation clearing was the main cause of change in CO2 production and emission in the land conversion, and marsh replantation should be a primary strategy to mitigate the climate impact of the aquaculture sector.					; Lai, Derrick/B-1387-2009	Tan, Lishan/0000-0002-9714-1728; yang, ping/0000-0002-5212-6065; 													0301-4797	1095-8630				JUL 15	2023	338								117813	10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.117813	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.117813		MAR 2023						36996562					WOS:001054132900001

Determining Critical Nutrient Thresholds Needed to Control Harmful Cyanobacterial Blooms in Eutrophic Lake Taihu, China	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Nutrient overenrichment has led to dramatic increases in harmful cyanobacterial blooms, creating serious threats to drinking water supplies, ecological and economic sustainability of freshwater ecosystems. Nutrient-cyanobacterial bloom interactions were examined in eutrophic Lake Taihu, China. In situ microcosm nutrient dilution bioassays and mesocosm nutrient addition experiments were conducted to determine nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentration and load thresholds needed to control cyanobacterial bloom formation. Blooms were dominated by toxic, non N-2 fixing Microcystis spp, from May to December. Dilution bioassays showed seasonality in nutrient limitation, with P-availability controlling prebloom spring conditions and N-availability controlling summer-fall blooms. Nutrient dilution and enrichment bioassays indicated that total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentration thresholds should be targeted at below 0.80 mg L-1 and 0.05 mg L-1, respectively, to limit intrinsic growth rates of Microcystis dominated blooms. Based on estimates of nutrient loading and observed stoichiometry of phytoplankton biomass, 61-71% TN and 20-46% TP reduction are necessary to bring Taihus phytoplankton biomass to acceptable sub-bloom conditions of less than 20 mu g L-1 chlorophyll a.

Temporal trends in Lake Erie plankton biomass: Roles of external phosphorus loading and dreissenid mussels	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We compare the results of lakewide plankton studies conducted during 1996-2002 with data reported in the literature from previous years to evaluate the effectiveness of continued nutrient control, the relationship between external phosphorus loading and plankton abundance, and the many predicted outcomes of the dreissenid invasion. We found that although recent external annual phosphorus loading has not changed since reaching mandated target levels in the early- to mid-1980s, phytoplankton communities have. Total phytoplankton biomass, measured through enumeration and size-frequency distributions, has increased since minima were observed in 1996 or 1997, with summer (July-September) biomasses generally greater than before the dreissenid establishment in the late 1980s. Cyanobacteria biomass also increased during summer in all basins after the dreissenid invasion. In contrast, chlorophyll a concentration has decreased in all basins during both spring and summer. However chlorophyll a concentration was poorly correlated with total phytoplankton biomass. Relative to the mid-1980s, crustacean zooplankton biomass during the years 1996-2002 increased in the western basin during spring and summer, increased in the central basin during spring but remained the same during summer, and decreased to low levels in the eastern basin. Several of these observations are consistent with predictions made by previous researchers on the effects of reduced total external phosphorus loading and the stimulatory or inhibitory effects of dreissenid mussels. However, several were not. Results from this study, particularly the inconsistencies with. tested predictions, highlight the need for further research into the factors that regulate plankton community dynamics in Lake Erie.

Rotifer dynamics in three shallow lakes from the Salado river watershed (Argentina): the potential modulating role of incident solar radiation	PHOTOCHEMICAL & PHOTOBIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												In turbid Pampean lakes, incident solar radiation is a major driver of plankton seasonal dynamics. Higher light availability in summer translates into higher primary production, and therefore more food for zooplankton grazers. However, experimental evidence suggests that food produced under the high irradiance conditions prevailing in summer are less suitable to sustain rotifer population growth than that produced under the lower irradiance conditions typical of winter. Here, we analysed time series datasets corresponding to three shallow lakes from the Salado river watershed. This analysis provided evidence for similar seasonal patterns of rotifer relative abundance over a large geographic area. In addition, we performed life table experiments to test the hypothesis that natural seston produced in winter could sustain higher population growth rates than seston produced in summer. We suggest that the natural seasonal changes in temperature and food generate successive time windows, which may be capitalized by the different grazer species, resulting in predictable phenology of grazer populations.					; ARMANDO, RENNELLA/AAL-6263-2021	Zagarese, Horacio/0000-0001-6588-5960; Diovisalvi, Nadia/0000-0002-1054-8323; 													1474-905X	1474-9092					2015	14	11					2007	2013		10.1039/c5pp00125k	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5pp00125k								26416592					WOS:000364085000010

Seasonal Diet Changes and Trophic Links of Cold-Water Fish (Coregonus albula) within a Northern Lake Ecosystem	ANIMALS												Simple Summary: Climate change in the high latitudes may endanger cold-water fish that have adapted to the low water temperatures and long winters. Northern oligotrophic lakes, with their naturally sparse food basis for fish, may be especially vulnerable to climate change. However, many aspects of northern fish food ecology have received little attention. We evaluated the dietary habits, trophic positions, and food web interactions of the European vendace, which is regarded as one of the most vulnerable commercial fishes due to modern environmental changes. Using two analyses, fish stomach content and stable isotopes (carbon and nitrogen), we tracked the flow of nutrients through the food web of an example lake (at the White Sea basin) and determined the vendace's main food sources. In spite of clear seasonal differences in the food preferences of vendace, we determined planktonic copepods to be its key energy (carbon) source. The vendace has also adapted to consume its own embryos during the winter, increasing its trophic position in the lake food web. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the vendace's feeding habits, its ability to adapt to low-trophic supplies, and the effects of environmental change. The seasonal feeding patterns of the cold-adapted fish, Coregonus albula, are poorly studied in high-latitude lakes but could provide insight for predicting the effects of global warming. We examined vendace's diet composition, traced the carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios from producers to consumers in the food web, and estimated vendace's trophic position in a subarctic lake (the White Sea basin). Results showed the vendace to be a typical euryphagous fish, but clear seasonal differences were found in the relative importance of plankton and benthos in the diet. The vendace consumed primarily benthic amphipods in the summer, planktonic cladocerans in the autumn, and copepods in the winter-spring (under ice); larvae of aquatic insects were the second-most important food items throughout the year. Because of the substantial proportion of fish embryos in its diet, the vendace had a trophic position similar to that of a predatory fish (perch). The Bayesian food source-mixing model revealed that the majority of vendace energy derives from planktonic copepods. The dominant Cyclops had the lowest carbon isotope values, suggesting a carbon-depleted diet typical for methanotrophic bacteria, as its probable food source was in a lake under ice. Understanding the feeding patterns of vendace provides information to better predict the potential biotic effects of environmental change on lake ecosystems.

Monitoring Chla concentration (C-Chla ) and understanding the interactions between C-Chla and related environmental factors (hydrological and meteorological conditions, nutrients enrichment, etc.) are necessary for assessing and managing water quality and eutrophication. An acceptable Landsat 8 OLI-based empirical algorithm for C-Chla has been developed and validated, with a mean absolute percentage error of 14.05% and a root mean square error of 1.10 mu g L-1. A time series of remotely estimated C-Chla was developed from 2013 to 2015 and examined the relationship of C (Chla) to inflow rate, rainfall, temperature, and sunshine duration. Spatially, C (Chla) values in the riverine zone were higher than in the transition and lacustrine zones. Temporally, mean C-Chla value were ranked as spring > summer > autumn > winter. A significant positive correlation [Pearson correlation coefficient (r) = 0.88, p < 0.001] was observed between the inflow rate and mean C-Chla in the northwest segment of the Xin'anjiang Reservoir. However, no significant relation was observed between mean C-Chla and meteorological conditions. Mean (+/- standard deviation) value for the ratio of total nitrogen concentration to total phosphorus concentration in our in situ dataset is 75.75 +/- 55.72. This result supports that phosphorus is the restrictive factor to algal growth in Xin'anjiang Reservoir. In addition, the response of nutrients to Chla has spatial variabilities. Current results show the potential of Landsat 8 OLI data for estimating Chla in slight turbid reservoir and indicate that external pollution loading is an important driving force for the Chla spatiotemporal variability.					; Liu, Xiaohan/AGS-6555-2022; Zhang, Yunlin/N-5464-2014; Shi, Kun/O-2638-2013; , 张一波/AAY-5453-2020; Guo, Yulong/AAW-6008-2021	Zhang, Yibo/0000-0001-5542-2495; Li, Yuan/0000-0003-0381-2605; Zhang, Yunlin/0000-0002-3382-4570; Shi, Kun/0000-0002-6124-7512; Zhou, Yongqiang/0000-0003-1402-345X; Guo, Yulong/0000-0002-6146-1949; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				JAN	2018	25	2					1359	1374		10.1007/s11356-017-0536-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-0536-7								29090433					WOS:000419944100035

Seasonal movements of adult Gizzard Shad Dorosoma cepedianum in a Missouri River reservoir	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Gizzard Shad Dorosoma cepedianum are important for nutrient cycling and can affect water clarity, plankton densities, and fish production levels. Gizzard Shad can also be crucial prey fish for recreationally important species such as Walleye Sander vitreus and Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu. Lake Sharpe, a mainstem Missouri River reservoir located in central South Dakota, supports a recreationally important Walleye and Smallmouth Bass fishery with Gizzard Shad being the primary prey fish. Previous work suggested Hipple Lake, a backwater embayment of Lake Sharpe, may be an important overwinter location for Gizzard Shad; however, movement of Gizzard Shad between Lake Sharpe and Hipple Lake is unknown. To understand movement of Gizzard Shad, 40 adults (20 in 2014 and 20 in 2015) were implanted with acoustic telemetry tags. Passive receivers determined movement patterns and fish locations. Analysis included 28 individuals due to removal of mortalities and other restrictions. Tagged individuals were at large in Lake Sharpe from May 5, 2014 through April 11, 2017. Over 50% of tagged Gizzard Shad overwintered in Hipple Lake. Gizzard Shad moved larger distances in the summer (average 1.5 rkm/day) and fall (average 1.75 rkm/day) months but did not move substantially during winter (average 0.42 rkm/day) and spring (average 0.37 rkm/day) months. Overall, Hipple Lake appears to be an important habitat for Gizzard Shad within Lake Sharpe and should be prioritized for habitat conservation as connectivity between Hipple Lake and Lake Sharpe is being lost through siltation and emergent vegetation growth.

Two surveys (May and August 2017) covering the entire Gyeonggi Bay (15 sites) and twelve surveys over four seasons (February, May, August, and November of 2016-2018) covering the Incheon Special Management Area (7 sites) were carried out to collect surface seawaters. Three surveys (January, April, and August of 2015) were also performed to collect seawater samples at Shihwa Lake (16 sites). Although the concentration gradients of nutrient type heavy metals (e.g. copper, nickel, zinc, and cadmium) corresponded to patterns of salinity in both dry and wet seasons, there was little seasonal variability over the three years studied. However, there was evidence that heavy metals were released during mixing with freshwaters in the wet season, likely from river outflow or direct coastal inputs such as effluents from Shihwa Lake. For nutrients, whereas the conservative mixing of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and the release of dissolved inorganic phosphate and dissolved silica were observed in the wet season, the concentrations of organic particles (e.g., chlorophyll-a, particulate organic carbon, and particulate organic nitrogen) had an inverse relationship with salinity in the dry season (May). Scavenged metals (e.g., manganese and cobalt) had non-freshwater coastal sources, such as benthic remobilization from suboxic sediments, and exhibited seasonal variation; they progressively increased in concentration from winter to spring and summer, and dropped to their minimum levels in the fall, which was presumably related to variation in microbial activity in sediments. Based on their relationship with salinity, heavy metals were deduced to be derived from coastal sources such as effluents from Shihwa Lake and freshwater from the Han River.																			1738-5261	2005-7172				MAR	2020	55	1					69	84		10.1007/s12601-020-0002-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12601-020-0002-1		JAN 2020											WOS:000510096600001

Hence, the seasonal changes in the fatty acid (FA) profile of Viviparus contectus caught from Demirkopru Dam Lake were determined in this study. Saturated fatty acid (SFAs) (64.54-80.39% of total fatty acids) had the highest concentration followed by polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (10.63-21.83%) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) (6.57-10.13%). Stearic acid (C18:0) was the major SFA while arachidonic acid (C20:4 n-6) was the major PUFA. The season significantly affected the FA profile of V. contectus while no significant difference was determined between seasons with respect to tissue MUFAs levels. A higher level of total SFAs was detected during spring (80.39%) while a higher proportion of MUFAs was detected during the winter (10.13%). The total amounts of PUFAs were highest in winter (21.83%). Overall, V. contectus has nutritional value. However, V. contectus caught in autumn may be nutritionally the most valuable for human consumption due to higher eicosapentaenoic acid 20:5 n-3 and docosahexaenoic acid contents.

J	Elliott, JA				Elliott, J. Alex			The seasonal sensitivity of Cyanobacteria and other phytoplankton to changes in flushing rate and water temperature	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												The phytoplankton lake community model PROTECH (Phytoplankton RespOnses To Environmental CHange) was applied to the eutrophic lake, Esthwaite Water (United Kingdom). It was validated against monitoring data from 2003 and simulated well the seasonal pattern of total chlorophyll, diatom chlorophyll and Cyanobacteria chlorophyll with respective R2-values calculated between observed and simulated of 0.68, 0.72 and 0.77 (all P < 0.01). This simulation was then rerun through various combinations of factorized changes covering a range of half to double the flushing rate and from -1 to +4 degrees C changes in water temperature. Their effect on the phytoplankton was measured as annual, spring, summer and autumn means of the total and species chlorophyll concentrations. In addition, Cyanobacteria mean percentage abundance (%Cb) and maximum percentage abundance (Max %Cb) was recorded, as were the number of days that Cyanobacteria chlorophyll concentration exceed two World Health Organization (WHO) derived risk thresholds (10 and 50 mg m-3). The phytoplankton community was dominated in the year by three of the eight phytoplankton simulated. The vernal bloom of the diatom Asterionella showed little annual or seasonal response to the changing drivers but this was not the case for the two Cyanobacteria that also dominated, Anabaena and Aphanizomenon. These Cyanobacteria showed enhanced abundance, community dominance and increased duration above the highest WHO risk threshold with increasing water temperature and decreasing flushing rate: this effect was greatest in the summer period. However, the response was ultimately controlled by the availability of nutrients, particularly phosphorus and nitrogen, with occasional declines in the latter's concentration helping the dominance of these nitrogen-fixing phytoplankton.

J	Cui, LL; Wang, J				Cui, Lili; Wang, Jun			Persistent Halogenated Organic Pollutants in Surface Water in a Megacity: Distribution Characteristics and Ecological Risks in Wuhan, China	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												Surface water pollution in megacities is strongly linked to human and environmental health, and surface water quality has deteriorated sharply recently because of increasing persistent halogenated organic pollutant (HOP) concentrations. In the present study, we collected 112 water samples from 14 lakes and 11 drinking water sources in Wuhan, China, and analyzed them for two typical groups of HOPs: polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). The mean values of the sigma PCB concentrations were 4.34 and 10.05ng L-1 in winter and summer, respectively. For sigma PBDE concentrations, the mean values were 0.88 and 1.53ng L-1 in winter and summer, respectively. The PCB and PBDE concentrations at most sites in summer were significantly higher than those in winter, probably because of heavy stormwater runoff in summer. The degree of urbanization predicted from the population density was positively correlated with sigma PCB concentrations in the drinking water sources in summer. PBDE and PCB composition analysis suggested the major sources were penta-BDE and Aroclor mixtures. Risk assessments showed the PBDEs in water from the Zhuankou site exceeded the threshold set by the European Union, which could result in adverse effects on aquatic organisms. Negligible noncarcinogenic risks were found for PCBs and PBDEs in the surface water with regard to drinking and bathing. However, the carcinogenic risks of PCBs for bathing in surface water were higher than the safe level of 1.00x10(-6), implying that the surface water in Wuhan is not safe for bathing.

This study reconstructed the Asian monsoon and climatic evolution in SAYR since 6.1 cal (cal = the calendar year, as below) ka BP in the mid-late Holocene using geochemical parameters (i.e., SiO2/[RO+R2O], SiO2/Al2O3, SiO2/TiO2, SiO2/[Al2O3 + Fe2O3], chemical index of alteration (Al2O3/[Al2O3 + CaO* + Na2O + K2O]), chemical index of weathering (Al2O3/[Al2O3 + CaO* + Na2O]), [CaO + K2O + Na2O]/Al2O3 and K/Na ratios) of peat deposits and AMS C-14 chronology. The climate was warm and humid between 6.1 and 5.4 cal ka BP, with weak winter monsoon intensity and strong summer monsoon intensity, and accompanied by strong chemical weathering and leaching. From 5.4 to 1.5 cal ka BP, the climate was relatively cold and dry with enhanced winter monsoon and weakened summer monsoon intensities. During 1.5 and 0.8 cal ka BP, with the winter and summer monsoon changing rapidly, lower winter monsoon intensity, higher summer monsoon intensity, and higher chemical weathering and leaching since 6.1 cal ka BP indicated a warm and humid regional climate. It has been relatively cold and dry as a whole, with a trend of being warm and wet, since 0.8 cal ka BP, accompanied by gradually weakened winter monsoon intensity, gradually enhanced summer monsoon intensity, and gradually enhanced chemical weathering and leaching. The Asian monsoon and climatic evolution process in SAYR is highly unstable and has undergone centennial-millennial scale oscillations since 6.1 cal ka BP. Also, six phases at 6.1-5.9, 4.5-4.2, 2.7-2.4, 1.9-1.7, 1.5-1.4, and 0.6-0.4 cal ka BP correspond with cold events recorded by peat and lacustrine deposits and ice cores on the northeastern and eastern TP and with deep-sea sediments in high-latitude regions in the Northern Hemisphere. The results show that climate change in SAYR on the northeastern TP has been consistent with global climate change since the mid-late Holocene.

The phosphorus measured as total phosphorus (TP) in digested aqueous extracts showed an exponential increase with daily temperature (R2 = 0.544, N = 474), with the best correlation observed for the 2010 subset (R2 = 0.727, N = 55). The temperature correlation was not observed with the total suspended particles (TSP). Longer dry periods during spring to summer months favored a higher P level on aerosols. The temperature and precipitation pattern dependence indicate a possible climate change influence on the aerosol P levels. The unchanged yearly aerosol TP content does not directly reflect the dropping trend observed in surface water after 1990s from the same area during spring to summer period.

MODERN PRECIPITATION	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Over a 7-year period from April 1982 to April 1989, integrated samples of rain and snow were collected at 32 sites by oil-sealed storage gage stations in (and adjoining) the southeast California desert; station elevations ranged from -65 m to 2280 m, and the collection network covered an area measuring about 400 km in each dimension. Deuterium (delta-D) analysis of 406 samples shows that the average delta-D of summer precipitation was -56 per mil (parts per thousand), whereas winter values averaged -78 parts per thousand; averaged annual values were close to -69 parts per thousand because most of the area is in a winter-dominated precipitation regime. We found no correlation between wetness or dryness of a season and the delta-D of its precipitation. The delta-O-18 versus delta-D plots show that rain samples define a tine of slope 6.5, less than the 8 of the Meteoric Water Line, whereas snow samples define a tine of slope 9.2. These differences in slope are the result of isotopic fractionation which occurred during evaporation of raindrops but not during sublimation of snow. Trajectory plots of 68 of the major storm events show that all of the winter storms originated in the Pacific, and passed over high mountains before reaching our collection stations. However, 21 of the 30 summer storms had trajectories that originated either over the Gulf of Mexico or the subtropical Pacific and traveled either west or north to reach our stations, without traversing high mountains. The difference in delta-D between winter and summer precipitation is due to different air flow patterns during those seasons.																			2169-897X					APR 20	1992	97	D5					5795	5812		10.1029/92JD00184	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/92JD00184													WOS:A1992HQ64400001
J	Pine, WE III; Ludsin, SA; DeVries, DR				Pine, WE III; Ludsin, SA; DeVries, DR			First-summer survival of largemouth bass cohorts: Is early spawning really best?	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Previous work has demonstrated that survival of largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides through the first year of life can be size dependent, favoring larger individuals. Because size, diet biomass, lipid accumulation, and ultimately overwinter survival of juveniles are typically positively related to age, early spawning is clearly advantageous. However, a true understanding of which largemouth bass cohorts contribute to the new year-class remains somewhat unclear because these conclusions have largely been based upon fish collected during summer rather than fish collected during spring. Conceivably, even earlier hatched cohorts of largemouth bass could have existed in many of these studies, and these fish may simply not have survived to the summer collection period. In order to assess this possibility, we quantified first-summer survival of largemouth bass cohorts collected during 1992 and 1993 in Auburn, Alabama, ponds (which were 2-5 ha each). Our results indicate that it is early-hatched cohorts that likely contribute to the new year-class. Although we found that early-hatched cohorts were lost between May and July, these losses were not attributable to age-dependent mortality; instead, sampling biases associated with avoidance of seines by older, larger young-of-year largemouth bass appear to have driven these shifts. In addition, because we found that size-dependent cannibalism during summer acted to remove smaller, later-hatched largemouth bass, early hatching may enhance survival during larval and early juvenile stages in southern systems (and not just during the winter period). Given this information, fishery managers may potentially be able to implement harvest regulations that are designed to protect large, early-spawning adults, thereby increasing the probability of producing a strong year-class by enhancing first-summer growth and, ultimately, recruitment to adult stages.

In arid zone reservoirs, the inflow and outflow discharges have extreme seasonal variations which produce well-defined cycles of filling and draining. Moreover, since stratification often occurs, epilimnion and hypolimnion renewal rates may vary producing different environmental conditions throughout the water column. These variation patterns may affect phytoplankton growth at both temporal and spatial scales. For two hydrological years, we analyzed the influence of light climate, nutrients, residence time (Tw), and stratification on phytoplankton biomass (as chlorophyll-a [Chl-a]) in an irrigation reservoir (276hm(3)) in the arid central Andes in Argentina (33 degrees S). The reservoir was turbid (Z(Secchi): 1.4m) with relatively high levels of dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus (60gPL(-1) and 560gNL(-1), respectively). Stratification occurred from mid-spring to late-summer, when hypolimnetic oxygen and pH decreased whereas dissolved nutrients increased. The reservoir was mesotrophic (Chl-a: 4.6-10.8gL(-1)) and showed two semi-annual peaks of Chl-a (summer and winter). Depending on the water column circulation, Chl-a was directly related to Tw for 60>Tw>200 and inversely to ammonia, during mixing and stratification periods, respectively. Phytoplankton development was strongly influenced by the seasonal variations of inflow/outflow and stratification. Chl-a peaked in summer, when inflow plunged into the hypolimnion of the stratified reservoir and in the warm and mixed epilimnion algae proliferated until nutrients depletion. Alternatively, the winter Chl-a maximum is likely to be produced by the higher concentration of nutrients combined with the turbulent mixing in the water column which acts as a mechanism that helps to overcome light-limitation. Since stratification modifies the vertical distribution of Tw, the use of a single annual value of this hydraulic parameter to assess its effect on the reservoir trophic state results inadequate. This paper constitutes the first description of hydrologic effects on Chl-a dynamics in a reservoir in arid central western Argentina.

Internal Phosphorus Storage in Two Headwater Agricultural Streams in the Lake Erie Basin	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Internal phosphorus (P) in sediments plays an important role in the nutrient dynamics of lakes, sometimes long after external loads have been reduced. Similarly, internal P sources may drive the nutrient dynamics of small agricultural streams that drain to larger rivers and lakes, despite best management practices intended to reduce external P loads from adjacent fields. Here, internal P concentrations were measured with sequential extraction on cores collected in spring and summer from two small agricultural streams in the drainage basin of Lake Erie, a large, eutrophic lake experiencing increasing SRP loads. Average total extractable P concentrations were similar to within 5% during spring and summer, but mobile P binding fractions nearly doubled in summer, possibly due to accelerated rates of organic matter mineralization or iron reduction beneath suboxic, stagnant surface waters. One site had chronically greater internal P concentrations by 25-75%, despite the implementation of best management practices such as grass buffers. The site also had more aquatic vegetation that restricted the flow, less dissolved oxygen in surface water, and greater organic matter in sediments during both seasons, suggesting that variations in hydrology, sediment composition, and vegetation influence hot spots of P retention throughout small agricultural streams.

Changes in air temperature, but not in precipitation, determine long-term trends in water chemistry of high mountain lakes of the Alps with and without rock glacier influence	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Climate change has strongly affected lakes around the world, but the relative effects of warmer air temperatures and changing precipitation on the water chemistry of alpine systems are not well understood. Here we tested the effect of monthly and seasonal climate on the water chemistry of six high mountain lakes located in the Alps. From 1982 to 2020, water samples were collected annually from different depths during the autumn mixing. We observed a simultaneous increase in electrical conductivity, ionic content, and pH with air temperature. In lakes with rock glacier influence, the increase in conductivity, ionic content, and especially in sulfate was even more pronounced, but accompanied by a strong decrease in pH. These differences are attributed to the direct influence of acidic meltwater from active rock glaciers in catchments with acidic bedrock. We then analyzed changes in lake chemistry, taking into account seasonal trends in air temperature and precipitation, using redundancy analysis. Temperature increase significantly affected water chemistry in five of the six lakes, especially at times of ice breakup. Increasing warming explained 17% to 32% of the changes in electrical conductivity, alkalinity, pH, major ions, and nitrogen. In contrast, precipitation had little effect on the changes of those parameters. Nevertheless, late spring snowfall and high snowfall in early fall, which result in prolonged ice cover, had a dampening effect on the impact of climate warming on lake chemistry. Our results confirm that climate warming remains a major driver of chemical changes in alpine lakes, but provide new evidence that late spring temperatures are the most important triggers.

Declines have occurred in Jiangxi, but most markedly in Hunan (predominantly at East Dongting Lake) where the decline has been steady since 2003/2004, with few left from 2008/2009 onwards. Numbers have increased substantially in Anhui (predominantly at Shengjin Lake), which now supports more Greater White-fronted Geese than Jiangxi and Hunan combined. The species appears a habitat specialist in China, confined to grazing short-sward recessional Carex sedge meadows. At East Dongting Lake, reductions in Greater White-fronted Geese numbers correlated with declines in availability of suitable sedge swards, caused by earlier water table recession, which in recent years has meant swards were too tall for geese to utilise from their arrival in autumn. The hydrological changes are most probably due to the commissioning of the Three Gorges Darn in mid-2003. At Shengjin Lake, the increases may be due to recent stable first exposure dates and slow water recession rates which favour short Carex swards attractive to geese; high buffalo grazing density at this lake may also assist in maintaining suitable sward heights. These hypotheses require investigation.

J	Labe, Z; Ault, T; Zurita-Milla, R				Labe, Zachary; Ault, Toby; Zurita-Milla, Raul			Identifying anomalously early spring onsets in the CESM large ensemble project	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												Seasonal transitions from winter to spring impact a wide variety of ecological and physical systems. While the effects of early springs across North America are widely documented, changes in their frequency and likelihood under the combined influences of climate change and natural variability are poorly understood. Extremely early springs, such as March 2012, can lead to severe economical losses and agricultural damage when these are followed by hard freeze events. Here we use the new Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble project and Extended Spring Indices to simulate historical and future spring onsets across the United States and in the particular the Great Lakes region. We found a marked increase in the frequency of March 2012-like springs by midcentury in addition to an overall trend towards earlier spring onsets, which nearly doubles that of observational records. However, changes in the date of last freeze do not occur at the same rate, therefore, causing a potential increase in the threat of plant tissue damage. Although large-scale climate modes, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, have previously dominated decadal to multidecadal spring onset trends, our results indicate a decreased role in natural climate variability and hence a greater forced response by the end of the century for modulating trends. Without a major reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, our study suggests that years like 2012 in the US could become normal by mid-century.

Their spatial and temporal distributions in relation to environmental variables and fish composition were the aims of this study. Both benthic groups of organisms were studied at 10 sites covering the whole area of Lake Qarun. Total of 164 algae species belonging to phyla: Cyanobacteria, Bacillariophyta, Miozoa (previously Dinophyta), Chlorophyta, Cryptophyta, Ochrophyta and Euglenozoa (previously Euglenophyta) were recorded. Macroinvertebrates communities consisted of 16 species representing phyla: Arthropoda, Annelida and Mollusca. The highest densities of benthic algae and macroinvertebrates were recorded in the middle sub-region of the lake in line with the co-domination of tilapias, mullets, soles and anchovy, whereas their lowest density at site 1 in the eastern area. The sites primarily located in the western sub-region with higher density of benthic organisms and domination of Mugil cephalus were distinctly separated from the other sites. Similar trend was in distribution of chlorophyll a content, which strongly correlated with density of benthic algae. Temporal distribution indicated higher algae density in spring and summer, and higher macroinvertebrates density in spring and autumn. The fish community' composition was spatially and temporally different and environmental variables were more similarly distributed.

In this natural aquarium, seasonal changes in the zooplankton community structure were evaluated in terms of species composition and abundance for the first time and a total of 34 taxa were identified, 29 of them belonging to Rotifera, 3 Cladocera and 2 Copepoda. Two of these rotifers Lecane thienemanni (Hauer, 1938) and Notommata glyfura Wulfert, 1 935 are new records for Turkey. In addition, L. thienemanni is new for Western Asia. The species richness was high in summer. Total abundance ranged from 941-23.312 ind. m(-3), exhibiting a major peak in early spring and a minor one in early autumn. In terms of density, Rotifera dominated with 63%, followed by Copepoda with 33% and Cladocera with 4%. Predation pressure from fish, high temperatures and low oxygen values had significant impacts on zooplankton composition and abundance, especially for the crustacean community.

Seasonal contributions of water and pollutants to Lake St. Charles, a drinking water reservoir	CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL												Surface waters are widely used as sources of drinking water in Canada. The identification of the main sources of pollutants to surface waters, often associated with increasing urbanization, is needed to improve management strategies. We used stable water isotopes (delta O-18 and delta D), and nutrient and fecal coliform mass fluxes to estimate the seasonal contributions of water and pollutants of different inflows to Lake St. Charles (LSC). Our results indicate that out of six identified LSC water sources, groundwater (GW), Hurons River (HR) and small stream tributaries (SSTs) represent the major contributors (in terms of water volume). The three other water sources, including two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), Delage Lake (DL) and precipitation (rain and snow), represent smaller seasonal contributions. During the high-flow seasons (spring and fall), LSC receives water mainly from SSTs and HR, while during the low-flow season (summer), the lake relies mainly on GW inflows. Estimates of point source (WWTPs) versus non-point source (primarily septic installations) concentrations of nutrients and fecal coliforms show that the latter represents a seasonally variable and greater source of pollutants (5% WWTPs vs. 95% septic installations). HR and SSTs, draining densely occupied areas of single housing units with individual septic installations, are categorized as non-point sources, and as such are considered major nutrient and fecal coliform contributors. The higher precipitation in spring and fall caused increased fluxes of nutrients and fecal coliforms through higher stream discharge. Due to the seasonally variable and difficult to predict discharge dynamics of SSTs and HR, these two sources represent a potentially larger threat to LSC water quality. We advocate that improved management requires reducing the number of individual septic installations in the LSC watershed.

Impact of salinization on lake stratification and spring mixing	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS												Anthropogenic freshwater salinization affects thousands of lakes worldwide, and yet little is known about how salt loading may shift timing of lake stratification and spring mixing in dimictic lakes. Here, we investigate the impact of salinization on mixing in Lakes Mendota and Monona, Wisconsin, by deploying under-ice buoys to record salinity gradients, using an analytical approach to quantify salinity thresholds that prevent spring mixing, and running an ensemble of vertical one-dimensional hydrodynamic lake models (GLM, GOTM, and Simstrat) to investigate the long-term impact of winter salt loading on mixing and stratification. We found that spring salinity gradients between surface and bottom waters persist up to a month after ice-off, and that theory predicts a salinity gradient of 1.3-1.4 g kg(-1) would prevent spring mixing. Numerical models project that salt loading delays spring mixing and increases water column stability, with ramifications for oxygenation of bottom waters, biogeochemistry, and lake habitability.					; rock, l/GRF-6369-2022	Rock, Linnea/0000-0001-7330-3625; Ladwig, Robert/0000-0001-8443-1999; 														2378-2242				FEB	2023	8	1					93	102		10.1002/lol2.10215	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lol2.10215		OCT 2021											WOS:000702757300001

The forcing of Asian monsoons on Holocene productivity remains debated in north AS, an area influenced by summer and winter monsoon. A sediment core from Makran margin was utilized to analyze organic biomarkers and high-resolution bromine intensities, unveiling the forces of biological productivity through the past 8000 years. Alkenone sea surface temperature (SST) records show significant cooling in north AS and augmented SST difference between north and west AS toward the late Holocene, suggesting Asian winter monsoon (AWM) strengthening during the period. The Holocene productivity signals in north AS, indicated by the bromine to rubidium ratio and multiple biomarkers, are responsive to SST changes and thus mainly controlled by the AWM variation, not modulated by Asian summer monsoon (ASM). Millennial-to-centennialscale variability of marine productivity during the Holocene is closely related to North Atlantic climate oscillations, mainly through atmospheric circulations in winter.

J	Corcoran, MC; Thomas, EK; Morrill, C				Corcoran, Megan C.; Thomas, Elizabeth K.; Morrill, Carrie			Using a Paired Chironomid δ18O and Aquatic Leaf Wax δ2H Approach to Reconstruct Seasonality on Western Greenland During the Holocene	PALEOCEANOGRAPHY AND PALEOCLIMATOLOGY												The Arctic hydrological cycle is predicted to intensify as the Arctic warms, due to increased poleward moisture transport during summer and increased evaporation from seas once ice-covered during winter. Records of past Arctic precipitation seasonality are important because they provide a context for these ongoing changes. In some Arctic lakes, stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen (delta O-18 and delta H-2, respectively) vary seasonally, due to seasonal changes in precipitation delta O-18 and delta H-2. We reconstruct precipitation seasonality from Lake N3, a well-dated lake sediment archive in Disko Bugt, western Greenland, by generating Holocene records of two proxies that are produced at different times of the year, and therefore record different lake water seasonal isotopic compositions. Aquatic plants synthesize waxes throughout the summer, and their delta H-2 reflects winter-biased precipitation delta H-2 at Lake N3, whereas chironomids synthesize their head capsules between late summer and winter, and their delta O-18 reflects summer-biased precipitation delta O-18 at Lake N3. During the middle Holocene at Lake N3, aquatic plant leaf wax was strongly H-2-depleted, while chironomid chitin was O-18-enriched. We guide interpretations of these records using sensitivity tests of a lake water and energy balance model, where we change precipitation amount and isotope seasonality inputs. The sensitivity tests suggest that the contrasting trends between proxies were likely caused by an increase in precipitation amount during all seasons and an increase in precipitation isotope seasonality, in addition to proxy-specific mechanisms, highlighting the importance of understanding lake- and proxy-specific systematics when interpreting records from sediment archives.

The impact of Eurasian dust storms and anthropogenic emissions on atmospheric nutrient deposition rates in forested Japanese catchments and adjacent regional seas	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Bulk precipitation and stream water chemistry data from 1993 to 2005 are used to analyze the relationship between Eurasian dust storms and nutrient deposition rates in the Kutsuki experimental forest (near Lake Biwa). From 2000 to 2005, atmospheric deposition, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and dissolved silica (DSi) deposition rates increased by 26%, 132%, and 38%, respectively in the Kutsuki experimental forest. These TN and TP increases are associated with three seasonal factors: the increasing frequency and intensity of Eurasian spring dust events (March/April); the annual typhoon period (late August/September); and autumn/early winter (October to December) monsoons. The annual typhoon and monsoon winter periods are drivers for atmospheric TP and DSi deposition due to the correlation between the deposition and precipitation. In addition, increased spring dust deposition is a primarily driver for TN deposition changes. Increased emissions from urbanized areas in China (and likely Korea) affect the chemical properties of aerosols reaching downwind Japanese regions. Aerosol processes are responsible for increasing TN in aerosols, which are affected primarily by anthropogenic emissions. From 2000 to 2005, coal burning emissions from East Asia have contributed to an increase in TP (and possibly DSi) deposition rates. The observed increase in nutrient deposition did not noticeably impact short-term (5 year) stream water fluxes in the Kutsuki experimental forest. Due to plant uptake, the forest ecosystem retained atmospherically deposited N and P. Finally, the observed increases in nutrient deposition rates over the East China Sea and the Sea of Japan may significantly influence intra-annual net primary production. It is recommended that earth system modelling incorporate changes in atmospheric nutrient deposition rates and their impacts on the regional carbon cycle as well as aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.

The chambers were monitored during 24 h incubation periods in the spring and summer 1974 and 1975. Physico-chemical differences between the natural lake system and within the experimental chambers were negligible. Experimental mercury concentrations ranging from < 0.02-1.25 ppm were added to the chambers to determine the effect of elevated Hg concentrations on in situ primary production. Mercury concentrations were monitored in the water column of each chamber during each 24 h incubation period to determine absolute concentrations following reduction through adsorption, absorption and vaporization. At least a 40% reduction in photosynthetic activity occurred at Hg concentrations as low as 0.06 ppm. A toxic Hg threshold concentration of 0.06 ppm was demonstrated for the summer phytoplankton assemblage, but a distinct threshold concentration was absent for the spring diatom assemblage. Differences in spring and summer phytoplankton populations may suggest subtle differences in Hg sensitivity between phytoplankton assemblages in combination with temperature acting on total community metabolism.																			0022-3646	1529-8817					1977	13	1					58	61		10.1111/j.1529-8817.1977.tb02887.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1529-8817.1977.tb02887.x													WOS:A1977CZ44600010

The Keratella spp. were collected throughout the year with maximum population densities in spring and fall. P. sulcata and B. angularis were common only during summer months. An extensive correlation analysis involving lagged variables was performed to ascertain relations between birth rates and environmental parameters (temperature and food). Birth rates of all 5 spp. were positively correlated with temperature. Concentrations of certain phytoplankton (Rhabdomonas, Rhodomonas, Chlamydomonas and Ankistrodesmus) were positively correlated with Keratella birth rates.

Common Mudpuppy (Necturus maculosus (Rafinesque, 1818)) in Western New York: A Seasonal Comparison of Diet, Body Condition, and Capture Methods	JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY												The Common Mudpuppy (Necturus maculosus (Rafinesque, 1818)) is found in many watersheds from eastern Canada to the southeastern United States. Although its range is large, recent observations suggest its population is dwindling in the Great Lakes region. A lack of understanding about its distribution at a finer scale or whether diet and body condition exhibit seasonal patterns limits our ability to develop a conservation management plan. This study investigated seasonal changes in Common Mudpuppy diets and body condition across western New York (USA) over a 2-yr period by using rock turning (RT) and trapping (TR) collection methods. Common Mudpuppies were found in all four major watersheds of the region in both lentic and lotic habitats. RT was more efficient than TR in streams, whereas TR was a better option in lakes. Male-to-female sex ratios and four of five measured morphological features did not differ between collection methods, although the largest and smallest Common Mudpuppies were captured by RT, suggesting some size selectivity in TR. Body girth was significantly smaller for Common Mudpuppies collected by RT, and this was attributed to seasonal differences in activity. Stomach contents were varied and differed by season, with 41 unique prey types recovered, including several forms of microplastics. In summer and fall, Common Mudpuppies fed on invertebrates exclusively, but during winter and spring, fish were incorporated into the diet. Body condition reflected the change in diet, with a higher body condition when fish were present in the diet. These findings suggest seasonal data are necessary to fully understand Common Mudpuppy conservation needs.																			0022-1511	1937-2418				SEP	2022	56	3					324	335		10.1670/20-141	http://dx.doi.org/10.1670/20-141													WOS:000870705500008

Climatic anomalies drive wildfire occurrence and extent in semi-arid shrublands and woodlands of southwest Australia	ECOSPHERE												Variation in the frequency, extent and intensity of wildfires can drive changes in the composition, structure, diversity and functioning of ecosystems in fire-prone regions worldwide. However, relationships between climatic variation and wildfire occurrence remain poorly understood in many fire-prone regions. We investigated fire occurrence and extent across 15,500 km(2) of semi-arid southwest Australia in relation to inter-annual and/or seasonal variation in regional climate and broad-scale circulation patterns. Superposed epoch analysis (SEA) was used to determine whether wildfire occurrence was related to anomalously high or low regional rainfall or temperature. In particular, we tested if years of minor fire extent (i.e., <250 km(2) burnt) and major fire extent (i.e., >1,000 km(2) burnt) occurred under different climatic conditions. We also used SEA to determine if wildfires occurred during or following periods of extremes of drivers of regional climate, including the El Nino southern oscillation (ENSO), the Indian Ocean dipole, atmospheric blocking in the adjacent Southern Ocean, and the southern annular mode (SAM). Fire occurrence was linked to dry and hot conditions typically associated with the El Nino phase of ENSO, with few or no fires in years with cool and wet summers. However, major fire years tended to occur during drought conditions that followed wet and cool conditions in spring and summer of the preceding year. These wet and cool periods were typically associated with the presence of blocking highs in the Southern Ocean to the south of Western Australia. We hypothesise that high rainfall in spring and summer favours the growth of ephemeral plants while subsequent drought conditions promote fuel drying, resulting in more continuous and highly flammable fuel beds capable of sustaining larger fires. Regional climatic patterns are likely driven by interactions among the SAM, atmospheric blocking, and decaying tropical cyclones. As climatic extremes are expected to increase in intensity and frequency in the future, it is likely that the occurrence of extensive wildfires in semi-arid southwest Australia will also increase, potentially driving changes in the distribution and composition of fire-sensitive plant communities.					; O'Donnell, Alison/H-8389-2012; Grierson, Pauline/A-9240-2008; McCaw, Lachlan/P-1267-2019; Boer, Matthias/A-4951-2008	O'donnell, Colm/0000-0002-8004-450X; O'Donnell, Alison/0000-0001-7597-7965; Grierson, Pauline/0000-0003-2135-0272; Boer, Matthias/0000-0001-6362-4572; McCaw, Lachlan/0000-0001-9127-5090													2150-8925					NOV	2011	2	11							127	10.1890/ES11-00189.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/ES11-00189.1													WOS:000208811200008
J	LAUZANNE, L				LAUZANNE, L			ALIMENTARY REGIMENS AND TROPHIC RELATIONSHIPS OF FISH IN LAKE CHAD	CAHIERS ORSTOM HYDROBIOLOGIE												The food and feeding habits of the common fish species from southeastern Lake Chad [Africa] were studied. The 2 main areas - archipelago and open waters - as well as spring and fall, the 2 main hydrological seasons, were separately examined. Stomach contents were analyzed using occurrence (% OC) and volumetric (% V) methods (Hynes, 1950) and a feeding index: .**GRAPHIC**. (Lauzanne, 1975). Relative biomass values were estimated for each species by means of a seine net (archipelago) and a set of gillnets in open waters. Fish diets in open waters are generally much simpler than the archipelago''s. The explanation lies with food items, which are much diversified and abundant in archipelago and lacking in open waters. Seasonal variations are well marked for predators which, during the spring, feed upon large species fry; during the fall, adults of small species are found more frequently. Terrestrial insects play an important role for open water fishes during spring; prawns are common within archipelago stomachs during the fall. The consumers belong to 3 distinct trophic levels: primary consumers (phytophagous and detritus eaters), secondary consumers (benthophagous and zooplankton feeders) and top consumers (chiefly piscivorous). Trophic relations are quite simple for the 2 first groups. On the other hand, food webs are more complex for top consumers. Zooplankton feeders prevail within archipelago (44% of the total ichthyomass); top consumers, with 64% of the total ichthyomass, are very important in open waters.																			0373-9422						1976	10	4					267	310																WOS:A1976DT31300003

The timing of freezeup and breakup results from an integration of meteorological conditions (primarily air temperature) that occur before these events. Changes in the average timing of these ice-events are translated into changes in air temperature by the use of empirical and process-driven models. The timing of freezeup and breakup at the two locations represents an integration of air temperatures over slightly different seasons (months). Records from both locations indicate that the early winter period before about 1890 was similar to 1.5 degrees C cooler than the early winter period after that time; the mean temperature has, however, remained relatively constant since about 1890. Changes in breakup dates demonstrate a similar 1.0-1.5 degrees C increase in late winter and early spring air temperatures about 1890. More recent average breakup dates at both locations have been earlier than during 1890-1940, indicating an additional warming of 1.2 degrees C in March since about 1940 and a warming of 1.1 degrees C in January-March since about 1980. Ice records at these sites will continue to provide an early indication of the anticipated climatic warming, not only because of the large response of ice cover to small changes in air temperature but also because these records integrate climatic conditions during the seasons (winter-spring) when most warming is forecast to occur. Future reductions in ice cover may strongly affect the winter ecology of the Great Lakes by reducing the stable environment required by various levels of the food chain.

However, diet and habitat links may depend significantly on seasonal availability of, and qualitative differences between, littoral and pelagic prey and on fish size. Despite increasing interest in food-web dynamics, little is known about the seasonal changes in, or qualitative differences between, littoral and pelagic trophic pathways supporting generalist fish species in high-latitude lakes. We used stomach contents together with analyses of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes and fatty acids to study the winter and summer diet of generalist Arctic charr and determine the qualitative differences between littoral and pelagic prey items. We were particularly interested to determine whether Arctic charr are able to utilise abundant and lipid-rich winter zooplankton resources in subarctic Lake Saanajarvi, northern Finland. Arctic charr fed actively on cladoceran zooplankton in both seasons, despite the higher abundance and higher lipid content of calanoid copepods. Although the stomach contents consisted mainly of zooplankton in summer, the isotopic compositions of muscle and liver suggest Arctic charr relied more on littoral carbon sources throughout the year. Fatty acid analysis indicated that Arctic charr had lower amounts of body fat and total and essential fatty acids in winter compared with summer. Observed seasonal feeding activity and dietary shifts were partly related to Arctic charr size. Small (<200mm) Arctic charr had more empty stomachs in winter, but higher amounts of zooplankton in stomachs and of essential fatty acids in muscle tissue in summer compared with larger (>200mm) conspecifics that had more seasonally stable feeding activity and diet. Fatty acid analysis indicated that both littoral and pelagic food sources provided similar fatty acids to Arctic charr, but in general, zooplankton had higher percentages of essential fatty acids compared with zoobenthos. Pelagic Eudiaptomus graciloides calanoids and littoral Gammarus lacustris amphipods had the highest concentrations of total and essential fatty acids, but only the latter prey item was found in Arctic charr stomach contents. Our study demonstrates that lipid-rich zooplankton can subsidise the predominantly benthivorous diet of top consumers (here Arctic charr) in subarctic lakes. The results also demonstrate that littoral and pelagic trophic pathways can be highly integrated in high-latitude lakes, as a result of the flexible foraging behaviour of top consumers such as Arctic charr.

J	Pfister, C; Brázdil, R				Pfister, C; Brázdil, R			Climatic variability in sixteenth-century Europe and its social dimension:: A synthesis	CLIMATIC CHANGE												The introductory paper to this special issue of Climatic Change summarizes the results of an array of studies dealing with the reconstruction of climatic trends and anomalies in sixteenth-century Europe and their impact on the natural and the social world. Areas discussed include glacier expansion in the Alps, the frequency of natural hazards (floods 111 central and southern Europe and storms on the Dutch North Sea coast), the impact of climate deterioration on grain prices and wine production, and finally, witch-hunts. The documentary data used for the reconstruction of seasonal and annual precipitation and temperatures in central Europe (Germany, Switzerland and the Czech Republic) include narrative sources, several types of proxy data and 32 weather diaries. Results were compared with long-term composite tree ring series and tested statistically by cross-correlating series of indices based on documentary data from the sixteenth century with those of simulated indices based on instrumental series (1901-1960). It was shown that series of indices can be taken as good substitutes for instrumental measurements. A corresponding set of weighted seasonal and annual series of temperature and precipitation indices for central Europe was computed from series of temperature and precipitation indices for Germany, Switzerland and the Czech Republic, the weights being in proportion to the area of each country. The series of central European indices were then used to assess temperature and precipitation anomalies for the 1901-1960 period using transfer functions obtained from instrumental records. The statistical analysis of these series of estimated temperature and precipitation anomalies yielded features which are similar to those obtained from instrumental series. Results show that winter temperatures remained below the 1901-1960 average except in the 1520s and 1550s. Springs fluctuated from 0.3 degrees C to 0.8 degrees C below this average. Summer climate was divided into three periods of almost equal length. The first was characterized by an alternation of cool and warmer seasons. The second interval was 0.3 degrees C warmer and between 5 and 6% drier than in the 1901-1960 period. It is emphasized that this warm period included several cold extremes 111 contrast to the recent period of warming. Summers from 1560 were 0.4 degrees C colder and 4% more humid. Autumns were 0.7 degrees C colder in the 1510s and 20% wetter in the 1570s. The deterioration of summer climate in the late sixteenth century initiated a second period of enlarged glaciers in this millennium (the first having been in the fourteenth century) which did not end until the late nineteenth century. An analysis of forcing factors (solar, volcanic, ENSO, greenhouse) points only to some volcanic forcing. In order to understand circulation patterns in the sixteenth century in terms of synoptic climatology, proxy information was mapped for a number of anomalous months. Attempts to compare circulation patterns in the sixteenth century with twentieth-century analogues revealed that despite broad agreements in pressure patterns, winters with distinct northeasterly patterns were more frequent in the sixteenth century, whereas the declining summer temperatures from the mid-1560s seem to be associated with a decreasing frequency of anticyclonic ridging from the Azores' center of action towards continental Europe. The number of severe storms on the Dutch North Sea coast was four times greater in the second half of the century than in the first. A more or less continuous increase in the number of floods over the entire century occurred in Germany and the Czech lands. The Iberian peninsula and the Garonne basin (France) had the greatest number of severe: floods in the 1590s. The analysis of the effects of climate on rye prices in four German towns involved a model that included monthly temperatures and precipitation values known to affect grain production. The correlation with rye prices was found significant for the entire century and reached its highest values between 1565 and 1600. From the 1580s to the turn of the century wine production slumped almost simultaneously in four regions over a distance of 800 kilometers (Lake Zurich to western Hungary). This had far-reaching consequences for the Habsburg treasury and promoted a temporary shift in drinking habits from wine to beer. Peasant communities which were suffering large collective damage from the effects of climatic change pressed authorities for the organization of witch-hunts. Seemingly most witches were burnt as scapegoats of climatic change.

J	FERRIS, JM; BURTON, HR				FERRIS, JM; BURTON, HR			THE ANNUAL CYCLE OF HEAT-CONTENT AND MECHANICAL STABILITY OF HYPERSALINE DEEP LAKE, VESTFOLD HILLS, ANTARCTICA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Deep Lake, a hypersaline lake of about ten times seawater concentration, rarely freezes and is characterized by a monomictic thermal cycle, Winter circulation, at c. -17.degree. C, lasts for two to three months. In summer, epilimnetic temperatures from 7-11.degree. C result in large vertical thermal gradients (21-26.degree. C) which combine with the enhanced rate of density change per degree Celsius, accompanying such high salt concentration, to produce a particularly stable density configuration in Deep Lake (Schmidt stability c. 8000 g-cm cm-2; 0.785 J cm-2). The Birgean annual heat budget (c. 24,500 cal cm-2; 102.7 103 J cm-2) is comparable to that of a temperate lake with a similar mean depth, despite the comparatively high ratio of Birgean wind work to annual heat budget (0.37 g-cm cal-1). Deep lake retains c. 50% of the incident solar radiation during the short summer heating period; within the range estimated for ''first class'' lakes in North America. Extended daylight hours certainly contribute to the high maximum rate of heating in the lake (444 cal cm-2 day-1; 1.86 103 J cm-2 day-1). Deep Lake cools at a rate less than half its average heating rate. Partitioning the total stability into thermal and saline components shows that salinity can contribute up to c. 20% of the maximum summer Schmidt stability. In early summer, the effect of small melt-streams is to increase stability by diluting the epilimnion. In autumn evaporative water loss can overtake this effect, creating small de-stabilizing salinity gradients. The usually short-term stabilizing influence of snowfall and drift is less predictable, but is probably more common in winter when strong winds are most frequent. Hypersalinity has a profound effect on the physical cycle of Deep Lake, through freezing point depression and the increased rate of density change with temperature. These changes affect the lake''s biota, both in relation to osmotic stress, and by effectively exposing them to a more thermally extreme environment. A comparison between Deep Lake and a smaller lake of similar salinity (Lake Hunazoko, Skarvs Nes), demonstrates that it is inappropriate to consider the biological effects of salinity in isolation. The smaller lake offers warmer epilimnetic conditions for at least part of the summer, which may explain the much greater limnetic algal production in Lake Hunazoko.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				AUG 15	1988	165						115	128		10.1007/BF00025579	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00025579													WOS:A1988Q014900013

Dissolved organic matter (DOC) and light-absorbing characteristics of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) were monitored in different tributaries of China within the Haihe River basin during spring and autumn. The concentration of DOC during spring was higher than during autumn (p < 0.01), and the evaporation was an important factor affecting the concentration of DOC in the basin. By contrast, the proportion of inputs due to terrigenous plants during autumn was higher than during spring. Carbon stable isotope analysis delta C-13 and C: N ratio of DOC, evidenced the inputs of DOC in the Haihe River basin from different sources including sewage, terrestrial plants, soil, and plankton. Isotopic analysis of delta C-13 and excitation-emission matrix (EEM) with fluorescence regional integration (FRI) analysis supported the hypothesis that allochthonous inputs contributed substantially to the inputs of DOC in the Haihe River basin, coming largely from sewage (9.8%-81.2%) and terrestrial plants (13.3% -65.8%). Depending on the source of DOC and contribution, four types with different EEM spectra were set. Type I, river water from sewage (81.2%): Type II, river water with input from terrestrial plants (65.8%); Type III, river water with plankton (36.4%), and Type IV, river water with soil-derived DOC (33.9%). The results demonstrated that the combined methodology using C-13 stable isotope and EEM-FRI can be used to characterize the components of DOC in river waters.

Monitoring and evaluating the long -term dynamics of the Taitema Lake wetland is essential for conserving and restoring regional wetland ecosystems. This paper used a dense time series of Landsat images from 1986 to 2021 to map the Taitema Lake wetlands. It analyzed the annual and seasonal variations of the wetlands by ten ecological indicators, which include area extent, vegetation, hydrology, and landscape features. A systematic assessment of the ecological quality of the wetlands over the past 36 years, along with their influencing factors, was conducted from the perspective of wetland health. The results showed that (1) the recovered water areas and the wetlands showed a clear trend of ecological restoration since 2000, accompanied by an increased fragmentation. The total wetland area increased from 69.95 km 2 in 1986 to 1164.47 km 2 in 2021, with a 15.6 -fold increase, and the vegetation area increased twentyfold to 639.84 km 2 . (2) The wetness in the core zone increased consistently across seasons, coupled with a simultaneous vegetation expansion surrounding the core zone. The areas with increasing wetness levels account for 48 % during winter and spring, and the areas with vegetation expansion account for 81 % and 72 % in summer and autumn, respectively. (3) The wetland ecological health status recovered to a " Good " level in 2021 and has not reached the " Excellent " status. The expansion of the water body is the primary driver behind the promotion of wetland ecological recovery. Small water bodies within the area range of 0.05 to 0.1 km 2 notably exhibited the most stimulating effects on the wetlands. Thus, increasing the count of smaller water bodies helps rehabilitate vegetation growth and mitigating the water supply ' s stress to sustain large lacustrine bodies.

Moose and white-tailed deer mortality peaks in fall and late winter	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												The Grand Portage Band of Lake Superior Chippewa manages for sustainable subsistence harvests of moose (mooz; Alces alces) and white-tailed deer (waawaashkeshi; Odocoileus virginianus). Moose populations in northern Minnesota, USA, are declining, which may necessitate alterations to Indigenous subsistence practices. Moose and deer exhibit seasonal behaviors such as altered space use and movement strategies, to which gray wolves (ma'iingan; Canis lupus) and humans may adapt, resulting in seasonal mortality patterns. Identifying periods of increased moose and deer vulnerability is important for achieving tribal conservation objectives. We assessed seasonal cause-specific mortality of adult moose (2010-2021) and deer (2016-2022) fitted with global positioning system collars on and near the Grand Portage Indian Reservation (Gichi Onigaming; GPIR) in Minnesota and hypothesized mortality risk would be influenced by species-specific space use patterns and weather. We estimated survival rates and mortality risk using time-to-event models. We recorded 42 moose mortalities (17 health issues, 8 predations, 4 subsistence harvests, 13 unknown causes) and 49 deer mortalities (26 predations, 13 harvests, 4 other causes, 6 unknown causes). Mean annual moose survival was 83.2%, and mortality risk peaked during late winter (similar to 25 April) and fall (similar to 8 October). Mean annual deer survival was 48.0%, and mortality risk peaked during late winter (similar to 25 March) and during their fall migration period (similar to 11 November). Mortality timing coincided with transitions between space use states (i.e., periods of spatial stability), suggesting ungulates are at greater risk during these transitional periods, though movement strategy (i.e., resident vs. migratory) did not influence mortality risk. Further, increased winter severity corresponded with increased deer mortality. We observed similar temporal peaks in mortality risk when harvest mortalities were censored, suggesting our observed seasonal mortality peaks occur naturally despite harvest comprising most fall deer mortality. Our results can inform population models and harvest regulations by identifying periods of mortality risk on GPIR under Anishinaabe principles of seventh-generation conservation planning.

J	Schultz, RD; Haines, DE				Schultz, RD; Haines, DE			Comparison of seasonal bluegill catch rates and size distributions obtained with trap nets and electrofishing in a large, heated impoundment	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												To determine potential bias in bluegill Lepomis macrochirus population indices, we compared the catch rates and size structure of bluegills captured by use of trap-netting and electrofishing from 1983 to 2001 in Coffey County Lake, a 2,100-ha cooling impoundment in Kansas. Trap-net catch per unit effort (CPUE) and size structure (proportional stock density [PSD]) were greater in 13-mm-mesh than in 25-mm-mesh trap nets, but length frequencies were similar. Bluegill electrofishing CPUE and PSD were greater during fall than spring, but longer bluegills were obtained by spring electrofishing. Trap nets produced a higher bluegill CPUE than did spring electrofishing, and the trap-net length frequency was skewed toward longer fish. Our data suggest that (1) the 13-mm trap-net mesh size yields more accurate information about harvestable-size bluegill abundance and size structure than 25-mm trap nets and (2) trap-netting (both mesh sizes combined) produces more accurate information about harvestable-size bluegill abundance and size structure than does spring electrofishing. Year effects played a large role in the differences detected among catch rates and population indices. Although fall electrofishing provided a larger bluegill sample than did spring electrofishing, size structure differences were not great enough to warrant a change in the standard electrofishing sampling period (i.e., spring) for bluegills in large Kansas impoundments because black bass Micropterus spp. can be sampled concurrently. This study provides gear and seasonal bias information on bluegill catch rates and size structure. Such information is lacking for large impoundments, which points to the need for further studies like ours.																			0275-5947					FEB	2005	25	1					220	224		10.1577/M04-055.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M04-055.1													WOS:000228031200024

Understanding how urban parks affect people's lives can help guide the construction and planning of parks in a direction that is more beneficial to the public. Therefore, it is worth studying the extent to which different urban parks with different characteristics affect public behaviour and preferences. This paper takes five typical urban parks in Chengdu and analyses the relationship between characteristics of the park ecosystem and public behaviour and preferences. The characteristics include the park scale, blue-green space ratio, plant diversity, and degree of re-wilding. Visit frequency, stay time, and park preference characterise public behaviour and preferences. The results show: (1) There are obvious differences in the ecosystem characteristics of the five parks: Qinglong Lake Wetland Park is the largest; the proportion of blue-green space in Jiangjiayiyuan Garden is the highest; the degree of re-wilding in Bailuwan Wetland Park is the highest; the proportion of green space and plant diversity in Guixi Ecological Park is the highest; and the proportion of blue space in Jincheng Lake Wetland Park is the highest. (2) There are differences in public behaviour and preferences for different parks. Tourists visit Qinglong Lake Wetland Park the most in spring and autumn and they choose Guixi Ecological Park instead in summer and winter. The public stays longer in Qinglong Lake Wetland Park and shorter in Jincheng Lake Wetland Park. (3) The scale of urban parks, the proportion of blue-green space, and the degree of re-wilding, especially the proportion of blue space, have a positive impact on the public's evaluation and promote public visits. The results of the study could help improve public awareness of the relationship between park characteristics and ecological services and well-being.

Radionuclide dating (Pb-210, Cs-137 and Am-241) confirmed the annual rhythm of laminations in the upper sediment profile. In Lake Bourget, biochemical varves are triplets composed of a diatom layer (spring lamina), a bio-precipitated calcite-rich layer (spring/summer lamina), and a layer rich in organic matter and detrital particles (winter lamina). The onset of eutrophication and the first appearance of an anoxic facies occurred simultaneously and were dated by laminae counting to AD 1943 +/- 1 year. Persistent anoxic conditions began in AD 1960. Eutrophication is characterised by drastic increases in the flux of biogenic silica (mostly diatoms), lacustrine organic matter, and larger calcite crystals (15-30 mu m). The increase of organic matter also represents a marker of the onset of anoxic conditions in the hypolimnion. Our results show that eutrophication was the main factor controlling anoxia in the hypolimnion. This eutrophication was caused mostly by the inflow of untreated sewage effluents, and to a lesser extent, by input of fertilizer-derived phosphorus during floods of the Rhone River and run-off from the lake catchment. The Rhone River, however, can also be a source of re-oxygenation via underflows that originate during flood events. Oxygenation of the hypolimnion is also controlled by low winter temperatures, which enable turnover of the lake. Thus, global warming, associated with a forecasted reduction in precipitation, might reduce the efficiency of hypolimnetic re-oxygenation in Lake Bourget.

Ciliate numbers and biomasses showed a trend of increase toward eutrophication, and both were strongly correlated with the abundance of bacteria and phytoplankton. The mean cell densities for ciliates were: 2.9, 5.0, 9.8 and 20.3 cells/ml for oligotrophic, mesotrophic, eutrophic and hypereutrophic lakes, respectively. The ciliate communities were dominated by four orders: oligotrichs, haptorids, scuticociliates and prostomatids. The relative importance of oligotrichs and haptorids decreased along the trophic gradient from oligotrophy to eutrophy. In more eutrophic conditions these orders were progressively replaced by small scuticociliates and prostomatids. The diversity of ciliates in lakes was positively correlated (R-2 = 0.84) with the concentration of chlorophyll-a. The peak abundances, in terms of both cell numbers and biomasses, were recorded in spring and early summer (most eutrophic lakes) or autumn (oligotrophic and most mesotrophic lakes).

Denitrification occurring on suspended sediments (DSS) may play an important role in nitrogen removal in water columns with high SPS concentrations. Poyang Lake, with dramatic hydrologic variations, has high spatial and seasonal variation of SPS, and we hypothesized that DSS and nitrogen removal in this lake would vary similarly. DSS in Poyang Lake was determined by the traditional acetylene-inhibition method combined with a batch mode assay. Laboratory simulation experiments were also conducted to examine the factors controlling denitrification occurring on SPS. Seasonally, DSS rates at 15 sampling sites in Poyang Lake were 0.63 +/- 0.24, 0.29 +/- 0.17, 0.25 +/- 0.18, and 0.52 +/- 0.37 gmol N. L-1. d(-1), respectively in spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Spatially, average DSS rates were higher in the northern lake area, which is connected to the Yangtze River, than in the upstream and central lake area. Lowest DSS rates occurred in semi-closed bay and dish lakes. Spatial and seasonal variations of DSS rates were affected by a combination of factors, in which nitrate concentrations, SPS composition, and concentrations of organic-SPS were the most important. These influencing factors were seasonally dependent, with nitrate concentrations having stronger effects on DSS during wet seasons than dry seasons. Results from a multiple stepwise regression model also demonstrated that DSS tended to occur on fine particles (e.g., clay particles, <4 mu m). Evaluation of annual nitrogen loss by DSS was estimated according to the seasonal water budget and DSS rates in Poyang Lake. The total nitrogen loss by DSS was estimated to be 10800 +/- 6090 tau, which accounted for 2.8-9.9% of the nitrogen input, and this proportion was comparable to nitrogen removal by sediment denitrification. This result confirms that DSS was an important nitrogen sink in this large, turbid lake. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Experiments in which cultures were submitted to these conditions indicate that pH, redox potential, dissolved oxygen and cell division rate fluctuated much as was expected. Nevertheless, glycogen (energy reserve) tended to disappear from the cultures maintained in the darkness and under 0.5 Klux at 4.degree. C, the glycogen content did not decrease. The glucose consumption rate was faster in the darkness and presented a smaller Km, suggesting a higher affinity of Microcystis for external sources of glucose. This may have some significance in relation to the survival strategy of Microcystis under field conditions during autumn, winter and spring in temperate lakes.

Suspended particulate matter (SPM) plays a connective role in ABP processes. However, little is known about the impacts of ABP effect on the occurrence, source apportionment and toxicity of SPM-bound polycydic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in a typically shallow eutrophic lake under strong anthropogenic emissions of PAHs. In this study, we study this gap knowledge on the eutrophic Lake Chaohu, China. SPM-bound PAHs in Lake Chaohu were controlled by anthropogenic emissions in all seasons. Apparent ABP effect only occurred in spring and summer in lake area. Algae blooms in spring and summer significantly increased 46.5% +/- 7.9% (mean +/- standard deviation) and 19.8% +/- 2.4% of Sigma(21) SPM-bound PAHs, and greatly enhanced their toxicity (1.98 +/- 0.46 limes in spring and 32.9% +/- 4.2% in summer). Therefore, there need more attentions focusing on the coupling effect of persistent toxic substances such as PAHs and harmful algae blooms in aquatic environment for sustainable development. The apparent ASP effect had little influence on their source apportionment. However, it may cause a regime shift for the source apportionment on a short-term scale. Further study could pay more attentions on in-depth and short-term studies on ASP effect. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Total numbers of individuals varied between 2900-400 m-2. Five species were found in such numbers that it was possible to estimate production. One species, Glossiphonia complanata L., occurred in 2 distinct subspecies, i.e., G. c. typica L. and G. c. concolor Apathy. Erpobdella octoculata L. and Helobdella stagnalis L. constituted 45.4 and 36.0% of the leeches, respectively. Fortnightly sampling showed periodical increases of E. octoculata and H. stagnalis during autumn and spring and increased numbers of E. testacea Sav., G. heteroclita L., G. c. typica and G. c. concolor in early spring. These variations, not caused by reproduction, indicated immigration from deeper water to the shallow zone lacking macrophytic vegetation. The mean individual weight of immigrating leeches was in several cases either higher or lower than the mean weight of the resident leeches. Mortality rates did not indicate any periods of emigration. The total immigration was at least 2500 individuals m-2 in autumn and 1000 m-2 during spring.																			0030-1299	1600-0706					1979	33	1					113	120		10.2307/3544519	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3544519													WOS:A1979HN09500017

To obtain more information on the characteristics of these two states, we compared seasonal variations in trophic structure and physico-chemical variables of two clear and two turbid lakes studied during seven or eight years. The clearwater lakes were characterised by a high abundance of submerged macrophytes, high piscivorous:planktivorous fish ratios, high zooplankton:phytoplankton ratios and low chlorophyll a during summer. Submerged macrophytes were almost absent from the turbid lakes, planktivorous fish dominated, the zooplankton:phytoplankton ratio was low and summer chlorophyll a was high. While total phosphorus (TP) was almost constant throughout the season in the clearwater lakes, TP was substantially higher during summer in the turbid lakes reflecting high internal loading. In the clearwater lakes, mean summer chlorophyll a was only 45-51% of winter values, while summer chlorophyll a was 118-259% of winter values in the turbid lakes. Our data suggests that zooplankton, by grazing on phytoplankton, play a major role in maintaining clearwater conditions in eutrophic macrophyte-rich lakes, in particular during summer. In addition, results from a multiple regression on data from 37 lakes and the analyses of the seasonal dynamics in suspended solids provide some evidence that zooplankton grazing diminishes concentrations of detritus and inorganic suspended solids either directly by grazing or more indirectly. Using information also from literature, we argue that the role of zooplankton grazing for water clarity in macrophyte-rich lakes may increase from mesotrophic to eutrophic lakes.

A total of 79 water samples were taken around the habitats of beavers from 14 localities situated in the recreational Masurian Lake District (north-eastern Poland). Water was sampled in the spring and autumn seasons, at different distances from beavers' lodges (0-2, 10, 30, and 50 m). The samples were examined for the presence of (oo)cysts of zoonotic protozoa Giardia duodenalis and Cryptosporidium spp. by direct fluorescence assay (DFA) and by nested and real time PCR. By DFA, the presence of Giardia cysts was found in 36 samples (45.6%) and the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts in 26 samples (32.9%). Numbers of Giardia cysts, Cryptosporidium oocysts, and summarised (oo)cysts of both parasites showed a significant variation depending on locality. The numbers of Giardia cysts significantly decreased with the distance from beavers' lodges while the numbers of Cryptosporidium oocysts did not show such dependence. The amount of Giardia cysts in samples collected in spring was approximately 3 times higher than in autumn. Conversely, a larger number of Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected in samples collected in autumn than in spring. By PCR, Giardia DNA was found in 38 samples (48.1%) whereas DNA of Cryptosporidium was found in only 7 samples (8.9%), Eleven Giardia isolates were subjected to phylogenetic analysis by restriction fragment length polymorphism PCR or sequencing which evidenced their belonging to zoonotic assemblages: A (3 isolates) and B (8 isolates). In conclusion, water in the vicinity of beavers' lodges in the tested region was markedly contaminated with (oo)cysts of Giardia duodenalis and Cryptosporidium spp., which confirms the potential role of beavers as a reservoir of these parasites and indicates a need for implementation of appropriate preventive measures to protect tourists' health.

Hatching patterns of resting eggs produced in different seasons were evaluated under different laboratory incubation conditions (constantly kept in water and subject to one or two months of desiccation). The number of eggs hatching after incubation in dry conditions was too low to be used for quantitative analysis. Resting eggs from most populations and sampling seasons had a five-month refractory period. After that period, eggs produced in the fall hatched within a few days, while those produced in the spring kept hatching over a period of several weeks. No difference was found between hatching patterns of resting eggs produced in the permanent lake (only in the fall) and those produced in the same season in temporary ponds. Differences in genetic structure were found among populations but not between spring and fall females of the only population analyzed in both seasons.

Comparisons between calculated equilibrium isotope values, using the fractionation equation of Friedman and O'Neil (1977) and measured oxygen isotope ratios of calcite in the sediment-traps reveal that oxygen isotopic values of autochthonous calcite (delta(18)O) are in isotopic equilibrium with ambient water during most of the spring and summer, when the majority of the calcite precipitates. In contrast, small amounts of calcite precipitated in early-spring and again in late-autumn are isotopically depleted in O-18 relative to the calculated equilibrium values, by as much as 0.8 parts per thousand. This seasonally occurring apparent isotopic nonequilibrium is associated with times of high phosphorous concentrations, elevated pH (similar to 8.6) and increased [CO32-] (similar to 50 mu mol/l) in the surface waters. The resulting weighted average delta(18)O Value for the studied period is -9.6 parts per thousand, compared with a calculated equilibrium delta(18)O value of -9.4 parts per thousand. These data convincingly demonstrate that delta(18)O of calcite are, for the most part, a very reliable proxy for temperature and delta(18)O Of the water. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Tonetta, D; Fontes, MLS; Petrucio, MM				Tonetta, Denise; Fontes, Maria Luiza S.; Petrucio, Mauricio Mello			Linking summer conditions to CO2 undersaturation and CO2 influx in a subtropical coastal lake	LIMNOLOGY												In this study, we tested the hypothesis that pCO(2) and air-water CO2 fluxes in the surface waters of a subtropical lake vary on two time scales (diel and seasonally) and that CO2 concentrations would decrease during the day and in summer. We estimated the variability of pCO(2) and the air-water CO2 flux from pH-alkalinity in four 48-h periods that were representative of each subtropical season. There was high variability in pCO(2) and the air-water gas flux over 48 h, but there was no clear pattern between day and night. CO2 concentrations showed a strong positive correlation with heterotrophic bacterial biomass and a negative correlation with dissolved organic carbon concentrations and water temperature. The lake was predominantly diel and seasonally CO2 supersaturated; the highest CO2 efflux was observed in the spring and a CO2 influx was observed in summer. Our hypothesis was confirmed; pCO(2) was lowest in summer and during the daytime in spring and summer due to physical and biological conditions that favoured photosynthetic activities. These findings suggest that temporal shifts in the microbial community and meteorological variables, which are indirectly related to temperature, may be important drivers of CO2 concentrations in Peri Lake. In conclusion, pCO(2) and the air-water CO2 flux vary temporally (diel and seasonally) in the littoral zone of this subtropical coastal lake, with shifts between CO2 influx and efflux throughout the sampling periods.					; Tonetta, Denise/AAA-9060-2019; Petrucio, Mauricio/AAC-6232-2019	Tonetta, Denise/0000-0002-7613-9610; Petrucio, Mauricio/0000-0002-7242-9426													1439-8621	1439-863X				AUG	2015	16	3					193	201		10.1007/s10201-015-0460-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-015-0460-9													WOS:000359433000007
J	Gaedke, U; Wickham, SA				Gaedke, U; Wickham, SA			Ciliate dynamics in response to changing biotic and abiotic conditions in a large, deep lake (Lake Constance)	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												From 1987 to 1998, ciliates and their prey and predator communities in Lake Constance (which is large, deep and meso-eutrophic) were intensively studied as the lake underwent reoligotrophication. Ciliate biomass exhibited the bimodal seasonal distribution typical for meso-eutrophic lakes, with high biomass in spring and summer and low biomass in winter and during the clear-water phase. Cluster analysis produced 9 groups of temporally co-occurring ciliate morphotypes with potentially similar ecological characteristics. The clusters exhibited a larger seasonality than found in the size distribution, showing that size alone failed to capture some ciliate seasonal dynamics. Ciliate biomass declined by approx. 30% during the 12 yr of study, i.e. considerably less than daphnids (and total phosphorus). This yielded a significant increase in the ratio between summer ciliate and daphnid biomass as re-oligotrophication progressed, in contrast to previous studies. Few indications for a mechanistic link between phosphorus concentrations (which declined 3-fold during the study period) and ciliate biomass or community composition via group-specific food concentrations were found. The relative contribution of 3 of the 9 clusters changed as re-oligotrophication progressed. Ciliate size distribution was related to re-oligotrophication and daphnid biomass in summer. The smallest and largest ciliates gained importance when daphnids decreased, whereas the biomass of large ciliates declined. Generally, summer daphnid biomass had a greater predictive power for attributes of the ciliate community than the other factors studied (phosphorus, prey biomass, copepod biomass). The extent of bottom-up and top-down control of ciliates appeared to be time- and group-specific. Overall, the ciliate community exhibited remarkably recurrent seasonal patterns, despite major alternations in abiotic and biotic conditions.																			0948-3055	1616-1564				MAR 9	2004	34	3					247	261		10.3354/ame034247	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame034247													WOS:000220502400005

These data were examined to obtain a 1st general diagnosis of lake acidification in Quebec. The spatial variation of the mineralization of lakes was interpreted in relation to lithology and galacial deposits, allowing the identification of Shield areas particularly threatened by acid precipitation. A strong south-west to north-east gradient in sulfate concentration was observed and interpreted as a result of long range atmospheric transport of S and as an indication of increased sulfate levels in southern Quebec lakes. The frequency distribution of pH values and the relation between pH and sulfate were examined; the results suggested that many Shield lakes were probably affected by acid precipitation. A comparison was made between spring and summer conditions; data obtained in spring showed a substantial decreased in pH and alkalinity.																			0049-6979	1573-2932					1985	25	2					115	132		10.1007/BF00568381	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00568381													WOS:A1985AHD8800001
J	Suzuki, K				Suzuki, K			Chemistry of stream water in a snowy temperate catchment	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The seasonal variation of the quality of stream water in a snowy temperate area, where rain or temporary warming can cause frequent melting at the surface of snow cover, even in mid-winter, was studied. Monthly runoff is highest in the snowmelt seasons March and April, and lowest in November. Since floods in the rainy season or in the autumn rainy period take place irregularly, they contribute little to monthly runoff. In winter, as with the snowmelt season, the proportion of HCO3- in stream water is relatively low, while the proportions of Cl-, NO3- and SO42- are relatively high. In mid-winter and during the snowmelt season, the amount of each ion clearly indicates that stream water quality is strongly influenced by snow meltwater.

However, the species exhibits invasive characteristics by competing with native species for food and habitat use. This study investigates the feeding ecology of G. holbrooki populations from three distinct freshwater environments (Lake Iris, E & gbreve;lenhoca Reservoir, and Parlak Reservoir) on the Karaburun Peninsula (North-Western T & uuml;rkiye), a region outside its native range. The primary aim was to evaluate seasonal and spatial variations in the diet of the species. A total of 871 specimens were analysed: 247 from Iris Lake, 318 from Parlak Reservoir, and 306 from E & gbreve;lenhoca Reservoir. Low percentages of empty stomachs (<= 20%) across all populations indicate high feeding intensity. The results reveal that G. holbrooki exhibits a generalist feeding strategy, consuming a wide range of food items such as insects, zooplankton, and plant material across all the investigated environments. The relative importance of food groups (determined by the Importance Index, MI%) varied seasonally but not spatially. In all three populations, the most important food source in the spring was dipterans, followed by plants in the summer and fall, and cladocerans in the winter. Plants accounted for the largest percentage of the diet in every population (MI% >65%). These findings suggest that G. holbrooki adapts its diet to seasonal food availability.

During the observation period from 2001-2020, the annual aerosol optical depth (AOD) at most sites showed increasing trends (0.002-0.029 yr(-1)), except for that at three sites, Canberra, Jabiru, and Lake Argyle, which showed decreasing trends (0.004 to 0.014 yr(-1)). In contrast, the annual Angstrom exponent (AE) showed decreasing tendencies at most sites (0.045 to 0.005 yr(-1)). The results showed strong seasonal variations in AOD, with high values in the austral spring and summer and relatively low values in the austral fall and winter, and weak seasonal variations in AE, with the highest mean values in the austral spring at most sites. Monthly average AOD increases from August to December or the following January and decreases during March-July. Spatially, the MODIS AOD showed obvious spatial heterogeneity, with high values appearing over the Australian tropical savanna regions, Lake Eyre Basin, and southeastern regions of Australia, while low values appeared over the arid regions in western Australia. MERRA-2 showed that carbonaceous aerosol over northern Australia, dust over central Australia, sulfate over densely populated northwestern and southeastern Australia, and sea salt over Australian coastal regions are the major types of atmospheric aerosols. The nine ground-based AERONET sites over Australia showed that the mixed type of aerosols (biomass burning and dust) is dominant in all seasons. Moreover, Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) showed that polluted dust is the dominant aerosol type detected at heights 0.5-5 km over the Australian continent during all seasons. The results suggested that Australian aerosol has similar source characteristics due to the regional transport over Australia, especially for biomass burning and dust aerosols. However, the dust-prone characteristic of aerosol is more prominent over central Australia, while the biomass-burning-prone characteristic of aerosol is more prominent in northern Australia.

The city of Pori at the delta of the river is the most significant flood risk area in Finland. The preparation of a flood risk management plan (FRMP) for the Kokemaenjoki River Basin as a national pilot began in 2007 and will be finalised during 2011. The main challenges of the FRMP are the reconciliation of flood risks and various interests in different parts of the river basin, and adaptation to climate change. It has been predicted that climate change will alter the flood dynamics of the Kokemaenjoki River: the highest flow peaks will shift from spring to late autumn and winter and the risk of ice jam floods will increase. Development of the existing early warning systems and adaptive lake regulation practices are the two most important non-structural measures for preventing and mitigating flood damage. A new channel in the mid-river reach would help to manage the increasing winter flows. Also robust structural flood protection measures will be needed in the city of Pori. Nevertheless, close collaboration among authorities, municipalities and water body regulators will be critical in successful flood risk management in the Kokemaenjoki River Basin.

In addition, the relative importance of these two processes to phytoplankton assemblage will be affected by hydrological connectivity. However, the impacts of anthropogenic activities on phytoplankton beta diversity and the relative importance of these two processes to phytoplankton are still poorly understood, especially in water conservation areas. Here, we examined the relative importance of local and regional environmental control and spatial structuring of phytoplankton communities in five rivers with different degrees of disturbance during wet and dry seasons. We found that community structure and local environmental conditions varied greatly in seasons and rivers. The reference river (with minimum disturbance) had the highest homogeneity of environmental conditions and phytoplankton assemblage, while the excessive disturbance rivers (sand mining activities) had the greatest environmental heterogeneity and species dissimilarity between sites. Variation partitioning analysis showed that the phytoplankton community variation was mainly explained by the spatial variables in the wet season (summer and autumn) and winter, while the local environmental variables explained the largest variation of phytoplankton community in the dry season (spring). However, broad-scale variables were selected by redundancy analysis in both dry and wet seasons, which indicates that long-distance scales always have low river connectivity, regardless of whether the river is overflowing or drying up. Local environmental processes explained the most variation in phytoplankton community within all of the rivers, suggesting that deterministic processes usually work on relatively small spatial scales. However, this effect would be weakened by anthropogenic activities, especially sand mining activities. We inferred that sand mining activities increased the environmental heterogeneity and species dissimilarity between sites by causing watercourse habitat patches and obstructing river connectivity. On the other hand, as the excessive disturbance, sand mining activities significantly reduced the species richness and abundance of phytoplankton.

In each year, spring population peaks were followed by strong summer reductions. Concomitant with population declines, there were reductions in rotifer egg ratios. Keratella taurocephala abundance patterns were similar to those of K. cochlearis during 1984 and 1985, but not in 1986 and 1987, when spring peaks and summer declines were not apparent. However, summer declines in the egg ratio of K. taurocephala were observed during each year. The reduction in rotifer populations simultaneously with decreased egg ratios suggested that population declines were caused by food limitation. Food-addition experiments conducted in situ in small enclosures indicated that food was limiting for K. cochlearis when its populations were declining, but not during other periods of the year. Keratella taurocephala did not show a consistent response to food addition.

Methane emission from high latitude lakes: methane-centric lake classification and satellite-driven annual cycle of emissions	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Methane (CH4) is emitted from lakes by several processes: bubbles released from bottom sediments that reach the atmosphere (ebullition); spring release of CH4 trapped in bubbles in and under the ice during fall freeze (bubble release), and diffusion of CH4 from sediments to the surface. Each of these emission routes is highly variable over space and time, and episodic in the extreme, making reliable measurements difficult to carry out. However, lakes are receiving increasing interest for their important contribution to global CH4 emissions. Their area, distribution and emissions respond to interannual and longer-term climate fluctuations and close to half the world's lake area is in high northern latitudes that are experiencing rapidly-warming temperatures and lengthening thaw periods. We report on a new spatially-explicit data set of lakes >50 degrees N, classified with methane-relevant criteria. The seasonality of daily CH4 fluxes is driven with satellite observations of thaw timing and duration. We found that observed thaw seasons are 10-30% shorter than those assumed in previous studies. The area of lakes is 1,095x10(3) km(2) and total CH4 emission is 13.8-17.7 Tg CH4 year(-1): 11.2-14.4 Tg via diffusion and ebullition and 2.6-3.3 Tg from spring release of CH4 stored in bubbles in winter lake ice. This novel suite of data and methodologies provides a unique framework to model CH4 emission from lakes under current, past and future climates.																			2045-2322					JUL 27	2020	10	1							12465	10.1038/s41598-020-68246-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-68246-1								32719313					WOS:000556875200009

(uncorrected for reservoir effect). Sedimentological data from sites in the Pyramid Lake and Smoke Creek-Black Rock Desert subbasins indicate that the Trego Hot Springs tephra layer was deposited during a relatively dry period when Pyramid Lake was at or below its spill point (1177 m) to the Winnemucca Lake subbasin. The Wono tephra layer was deposited when lake depth was controlled by spill across Emerson Pass sill (1207 m) to the Smoke Creek-Black Rock Desert subbasin. O-18 data from core PLC92B also support the concept that the Trego Hot Springs tephra fell into a relatively shallow Pyramid Lake and that the Wono tephra fell into a deeper spilling lake.

J	ENGEL, S; NICHOLS, SA				ENGEL, S; NICHOLS, SA			AQUATIC MACROPHYTE GROWTH IN A TURBID WINDSWEPT LAKE	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												High water turbidity developed in the 1970s in shallow windswept Rice Lake. Wisconsin, and created a depauperate macrophyte community that has persisted more than a decade later. In 1989, this flora was characterized by species with early spring growth, summer leaf canopies, and winter tubers or rhizomes. The community was dominated inshore by water lilies (Nymphaea tuberosa and Nuphar variegatum) and offshore by pondweeds (Potamogeton pectinatus and P. natans). Together with coontail (Ceratophyllum demersum), water crowfoot (Ranunculus longirostris), and elodea (Elodea canadensis), the submersed flora reached a summer dry-weight standing crop of only 28-31 g/m2. The water turbidity developed when high water destroyed wild rice beds (Zizania palustris var. palustris), allowing winds to suspend soft sedment, uproot surviving plants, and circulate nutrients. Suspended sediment and phytoplankton blooms reduced Secchi disk visibility to less than 30 cm. These conditions left 61% of the water surface barren of rooted plants and forced surviving pondweeds to grow in peculiar ring or loop formations. With ice-out in mid-April and dense phytoplankton blooms by June, Rice Lake macrophytes had just 4-6 weeks to sprout and reach the water surface--a growth window too short for most northern species.																			0270-5060					JUN	1994	9	2					97	109		10.1080/02705060.1994.9664436	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1994.9664436													WOS:A1994NW51100002

FLOWERING PHENOLOGY AND AERIAL DEPOSITION	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												Two years of aerial pollen trapping at 2 lakes surrounded by coniferous forest are summarized. Most of the annual pollen and spore deposition occurs between Feb. and May (86%), followed by 10% during the summer, and 4% during the fall-winter nonflowering period. Annual aerial influx is very similar at both Marion and Surprise lakes, .apprx. 5000 grains .cntdot. cm-2 .cntdot. yr-1. The annual frequency spectra are also equivalent, with a predominance of Cupressaceae (32%) and Alnus (35%), followed by Tsuga heterophylla (8-11%), grasses (8-10%) and pine (2-3%). Regional, rather than local or extralocal pollen, is estimated to account for about 90% of the annual aerial deposition at both lakes. The data also suggest that pollen transport is predominantly upslope in this mountainous area.

The hydrological simulations computed using available climate scenarios indicated modifications in annual water yields, from a 13% increase to a 30% decrease, and earlier spring floods. Peak flows, winter and summer low flows, and the level of increase in water yields vary depending on the studied climate scenario. The simulation of the current management plan shows that climate changes will affect the current trade-off between the various management objectives of the reservoirs. Adaptation solutions to the current management plan appeared to be feasible, but no unique solution applicable to all climate scenarios was found.																			0315-1468	1208-6029				AUG	2007	34	8					934	945		10.1139/L07-030	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/L07-030													WOS:000250261200005
J	Lücke, A; Brauer, A				Lücke, A; Brauer, A			Blogeochemical and micro-facial fingerprints of ecosystem response to rapid Late Glacial climatlic changes in varved sediments of Meerfelder Maar (Germany)	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The response of a lacustrine ecosystem to climatic changes from 13,500 to 10,800 BP was studied in a varve dated sediment profile of Lake Meerfelder Maar, western Germany. Bulk biogeochemical parameters, stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes of sedimentary organic matter and micro-facies analysis are used for a detailed investigation of the lake's development from the Allerod interstadial (AL) to the Younger Dryas stadial (YD) and into the early Holocene (Preboreal). Varve micro-facies reveal rapid changes in composition and seasonal structure of the depositional environment mainly in temporal accordance with changes of terrestrial biozones. The respective responses of bulk proxy parameters (similar tobi-decadal resolution) indicate different sensitivities to diverse climatic changes. A prominent transition took place within two decades at the AL/YD boundary (12,690-12,670 BP). Increased flux of nutrients released from redeposited littoral sediments and shorter YD summer seasons led to an acceleration and concentration of lacustrine primary production with reduced discrimination against (1 3) C. High lacustrine primary production was further favored by relatively warm YD summer temperatures. At 12,240 varve years BP, from 1 year to the next, a regular deposition of detrital layers in spring set in which is related to local hydrologic threshold processes amplifying, the response to increased snowmelt discharge. This distinct change in the middle of the YD is clearly detected by varve micro-facies but not equally recorded in organic bulk proxy data. Especially, carbon isotope ratios remain constant and indicate a negligible effect of this process on the productivity of lacustrine algae. The YD/Preboreal transition (11,645-11,585 BP) is marked by a characteristic change in micro-facies. Throughout this transition, stable carbon isotope ratios strongly decline while the accumulation of opal and organic matter (OM) remained constant. This is seen as an increasing importance of spring and autumn for gross primary production at the onset of the Holocene. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Khairy, MA; Lohmann, R				Khairy, Mohammed A.; Lohmann, Rainer			Source apportionment and risk assessment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the atmospheric environment of Alexandria, Egypt	CHEMOSPHERE												In this study, three receptor models [factor analysis/multiple linear regression (FA/MLR), positive matrix factorization (PMF) and UNMIX] were applied seasonally to investigate the source apportionment of PAHs in the atmospheric environment of Alexandria, and a lifetime cancer risk was assessed. Sigma(44) (gas + particle) PAH concentrations varied from 330 to 1770 ng m(-3) and 170-1290 ng m(-3) in the summer and winter seasons respectively. PAH concentrations at the industrial sites were significantly higher than at the traffic and residential sites during the winter season (p < 0.001). Summer PAH concentrations were significantly higher than the winter season at the traffic sites (p = 0.027). Results obtained from the three receptor models were comparable. Vehicle emissions, both diesel and gasoline contributed on average 36.0-49.0% and 19.0-34.0% respectively, natural gas combustion 11.0-27.0% and, during the summer only, also evaporative/uncombusted petroleum sources 8.00-18.0%. Seasonal trends were found for the gasoline emission source. Overall, PMF and UNMIX models afforded better source identification than did FA/MLR. The lifetime cancer risk assessment showed that incremental lifetime cancer risks (ILTCRs) were greater than the acceptable level of 10(-6) through dermal and ingestion routes at all the investigated sites and through the inhalation route at the industrial and traffic sites only. Total ILTCRs (6.64 x 10(-3)-4.42 x 10(-2)) indicated high potential risks to the local residents.

Environmental influences on the qualitative and quantitative composition of phytoplankton and zooplankton in North African coastal lagoons	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Within the framework of the international research project MELMARINA, seasonal dynamics of plankton communities in three North African coastal lagoons (Merja Zerga, Ghar El Melh, and Lake Manzala) were investigated. The sampling period extended from July 2003 to September 2004 with the aim of evaluating hydrological and other influences on the structure, composition and space-time development of these communities in each lagoon. Phytoplankton in Merja Zerga showed a quasi-permanent predominance of marine diatoms in the open sea station and in the marine inlet channel. Dinoflagellates were abundant in summer and early autumn in the marine inlet and extended into the central lagoon station. In Ghar El Melh, marine species (especially diatoms and dinoflagellates) dominated despite occasional winter inflows of freshwater. In Lake Manzala, freshwater species generally predominated and the planktonic communities were comparatively very diverse. Chlorophyceae contributed 39% of the total species recorded and diatoms and cyanophyceans were also common; the Dinophyceae, Euglenophyceae, Chrysophyceae and Cryptophyceae less so. Zooplankton communities in both Ghar El Melh and Merja Zerga were dominated by marine copepods. Rotifera, Copepoda, Ostracoda, and Cladocera were recorded in both lagoons as were meroplanktonic larvae of Polychaeta, Cirripedia, Mysidacea and Gastropoda and free living nematodes. Ghar El Melh was the more productive of these two lagoons with spring and early summer being the productive seasons. Zooplankton communities in Lake Manzala were generally dominated by rotifers and highest zooplankton abundances occurred in April (2003). Sampling stations near the marine inlets showed the highest diversity and the zooplankton communities showed considerable spatial variation within this large lagoon. The three lagoons represent very different water bodies contrasted strongly in terms of tidal effects and freshwater availability. Yet, there are some similarities in ecosystem structure. Space-time development of the plankton communities was similar especially in Merja Zerga and Ghar El Melh. Species abundances and specific diversities indicated that seasonal changes in salinity and nutrient concentrations were the main influential factors. Lake Manzala was the most productive lagoon and all the three sites supported toxic algal species. Relatively low plankton biomass in Merja Zerga and Ghar El Melh probably resulted from a combination of factors including highly episodic nutrient inputs, light suppression (by turbidity) and nutrient competition with benthic algae. Water quality variables were largely driven by the hydrological regime specific to each lagoon. Nutrient enrichment and, particularly for Lake Manzala, sea level rise threaten the sustainability of the planktonic ecosystems in all three lagoons.

Probably due to intraspecific competition for Asellus aquaticus, the most important food, the adults shrank in spring and summer and eventually died off and were replaced by numerous young which grew rapidly during autumn. No distinct variations in energy and fat content throughout the year were found. Probably triclads have no need for rapid energy mobilization. Adults contained more fat and energy than young, may be in connection with cocoon production. The condition, mortality and reproductive potential are compared to British populations. The Swedish population of D. lacteum may be more of an r-strategist than the British one, because of more extensive temperature variations. Temperature, growth/maturation level and food are probably the main factors in the reproduction phenology.																			0003-9136						1979	85	4					482	510																WOS:A1979HC08200006
J	El-Refaie, G				El-Refaie, Ghada			Temperature impact on operation and performance of Lake Manzala Engineered Wetland, Egypt	AIN SHAMS ENGINEERING JOURNAL												Wetlands are shallow water bodies open to the atmosphere, so, they are strongly influenced by weather temperature where temperature modifies the rates of several key biological processes and it is sometimes a regulated water quality parameter. Therefore, studying the impact of temperature on constructed wetland performance and operation is very important to increase its performance and improve the removal efficiency of different pollutants. This research was carried out in Lake Manzala Engineered Wetland (LMEW) which was constructed to treat 25,000 m(3) / day of the polluted drainage water in Eastern Delta. The main goal of this research is studying the impact of water temperature on performance and operation of LMEW, and determine the best applied flow rate in winter and summer seasons considering temperature variation using PreWet program. The study concluded that the temperature variation affects the wetland performance and operation where the water flow rate could be increased than the design value by 27% in winter months and reduced by 26% in summer months. Also, the application of the new recommended water flow rate improved the removal efficiency of the studied parameters (FC, BOD, TP and total TSS) with percentage varied between 11.7% and 25.8% in winter and with percentage varied from 3.5% to 27.7% in summer.

Physicochemical and biological dynamics in a coastal Antarctic lake as it transitions from frozen to open water	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Pony Lake, at Cape Royds, Antarctica, is a shallow, eutrophic, coastal lake that freezes solid in the winter. Changes in Pony Lake's physicochemical parameters and microbial community were studied during the transition from ice to open water. Due to rising water temperatures, the progressive melt of the ice column and the gradual mixing of basal brines into the remaining water column, Pony Lake evolved physically and chemically over the course of the summer, thereby affecting the microbial community composition. Temperature, pH, conductivity, nutrients and major ion concentrations reached their maximum in January. Pony Lake was colonized by bacteria, viruses, phytoflagellates, ciliates, and a small number of rotifers. Primary and bacterial production were highest in mid-December (2.66 mg C l(-1) d(-1) and 30.5 mu g C l(-1) d(-1), respectively). A 16S rRNA gene analysis of the bacterioplankton revealed 34 unique sequences dominated by members of the beta-and gamma-proteobacteria lineages. Cluster analyses on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) banding patterns and community structure indicated a shift in the dominant members of the microbial community during the transition from winter ice, to early, and late summer lakewater. Our data demonstrate that temporal changes in physicochemical parameters during the summer months determine community dynamics and mediate changes in microbial species composition.

Determination of water quality Vichuquen Lake, using satellite images Landsat 8, sensor OLI, year 2016, Chile.	REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION												Trophic structure deterioration in continental water bodies (lakes and damps) has been a growing problem during the last years. Numerous factors, either natural or man-made contribute in value increments of various water quality indexes ranging toward eutrophication. Our study had objective to use remote sensing as complementary tool to study the spatial distribution and dynamics of Lake Vichuquen water quality parameters in two seasons of 2016 through the use of two satellite images of the Landsat 8 OLI sensor, with in situ and laboratory data. The Chl-a and Z(SD) parameters were estimated from multiple linear regression models. The results indicate that the trophic state of Lake Vichuquen corresponds to a eutrophic level in summer and mesotrophic in autumn. The laboratory analyzes establish for the summer and autumn season that the Chl-a data oscillate between 14.1 and 5.5 mu g/l and for the Z(SD) between 3.7 and 2.5 m respectively. The increase in the levels of eutrophication of Lake Vichuquen is influenced in the first place by the seasonality and secondly by the different land uses that accelerate this type of processes; such as the plantations of radiata pine and eucalyptus, the agricultural activities and the urban areas surrounding the lake. The mean square error for each variable and each season varied in Chl-a in summer and another year 0.74 and 0.01 mu g/l and Z(SD) 0.16 m respectively.					; Pérez-Martínez, Waldo/ABG-1049-2021; Briceño-de-Urbaneja, Idania/AAR-5707-2020	Perez-Martinez, Waldo/0000-0002-3670-6190; 													1133-0953	1988-8740				DEC	2018		52					67	78		10.4995/raet.2018.10126	http://dx.doi.org/10.4995/raet.2018.10126													WOS:000454312900007

Heterotrophic flagellates dominated grazing at all times, accounting for 49-81% of grazing on an areal basis and up to 98% of grazing at some depths. Pigmented (mixotrophic) flagellates were major grazers during winter and spring blooms, when they contributed up to 45% of community grazing on an areal basis and 79% at depths of maximum abundance. In late spring to early summer, rotifers and ciliates were responsible for as much as 25 and 30% of bacterivory at some depths, but averaged 3 and 11% over the year, respectively. Grazing impact of cladoceran crustaceans was generally <1% of the total. Bacteriovory by copepods was not detected. Total bacterial mortality due to grazing ranged from 11 to 162% of bacterial cell production estimated from the incorporation of [3H]thymidine. Use of 0.57-.mu.m microspheres as tracers gave similar estimates of ingestion to fluorescently labeled bacteria in this system. The use of 4% ice-cold glutaraldehyde mixed 1 : 1 with the water sample was found to be equally effective to an acrolein-tannic acid mixture for reducing egestion of particles by protists. We therefore consider our findings to be representative of bacterivory by the planktonic community in this eutrophic system.

Predation by young of the year alewife reduced the mean body length of cladoceran and copepod biomass from spring to summer in alewife lakes, while mean body length remained unchanged in nonalewife lakes. Cladoceran biomass decreased substantially from spring to summer in 3 of 4 alewife lakes, increasing only in the most eutrophic lake. Conversely, cladoceran biomass increased from spring to summer in 3 of 4 nonalewife lakes. Predation by alewife on zooplankton did not have consistent cascading effects on phytoplankton biomass. Analysis of planktonic biomass ratios (phytoplankton biomass: zooplankton biomass) suggests that cascading effects were stronger in oligotrophic systems and weakened with increasing trophic status, as ratios in alewife and nonalewife lakes converged at higher total phosphorous levels. Our results suggest that lake trophic status may influence the relative importance of top-down control of both zooplankton and phytoplankton biomass. The mechanisms that explain this pattern remain elusive and likely require additional efforts to estimate alewife densities, rates of zooplankton and phytoplankton production relative to consumption, and the influence of other physical lake features.					; Simon, Kevin/CAH-1516-2022; Demi, Libertario/L-5366-2018	Simon, Kevin/0000-0002-9537-2450; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				OCT	2015	758	1					47	59		10.1007/s10750-015-2264-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-015-2264-7													WOS:000359400700005

Characterizations of the light-scattering attributes of mineral particles in Lake Ontario and the effects of whiting	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Light-scattering attributes of minerogenic particles from the upper waters of Lake Ontario, collected lake-wide from pelagic waters in late 2007 summer and early 2008 spring cruises and over the summer interval at a near-shore site in 2008, were characterized by scanning electron microscopy interfaced with automated image and X-ray analyses (SAX). SAX results were used to estimate minerogenic scattering and backscattering coefficients (b(m) and b(b,m)) through Mie theory. Two minerogenic particle regimes with respect to light scattering were resolved: (1) clay mineral dominance and (2) dominance by 'whiting' (CaCO3 precipitate) in late summer in portions of the lake. Clay minerals made noteworthy and important contributions to overall particulate scattering and backscattering coefficients (b(p) and b(bp), respectively) in spring and early summer. Dramatic increases in values of b(p), and particularly b(bp), as well as decreases in Secchi disk depth (SD), were observed during whiting from the associated large increases in b(m) and b(b,m). Features of these events were the primary drivers of the spatial patterns in late summer and temporal differences observed for scattering and SD. Particles in the size range of 1-10 mu m were responsible for minerogenic scattering during stratification, but those with sizes >10 mu m made noteworthy contributions at certain sites during spring turnover. The credibility of the SAX-Mie estimates of b(m) and b(b,m) was supported by the extent of optical closure obtained with paired bulk measurements of overall b(p) and b(bp) (2007 summer cruise), and independent estimates of organic particulate scattering and backscattering through empirical bio-optical models.

Growth rates from both back-calculation, and the Gompertz model, indicated an asymptote near the end of the summer, and average summer growth rates of 0.77 and 0.70 mm/day, respectively. The Gompertz model gave the best fit (n=201, r=0.744) with an L infinity of 85.4 mm TL, and instantaneous growth rate, g, of 0.0264. Back-counting daily growth increments allowed us to show that broods of young fish were produced throughout the summer, from late May to mid August, with maximum hatch taking place in mid-July. The species is a "batch" (serial) spawner, with only a fraction of the eggs ripening in the ovary and being released at as yet undetermined intervals. Eggs of the larger immature fish in the first summer developed from 0.05 to 0.21 mm in diameter (preserved) by fall, and in mature fish of the following spring and summer, developed to 1.2 mm in diameter (preserved), 1.4 mm fresh, at spawning. Attached to each egg was a filament averaging 2.0 cm in length, adhesive in nature, and presumably for attachment to vegetation. The egg also had microscopic hairs on its surface. No evidence was found to support temperature-dependant sex determination, nor were embryos or sperm found in the ovaries of spawning females, unlike Labidesthes sicculus vanhyningi, (the southern subspecies) which has internal fertilization. The Canadian species possesses a genital papilla through which the eggs were released, and an apparently much smaller male genital papilla than the southern subspecies.																			0378-1909					AUG	2008	82	4					421	431		10.1007/s10641-007-9304-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-007-9304-8													WOS:000258062300010

While habitat destruction has been proposed as a key reason forcing waterbirds to move from natural habitats to agricultural habitats, few have used long-term data to test this hypothesis. The Siberian crane (Leucogeranus leucogeranus) is an IUCN Critically Endangered species. About 98% of its global population winters at Poyang Lake, China. Recently, many cranes shifted from feeding in natural wetlands to agricultural habitats. Here, we integrate bird surveys,Vallisneriatuber (the traditional food of cranes in natural wetlands) surveys, water level data, and remotely sensed images from 1999 to 2016 to explore the drivers of this habitat shift. Changes in Siberian crane numbers in natural wetlands and agricultural fields indicated that the habitat shift occurred in the winters of 2015-2016. Analyses using generalized linear mixed models suggested that crane numbers in natural wetlands were positively related to tuber density and the interaction between dry season (October-March) water level and tuber density. The changes in tuber density and dry season water level in 2015-2016 indicated that tuber disappearance may have been the primary driver of the habitat shift, with a smaller effect of high water level. Submerged plants at Poyang Lake have degraded seriously in the past two decades. The plant degradation at Shahu Lake, a sublake of Poyang Lake, may have been caused by high spring water, high winter temperature, and low summer temperature. However, the drivers of tuber disappearance at Poyang Lake may not be restricted to these variables. Because Poyang Lake is an important refuge for many waterbirds in the Yangtze River floodplain, it is urgent to take effective measures to restore its submerged plants and ecosystem health. Agricultural fields can be important refuges for Siberian cranes, mitigating the negative impacts of wetland deterioration.					; Zhao, Bin/I-3651-2013	Fraser, James/0000-0002-8653-1333; Liu, Yifei/0000-0003-0404-5321													2045-7758					OCT	2020	10	20					11055	11068		10.1002/ece3.6720	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.6720		SEP 2020						33144948					WOS:000564480200001

However, the response of aquatic systems to decreasing wind speeds has received little attention. We examined the effects of a long-term decrease in wind speed on shallow, eutrophic Lake Taihu, China's third largest lake, by combining high-frequency monitoring, long-term meteorological and water quality data with short-term laboratory sediment nutrient release experiments. The annual mean wind speed showed a significant decreasing trend and the maximum continuous days with wind speed <3 m/s increased significantly from 1996 to 2017. The high-frequency monitoring data showed that bottom water hypoxia occurred occasionally in summer and autumn. The water quality data combined with the experimental results suggest that lower wind speed and longer low wind duration can enhance the release of phosphorus (P) from the sediments and increase nitrogen (N) losses, likely via denitrification, because a longer stability period leads to lower dissolved oxygen concentrations near the lake bottom. The results of Bayesian functional Linear regression with Sparse Step functions (Bliss) indicated that wind speed during spring and summer strongly affected chlorophyll a (Chla) concentrations in the summer by enhancing the release of nutrients from the sediments. The results of the structural equation models indicated that declined wind speed might increase phytoplankton biomass (as Chla) by altering nutrient availability. Increasing water temperatures and decreasing wind speeds synergistically enhance water column stability, which may offset some of the immediate benefits of reductions in external nutrient loading by enhancing internal loading. Given predicted global change, it will become increasingly important to reduce the external nutrient loading for overall improvement of water quality in this and other shallow eutrophic lakes.

J	Hamblin, PF; He, C				Hamblin, PF; He, C			Numerical models of the exchange flows between Hamilton Harbour and Lake Ontario	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING												Accurate simulations of the flow and the transport of water quality constituents in such coastal zones of large lakes as the western end of Lake Ontario and Hamilton Harbour are needed to assess the impact on pollutant levels of cleanup operations and sewage diversions. Coastal models in temperate zone lakes are classified in terms of density stratification, uniform in winter and stratified during summer.,During the winter period a 1-D model of the flow between a lake and adjacent harbour is shown to agree favourably with advanced acoustic measurements of the flow in the connecting passage, but does not account for the observed winter buildup of salinity in the harbour. A calibrated 2-D hydrodynamic and salt transport model is used to show that significant exchange does not take place unless the excursion of the inflow is several times greater than the length of the connecting channel, an infrequent occurrence. The exchange is also shown to depend on the flow field at the entrances of the channel. In summer a I-D vertical model illustrates the dramatic effect of the inflow from Lake Ontario on hypolimnetic temperatures of the harbour. Three-dimensional hydrodynamic and temperature-salt transport models are validated by extensive field observations taken in 1996. The stratified exchange is much stronger than its winter counterpart and more steady. Winter exchange is forced by short-term water level fluctuations, whereas summer or stratified exchange by slowly fluctuating density contrasts between the two water bodies.																			0315-1468	1208-6029				FEB	2003	30	1					168	180		10.1139/L02-076	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/L02-076													WOS:000182266300016

Excluding livestock access to farm dams reduces methane emissions and boosts water quality	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Farm dams, also known as 'agricultural ponds', are ubiquitous features of agricultural landscapes globally. Those accessed by livestock have high methane (CH4) emissions per unit area relative to other freshwater systems. Fencing dams and installing water troughs to prevent livestock from entering the dams are promising strategies to improve water quality and substantially reduce their carbon footprints. However, previous studies only measured the effects of fencing on methane diffusive emissions without considering ebullitive fluxes (i.e., methane bubbles), which is often the dominant emission pathway in smaller water bodies. Also, data is lacking on how the benefits of fencing farm dams vary across seasons. Using Australia as a test case, this study investigates the benefit of fencing off farm dams by monitoring total CH4 (diffusion + ebullition) and carbon dioxide (CO2) in summer and winter. Fenced dams had 72 % lower CH4 emissions in summer and 92 % lower in winter than unfenced dams. Similarly, CO2-equivalent (CO2 + CH4) fluxes were lower in fenced dams by 59 % in summer and 73 % in winter. Fenced dams had higher water quality, with 51 % less total dissolved nitrogen, 57 % less phosphorous, and 23-49 % more dissolved oxygen. Average daily air temperature was a key predictor of CH4 emissions from farm dams, underscoring the importance of considering temporal dynamics for estimating yearly farm dam emissions. We confirmed that excluding livestock from entering farm dams using fences significantly mitigates CH4 emissions and enhances water quality, and these benefits are maintained seasonally.					; Malerba, Martino/LIA-7890-2024	Malerba, Martino E./0000-0002-7480-4779; Macreadie, Peter/0000-0001-7362-0882													0048-9697	1879-1026				NOV 15	2024	951								175420	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.175420	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.175420		AUG 2024						39128522					WOS:001298075400001
J	BIRCH, PB; SPYRIDAKIS, DE				BIRCH, PB; SPYRIDAKIS, DE			NITROGEN AND PHOSPHORUS RECYCLING IN LAKE SAMMAMISH, A TEMPERATE MESOTROPHIC LAKE	HYDROBIOLOGIA												This paper presents N and P budgets for spring and summer for the trophogenic (0-9 m) and tropholytic (9-27 m) zones of Lake Sammamish. The objective of constructing the budgets is to evaluate the efficiency of nutrient recycling and increase knowledge of the overall nutrient dynamics. The budgets reveal that uptake and solubilization are the dominant fluxes and that nutrient recycling is generally efficient, with the possible exception of early spring during the diatom bloom. This leads to greater reductions in the dissolved N and P pools in spring than summer. Sedimentation is greater in spring because of a pulse immediately following the diatom bloom. Solubilization of particulates is much less in the tropholytic zone than the trophogenic zone. This is due to slower decomposition rates there and to the efficiency of solubilization in the overlying trophogenic zone which results in a relatively small particulate influx. Turnover times for the N and P pools are therefore much faster in the trophogenic zone than in the tropholytic zone. In the trophogenic zone, the dissolved N pool turns over much more slowly than the dissolved P pool because of its larger size relative to algal growth requirements. Overall there is a net loss of N and P from the water column in spring primarily due to sedimentation and denitrification. In summer there is a small net gain because of sediment release and a slight excess of inflow over outflow.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1981	80	2					129	138		10.1007/BF00008431	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008431													WOS:A1981LR19400003

Sediments of lakes Volvi, Doirani, and Kerkini, located in northern Greece, were collected in two-time periods (fall/winter 2010 and spring/summer 2011) and analyzed, applying the developed analytical methodology. Microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) was applied to extract the pesticide residues from lake sediment samples. Analytical results were stored, categorized, and visualized using geographical information systems, in order to assess and observe spatial and temporal variations of the pollution. Main pesticides that were detected included the following: amitrole, tebuconazole, phoxim, diniconazole, sethoxydim, temephos, tetrachlorvinphos, pendimethalin, boscalid, disulfoton sulfone, lenacil, propiconazole, cycloxydim, pyridaben, and terbuthylazine. Amitrole, diniconazole, and tebuconazole were found to be common in all three lakes. Lakes Kerkini and Doirani exhibited increased concentrations during the first sampling period (winter 2010) with predominant pesticide classes, triazines/triazoles and organophosphates. Pollution is mainly located near the populated villages of the lakes and the nearby cultivations. During the second sampling period, pesticide concentrations appear lower and located in sediments near the center of the lake. Lake Volvi exhibits increased pesticide concentrations during the second sampling period, temporal and spatial variations and different pesticide profile pattern. Increased pollution occurs near the center of the lake during the first sampling period, mainly comprised by triazines/triazoles and organophosphates. During the second sampling period, the majority of the sediment samples demonstrated a different pesticide profile dominated by unclassified pesticides and triazines/triazoles. Mineralogical analysis of the samples demonstrates that sediments are mainly composed of clay, mud, and sand particles, and they present spatial variations. Near the center of the lakes, sediments appear to be more fine-grained with higher clay content and are more likely to adsorb pesticides.

Although coastal waterbirds tend to use artificial habitats around tidal flats as roosting sites during high-tide, it remains unclear whether the importance of surrounding habitats relative to tidal flats varies among landscape types, seasons, species, or tidal conditions. The Black-faced Spoonbill (Platalea minor) and Eurasian Spoonbill (P. leucorodia) are two closely related sympatric species in East Asia with narrow and wide distribution ranges and habitat requirements, respectively. We therefore expect that both species will use surrounding artificial habitats across seasons at high tides, but Blackfaced Spoonbills will use them less frequently than Eurasian Spoonbills. Here, we address these hypotheses in the Imazu tidal flat and its surrounding environments in southern Japan. We investigated the habitat use and behavioral patterns of both species through route and behavioral surveys during the fall migration and wintering seasons in 2021. We found that both species used surrounding habitats including artificial ones more frequently than the tidal flat regardless of the tidal condition or season, but spoonbills used these habitats more frequently in winter than in autumn. We also found that Eurasian Spoonbills foraged in surrounding artificial habitats more frequently than Black-faced Spoonbills. These results not only demonstrate how coastal waterbirds exploit surrounding habitats relative to tidal flats but also suggest that the importance of surrounding habitats varies among species and seasons. Our study thus emphasizes that valuing and managing surrounding habitats in addition to tidal flats are key to conserving globally declining waterbirds.

J	Ricker, KE				Ricker, KE			Flora was his interest and prime course of study: A botanical career for W.E.!Ricker disappears	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Bill Ricker's career went through many twists in his academic years. He had taken botany in his senior matriculation year at high school and he had collected over 100 species of flora before commencement of university life. At the conclusion of his first university year, he set out over the summer to collect a much larger sample of species, primarily from the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence ecoregion, to fulfil a requirement for a second year botany course (spermatophytes). He identified about 390 species, and some 254 were collected and pooled with those from previous years to make a final submission of 354 spermatophyte species. Field plant identification continued in each academic year thereafter, in concert with collections and identifications of aquatic invertebrates in his summer projects while under the employment of the Ontario Fisheries Research Laboratory. At the conclusion of his undergraduate years, Bill had taken more courses in botany than in zoology, and it was the summer employment that had really prepared him for postgraduate work in fisheries biology, which was ecologically oriented. When Bill left Ontario in the autumn of 1931 he had identified over 600 species of plants, excluding lower cryptogams, but including many aquatic species of higher plants. In western North America Bill's botanical career began at Cultus Lake in 1931. He again studied all aspects of the basin while employed with the federal government, and from the work he assembled a Ph.D. thesis. At the time of thesis completion he had identified over 300 species of flora, including alpine plants at timberline, 1500 - 1800 m above lake level, and planktonic algae in its water column. In 1939, after more field fisheries work in the Fraser River basin of British Columbia, Bill accepted a position with the biological staff at Indiana University. In this period which concluded in 1950 he identified another 50 - 110 species of flora, all in the Carolinian ecoregion, and hitherto not seen by him. Considering all floral classes, Bill's eastern North American repertoire had by then added up to 791 species, representative of more than 112 families of plants. Returning west for the remainder of his life, new identifications elsewhere added to his Cultus Lake list which slowly added up to about 1000 species for the west coastal region of North America. Flora was also identified elsewhere in the mid-continental region of North America, in Eurasia where the Abisko region of Lappland was a highlight, and in South America and New Zealand. Records of his botanical prowess, were kept primarily in his diaries, which began in 1923 and were maintained consistently to the end of 1934, and thereafter intermittently to 1949. The diaries reveal that his career as a budding botanist was subtly hijacked by a wily Professor W.H.K. Harkness in the rival Biology Department who out-manoeuvred Drs. R.B. Thompson and R.A. Sifton in the Botany Department. The former always managed to employ Bill in summer and keep him occupied in the department's labs during the autumn and winter and spring, tying up any free time when the botanist had approached him on lab work. Certainly, the botany courses taken and which he excelled at were more appropriate for his aquatic ecological pursuits. Salesmanship won the day for the zoologists, but Bill was a life-long botanist regardless of whatever else he studied or managed throughout his professional career. The last days of his life had a botanical conclusion.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				JAN	2006	75	1					39	72		10.1007/s10641-005-2442-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-005-2442-y													WOS:000236958800003
J	Çelekli, A; Sachin, G				Celekli, Abuzer; Sachin, Gulseren			Bio-assessment of wastewater effluent conditions with algal pollution index and multivariate approach	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Water scarcity and water pollution are important issues in the world. Therefore, reusing treated wastewater for irrigation can be a crucial approach in arid and semi-arid regions. There are still some concerns about the sustainability of wastewater irrigated agriculture. Thereby, the present study is aimed to evaluate responses of algal species to stressors in the central wastewater treatment plant using the modified algae pollution index and multivariate approaches to assess healthy sustainability of wastewater effluent quality and to give the suggestion for reusing such kind of waters, especially for irrigation. Samplings of water and algae were carried out twice a month between October 2019 and August 2020. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) explained 94.1% of the relationships between environmental factors and species. Water and air temperatures, precipitation, chemical oxygen demand (COD), electrical conductivity (EC), pH, and NO3 played important roles in the temporal occurrence/succession of algae composition in the wastewater treatment plant. Ordination of commonly encountered algae species relatively near the center of the CCA indicates their wide range of tolerance levels to the changes in environmental conditions in the system. Of the species, Navicula aitchelbee, Nitzschia fonticola, and Euglena oxyuris preferred high EC levels; Brachysira exilis, Chlorella vulgaris, G. parvulum, and C. ovata associated with high COD levels, and Navicula tripunctata, Nitzschia umbonata and C. vulgaris related to high NO3 levels (>75% of the percentile). The modified pollution index developed in the present study indicated that the wastewater treatment plant had mainly high organic pollution (>3.00) in the summer and fall seasons, when it had moderate organic pollution (>2.50) in the winter and spring seasons. Results of the study suggest that crucial algae-stressors relationships can be used as an assessment tool to ensure sustainable water supply for the irrigation purpose in arid and semi-arid regions.

J	Marjani, A; Jamali, M				Marjani, Aliasghar; Jamali, Mirmosadegh			Role of exchange flow in salt water balance of Urmia Lake	DYNAMICS OF ATMOSPHERES AND OCEANS												In this paper we examine how exchange flow in Urmia Lake plays a crucial role in dynamics of the lake. Urmia Lake, a very large hypersaline lake of high ecological significance, is located in northwest of Iran with a 15-km causeway dividing it into north and south lakes. A 1250-m opening in the causeway near the east coast links the two lakes. The differences in mean water levels and densities of the two lakes increase in spring due to large freshwater inflows into the south lake. High evaporation dominates the lake in summer. By incorporating the results of a two-layer hydraulics theory into a mixing model of the lake, we show that the exchange flow through the opening diminishes the water level and salinity differences of the two lakes and hence helps restoration of the pre-construction state of the lake by the end of fall. The model results are confirmed by the field data. The north-south and south-north flows through the opening are equal in most of the year, except in spring when the south-north flow is greater due to the head difference of the two lakes.

The increasing Aphanizomenon biomass in a lake in which phytoplankton are generally phosphate limited in summer and autumn was accompanied by high enzymatic activity of alkaline phosphatase, reaching values of 2830 nmol MU l(-1) h(-1), suggesting a great demand for phosphorus. In addition, the nitrogen requirement of the developing population of Aphanizomenon was partly provided by nitrogen fixation, as indicated by a high percentage of heterocysts. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that filtrate from an old Peridinium gatunense culture enhanced Aphanizomenon growth. Thus, it is postulated that the degradation of the massive Peridinium bloom in spring and early summer supported the development of A.ovalisporum. The high pH and alkalinity during the bloom of Aphanizomenon indicate that A.ovalisporum is probably a HCO3- user. After 1994, akinetes of A.ovalisporum were left in sediments and the water column, and could be a source for the next year's bloom. This possibility was demonstrated by inoculation of lake water and sediments into nitrogen-depleted BG-11 medium, resulting in the dominance of A.ovalisporum.

Modelling the effects of nutrient loads reduction and testing the N and P control paradigm in a German shallow lake	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												The current work presents a modelling approach to tackle water quality issues in the Lower Havel, Germany. The Lower Havel located in the northeast of Germany, near Berlin, is a region with several shallow riverine lakes interconnected with river sections and artificial canals. The surface waters receive nutrients from treated urban effluent and from the catchment dominated by agriculture. The models HYDRAX and QSim were used to study eutrophication control viability by manipulating nutrients external loads. Namely, to investigate if reducing nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) simultaneously would contribute more to improve the trophic state than using the strategy of just reducing one of the nutrients. The results show that a successful water quality management implies not only reducing external loads of P but also considering internal loads. Reducing N external loads has no significant impact in this ecosystem but is advisable to minimize N emissions to the eutrophic coastal area. A combined reduction of N and P loads was not found to have benefits over a reduction of just P. Reducing P external loads significantly reduces phytoplankton spring blooms and contributes to lowering P accumulated in sediments. However, according to our results phytoplankton in late summer and fall largely depends on internal loads and the P accumulated in the sediments.

Water quality in such lakes varies with hydrodynamic variations; however, their relationship is not clear. To identify the unique relationship between water level and water quality in river-connected lakes, we used the comprehensive pollution index (CPI) and regression analysis to analyze the spatiotemporal variation in water quality in Dongting Lake from 2015 to 2018 and the effects of water level on water quality. Four water quality parameters were selected: total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), permanganate index (CODMn), and chlorophyll a (Chl-a). The results showed significant spatial variation in the lake water quality, with relatively high concentrations of TN, TP, CODMn, and Chl-a in East Dongting Lake. TN and TP decreased by 12.15% and 37.61%, respectively, from 2015 to 2018, whereas CODMn increased from 1.781 to 2.009 mg/L. Seasonally, TN and TP concentrations were low in the summer and autumn, with high concentrations in the winter and spring. In contrast, CODMn and Chl-a concentrations exhibited opposite trends. The pollution level in Dongting Lake ranged between slightly and moderately polluted, with a CPI ranging from 0.76 to 1.32 across all sampling sites during 2015-2018. The water level in Dongting Lake initially increased and, then, decreased in a year, with marked WLFs owing to seasonal shifts in precipitation and human activities. The water level had significant negative relationships with TN and TP concentrations and a significant positive relationship with CODMn concentration (p < 0.05). Based on the results, strict control of excessive external nutrient loading should be actively implemented in Dongting Lake, in addition to hydrological regulation for effective lake water quality management.					; LI, feng/HIR-1703-2022; YANG, NAN/HQZ-5508-2023	, Xinsheng/0000-0002-3720-247X; Chen, Xin-sheng/0009-0009-6601-8725; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				FEB	2022	29	10					14083	14097		10.1007/s11356-021-16739-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16739-5		OCT 2021						34601677					WOS:000702813700012

We compared responses of zebra and quagga mussels from southwestern Lake Erie and zebra mussel from the Ohio River at Louisville, Kentucky. Experimental increases in temperature significantly enhanced growth rates in fall - early winter but not during summer - early fall. Elevated temperatures increased mortality in the warm season but not in the cool season. Zr:bra mussel survived better (especially the Ohio River population) than did quagga mussel at high temperatures. Inorganic turbidity had few detectable effects; relationships, where significant, varied with temperature and species. Based on these experiments and related laboratory studies, we predict that populations of Dreissena in the Ohio River and farther south will suffer overall if water temperatures increase. In contrast, more northern populations of Dreissena will probably benefit from predicted climatic change and may extend their range to higher latitudes and altitudes.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JAN	1998	55	1					220	229		10.1139/cjfas-55-1-220	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-55-1-220													WOS:000072907600021
J	BARNES, NE; BODALY, RA				BARNES, NE; BODALY, RA			ORIGIN AND ABUNDANCE OF LAKE WHITEFISH (COREGONUS-CLUPEAFORMIS) CONGREGATING BELOW A HYDROELECTRIC CONTROL DAM IN NORTHERN CANADA	REGULATED RIVERS-RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT												The abundance and origin of lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) congregating downstream of the Missi Falls control dam at the outlet of Southern Indian Lake (SIL) in northern Manitoba, Canada were studied during two successive open water seasons. In 1986 the number of lake whitefish below the dam increased to almost 90 000 in the autumn and most of these fish were physiologically ready to spawn. Morphological comparisons indicated that most of these fish originated from SIL and were apparently attempting to return to it. Flows through the dam in this year were high and similar to those before the diversion of the Churchill River. In 1987 there were fewer fish of SIL origin below the control dam and the numbers decreased over the summer. Discharge through the dam was much lower in 1987 than before diversion. The number of lake whitefish below the dam that appeared to originate from lakes downstream of Missi Falls on the lower Churchill River varied from 2000 to 12000 over the whole study period. These fish may have been attracted to the control dam by local environmental conditions such as cool water temperatures. The effects of the control dam on lake whitefish movements and distribution was not predicted despite extensive pre-project studies. These effects should receive more attention in the prediction of impacts of boreal hydroelectric projects.																			0886-9375					DEC	1994	9	4					295	302		10.1002/rrr.3450090409	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rrr.3450090409													WOS:A1994QF56500008

Modeling the distribution of niche space and risk for a freeze-tolerant ectotherm, Lithobates sylvaticus	ECOSPHERE												Many animals depend on stable below-the-snow (subnivium) conditions to survive winter in seasonally cold regions. Freeze-tolerant ectotherms may experience increased ice content and/or energy expenditure in suboptimal subnivium conditions, with implications for overwinter survival and body reserves available for spring reproduction. We used a novel mechanistic modeling approach to explore effects of winter climate on the microclimate conditions, energy expenditure, and ice dynamics of the freeze-tolerant, subnivium-dwelling wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) in the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes Basin region of the United States. We hypothesized that (1) frogs would experience the greatest energy cost to survive winter in southern regions of our study area, where air temperatures are warmer and shallower snow could allow for increased numbers of freeze-thaw cycles, and (2) frogs would be most vulnerable to lethal freezing in the cold, dry northwest portion of our study region. We found that total winter energy expenditure changed little with latitude because the effect of warmer soil temperatures (higher metabolic rates) to the south was offset by a shorter winter duration. Energy expenditures were greatest in the snowbelts of the Great Lakes, characterized by more persistent snow cover and relatively warm soil temperatures. In contrast, highest ice contents occurred in the northwest of the study region where air temperatures were coldest and snow was shallow. Thus, it appears that wood frogs experience a trade-off between risk of lethal ice content and extensive use of body reserves across geographic space. Simulations showed that interpopulation differences in burrow depth and cryoprotectant concentration can influence risk of lethal ice content and overuse of body reserves prior to spring breeding, and those risks vary in relation to winter climate. Our mechanistic modeling approach is a novel tool for predicting risk and shifting niche space for cold-adapted and subnivium-dependent species.

Water clarity, indexed as the depth at which photosynthetically active radiation was 1% of surface intensity, declined by 25% after 3 years. Late-summer thermoclines were about 1 m shallower in two lakes after logging, but it was not possible to exclude weather as a factor. None of the lakes showed significant declines in lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) habitat volume. A forested shoreline buffer strip around one of the lakes prevented increases in midlake wind speed but did not prevent declines in water clarity and thermocline depth.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					2000	57			2			82	91		10.1139/cjfas-57-S2-82	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-57-S2-82													WOS:000089999500009

The dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy (& epsilon;), a key parameter to quantify turbulence, also significantly affects the hydrodynamic and biochemical processes. Continuous measurements of high-frequency surface (0.50 m depth) flow velocity, meteorological data, water level and water temperature conducted in Xiangxi Bay (XXB) of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) during summer (2019/6/17-2019/6/24) and winter (2019/12/29-2020/1/4) observational period, have been used to explore the variability of surface turbulence and its possible driving factors. The results show that a two-layered flow structure was clearly visible in summer. The surface water flowed from downstream to upstream (surface intrusion currents), with an average longitudinal velocity of 0.05 m/s and 0.02 m/s during summer and winter observational periods, respectively. Meanwhile, the longitudinal velocity also showed periodic fluctuations at three different time scales, with periods of 1.80 h, 20 min and 1-3 s, respectively. The 1.80 h fluctuation was caused by the flow oscillation driven by daily discharge regulation of TGR. In addition, the surface turbulence dissipation rates varied from 10-8 W/kg to 10-4 W/kg in summer, and from 10-9 W/kg to 10-4 W/kg in winter. In XXB, the movement of surface intrusion currents is an important factor that dominates and maintains the surface turbulence, while the contribution of atmospheric forcing (wind shear and convective cooling) accounts for 27.17 % in summer but 58.95 % in winter. The diurnal water level regulation of reservoir and wind variations are co-driving forces for the diurnal differences of surface turbulence during the observational periods. Therefore, the atmospheric forces and reservoir regulation together determine the variability of surface turbulence. This study will help to deepen the understanding of the hydrodynamic process of large regulated riverine reservoirs.

The distribution pattern of marine bacterial beta-glucosidase activity (beta-GlcA) has been investigated by using fluorogenic model substrate (FMS) technique in order to have better understanding of the beta-GlcA, as well as its relation to marine bacterial biomass, productivity and environmental factors in Taiwan strait. The results showed that: (1) In summer, the average of beta-GlcA at the Southern stations of Taiwan strait was 1.94 nmol/l h. While in winter, the average of beta-GlcA at the Northern stations was 0.86 nmol/l h and the range of variation (0.34-1.89 nmol/l h) was much more narrow than that in summer (0.31-8.1 nmol/l h). (2) According to the carbon conversion factor, the beta-GlcA was 0.14 and 0.062 ugc/l h in summer and winter respectively. These beta-GlcA values were higher than the bacterial production of the two seasons respectively. (3) The beta-GlcA gradually rises from offshore water to near-shore water. (4) The correlation between the beta-GlcA and the bacterial secondary production was not so obvious. (5) The correlation between the section distributions, daily varying of the beta-GlcA and the bacterial production was not obvious. (6) In the surface water, the distribution character of free-state beta-GlcA from bacteria was equal to that of the total beta-GlcA in the whole sea area. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The population was univoltine with peaks of egg production in winter and early spring. Young from both peaks became adults in spring and aestivated as cysts. Laboratory experiments suggested that either high temperature (12.degree. C or more) or long days will inhibit egg production, but that both factors together are needed to induce encystment. Embryonic survival was low, on the average only 60%. The population was limited by low food levels in winter.

We focused on the phytoplankton diversity of 15 fishponds located in Austria. Of the 15 fishponds, 12 waterbodies are aquaculture ponds stocked with common carp, which converted to organic farming some years ago with grain as supplementary feed, and 3 ponds are used for recreational fishing. The trophic state index increased from 59 to 71 in spring to 80 to 93 in autumn and classified the ponds as mid-eutrophic to hypertrophic. The taxa number was surprisingly high (taxa richness up to 100 taxa per pond). The phytoplankton resource use efficiency was in the upper range of eutrophicated waters and did not show seasonal differences (median Chlorophyll-a/total phosphorus = 1.94, Chlorophyll-a/total nitrogen = 0.12). Linking environmental data with the algal community resulted in a distinct temporal community pattern with a significant seasonal shift from the cooler season dominated by Ochrophyta taxa to green algae as the most abundant group in summer and autumn. Our findings challenge general assumptions regarding low phytoplankton diversity with long-lasting Cyanobacteria blooms and conform to the algal dynamics described in the plankton ecology group (PEG) model for temperate shallow lakes. These man-made systems are an ecological asset, highly connected to terrestrial habitats in their vicinity and significantly contributing to the ecological health and long-term sustainability of the region.

In June 1997 a combined total of 100 adult Galerucella calmariensis (L.) and G. pusilla (Duft) were introduced into the Sanctuary in an attempt to control loosestrife. Since then, annual spring and fall monitoring has been conducted on 5/m(2) quadrats with the intention of evaluating the abundance of Galerucella spp. and their impact on loosestrife over time. Through 2000 Galerucella spp. populations increased, as did damage to loosestrife, though not to the extent of controlling its growth or seed production. During the summers of 2001 and 2002 loosestrife was decimated. Following those periods, ephemeral non-target feeding by Galerucella spp. was documented primarily on red osier (Cornus stolonifera) in 2001 and speckled alder (Alnus rugosa) in 2002 with three other species being grazed to a lesser degree. No non-target species were substantially impacted during these brief periods (<1 wk). Temporal variation in the population distribution suggests that a shortage of appropriate food may have initiated early aestivation. During the summer of 2002 Galerucella spp. were found 9 km off-site, believed to result from a single-season dispersal, suggesting a mobility of a greater extent than previously recorded.																			0003-0031	1938-4238				OCT	2004	152	2					248	254		10.1674/0003-0031(2004)152[0248:RONFAB]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1674/0003-0031(2004)152[0248:RONFAB]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000224402500005

An early Holocene wet period in the southwestern United States	GEOLOGY												Multiple generations of spring-fed streams traversed similar to 800 km2 of the Las Vegas Valley in southern Nevada between ca. 10.9 ka and 8.5 ka, depositing an extensive tufa network. The scale of this network and diversity of tufa morphologies is novel in North America and offers an opportunity to obtain quantitative paleoclimate data for the region during the early Holocene. We determined isotopic compositions and estimated past temperatures using clumped isotope data from early Holocene tufa on the valley floor (698 m) as well as tufa forming today at higher elevation in the nearby Spring Mountains at Cold Creek Spring (1856 m). Modern and fossil tufa yielded comparably low delta 18O values, implying that source waters for both were derived from high-elevation winter precipitation. Clumped isotope temperatures of modern tufa average 15.8 +/- 2.5 degrees C, aligning with mean summer temperatures of the emergent spring water, and indicate equilibrium conditions of tufa formation. The early Holocene tufa yielded similar clumped isotope temperatures, averaging 15.2 +/- 3.9 degrees C, meaning it precipitated at temperatures that occur at much higher elevations today. The Las Vegas tufa record, combined with nearby and temporally correlative paleospring and lacustrine records, suggest that cool/wet conditions prevailed throughout the Mojave Desert during the early Holocene. These records also demonstrate that spring ecosystems responded to millennial-scale hydroclimate variations that supersede climate change driven solely by insolation. The previously unrecognized pattern of ecosystem response to hydroclimate documented here may assist in understanding climate drivers for the early Holocene and provide critical information for the fate of groundwater-dependent ecosystems in the southwestern United States.																			0091-7613	1943-2682				2025 MAY 2	2025										10.1130/G53174.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/G53174.1		MAY 2025											WOS:001511755900001

The management goal was to triple the biomass of walleye adults (>17.5 in). Fry were stocked at 2,000/acre (1984-1995) and 3,000/acre (1996-1999), extensively reared fingerlings were stocked at 10/acre (1984-1990), and intensively reared fingerlings were stocked at 5/acre (1985-1999). Spring- and fall-stocked fingerlings were also compared during 1992-1999. Fry stockings were highly variable, but produced large year-classes in 1985, 1986, 1993, 1995. 1997, and 1998. October samplings of fingerlings, which originated from fry stockings, yielded 9-27 fish/acre. Intensively reared fingerling survival was about four times greater than that of the smaller, extensively reared fingerlings. Survival of spring-stocked fingerlings was higher than that of fall-stocked fingerlings in 3 of 5 years. Findings from this investigation were used to develop walleye management strategies for Rathbun Lake. Walleye culture and stocking protocols for fingerlings and fry should be guided by water-body-specific angler demand, production economics, and survival characteristics.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				AUG	2002	22	3					1007	1013		10.1577/1548-8675(2002)022<1007:EOWFAF>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8675(2002)022<1007:EOWFAF>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000177486800034
J	Sánchez-Carrillo, S; Alvarez-Cobelas, M				Sánchez-Carrillo, S; Alvarez-Cobelas, M			Nutrient dynamics and eutrophication patterns in a semi-arid wetland:: The effects of fluctuating hydrology	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												A three-year study was carried out in Las Tablas de Daimiel National Park, a Spanish semi-arid wetland, to describe eutrophication patterns and the responses of the main primary producers in contrasting inundation years. Total and dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus, phytoplankton chlorophyll-a (monthly) and emergent macrophyte cover (yearly) were measured together with water levels. Water balances were taken to assess phosphorus and nitrogen annual nutrient budgets. The wetland could be termed hypertrophic. Nutrients displayed distinct seasonality because nitrogen peaked both in winter and summer, whereas phosphorus did so in late spring and early summer. A reduction in both total nitrogen and phosphorus in humid years due to higher water levels was also observed. An important spatial heterogeneity in nutrient content occurred throughout the study, part of which could be ascribed to hydrological fluctuations since the input site showed higher mean values in rainy years. Mass balances suggested that sedimentation played a key role in nutrient dynamics, with macrophyte leaching and waterfowl additions being minor sources. Internal loading was much higher than external loading in this wetland, thereby being responsible for higher sedimentation rates. Phytoplankton chlorophyll-a displayed seasonality, with peaks in late summer, when macrophyte activity was decreasing. No relationship between either chlorophyll-a and nutrients or hydrological conditions could be ascertained for most sampling stations and years of study. However, the water level-dependent, emergent macrophyte sawgrass (Cladium mariscus) presented a statistically significant relationship with both nitrogen and phosphorus. Our results demonstrate that macrophytes must be taken into account in wetland eutrophication models. A conceptual model comparing the responses of primary producers to eutrophication in lakes and wetlands is outlined.					; Sanchez-Carrillo, Salvador/L-1098-2014	SANCHEZ-CARRILLO, SALVADOR/0000-0002-5471-977X; 													0049-6979					OCT	2001	131	1-4					97	118		10.1023/A:1011903300635	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1011903300635													WOS:000171302500007

Seasonal pattern of depth selection in smallmouth bass	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												The current study used a stationary acoustic telemetry array to monitor the depth selection of adult smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu in a large, oligotrophic lake in Ontario, Canada. At an annual scale, smallmouth bass demonstrated regular, seasonal changes in inhabited depths: fish occupied shallow water during the summer (2-5 m depth) and descended to deeper water (12-15 m depth) during winter under ice. Smallmouth bass remained above the thermocline in the summer, seasonal depth patterns did not vary across fish size and movements to and from seasonal depths were closely linked to the development and degradation of the thermocline. At finer time scales, smallmouth bass exhibited diel vertical migrations in summer, with fish moving to < 2 m at night, and then descending to 3-5 m during the day. This pattern remained constant during the summer period examined, and varied with size such that larger fish remained deeper than smaller fish. During winter, depth did not vary across the 3-month monitoring period (c. 14 m), but small (< 2 m) changes in depth were observed periodically, suggesting limited movements were occurring. Results are further discussed in the context of climate change and reproductive success for this species.

Decreased nitrogen loading controls summer cyanobacterial blooms without promoting nitrogen-fixing taxa: Long-term response of a shallow lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The effectiveness of controlling nitrogen (N) to manage lake eutrophication is debated. Long-term, whole-lake case studies are required to determine whether diazotrophic cyanobacteria can fix sufficient N to offset a reduction of N-inputs. We document the recovery of shallow, productive Lake Muggelsee (Germany) over 37 yr (sampling interval 1-2 weeks) during a decrease of N and phosphorus (P) loading of 79% and 69%, respectively. Nitrogen concentrations in the lake responded immediately to loading reduction whereas P concentrations remained elevated for about 20 yr. Total nitrogen (TN) in the lake was always lower than TN in the inflow. Accordingly, estimated denitrification and N-burial rates substantially exceeded N-2 fixation rates in the long term. Phosphorus was growth limiting in spring whereas N was clearly limiting in summer due to high sediment P-release. TN : TP ratios, normalized to phytoplankton biovolume by regression, were 25.5 (weight) in spring and 3.3 in summer. During the study period, dissolved inorganic N (DIN) concentrations in summer decreased and the duration of low DIN concentrations increased by ca. 100 d. The biovolume of cyanobacteria and total phytoplankton decreased by 89% and 76%, respectively. The proportion of N-2-fixing cyanobacteria during summer decreased from 36% to 14% of the total phytoplankton biovolume. The total concentration of heterocysts and estimated total N-2 fixation did not change over time. In the long term, decreasing N-inputs effectively controlled summer cyanobacteria including N-2-fixing taxa, which did not compensate for the N-deficit. A P-only control strategy would not have been as successful.					; Shatwell, Tom/K-2937-2013; Shatwell, Tom/ABF-1308-2020; Köhler, Jan/C-2633-2014	Kohler, Jan/0000-0003-1894-2912; Shatwell, Tom/0000-0002-4520-7916; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2019	64			1	SI		S166	S178		10.1002/lno.11002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11002													WOS:000456164100014

In this study we investigated breast muscle size in relation to body mass in garden warblers Sylvia borin before and after crossing the Sahara desert and the Mediterranean Sea in autumn and spring migration, respectively. Breast muscle size was measured by moulding the shape of the muscles of live birds. Samples were collected on the Greek island of Antikythira during spring after the barrier crossing and on Crete during autumn, where garden warblers prepare for barrier crossing on their southward migration. Breast muscle size on Antikythira was significantly smaller than the equivalent size measured on Crete. Breast muscle size followed the changes in total body mass when garden warblers had a low body mass while this relationship disappeared when body mass is above 17.5 g. The combination of low body masses and small breast muscle size of birds that have just crossed the Sahara desert and the Mediterranean Sea and landed on Antikythira indicates a severe protein break down. During extended flights, when fat reserves are insufficient, the use of protein can also be a lifeline to reach the destination. The weak association between body mass and breast muscle size during autumn implies that the increase of breast muscle, as a preparation for the barrier crossing, does not take place en route from breeding sites to the Mediterranean area.

Poyang Lake is a large shallow lake and also the largest freshwater lake in China, which is being given prominent environmental and ecological status. Poyang Lake's hydrological situation fluctuates dramatically and the spatial and temporal characteristics and influencing factors of its water exchange capacity are complicated. In this paper, water age was selected to describe the water exchange capacity of Poyang Lake, and a water age model of Poyang Lake was established. With the water age model, the spatial and temporal characteristics and influencing factors of water age of Poyang Lake were studied and the law of response of the water age to the evolution of River-Lake relationship between Yangtze River and Poyang Lake and the proposed Poyang Lake Water Conservancy Hub was analyzed. The results showed that: (1) The water age of Poyang Lake demonstrates significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity, that is, the water age in summer and autumn is obviously higher than that in winter and spring and the water age in the disc-shaped lake and lake bay area is obviously higher than that in the main river channel and beach; (2) The water stage at Hukou and catchment inflow are the main factors affecting the water age of Poyang Lake and the influence of the water stage at Hukou on the water age of Poyang Lake is greater than that of the catchment inflow, and the higher water stage at Hukou, the higher the water age of Poyang Lake, while the higher the catchment inflow, the lower the water age of Poyang Lake; (3) After 2003, the water age of Poyang Lake decreases with the evolution of River-Lake relationship and the most significant decrease happens in autumn; (4) The proposed Poyang Lake Water Conservancy Hub may increase the water age of Poyang Lake to some extent while it alleviates the problem of low water in Poyang Lake. This study can provide a scientific base for the water environment management of Poyang Lake and provide a reference for research on water exchange capacity of other large shallow lakes.

Tracers were released in winter from the Mohave Power Plant (MPP) and Dangling Rope, UT, located on the shore of Lake Powell near Page, AZ; and in summer from MPP, the Tehachapi Pass between the Mojave Desert and the Central Valley in California, and El Centro, CA, on the California-Mexico border. At the Tehachapi tracer release site six-hour pulses of a separately identifiable perfluorocarbon tracer were released every four days in order to assess the time for the tracer to clear the monitoring network. Daily 24-hr integrated samples were collected at about 30 sites in four states. Limited tracer concentration data with higher time resolution is also available. Graphical displays and analyses identify several regional transport paths, including a convergence zone in the Mojave Desert, the importance of terrain channeling, especially in winter, and a relationship between 24-hr maximum influence function and distance that may prove useful as a scoping tool and to test regional scale air quality models. In winter, Dangling Rope tracer was routinely transported through the entire length of the Grand Canyon, while in summer, MPP tracer was routinely transported over most of Lake Mead.

Sediment Quality Assessment of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Lake Edku, Egypt	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												C ONTAMINATION of coastal lakes in Egypt is of great public concern due to its potential risk to ecosystem and human health. Lake Edku is one of the most significant lakes in northern Egypt that serving various purposes, including water supply, food security, recreational activities, and industrial applications. Contamination of lakes sediments with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) degrades water quality and affects the aquatic organisms, which in turn impacts human and the health of the whole aquatic ecosystem in the long term. Therefore, sixteen sediment samples were collected from Lake Edku through the spring and summer seasons of year 2022 and investigated to ascertain the concentrations, sources, toxicity, and ecological risk of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The results revealed insignificant difference between the total concentrations of PAHs during spring and summer seasons, as ranged between 211.80 and 363.10 mu g kg-1 with an average 273.08 +/- 62.10 mu g kg-1 in spring, and 135.50 to 345.40 mu g kg-1 with an average 271.80 +/- 64.14 mu g kg-1 in summer. In addition, the high molecular weight (HMW) PAHs (with a percentage of 70% and 67%) and PAHs with 3 and 4 rings were predominance in the collected samples through the spring and summer. Moreover, Ant/ (Ant + Phe) ratio ranged between 0.38 to 1 and 0.34 to 0.95 during spring and summer, respectively which showed that the source of PAHs in sediment was related to petroleum sources. While, BaA/BaA/ (BaA + Chry) ratio reached to 1 which revealed the sources of burning coal, grass, and wood. For the majority of stations, InP/ (InP + BgP) and Flu/ (Flu + Pyr) ratios reached to 1 indicated fuel combustion sources. The ratio of high molecular weight (HMW) to low molecular weight (LMW) PAHs ranged between 0.2 and 1 which suggested a petrogenic input. The results indicated a diversity of pollution sources of PAHs, and according to toxicity and ecological risk assessment, the recorded concentrations of PAHs in the sediment samples from all stations do not pose a potential carcinogenic risk or environmental harm as the toxic equivalent concentrations (TEQBaP) values were below 100 mu g kg-1. The results of the present study can pave the way for managing, reducing pollution levels, and preventing environmental deterioration in Lake Edku.

Microcystis ichthyoblabe, Microcystis wesenbergii and Microcystis aeruginosa successively dominated the water surface from June to October. However, the percentage of both M. wesenbergii and M. aeruginosa did not exceed 50 % in the mesosphere when M. wesenbergii and M. aeruginosa dominated the surface successively. M. ichthyoblabe dominated the water bottom from late spring to late autumn, while other Microcystis (including other Microcystis morphospecies and some small colonies that could not be identified) dominated the water bottom at other times. The colony size of other Microcystis showed little change during the study period and D-50 (the colony size at which 50 % of the total mass of the particles was smaller than this size) was always smaller than 100 mu m. D-50 of M. ichthyoblabe was about 200 mu m at most times, but reached 400 mu m in early November. Colony size of M. wesenbergii and M. aeruginosa increased and then decreased, with the maximum D-50 of 700 mu m and 800 mu m, respectively, occurring in October. Vertical distribution of cell density and colony sizes of different Microcystis morphospecies were also comparatively analyzed, and the results suggested that the Microcystis morphospecies composition varied with depth, with large Microcystis morphospecies dominating the water surface because of their large colony size.

While this basin has received much attention for its high nutrient loads from the Maumee River and recurring harmful algal blooms, carbon has gone understudied. To investigate the seasonal and spatial variability in inorganic and organic carbon budgets, we completed three surveys in spring, summer, and fall on a transect from the Maumee River to South Bass Island. In each survey, we observed higher spatial variability of all carbon species within 11 km of the Maumee River mouth relative to sites outside of Maumee Bay. This variability was driven by pulses of direct river water carbon, steep nutrient gradients, and patchy bloom conditions. Seasonal variability was also greater in Maumee Bay, with the highest river discharge in June adding large amounts of dissolved inorganic and organic carbon and pCO2 flux out of the water when productivity from the diatom bloom was smaller. In August, when and where we observed a Microcystis bloom, particulate organic carbon increased in concentration, and pCO2 flux switched directions into the water. In October, Chl-a concentrations and oxygen saturations were lowest, indicating a seasonal slowdown in productivity, and river discharge was the lowest, resulting in the lowest total carbon observed and dissolved organic matter chemistry indicating less contribution from the terrestrial watershed. In the open water outside of Maumee Bay seasonal and spatial carbon budget dynamics were more stable, highlighting the importance of riverine inputs on lake carbon cycling. The Maumee River has a large influence on the water quality of Lake Erie's Western Basin. Past research in this region focused on the connection between nutrients, such as phosphorus and nitrogen, and harmful algal blooms. Carbon, which is a water quality indicator and can serve as a component of greenhouse gases, is less studied. The goal of this project was to quantify changes in carbon over space and time along a gradient from the Maumee River into the Western Basin. We performed research cruises in spring, summer, and fall and collected samples for dissolved inorganic carbon, dissolved organic carbon, and particulate organic carbon. We found the Maumee River influenced the carbon budget due to direct inputs of carbon as well as nutrient inputs that fueled algal blooms. In the spring and summer when the Maumee River had high flow, much of the carbon in Maumee Bay was from the river, but later in the year as flow decreased an larger percent of the carbon came from the algal bloom, which changed which kind of carbon was most common due to photosynthesis. Throughout the study the open water of the basin had less variability in carbon compared to Maumee Bay. Carbon in the Western Basin of Lake Erie is heavily influenced by river input Spatial and temporal variability of inorganic and organic carbon is high in Maumee Bay Seasonal bloom dynamics transform carbon						Chaffin, Justin/0000-0002-5372-4577; Stanislawczyk, Keara/0000-0002-9423-6860; Gaffney, Katherine/0009-0006-1825-2865													2169-8953	2169-8961				AUG	2024	129	8							e2024JG008107	10.1029/2024JG008107	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024JG008107													WOS:001294992200001
J	Iwasaki, F; Wakahara, M				Iwasaki, F; Wakahara, M			Adaptable larval life histories in different populations of the salamander, Hynobius retardatus, living in various habitats	ZOOLOGICAL SCIENCE												Several variations in larval life histories were described in a salamander Hynobius retardatus living in Hokkaido, Japan, which had been reported to propagate in larval forms in a specific environment of Lake Kuttara like the axolotl. In almost all populations living in lower land Hokkaido, spawning was observed in early spring, and hatched larvae metamorphosed by August or September. In some populations living in the similar ponds but supplied with a mountain stream or spring water, however, larvae could not complete their metamorphosis by late autumn in the first year. All the larvae passed winter season under snow and then metamorphosed between late May and mid June in the second year. In some specific populations in cold, mountainous ponds, larvae could not metamorphose during the first and second years and metamorphosed in the third year. Thus, three age-groups of larvae, which were 2-year- and 1-year-overwintered larvae, and larvae under the age of one, were concurrently observed in one pond. Body size at the completion of the metamorphosis in the 2-year-overwintered larvae was significantly larger than that in the metamorphosing or metamorphosed larvae under the age of one. When hemoglobin (Hb) transition from larval to adult types in each population was examined, adult globin subunits were expressed in the overwintered larvae, even though they had not completed their morphological metamorphosis, suggesting that the expression of some adult phenotypes was independent of morphological metamorphosis.																			0289-0003					AUG	1999	16	4					667	674		10.2108/zsj.16.667	http://dx.doi.org/10.2108/zsj.16.667													WOS:000083204400013

This study was designed to help fill the gap of year-round measurements of CH4 emissions from subarctic mires. We report continuous eddy correlation CH4 flux measurements made during 2006 and 2007 over the Stordalen mire in subarctic Sweden (68 degrees 20'N, 19 degrees 03'E, altitude 351 m) using a cryocooled tunable diode laser. The landscape-scale CH4 fluxes originated mainly from the permafrost free wet parts of the mire dominated by tall graminoid vegetation. The midseason average CH4 emission mean was 6.2 +/- 2.6 mg m(-2) h(-1). A detailed footprint analysis indicates an additional strong influence on the flux by the nearby shallow Lake Villasjon (0.17 km(2), maximum depth 1.3 m). A stable bimodal distribution of wind flow from either the east or the west allowed separating the lake and mire vegetation signals. The midseason lake emission rates were as high as 12.3 +/- 3.3 mg m(-2) h(-1). Documented CH4 fluxes are similar to results obtained by automatic chamber technique and higher than manual chamber measurements made in the wet minerotrophic section dominated by Eriophorum angustifolium. The high fluxes observed from this vegetation type are significant because the areal distribution of this source in the mire is expanding due to ongoing thawing of the permafrost. A simple peat temperature relationship with CH4 emissions was used to fill data gaps to construct a complete annual budget of CH4 fluxes over the studied area. The calculated annual CH4 emissions in 2006 and 2007 equaled 24.5 and 29.5 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. The summer season CH4 emissions dominated (65%) the annual flux, with the shoulder seasons of spring and autumn significant (25%) and a minor flux from the winter (10%).

Oxygen and hydrogen isotopes, with averages of -7.8 parts per thousand and -53.0 parts per thousand for delta(18)O and delta D, respectively, are depleted in winter and rich in spring, and gradually decrease in summer and fall, illustrating that the seasonal effect is considerable. They also show that the isotopic difference between south portion and north portion of the Ordos Basin are not obvious, and the isotope in the middle portion is normally depleted. The isotope compositions of 32 samples collected from shallow groundwater (less than a depth of 150 m) in desert plateau range from -10.6 parts per thousand to -6.0 parts per thousand with an average of -8.4 parts per thousand for delta(18)O and from -85 parts per thousand to -46 parts per thousand with an average of -63 parts per thousand for delta D. Most of them are identical with modern precipitation. The isotope compositions of 22 middle and deep groundwaters (greater than a depth of 275 m) fall in ranges from -11.6 parts per thousand to -8.8 parts per thousand with an average of -10.2 parts per thousand for delta(18)O and from -89 parts per thousand to -63 parts per thousand with an average of -76 parts per thousand for delta D. The average values are significantly less than those of modern precipitation, illustrating that the middle and deep groundwaters were recharged at comparatively lower air temperatures. Primary analysis of (14)C shows that the recharge of the middle and deep groundwaters started at late Pleistocene. The isotopes of 13 lake water samples collected from eight lakes define a local evaporation trend, with a relatively flat slope of 3.77, and show that the lake waters were mainly fed by modern precipitation and shallow groundwater.

Wind variability over a large lake with complex topography: Lake of the Woods	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake of the Woods spans two geological regions: the Precambrian Shield and the Glacial Lake Agassiz Lakebed. The lake watershed's complex topography influences wind speeds and directions. We study wind variability over Lake of the Woods using reanalysis data and wind observations at seven sites. A wind variability index is proposed as a measure of lake-wide spread in wind direction. Our results show that the directional variability depends on wind speeds, with higher variability at lower speeds. The wind variability also changes throughout the year; it is more pronounced in spring (Apr-Jun) and fall (Sep-Oct) and less pronounced during winter (Dec-Jan). Observed wind directions are 60% more variable than reanalysis wind, indicating a need for higher-resolution reanalysis to resolve local wind effects due to topographic changes. Based on the statistical hierarchical clustering method, our analysis shows that geographically variable wind can be grouped into three regions to represent the predominant wind directions accurately. Clustering results also suggest spatial coverage gaps in the existing meteorological observation network. We reassess the existing network and propose a new meteorological observation site in the southeast basin near Morson, Ontario. Our study is of significance for water quality management because the wind is the key driver of water circulation, transport, and mixing in the lake, and accurate wind measurements are necessary to better constrain the underpinning physical, biological, and biochemical processes in mechanistic ecological models.

J	PLAYLE, RC				PLAYLE, RC			CHEMICAL EFFECTS OF SPRING AND SUMMER ALUM ADDITIONS TO A SMALL, NORTHWESTERN ONTARIO LAKE	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Aluminum was added as aluminum sulfate (alum) to Lake 114, a small, shallow lake of the Experimental Lakes Area, northwestern Ontario [Canada], in spring and summer point-source additions. Aluminum and H+ gradients were established during the additions, with high Al and low pH (about 1000 .mu.g L-1 Al, pH 4.7) near the alum sources, and background conditions (< 50 .mu.g L-1 Al, pH 5.7) further from the sources. Approximately 80% of the added Al was lost from the water column in two weeks. Phosphorus concentrations remained unchanged during the additions, whereas lake alkalinity decreased and sulfate increased close to the sources. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations decreased slightly (from 540 .mu.M L-1 to about 500 .mu.M L-1) near the alum source during the summer addition.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				JUN	1987	34	2					207	225		10.1007/BF00184762	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00184762													WOS:A1987H794900009

Crystal Bog, a humic lake in Vilas County, Wisconsin, is part of the North Temperate Lakes Long-Term Ecological Research Site. Phytoplankton and planktonic protozoa were identified and enumerated in a settling chamber with an inverted microscope. Bacterial cells were enumerated with the use of fluorescence 4', 6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-staining procedures, and automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) was used to assess bacterioplankton diversity. Bacterial cell counts showed little seasonal variation and averaged 2.6 x 10(6) cells/mL over the ice-free season. Phytoplankton and planktonic protozoan numbers varied by up to two orders of magnitude and were most numerous in late spring and summer. Dinoflagellates largely dominated Crystal Bog throughout the ice-free period, specifically Peridiniopsis quadridens in the spring, Peridinium limbatum in summer, and Gymnodinium fuscum and P. quadridens in fall. Brief blooms of Cryptomonas, Dinobryon, and Synura occurred between periods of dinoflagellate domination. The dominant dinoflagellate, Peridinium limbatum, was calculated to have a growth rate of 0.065 day(-1) and a doubling time of 10.7 days. Heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNFs) were a consistent component of the planktonic protozoa; seasonal patterns were determined for three genera of HNFs (Monosiga, Bicosoeca, and Desmarella moniliformis). Three genera of ciliates (Coleps, Strobilidium, and Strombidium) comprised the greater part of the planktonic protozoa in Crystal Bog. The number of species of planktonic protozoa was too low to calculate a diversity index. Shannon - Weaver diversity indices for phytoplankton and bacterioplankton in the epilimnion followed very similar seasonal patterns in this lake, supporting the hypothesis that in freshwaters, diversity patterns of these groups are linked.					; Kent, Angela/D-6124-2011; Yannarell, Anthony/AAA-1720-2019	Kent, Angela/0000-0003-1837-2382; 													0095-3628					DEC	2004	48	4					528	540		10.1007/s00248-004-0223-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-004-0223-3								15696386					WOS:000226829500009
J	SZE, P				SZE, P			SEASONAL SUCCESSION OF PHYTOPLANKTON IN ONONDAGA LAKE, NEW-YORK (USA)	PHYCOLOGIA												The seasonal successions of phytoplankton in Onondaga Lake during 1975-77 were generally similar to the 1973-74 period immediately after the reduction in P entering the lake. Diatoms and flagellates were dominant in spring and replaced in importance by chlorococcalean green algae and the diatom Cyclotella glomerata during summer. A die-off of summer algae was observed in 1977. During the summer, silica was depleted in the epilimnion by diatom growths and P by chlorococcalean green algae. Enrichment studies indicated that availability of P to green algae and silica to diatoms may have contributed to determining their periods of dominance. Blue-green algae continued to be relatively unimportant in the plankton, in contrast to the conditions before 1972 when they caused late summer blooms.																			0031-8884	2330-2968					1980	19	1					54	59		10.2216/i0031-8884-19-1-54.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2216/i0031-8884-19-1-54.1													WOS:A1980JU40300007

Vegetation characteristics of each site were recorded for spring and late summer, in conjunction with estimates of forager success (the percentage of foragers returning to colonies with solid particles or liquid loads). Foragers collected a wide variety of solid particles, with different arthropod prey dominating samples within different sites. At the lakeshore site (no vegetation), dipteran adults, larvae, and pupae comprised >58% of foraged particles. Isoptera comprised >21% of foraged particles at the wooded roadsite site. At grassland and pasture sites, seeds (17.2 and 15.7%, respectively) were important foraged items. Forager success rates were highest for solids at the lakeshore site (approximate to30% and 16% in spring and late summer, respectively), and highest for liquids at the pasture site (approximate to30% and 22% for spring and late summer, respectively). Possible influence of vegetation on success rates, and implications for estimates of foraging energetics, are discussed.

J	Malard, F; Tockner, K; Ward, JV				Malard, F; Tockner, K; Ward, JV			Physico-chemical heterogeneity in a glacial riverscape	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Spatio-temporal heterogeneity in physico-chemical conditions associated with the annual expansion/contraction cycle in a complex glacial flood plain of the Swiss Alps was investigated employing a landscape approach. The diverse and dynamic aquatic habitats of the flood plain were visualized as an aquatic mosaic or riverscape. Based on samples collected at ca. monthly intervals for 1.5 yr along 17 floodplain transects, the 3 components of riverscape heterogeneity, extent, composition, and configuration, were quantified using categorical maps and indices of landscape patterns for turbidity and specific conductance. Changes in the spatial heterogeneity of 13 other physico-chemical parameters were further analyzed by means of a within-dates principal component analysis. Riverscape heterogeneity (RH), quantified by applying several indices of landscape pattern to turbidity and specific conductance data, was minimum during groundwater-dominated base flow in winter. Despite an increase in surface connectivity in the channel network with rising discharge, RH rose in spring and summer as additional chemically-distinct water sources (i.e., snowmelt runoff and glacial ablation) contributed to surface flow within the flood plain. Most other physico-chemical variables measured during this study exhibited the same spatio-temporal heterogeneity as turbidity and specific conductance. Overall, the glacial flood plain shifted from a monotonous physico-chemical riverscape in winter to a complex mosaic in summer, this seasonal pattern being clearly driven by hydrological factors operating at the catchment scale rather than by autogenic processes within individual water bodies. Although RH exhibited a predictable annual pattern in response to the seasonal flow regime, we expect the channel network to undergo future modifications from stochastic factors associated with flood events and long-term changes reflecting movements of the glaciers.

In the pelagic zone, acoustic backscattering is almost entirely due to pelagic whitefish during that time of the year. For each sampling date, whitefish abundance was estimated for three size-classes (from -32 dB to -52 dB) and the horizontal distribution of the stock was plotted. Total population estimates for all size-classes combined agreed extremely well among four surveys before and after spawning time, ranging from 5.3 to 5.9 million individuals. During spawning and in early spring only part of the population was accessible to acoustic sampling. Horizontal distribution patterns were very consistent among five surveys in winter, showing a pronounced density gradient increasing from the southwestern to the northeastern shore. Pelagic whitefish thus maintain their characteristic overwintering distribution pattern for at least three months.																			0071-1128		3-510-47047-8				1995	46						249	259																WOS:A1995BH14P00030

However, ecological information about planktonic heliozoans is still limited. In this study, we investigated seasonal changes in planktonic heliozoan abundance in the deep northern and shallow southern basins of Lake Biwa at pelagic stations between August 2020 and December 2021. We compared planktonic heliozoan abundance levels between the two basins and examined the relationship between heliozoan abundance and environmental variables. In both basins, high levels of planktonic heliozoan abundance were detected in autumn, winter and spring. In the south basin, there was a significant positive correlation between planktonic heliozoan abundance and chlorophyll a concentration as well as the abundance of the diatoms Aulacoseira granulata and Aulacoseira ambigua. These results suggest that planktonic heliozoans directly or indirectly consume diatoms and that heliozoan abundance is subjected to bottom-up control. Furthermore, planktonic heliozoan abundance in the south basin was higher than that in the north basin, possibly due to the presence of waterweeds, which can serve as habitat for heliozoans, and the redistribution of planktonic heliozoans through resuspension from lake bottom sediments.

J	Taylor, JE				Taylor, JE			Reproduction in sympatric lizards: comparison of two species of Ctenotus (Scincidae) in south-eastern Australia	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												The scincid lizards Ctenotus robustus and C. taeniolatus occur sympatrically in regenerating, sand-mined areas in the Port Stephens-Myall Lakes region, coastal New South Wales, Australia. They are absent from the unmined open forest of the area. The reproductive characteristics of these two species were compared. Males reached sexual maturity at a smaller snout-vent length (SVL) than females in C. robustus ( 72 mm v. 78 mm) and C. taeniolatus (49 mm v. 52 mm). Males were reproductive from August to December and maximum testis volume in both species occurred in early spring; minimum testis volume was recorded in early autumn. Females of both species contained yolking follicles or eggs from October to January (spring-summer). Clutch size in C. robustus (4-9) did not differ significantly from that in C. taeniolatus (2-7) when SVL was accounted for. Both species laid eggs in nests dug 4-5 cm deep in open sandy areas with sparse vegetation, and nesting requirements might explain their absence from open forest. At hatching, C. robustus averaged 35.9 mm SVL and C. taeniolatus averaged 29.9 mm SVL. Hatchlings of both species were at field sites from mid-January to early April. Overall, reproductive characteristics of C. robustus and C. taeniolatus were generally similar.					; Taylor, Jennifer/G-1743-2011	Taylor, Jennifer/0000-0001-6461-0869; 													0004-959X	1446-5698					2004	52	6					649	666		10.1071/ZO04017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/ZO04017													WOS:000225689800006
J	Small, D; Islam, S; Vogel, RM				Small, D; Islam, S; Vogel, RM			Trends in precipitation and streamflow in the eastern US: Paradox or perception?	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Many studies have reported that total precipitation is increasing across the United States with most of the increase resulting from a positive trend in the upper tail of the daily precipitation distribution. Other studies have found that low and moderate, but not high flows are also increasing across much of the United States. How can precipitation, especially that produced by intense events, increase without a corresponding increase in high flows? We analyzed trends in annual 7-day low, average and high flows along with seasonal precipitation that is averaged over individual basins. Our findings suggest that statistically significant trends in both fall precipitation and 7-day low flow are found in a large percentage of the basins in the upper Mississippi and Great Lakes regions of the country. A large fraction of the trends in annual precipitation can be explained by an increase in fall precipitation. By estimating trends in precipitation at the spatial scale of individual basins, we offer a simple explanation for the apparent paradox of lack of trends in high flows. At the spatial scale of individual basins, precipitation is increasing during the fall but not during the spring, the season when high flows are generally observed. The increase in fall precipitation appears to result in an increase in the low flows while the lack of trends in precipitation in spring explains the lack of widespread trends in the high flows.

To understand more fully contaminant loading outside the breeding season, we analysed the contents of 1298 freshly regurgitated pellets and 179 fresh faeces, collected in March and early April 1978-83, and between late December and late February 1990-91, from the vicinity of breeding colonies in Lakes Ontario and Erie, the Niagara River, Detroit River, and south-eastern parts of Lake Huron. Most adult Herring Gulls from the Great Lakes population winter in these areas, but there is no published account of their food habits other than during the breeding season. Most pellets from colonies close to large urban centres contained remains of garbage, as well as various fish species. Small mammals, notably Deer Mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) dominated the early spring diet at Lake Huron colonies near agricultural areas. At all other sites fish predominated in pellets and faeces, but garbage items were also recorded regularly. The species of fish consumed varied regionally, probably reflecting local availability. In Lake Ontario, Rainbow Smelt (Osmerus mordax) and Alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) occurred most frequently in samples, whereas Freshwater Drum (Aplodinotus grunniens) was the main fish prey in Lake Erie and the Detroit River. Dietary differences were apparent between years, within seasons, and amongst areas. While these may have reflected some real differences in food availability, interpretation of these results was confounded by various biases inherent in the sampling of pellets and faeces to determine diet in such an opportunistic species. Therefore, it would be unwise to draw rigid conclusions as to regional or seasonal differences in the diets of piscivorous birds, based upon analyses of diet from only a small sample of sites or years. Herring Gulls appear to feed mainly on fish and garbage in winter and early spring on the lower Great Lakes (much as during the breeding season), but any locally abundant food source is probably exploited opportunistically.																			0018-8158					APR 1	1994	279						39	55		10.1007/BF00027839	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00027839													WOS:A1994NK39900005

The investigated Lake Blankensee covers an area of 2.9 km(2) with an average depth of 1.2 m (volume 3.43 10(6) m(3)). The average summer chlorophyll-a concentrations range from 104 to 418 mu g 1(-1) (1992-1995). Secchi-depths from 0.2 to 0.3 m are typical in summer. Massive algae blooms occur frequently and submerse macrophytes can no longer exist. The trophic state is polytrophic. In summer phosphorus concentrations in the lake were controlled by the internal processes, in winter by the inflowing River Nieplitz. The increasing total phosphorus concentrations and the soluble reactive fraction of phosphorus in the lake water from winter to summer are partly a function of net internal loading. According to the detailed chemical studies which are representative only for this investigated period the Lake Blankensee acts as a phosphorus source, which also affects the down-stream lakes and the river system. The P-balance is determined by the river input of 16.84 10(3) kg P and by an output of 20.71 10(3) kg P. Therefore the export of about 3.87 10(3) kg P characterises the negative P-retention rate due to the strong internal loading during summer. More than 60% of the sediment phosphorus is bound to the iron-redox system. Therefore it indicates a high potential mobility of phosphorus under anaerobic conditions in the sediment surface zone in summer during special weather conditions. This process is limited due to the high Fe:P ratio of about 21 (by weight) in the surface sediments of the Lake Blankensee (0-5 cm).																			0018-8158					JAN 17	1997	342						43	53		10.1023/A:1017092618517	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017092618517													WOS:A1997WZ13900006

In this habitat, population dynamics are largely controlled by spring water level, and sexual regeneration is more abundant in sites less exposed to flooding. The hypothesis tested in this study is that sexual regeneration of black ash in sites slightly exposed to flooding is influenced by fluctuations of spring flood water level. The age structure of two sapling populations (<5 cm DBH) was analyzed using models assuming a constant (exponential function) and decreasing mortality (power function) with age. Both models were useful in describing the age structure of the saplings. The constant mortality model was selected and analysis of the residuals showed that the populations responded in different ways to climate during the 1914-1989 period. While regeneration is correlated with summer and annual precipitation in population A, it is correlated with winter precipitation in population B. Abundant sexual regeneration in both black ash stands suggests that moisture conditions are sufficient to assure constant sexual regeneration, which is, however, diminished during dry years.																			0003-0031	1938-4238				JUL	1994	132	1					124	135		10.2307/2426207	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2426207													WOS:A1994NZ32700013
J	Potter, L; Xu, YJ				Potter, Lee; Xu, Y. J.			Can a eutrophic lake function as a carbon sink? Case study of a subtropical eutrophic lake in southern USA	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Carbon dioxide (CO2) outgassing from inland eutrophic waters is a small but critical component of the global carbon cycle that is currently not well constrained. Eutrophic lake systems have been reported to be supersat-urated with dissolved CO2 (pCO2), therefore considered a carbon source to the atmosphere. In this study, we aimed to test two hypotheses: 1) there is a substantial diurnal fluctuation in pCO2 in eutrophic lakes, making them both a source and a sink of carbon; and 2) the diurnal fluctuation is seasonally dependent, with a pro-nounced variability during the summer. As a case study, we used a hypereutrophic lake in a highly urbanized area in subtropical southern USA. We conducted in-situ measurements on pCO2, photosynthetically active ra-diation (PAR), and other ambient parameters at 3-hour intervals for two days each in the winter and summer of 2022. The study shows that there was a clear diurnal fluctuation of pCO2 with the peak in the early morning and the lowest in the later afternoon in both seasons. In the winter, the lake water was mainly CO2-unsaturated in reference to the atmospheric CO2 of 420 ppm, ranging from a low of 128 ppm in the mid-afternoon to a high of 557 ppm in the early morning hours. In the summer, the lake water was mostly CO2-oversaturated, with pCO2 increasing drastically from 309 ppm during the early afternoon to 3895 ppm in the early morning hours. In both winter and summer, CO2 outgassing was nearly three times greater at night than in the daytime, increasing from-9.98 to -3.75 mg C m-2h-1 in the winter and from 13.17 to 45.34 mg C m -2h- 1 in the summer. Consequently, a clear diurnal trend of CO2 evasion rate (FCO2) was found, showing that the lake often acted as a carbon sink during the daylight hours but as a carbon source at night, strongly affected by PAR availability and colored dissolved organic matter (cDOM). These findings validate our initial hypotheses and suggest that the diurnal and seasonal fluctuations of CO2 evasion in eutrophic lakes should be considered in the global carbon accounting of lake systems to constrain uncertainties. Furthermore, we found thatpCO2 measurements at 10:00o'clock in the morning have the least deviation to the diurnal average and, therefore, propose standardizing this time for future studies in field pCO2 measurements in order to make data comparable over seasons, geographical regions, and lake trophic levels.

Regional climate and vegetation response to orbital forcing within the mid-Pliocene Warm Period: A study using HadCM3	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Regional climate and environmental variability in response to orbital forcing during interglacial events within the mid-Piacenzian (Pliocene) Warm Period (mPWP; 3.264-3.025 Ma) has been rarely studied using climate and vegetation models. Here we use climate and vegetation model simulations to predict changes in regional vegetation patterns in response to orbital forcing for four different interglacial events within the mPWP (Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) G17, Kl, KM3 and KM5c). The efficacy of model-predicted changes in regional vegetation is assessed by reference to selected high temporal resolution palaeobotanical studies that are theoretically capable of discerning vegetation patterns for the selected interglacial stages. Annual mean surface air temperatures for the studied interglacials are between 0.4 degrees C to 0.7 degrees C higher than a comparable Pliocene experiment using modern orbital parameters. Increased spring/summer and reduced autumn/winter insolation in the Northern Hemisphere during MIS G17, K1 and KM3 enhances seasonality in surface air temperature. The two most robust and notable regional responses to this in vegetation cover occur in North America and continental Eurasia, where forests are replaced by more open-types of vegetation (grasslands and shrubland). In these regions our model results appear to be inconsistent with local palaeobotanical data. The orbitally driven changes in seasonal temperature and precipitation lead to a similar to 30% annual reduction in available deep soil moisture (2.0 m from surface), a critical parameter for forest growth, and subsequent reduction in the geographical coverage of forest-type vegetation; a phenomenon not seen in comparable simulations of Pliocene climate and vegetation run with a modern orbital configuration. Our results demonstrate the importance of examining model performance under a range of realistic orbital forcing scenarios within any defined time interval (e.g. mPWP). Additional orbitally resolved records of regional vegetation are needed to further examine the validity of model-predicted regional climate and vegetation responses in greater detail.

Assessment of the Benthic Macroinvertebrate Communities in the Evaluation of the Water Quality of Portuguese Reservoirs: An Experimental Approach	WATER												Reservoirs are dynamic ecosystems subject to different pressures that influence and compromise their ecological structure. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of using the macroinvertebrate to assess the water quality of four reservoirs (one site in Miranda-M and Pocinho-P; four sites in Aguieira-Ag1 to Ag4; and five sites in Alqueva-Al1 to Al5). The sites were sampled in autumn 2018 (A18), spring and autumn 2019 (S19 and A19) and spring 2020 (S20). In situ physical and chemical parameters were measured and a sample of water and macroinvertebrate were collected for further analyses. Total phosphorus exceeded the allowed concentrations (maximum values recorded: M-0.13 mg/L, P-0.09 mg/L, Ag3-0.22 mg/L and Al5-0.18 mg/L). Total abundance varied between 4 and 3088. Taxonomic richness was always low, between 1 and 12 taxa. The highest Shannon-Wiener value (1.91) was recorded in Ag1_A18 and Al2_A18. Pielou's evenness varied widely across all reservoirs, from 0.06 to 0.92. Almost all the organisms found were associated with polluted water, according to the index ratings. Organisms tolerant of disturbances (e.g., Chironomidae and Oligochaeta) were associated with sites with the worst water quality, according to the Water Framework Directive (WFD), (M, Ag3, Ag4 and Al5) while organisms with moderate tolerance to disturbances (e.g., Cordullidae and Polycentropodidae) were associated with sites with better water quality (P, Ag1, Ag2 and Al1 to Al4). The macrozoobenthos index (MZB) used proved to be a sensitive tool to Portuguese reservoirs, corroborating most of the results obtained in the remaining analyses, as well as providing a clear ecological potential complementing the analysis carried out by the WFD. Based on this, the macroinvertebrate community appeared to be sensitive and able to characterize the reservoirs' water quality.					; Rodrigues, Sara/KCY-5884-2024; Pinto, Ivo/AFS-5652-2022; Sousa Pinto, Isabel/G-1497-2010; Antunes, Sara/C-7150-2008	Rodrigues, Sara/0000-0002-9093-6464; Sousa Pinto, Isabel/0000-0002-9231-0553; Antunes, Sara/0000-0002-6686-9919; Pinto, Ivo/0000-0002-6454-079X														2073-4441				DEC	2021	13	23							3391	10.3390/w13233391	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13233391													WOS:000735127900001

To understand the AMD formation and evolution, it is necessary to determine the composition and variation of acidophilic community, and their role in AMD ecosystem. In this study, we compared seasonal variations of geochemistry and microbial composition of two adjacent AMD lakes with different formation histories in Anhui Province, China. Lake Paitu (PT) formed in 1970s near a mine dump and the pH was in the range of 3.01-3.16, with the lowest in spring and summer while the highest in winter. The main ions in PT were Al and SO42-, whereas Fe concentration was relatively low. The concentrations of these ions were the lowest in summer and the highest in winter. Lake Tafang (TF) formed in around 2013 in a pit was more acidic (pH 2.43-2.75), but the seasonal variation of pH was the same as PT. Compared with Lake PT, TF had higher Fe, lower Al and SO42- concentrations, and showed no significant seasonal changes. Despite salient seasonal variations of prokaryotic composition in Lake PT, Ferrovum was the major iron-oxidizing bacterium in most seasons. Furthermore, Lake PT was also rich in heterotrophic bacteria (48.6 +/- 15.9%). Both prokaryotic diversity and evenness of Lake TF were lower than PT, and chemolithotrophic ironoxidizing bacteria (71.7 +/- 25.4%) were dominant in almost all samples. Besides Ferrovum, more acid tolerant iron-oxidizer Leptospirillum and Acidithiobacillus were also abundant in Lake TF. Chlamydomonas was the major eukaryote in Lake PT and it flourished repeatedly at the end of December, causing an extremely high chlorophyll a concentration (587 mu g/L) at one sampling site in 2016, which provided rich nutrients for heterotrophic bacteria. The main alga in Lake TF was Chrysonebula, but its concentration was low, apparently because of the strong acidity and dark red color of lake water. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Isotope data were supplemented by previously published data on physico-chemical variables in the lake water column. We sought to determine how carbon and oxygen isotopic disequilibria in calcite deposited in the lake's laminated sediments vary seasonally, and what factors drive this variability. Deposition of calcite out of equilibrium with DIC and water was documented over the entire study period. For delta O-18, the disequilibrium difference between successive months far exceeded the amplitude of the seasonal variability in the isotope composition of water. The biggest difference between the measured and calculated delta C-13(calcite) and delta O-18(calcite) values was observed during late autumn and winter sediment resuspension and redeposition (2.4 parts per thousand and 5.4 parts per thousand, respectively). In the spring, delta C-13(calcite) and delta O-18(calcite) offsets from equilibria, 0.5 parts per thousand and 1.3 parts per thousand, respectively, resulted from rapid precipitation of large calcite crystals. During summer, intense productivity and processes related to calcifying algae ("vital effects") caused lower delta C-13 (0.5-1.8 parts per thousand) and delta O-18 (2.8-2.9 parts per thousand) in calcite. Differences between isotope values of calcite collected from the two water depths were small, and might have resulted from different settling velocities of small and large crystals, and/or preferential dissolution of smaller grains. We suggest that winter laminae should be excluded from isotope studies of varved sediments whenever possible, as they likely contain redeposited carbonate in which the isotope value is not indicative of conditions in the lake at the time of laminae formation. We also recommend supplementing isotope analysis of calcite in varved lake sediments with seasonally resolved analysis of carbonate content. It appears that major shifts in the proportion of carbonate deposited across seasons can cause notable changes in mean annual values of delta O-18(calcite) and delta C-13(calcite), even if DIC and water isotopic compositions remain stable.					; Apolinarska, Karina/AAZ-3588-2020; Pełechaty, Mariusz/HDN-8393-2022	Pelechaty, Mariusz/0000-0002-4075-6561; Apolinarska, Karina/0000-0002-3507-5139; Pelechata, Aleksandra/0000-0002-7487-8348; Pleskot, Krzysztof/0000-0002-3724-1700; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				JUN	2021	66	1					41	53		10.1007/s10933-021-00184-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-021-00184-y		MAR 2021											WOS:000631764200001

A total of 145 common carp were caught and 115 specimens of host were infected with 3 species of plathelminth parasites: Dactylogyrus extensus (Monogenea), Caryophyllaeus laticeps (Cestoda) and Bothriocephalus acheilognathi (Cestoda). The dominant parasite species D. extensus was occurred on host gills throughout the year. Total prevalence of D. extensus was 69.7% This species was the most prevalent found in fish and the infection was the highest in May. C. laticeps was the second dominant parasite in this study. A total of 740 parasites were found and no parasite specimens was found on fish form July until November. The infection rate was the highest in March. And total prevalence of C. laticeps was 29%. B. acheilognathi was found in 18 of the 145 fish examined. Fifty fish containing a total of 293 parasites were found. B. acheilognathi infection rate was the highest during Autumn and Summer (especially in June) and the lowest during Spring. The total prevalence was 12.4%. Intensity, seasonal changes of the parasite species are discussed in detail.

J	King, L; Jones, RI; Barker, P				King, L; Jones, RI; Barker, P			Seasonal variation in the epilithic algal communities from four lakes of different trophic state	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The epilithon of three soft-water lakes in the English Lake District (oligotrophic Wastwater, mesotrophic Coniston Water and eutrophic Esthwaite Water) and of Malham Tarn, a mesotrophic hard-water lake in the Yorkshire Dales, was sampled monthly from January 1997 until December 1998. Samples were analysed for chl-a content and algal community composition with special reference to the diatoms. At the oligotrophic Wastwater the maximum chl-a value occurred in early autumn, but at the other sites spring maxima were observed. The epilithon in all lakes was numerically dominated by diatoms, Achnanthes minutissima was particularly abundant at all the soft-water sites where it grew throughout the year. At Wastwater, Brachysira spp. were also characteristic of the epilithic algal community. The epilithon at Coniston Water contained larger cells of Fragilaria spp. (in 1997) and Gomphonema spp. (in 1998). At Esthwaite Water the community changed markedly between the monthly samples and seemed highly influenced by grazing. Here diatoms were a less important component of the epilithic biomass and filamentous Chlorophyceae were often dominant, The epilithic algal community at Malham Tarn was characterised by a spring bloom of Diatoma spp. and higher numbers of Cymbella spp., but in the summer filamentous green algae contributed most to the biovolume. Analysis of similarity (SIMI) between monthly samples of the epilithic algal communities within each lake over the two year period using the coefficient of variation of the SIMI values, demonstrated increased seasonal variability with increasing productivity.

Analysis of the State of Biological Communities in a Continental Water Body using Hydrooptical Characteristics	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												Phytoplankton composition, development, and distribution, as well as hydrooptical characteristics, were studied in mesotrophic drainless Lake Krasilovskoe (Altai krai, Russia) in March and August 2017, and February 2018. Phytoplankton comprised 147 taxa with a rank below genus. In winter, the phytoplankton abundance was 0.03-1.06 x 10(6) cells/L, biomass 0.2-12.2 g/m(3), and Chl a content 1.8-24.1 mg/m(3) at a snow depth of 0.13-0.34 m, ice thickness of 0.56-0.70 m, and water temperature of 0.1-4.5 degrees C. Summer phytoplankton was characterized by higher values of indicators of development (0.11-1.74 x 10(6) cells/L, 0.6-18.2 g/m(3), and 27.5-83.4 mg/m(3) Chl a, respectively). A positive relationship between the Chl a content and the absorption coefficient in the range of 400-460 and 670-800 nm and the total phytoplankton abundance and absorption coefficient in the range of 520-580 nm was found both in winter and summer periods. This indicates that active photosynthesis in algae takes place not only in summer, but also during the ice period.																			1995-0829	1995-0837				MAR	2021	14	2					159	167		10.1134/S1995082921010144	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1995082921010144													WOS:000644646100005

The aim of this study was to describe the seasonal changes in composition and abundance of heterotrophic nanoflagellates, ciliates, rotifers, and crustaceans in relation to algae and nutrients in a shallow eutrophic lake (north-eastern Poland) dominated by cyanobacteria and exposed to the strong impact of cormorants. Our results showed that algae accounted for a small part of the total phytoplankton abundance (9-40%) and biomass (10-21%) and were dominated by diatoms and cryptophytes. All of the studied groups of planktonic organisms were quite rich in species (95 algal, 79 ciliate, 44 rotifer and 25 crustacean species) and relatively abundant. Copepods formed a substantial part (45-83%) of the total zooplankton biomass during all seasons. Relatively low algal to zooplankton biomass ratio (0.8-1.1) suggests that during spring, summer, and winter algae were not sufficient food resources for metazooplankton, which supplemented its diet with protists (heterotrophic nanoflagellates and ciliates). In a shallow lake dominated by cyanobacteria, winter (ice-covered period) may be a more favourable period for the growth of some groups of algae, ciliates and rotifers than other seasons due to decreasing abundance of cyanobacteria.					; Napiorkowska-Krzebietke, Agnieszka/I-3874-2018; Kalinowska, Krystyna/S-8299-2018; Stawecki, Konrad/AAP-2235-2021	Bogacka-Kapusta, Elzbieta/0000-0002-6146-5229; Stawecki, Konrad/0000-0002-8904-8996; Napiorkowska-Krzebietke, Agnieszka/0000-0001-8361-0290; Kalinowska, Krystyna/0000-0002-5099-5371; Traczuk, Piotr/0000-0002-1130-569X													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY	2024	851	8					2025	2040		10.1007/s10750-023-05435-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-023-05435-9		DEC 2023											WOS:001132121500001

Iestyn; Anderson, Eric J.; Albergel, Clement			Rapidly expanding lake heatwaves under climate change	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Lake heatwaves-prolonged periods of hot surface water temperature in lakes-have recently been shown to increase in intensity and duration, with numerous potential implications for aquatic ecosystems. However, an important physical attribute of lake heatwaves that has not yet been investigated is their spatial extent, and how it varies within a warming world. Here, we show that the spatial extent of lake heatwaves, defined as contiguous regions within a lake that simultaneously experience extreme warm conditions, is increasing in the largest group of freshwater lakes on Earth, The Laurentian Great Lakes. We show that the maximum spatial extent of lake heatwaves is sensitive to inter-annual variations in winter ice cover and the timing of stratification onset in spring. Notably, we find that a lengthening of the warm summer season and, in turn, an overall increase in surface water temperature, stimulates the development of larger lake heatwaves. On average, our results suggest that the mean spatial extent of lake heatwaves has increased two-fold since 1995. We anticipate this rapid expansion of lake heatwaves to have widespread implications for heat-related impacts on aquatic species.					; Anderson, Eric/JYO-8924-2024; Albergel, Clement/B-8896-2012	Anderson, Eric/0000-0001-5342-8383; Albergel, Clement/0000-0003-1095-2702													1748-9326					SEP	2021	16	9							094013	10.1088/1748-9326/ac1a3a	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac1a3a													WOS:000685922900001

Microzooplankton grazing before, during and after a cyanobacterial bloom in Vancouver Lake, Washington, USA	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												We conducted 16 dilution experiments from April 2008 to January 2009 to estimate microzooplankton grazing and intrinsic phytoplankton growth rates before, during and after a bloom of filamentous cyanobacteria in Vancouver Lake, Washington, USA. Intrinsic phytoplankton growth rates were low in April (similar to 0.4 d(-1)), increased to a maximum (1.2 d(-1)) in May, and then declined to zero and became negative in June and early July, prior to a phytoplankton bloom dominated by cyano bacteria (Aphanizomenon flos-aquae). Phytoplankton growth rates rose as the bloom progressed, reaching rates > 1.0 d(-1) in August and September, then declined through autumn. Spring microzooplankton grazing rates were low (-0.3 to 0.3 d(-1)), then became substantially negative (-1.1 to -1.5 d(-1)) preceding the chlorophyll a bloom. During the bloom, grazing rates quickly increased to a maximum of 0.8 d(-1) and remained high as the bloom declined. Microzooplankton grazing specifically on cyanobacteria was high in spring (1.0 d(-1)), negative just before the bloom (-0.7 d(-1) to -1.0 d(-1)), and low in autumn (0.3 to 0.7 d(-1)). Negative grazing on cyanobacteria immediately before the bloom may have been due to preferential grazing on other co-occurring prey, thus enabling the bloom to form, while higher grazing rates on cyanobacteria, especially on Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, in autumn is likely to have contributed to the bloom's decline. These findings show that microzooplankton can potentially influence cyanobacterial blooms directly and indirectly through grazing.

The use of a solar photovoltaic circulator was investigated for reoxygenation in a shallow hypoxic lake in the northern Rocky Mountains. During the fall of 2019, a solar powered lake circulator (SolarBee SB10000LH; hereinafter circulator) was installed near the center of Upper Red Rock Lake, Montana USA (latitude 44 & ring; 36'N) and dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, turbidity, and changes to ice formation were monitored until ice-out the following spring of 2020 using an array of real-time and data logging sondes. Observations indicate the circulator formed a polynya that lasted until late November, did not increase lake turbidity, and facilitated oxygen exchange through the circulator-created-polynya for at least 3 weeks after an adjacent lake became ice covered. Thereafter, operation of the solar circulator failed from accumulation of snow and ice on the solar panels such that the lake froze completely over during a period of low light in December. From that point on throughout the winter, DO subsequently declined from supersaturation to hypoxia over a 41-day period and remained that way for nearly four months until ice-out in April. Based on this outcome, additional work is required to improve the solar-powered circulator design before attempting comparable applications elsewhere as a means of reducing the severity of hypoxia in shallow-lake systems during winter.

The fluxes of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) across air-water interface were measured in a shallow, hypereutrophic, subtropical Lake Donghu (China) over a year cycle, using a static chamber technique. During the year, Lake Donghu emitted CH4 and CO2; the average flux of CH4 and CO2 was 23.3 +/- 18.6 and 332.3 +/- 160.1 mg m(-2) d(-1), respectively. The fluxes of CH4 and CO2 showed strong seasonal dynamics: CH4 emission rate was highest in summer, remaining low in other seasons, whereas CO2 was adsorbed from the atmosphere in spring and summer, but exhibited a large emission in winter. Annual carbon (C) budget across air-water interface in Lake Donghu was estimated to be 7.52 +/- 4.07 x 10(8) g. CH4 emission was correlated positively with net primary production (NPP) and temperature, whereas CO2 flux correlated negatively with NPP and temperature; however, there were no significant relationships between the fluxes of CH4 and CO2 and dissolved organic carbon, a significant difference from boreal lakes, indicating that phytoplankton rather than allochthonous matter regulated C dynamics across air-water interface of subtropical lake enriched nutrient content.

How Body Size and Food Availability Influence First-Winter Growth and Survival of a Stocked Piscivore	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The first winter of life can play an important role in the success of age-0 fishes. First-winter survival is often size dependent, with larger fish exhibiting higher survival than small fish. Cohorts of age-0 saugeye female Walleye Sander vitreus x male Sauger S. canadensis stocked into Ohio reservoirs exhibit overwinter shifts toward larger body sizes; however, it is unclear whether growth, size-dependent mortality, or size-dependent emigration underlie this phenomenon. Saugeye may experience low prey availability during the overwinter period, making them especially vulnerable to starvation. Furthermore, survivors emerging from winter in poor energetic condition may experience reduced spring foraging success and growth. We used a combination of overwinter PIT tag studies in the field and overwinter outdoor pool experiments to understand these direct and indirect effects of winter on survival and size distributions of cohorts of saugeye. Using PIT tags to allow us to track growth of individuals in reservoirs, we found that saugeye of all sizes increased in length over winter, there was no evidence of size-dependent overwinter mortality, and rates of emigration out of the reservoir were greater for large saugeye than small saugeye. Thus, only growth rate, and not mortality or emigration biased toward small fish, can explain the observed overwinter shift in size distributions. In pool experiments, we found no direct effects of winter on survival, even in the complete absence of food, and no negative consequences of starvation over the winter on the ability of saugeye to resume feeding in the spring. Our results suggest that shifts in size distributions of first-year cohorts over winter are driven by growth rather than mortality. Neither direct effects of first winter on survival nor indirect effects mediated through effects of starvation on future foraging ability are important in recruitment success of saugeye in Ohio reservoirs.

The Mn/Fe ratio is frequently employed to reconstruct historical redox conditions, but interpretation of this ratio may be problematic when the accumulation of Fe and Mn is governed by factors in addition to redox processes. We tested the Fe and Mn contents and bacterial diversity of a 250 cm sediment column in a monomictic reservoir. The deposition time frame and sedimentary rate (approximately 60 cm/y) were determined by integrating the Fe and Mn contents with the hydrological time series, providing a sufficient archive to reconstruct the intra-year variation in water qualities. The inapplicability of the Mn/Fe ratio observed because redox processes, mixing patterns, and biological activity jointly affected the net accumulation of Fe and Mn in the sediment. The causes of the vertical variations in the sediment Fe and Mn contents are discussed, considering the runoff sediment input, hydrodynamic and thermodynamic characteristics of this reservoir, and bacterial distributions in the sediment column. High-speed deposition intensively occurred in summer and autumn; thus, during this period, fluvial sediment was the main source of Fe and Mn. Another source was biochemical sedimentation due to mixing and oxygenation in this reservoir, which played a larger role in spring and winter. Our study showed that the easily accessible current hydrological data of the reservoir provide a reference time frame for identifying historical environmental events and that the use of the Fe/Mn ratio alone is inconclusive for interpreting the historic oxygenation regimes of reservoirs. Future applications of this method should consider the individual reservoir characteristics that impact the mobility and net accumulation of Fe and Mn in the sediment.					; He, Wenyan/AAD-5964-2020	liao, ning/0000-0001-6872-7829; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				MAR	2023	147								109967	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.109967	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.109967		FEB 2023											WOS:000963319800001
J	Kuehn, SC; Negrini, RM				Kuehn, Stephen C.; Negrini, Robert M.			A 250 k.y. record of Cascade arc pyroclastic volcanism from late Pleistocene lacustrine sediments near Summer Lake, Oregon, USA	GEOSPHERE												Distal tephra beds provide important records of pyroclastic volcanism that enhance our overall understanding of eruptive frequencies, magnitudes, compositions, and hazards. Some beds also serve as widespread chronostratigraphic markers. Lacustrine sediments near Summer Lake, Oregon (United States), record numerous eruptions of Cascade arc sources over a period exceeding 2.5 m.y. Late Pleistocene sediments exposed in outcrop have yielded 88 visible tephra beds, including many beds not previously documented. Of these beds, 44 are characterized by rhyolitic glass, 40 contain predominantly basaltic or intermediate glass, and 4 are strongly heterogeneous in composition. Only 23 have been correlated to deposits outside of the Summer Lake basin. The remaining 65 beds provide a record of Cascade arc volcanism that is as yet unique to Summer Lake. Age-depth relations are well constrained for the upper 6 m of section, but are less certain in the lower 12.4 m. Tephra correlations and an overall age model suggest the following: bed B1 originates from an eruption of Mount Mazama (Crater Lake) ca. 20 ka. Beds I and W likely originate from eruptions of Mount St. Helens ca. 80 and 190 ka. A 7-cm-thick tephra bed correlated to Shevlin Park Tuff probably dates to ca. 198 ka. Tephra correlated to the Antelope Well tuff from Medicine Lake volcano dates to ca. 215 ka. Bed NN, at the base of the section, has an estimated age of at least 240-250 ka and probably originated from Newberry Volcano. Overall, this record significantly refines the Pleistocene tephrostratigraphic framework for western North America.					; Kuehn, Stephen/A-4946-2016	Kuehn, Stephen/0000-0002-2918-980X; 													1553-040X					AUG	2010	6	4					397	429		10.1130/GES00515.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/GES00515.1													WOS:000281195200006

Only spring water flows into the lake, which is surrounded by a comparatively broad Phragmites zone of 0.3 km(2). Spring water containing a very high concentration of NO3, with 9.3-17.75 mg l(-1), which seems to originate from agricultural cultivation on the periphery, flows into the lake. This decreases gradually as water flows through Phragmites belts and floating-leaved plant vegetation (Trapa spp. and Nelumbo nucifera) reached 0.01-0.07 mg l(-1) in spillage water in summer. Chlorophyll-a concentrations in the lake ranged from 150 in spring to 400 mg m(-3) in summer, showing progressive eutrophication compared with a condition of the lake in 1979. Macrophyte vegetation plays important roles with denitrification in the nutrient dynamics of shallow sand dune lakes.																			0018-8158					NOV 15	2003	506	1-3					93	99		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008557.62019.32	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008557.62019.32													WOS:000188455600013

The greatest number of species was found in Lake Rotoehu, but monthly maxima based on cell counts were usually greater in Lake Rotoiti. A summer bloom of the toxic blue-green alga Aphanizomenon flos-aquae occurred in Lake Rotoehu. Each lake had its own pattern of dominance. Surface and subsurface samples showed marked differences in species composition and abundance. Diatoms were important winter and spring components, with desmids forming conspicuous subordinates. Ceratium hirundinella was prominent in subsurface layers of Lakes Rotoma and Waikaremoana. Compound indices (ratios of number of species of most other algae to that of desmids) point to Lake Rotoehu as extremely eutrophic, to Lake Rotoma as moderately eutrophic, and to Lakes Rotoiti and Waikaremoana as oligotrophic rather than meso- or eutrophic.																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1978	12	2					153	166		10.1080/00288330.1978.9515736	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1978.9515736													WOS:A1978GA80100007

Northern pike Esox lucius, European perch Perca fluviatilis and pikeperch Sander lucioperca are three widespread predatory species in European lakes, where they often coexist. As potential competitors, we hypothesised that partitioning habitat is a determinant of species coexistence. This was tested by quantifying the variability of their habitat use in tracking adult individuals in the Bariousses reservoir (France, 86.6 ha, mean depth 7.1 m). Specifically, we investigated their distribution along the littoral-pelagic and depth axes along the daily cycle and across seasons. From littoral to pelagic waters were first found pike, then perch and finally pikeperch. Pike was the closest to the surface while pikeperch was the deepest. This general pattern was, however, variable across seasons with the three species located in the upper layer in summer during reservoir stratification. Individuals were more evenly distributed along the littoral-pelagic axis and closer to the bottom when water was mixing (autumn, winter). In summer, perch used more intensively in the pelagic zone during the daytime. Other species did not show any diel change of habitats. Our results highlighted that species coexistence is associated with habitat partitioning among these three predators, with perch showing a more variable behaviour regarding habitat characteristics. Now more than ever, in the context of global change which modifies habitats, it is of crucial importance to understand the coexistence mechanisms of species that shape ecosystems.					; Cucherousset, Julien/B-5709-2011; westrelin, samuel/JEO-8076-2023	Santoul, Frederic/0000-0002-2932-2172; TISSOT, Laurence/0000-0001-5689-3766; westrelin, samuel/0000-0002-0169-1363; 													0906-6691	1600-0633				JAN	2022	31	1					129	142		10.1111/eff.12619	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12619		JUN 2021											WOS:000661714800001

Three periods were evident: (1) A spring bloom, during snowmelt, of the planktonic diatom Asterionella formosa, (2) a mid-summer period of minimal algal abundance, and (3) a fall bloom of the blue-green alga Oscillatoria limnetica. Seasonal phytoplankton dynamics in these lakes are controlled partially by the reapid flushing rate during snowmelt and the transport of phytoplankton from the highest lake to the lower lakes by the stream, Icy Brood. During snowmelt, the A. formosa population in the most downstream lake has a net rate of increase of 0.34 d-1, which is calculated from the flushing rate and from the A. formosa abundance in the inflow from the upstream lake and in the downstream lake. Measurements of photosynthetic rates at different depths during the three periods confirmed the rapid growth of A. formosa during the spring. The decline in A. formosa after snowmelt may be related to grazing by developing zooplankton populations. The possible importance of the seasonal variations in nitrate concentrations were evaluated in situ enrichment experiments. For A. formosa and O. limnetica populations, growth stimulation resulted from 8- or 16-micromolar amendements of calcium nitrate and sulfuric acid, but the reason for this stimulation could not be determined from these experiments.

J	THEBAULT, JM; SALENCON, MJ				THEBAULT, JM; SALENCON, MJ			SIMULATION-MODEL OF A MESOTROPHIC RESERVOIR (LAC-DE-PARELOUP, FRANCE) - BIOLOGICAL MODEL	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Research carried out over a 5-year period on Pareloup Lake, an Electricite de France hydroelectric reservoir, enabled a better understanding of the behavior of the ecosystem, in both biological and hydrodynamic terms. The simulation models developed during the study were aimed at providing a tool for management and decision-making. The first phase, described in this paper, was the elaboration of a biological model (two phytoplankton groups, three zooplankton groups, detritus, PO4 and SiO2), based on a simple physical structure (two-layer model). The considerable information base available enabled calibration of the model, ensuring correct simulation of the seasonal evolution of each of the variables over the 5 years. This model pointed out the predominant mechanisms in the evolution of the biological variables. As the spring dynamics of phytoplankton determine the subsequent evolution of the whole of the system, it was necessary to simulate early algal growth and the subsequent collapse at the end of spring. Particular attention was given to representing algal response to light-temperature factors as well as to diatom sinking. It appears that the behavior of the model is extremely sensitive to forcing conditions, and most particularly to fluctuations in the level of the thermocline. Indeed, for correct simulation of annual phytoplankton dynamics it is essential to reproduce the transient spring thermoclines. Particular attention must therefore be paid to the acquisition of measurements of thermal profiles and, in the case of a two-layer model, to the determination of variations in depth of the mixing layer. It also appears that the values for the winter extinction coefficient have a major impact on the collapse of algae at the end of autumn and the bloom in early spring. A vertical thermal model of the reservoir, taking throughflow into account, was also developed and calibrated. The extreme sensitivity of the ecosystem to hydrodynamics fully justifies coupling the two models, so as to permit their potential use as a water management tool.																			0304-3800					JAN	1993	65	1-2					1	30		10.1016/0304-3800(93)90124-B	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3800(93)90124-B													WOS:A1993KL67900001
J	SONDERGAARD, M				SONDERGAARD, M			PHOTOTROPHIC PICOPLANKTON IN TEMPERATURE LAKES - SEASONAL ABUNDANCE AND IMPORTANCE ALONG A TROPHIC GRADIENT	INTERNATIONALE REVUE DER GESAMTEN HYDROBIOLOGIE												The seasonal development of autotrophic picoplankton was investigated in seven Danish lakes representing a eutrophication gradient. Highest cell abundance between 1.5 to 6 x 10(5) cells ml-1 were found in mid-summer. Minor peaks were observed in spring. In winter, densities were below 10(3) ml-1. The highest relative picoplankton contribution to total autotrophic biomass also occurred in mid-summer. In the eutrophic lakes and one humic lake the average seasonal contribution of picoplankton to total chlorophyll was below 1 % increasing to 5-8 % in the meso- and oligotrophic clear water lakes. During short periods the proportion of picoplankton did reach 25 %. The higher relative importance of picoplankton in less productive lakes was not due to higher actual chlorophyll concentrations, but due to a much more pronounced response by larger algae at higher nutrient loading. Both cyanobacteria and eukaryote organisms were present as picoplankton. Only eukaryotes were found in one eutrophic lake and an acidic, humic lake. In the eutrophic lakes eukaryote picoplankton was dominant; both with respect to cell densities and biovolume, whereas cyanobacteria dominated the two meso-oligotrophic lakes. Autotrophic picoplankton were present in all lake types, however their importance seemed to be less in most eutrophic lakes than in less productive, meso-oligotrophic lakes.																			0020-9309						1991	76	4					505	522		10.1002/iroh.19910760404	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19910760404													WOS:A1991HE11500003

In the systems reported here, Lakes Possum Kingdom, Granbury and Whitney (Texas), P parvum blooms were winter phenomena developing under conditions far from the growth optimum. Bloom thresholds of 10 x 10(6) cells L-1 were observed as a function of inflow and salinity for the period 2000-2009. In Lake Possum Kingdom, blooms occurred only when 7-day accumulated inflows were <10 x 10(6) m(3) and salinities were >1.5 psu. For Lakes Granbury and Whitney, blooms occurred when 7-day accumulated inflows were <20 x 10(6) m(3) and <40 x 10(6) m(3), respectively, and salinities were >0.5 psu. Inflow to these lakes exceeded thresholds during the spring and early-summer months in 8 (Lake Possum Kingdom), 7 (Lake Granbury) and 6 (Lake Whitney) of the 10 years analyzed. Salinities typically exceeded these thresholds during the period of study prior to the spring of 2007. The spring of 2007 was a period of high precipitation, after which salinities were typically below thresholds. The linkage between incidence of P. parvum blooms, inflows and salinity is of concern because combined effects from human population increase and climate change could lead to periods of decreased inflow and increased salinity, which may then increase the frequency and magnitude of P. arvum blooms.					; Brooks, Bryan/B-2612-2010; Roelke, Daniel/B-5766-2008	Grover, James/0000-0003-2425-6927; Brooks, Bryan/0000-0002-6277-9852; Roelke, Daniel/0000-0002-3166-3793; 													0142-7873	1464-3774				FEB	2011	33	2					243	253		10.1093/plankt/fbq079	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbq079													WOS:000286953500004

Spatial and temporal patterns in the microbial diversity of a meromictic soda lake in Washington State	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The microbial community diversity and composition of meromictic Soap Lake were studied using culture dependent and culture-independent approaches. The water column and sediments were sampled monthly for a year. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes showed all increase in diversity with depth for both groups. Late-summer samples harbored the highest prokaryotic diversity, and the bacteria exhibited less seasonal variability than the archaea. Most-probable-number assays targeting anaerobic microbial guilds were performed to compare summer and fall samples. In both seasons, the anoxic samples appeared to be dominated by lactate-oxidizing sulfate-reducing prokaryotes. High numbers of lactate- and acetate-oxidizing iron-reducing bacteria, as well as fermentative microorganisms, were also found, whereas the numbers of methanogens were low or methanogens were undetectable. The bacterial community composition of summer and fall samples was also assessed by constructing 16S rRNA gene clone libraries. A total of 508 sequences represented an estimated > 1,100 unique operational taxonomic units, most of which were from the monimolimnion, and the summer samples were more diverse than the fall samples (Chao1 = 530 and Chao1 = 295, respectively). For both seasons, the mixolimnion sequences were dominated by Gammaproteobacteria, and the chemocline and monimolimnion libraries were dominated by members of the low-G+C-content group, followed by the Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides (CFB) group; the mixolimnion sediments contained sequences related to uncultured members of the Chloroflexi and the CFB group. Community overlap and phylogenetic analyses, however, not only demonstrated that there was a high degree of spatial turnover but also suggested that there was a degree of temporal variability due to differences in the members and structures of the communities.					; Peyton, Brent/AAC-4210-2019; Peyton, Brent/G-5247-2015	Mormile, Melanie/0000-0001-9054-2687; Peyton, Brent/0000-0003-0033-0651													0099-2240	1098-5336				AUG	2008	74	15					4877	4888		10.1128/AEM.00455-08	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00455-08								18552187					WOS:000258474400038

The results revealed that the unconsolidated surficial cohesive sediment frequently experiences the processes of erosion, suspension and deposition. Wind waves, generated by the absorption of wind energy, are the principal force driving this cycle. When the wavelength-to-water depth ratio (L/D) is 2-3, wave propagation is affected by lakebed friction and surface erosion occurs. When L/D > 3, the interaction between wave and lakebed increases to induce massive erosion. However, influenced by rapid urbanization in the Lake Taihu basin, wind speed has significantly decreased, by an average rate of -0.022 m s(-1) a(-1), from 1970 to 2013. This has reduced the erodible area, represented by simulated L/D, at a rate of -16.9 km(2) a(-1) in the autumn and winter, and -8.1 km(2) a(-1) in the spring and summer. This significant decrease in surface erosion area, and the near disappearance of areas experiencing massive erosion, imply that Lake Taihu has become calmer, which can be expected to have adverse effects on the lake ecosystem by increasing eutrophication and nuisance cyanobacteria blooms.

In a four-month study restrictions/displacements in the presence, and releases in the absence, of Willow Warblers were observed in several of the local species. In the course of the autumn the Willow Warblers also changed their habitat distribution from groves to woodland, presumably because of interference from the numerous local birds in the grove-habitat. Shortly after arrival the habitat and microhabitat distributions (and foraging behavior) of the Willow Warblers were almost identical to those of local species such as the Black-bellied Apalis. However, in the course of the autumn and winter clear divergences occurred between the two groups in several ecological and behavioral parameters.																			0030-5693					MAY	1987	18	2					101	121		10.2307/3676845	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3676845													WOS:A1987H396000004

This study investigates airborne pollen trapping in the Betula microphylla-dominated wetland of Ebinur Lake in Northwestern China from September 2012 to August 2015 using Pearson correlation analysis and the Hybrid Single-particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model. Higher temperatures and moderate precipitation during the flowering period facilitated an increase in birch pollen with more exotic spruce pollen carried from the Tianshan Mountains by airflows, leading to the highest arbor pollen concentrations from September 2012 to August 2013. Peak pollen concentrations from September 2013 to August 2014 were possibly due to an increase in herbaceous pollen resulting from higher temperatures, lower precipitation and more exotic pollen from the desert of southwest Ebinur Lake and Central Asia in summer and autumn. Between September 2014 and August 2015, unfavorable climate conditions in summer and autumn decreased the pollen dispersal of xerophytes such as Artemisia and Chenopodiaceae, with little pollen transported from the Kazakh hilly area in late summer, resulting in the lowest pollen concentrations. Climatic parameters and air mass movements both greatly affected the atmospheric pollen concentration. The results provide information concerning the dispersion and distribution of birch pollen, paleoenvironmental reconstruction and wetland conservation.

The effect of environmental parameters and cyanobacterial blooms on phytoplankton dynamics of a Portuguese temperate lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The increasing occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in freshwaters is of great concern due to the ability of many cyanobacteria to produce cyanotoxins. In the present work, the eutrophied Vela Lake (Central Portugal), used for recreational purposes and as a water source for agriculture, was monitored every fortnight between 2000 and 2001. Phytoplankton diversity and densities were measured and correlated to environmental parameters. A seasonal phytoplanktonic succession was observed and it was mainly correlated with conductivity, temperature, total suspended solids and nutrients availability (particularly phosphorus). Diatoms were dominant during winter months (inferior temperatures and higher nutrients availability) followed by green algae in early spring and then cyanobacteria from late spring until early autumn (less nutrient availability and higher temperatures). A massive cyanobacterial bloom of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae occurred early in May 2001 and was preceded by the lowest nitrogen levels measured in the water during all the study period. At the time of this bloom senescence, dissolved oxygen was severely depleted and a massive death of ichthyofauna was recorded. A Microcystis aeruginosa bloom was also detected in July 2001 and it occurred following a rapid decrease in abundance of green algae and diatoms. By considering not only the environmental parameters but also the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms as explanatory variables in a canonical correspondence analysis, the variance explained for the phytoplanktonic assemblage during the study period was increased in about 7% achieving a total of 61.0%, indicating a correlation that may be due to the known competitive advantage and/or allelopathy of the bloom-forming cyanobacteria towards microalgae.

Its water quality (WQ) has degraded severely during the past three decades with catchment development. To better understand the external nutrient loading impacts on WQ, we measured nutrient concentrations in the main tributaries during January 2010-April 2018 and modelled the monthly volume of all the tributaries for the same period. The results show annual inputs of total nitrogen (TN) had higher variability than total phosphorus (TP). The multi-year average load was 183.8 t/year for TN and 23.3 t/year for TP during 2010-2017. The average TN and TP loads for 2010-2017 were 36.6% higher and 63.8% lower, respectively, compared with observations in 1999. The seasonal patterns of TN and TP external loading showed some similarity, with the highest loading during the wet season and the lowest during the dry season. Loads in spring, summer, autumn, winter, and the wet season (May-October) accounted for 14.2%, 48.8%, 30.3%, 6.7%, and 84.9% of the annual TN load and 14.1%, 49.8%, 28.1%, 8%, and 84.0% of the annual TP load during 2010-2017. In-lake TN and TP concentrations followed a pattern similar to the external loading. The poor correlation between in-lake nutrient concentrations and tributary nutrient inputs at monthly and annual time scales suggests both external loading and internal loading were contributing to the lake eutrophication. Although effective lake restoration will require reducing nutrient losses from catchment agriculture, there may be a need to address a reduction of internal loads through sediment dredging or capping, geochemical engineering, or other effective measures. In addition, the method of producing monthly tributary inflows based on rainfall data in this paper might be useful for estimating runoff at other lakes.

Satellite observations of turbidity in the Dead Sea	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												A methodology to attain daily variability of turbidity in the Dead Sea by means of remote sensing was developed. 250 m/pixel moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance data were used to characterize the seasonal cycle of turbidity and plume spreading generated by flood events in the lake. Fifteen minutes interval images from meteosat second generation 1.6 km/pixel high-resolution visible (HRV) channel were used to monitor daily variations of turbidity. The HRV reflectance was normalized throughout the day to correct for the changing geometry and then calibrated against available MODIS surface reflectance. Finally, hourly averaged reflectance maps are presented for summer and winter. The results show that turbidity is concentrated along the silty shores of the lake and the southern embayments, with a gradual decrease of turbidity values from the shoreline toward the center of the lake. This pattern is most pronounced following the nighttime hours of intense winds. A few hours after winds calm the concentric turbidity pattern fades. In situ and remote sensing observations show a clear relation between wind intensity, wave amplitude and water turbidity. In summer and winter similar concentric turbidity patterns are observed but with a much narrower structure in winter. A simple Lagrangain trajectory model suggests that the combined effects of horizontal transport and vertical mixing of suspended particles leads to more effective mixing in winter. The dynamics of suspended matter contributions from winter desert floods are also presented in terms of hourly turbidity maps showing the spreading of the plumes and their decay.

This study examined the valve size (length, height, width) of an ostracod species (Cyprideis torosa) collected from different lakes of the Mansfeld Lakes (ML), Central Germany. Size variability were investigated on different temporal (ecological and geological) scales and compared on different spatial (regional and local) scales. Statistical methods were applied to explore size variation between and within sample locations and the relationship between size traits and physical and chemical parameters (salinity, oxygen, temperature, pH). In ML no significant differences in size between contiguous lakes were detected but two morphotypes in males were identified in stratigraphically separated Holocene samples and co-occurring within Recent samples. Seasonal effects were detected for females (smaller size in spring than in autumn) and males (smaller size range in spring, higher variability in autumn). The correlation of size traits with environmental parameters revealed no general patterns, but a locally limited correlation between size and salinity in ML exists. On spatial and temporal scales, males and females show sex-specific size patterns, possibly due to differences in life history traits or selection pressure.

J	DANIELS, GL; FELLEY, JD				DANIELS, GL; FELLEY, JD			LIFE-HISTORY AND FOODS OF GAMBUSIA-AFFINIS IN 2 WATERWAYS OF SOUTHWESTERN LOUISIANA	SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST												Populations of Gambusia affinis were sampled monthly from September 1985 to August 1986 in two bayous draining into the Calcasieu Estuary of southwestern Louisiana. The two waterways are very different environments. Choupique Bayou is relatively pristine, drains farmland and forest, and supports a rich fish fauna. Contraband Bayou receives runoff and treated sewage effluents from the City of Lake Charles and has a depauperate fish fauna. In each population, we studied growth and foods of individuals and brood size of females. Despite the striking environmental differences in the two bayous, life histories in the two populations were quite similar. In both populations, foods most frequently found in stomachs were surface prey and detritus. Larger females ate more and higher quality foods than did males and smaller females. Females reproducing in late summer and fall had significantly smaller broods than females reproducing in spring and early summer. Two differences in population parameters between the bayous were that the population in Choupique Bayou was smaller than the population in Contraband Bayou and that an average individual from Choupique Bayou grew to a smaller size than one from Contraband Bayou. These two differences may be due to the heavier predation pressure in Choupique Bayou.																			0038-4909					JUN	1992	37	2					157	165		10.2307/3671664	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3671664													WOS:A1992HX29700007

Fish Hg concentrations were determined seasonally (spring, summer, and autumn) over 3 yr (2010, 2011, and 2012) to test the hypothesis that there are substantial changes in fish Hg concentrations during the year (seasonal variation) as well as annually. Concentrations were significantly (p<0.0001) different in the 2 study lakes, with mean seasonal concentrations varying from 0.24mg/kg to 0.36mg/kg and from 0.29mg/kg to 0.37mg/kg, respectively. The Hg concentrations of both perch populations showed significant year-to-year (p<0.0001) and seasonal variation (p<0.01). The changing fish Hg concentrations were 25% and 28% (2010-2011) and 17% and 0% (2011-2012) in the 2 lakes over the 3 yr, respectively. The results demonstrate how the significant year-to-year increase is, among other variables, related to changes in trophic position, shown through stable nitrogen (N-15) isotope data. The seasonal variation is related to summer growth dilution. The results highlight the clear need for yearly studies of fish Hg concentrations, rather than the 3-yr cycle suggested by current European policy through the Water Framework Directive. The lack of yearly sampling may result in erroneous conclusions regarding fish Hg concentration time trends. Environ Toxicol Chem 2014;33:2661-2670.

The observed water elevations and discharge are analyzed using a tidal analysis package called NS_Tide. The results indicate that the amplitudes of the two principal tides (lunar semidiurnal, M-2, and luni-solar diurnal, K-1) decrease from the river mouth to the upstream. The amplitudes in the high flow season (spring and summer) are lower than those in the low flow season (fall and winter). The amplitudes of the overtides and compound tides amplify from the downstream to the upstream in the low flow season; however, in the high flow season, the amplitudes only amplify in the lower part (0-35 km from the river mouth) and then decrease in the upper part (60-78 km from the river mouth). The temporal variation of tidal amplitudes are strongly correlated to the river discharge. Using the model results in 2013, we analyzed the momentum balance in the river channel and examined the significance of the Pitt River and Pitt Lake system. The momentum balance in the river channel is dominated by the balance between the pressure gradient and the bottom friction. The river-tide interaction plays an important role in the friction term in the lower part of the river channel, while the river flow explains most of the variability moving upstream. The system of the Pitt River and Pitt Lake is important for the tidal propagation in the river channel. Modelling tides without including this system systematically leads to significant inaccuracies of the tides in the river channel of the LFR.

Previous studies of lakes have mainly focused on how reduction in particularly phosphorus (P) concentrations helps to create a shift in lakes from a turbid to a clear state (re-oligotrophication), whereas the effect of nitrogen (N) reduction is less well studied. Here, by analysing a 28-year monthly monitoring dataset (from December 1991 to November 2019) from the subtropical, large eutrophic Lake Taihu, China, we identified a sudden shift in phytoplankton biomass and composition that coincided with a pronounced change in ecosystem functions, for example, resource use efficiency (RUE), during a period with reduction of the external nutrient loading. The changes were particularly strong in winter-spring where a sudden decrease in N concentrations was accompanied by a sudden increase in diatom biomass and phytoplankton RUE and a shift from green algae and flagellate co-dominance to dominance of diatoms. Structural equation modelling further indicated that ammonium reduction led directly to increases in winter-spring phytoplankton RUE and diatom biomass. Repeated fish stocking likely also contributed to the changes in biomass and RUE. Our study provides new insight into the ecological responses to N loading reduction and contributes to the understanding of lake responses to early re-oligotrophication, which was pronounced mainly in the colder seasons in subtropical Lake Taihu, similar to findings in the early phase of re-oligotrophication in numerous temperate lakes.					zhang, min/IYI-9869-2023; Deng, Jianming/AAN-2998-2020; Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019	Liu, Xia/0000-0002-6225-9179													1432-9840	1435-0629				DEC	2023	26	8					1640	1655		10.1007/s10021-023-00855-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-023-00855-z		JUN 2023											WOS:001011699700002

A late Quaternary record of monsoon variability in the northwest Kimberley, Australia	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Understanding of the late Quaternary environment of Australia's vast Kimberley region has to date been hindered by the region's lack of classic palaeoenvironmental archives such as deep lake sediments. However, mound spring peat deposits in the region have been found to be a potentially rich archive of palaeoenvironmental data. Here we present a high resolution record from Black Springs mound spring in the Kimberley's northwest, filling some of the current gaps in knowledge of the region's environmental history. This builds on a similar to 6000 year record developed from the same site and indicates that since the Last Glacial-Interglacial Transition the Australian summer monsoon has varied greatly in intensity, with an increase in monsoonal precipitation from similar to 14,000 yr BP and pronounced drying in the late Holocene. Despite some chronological uncertainties thought to be due to the inclusion of younger, microscopic root fragments, changes in the record compare well with other records of climatic change from the Kimberley, and across tropical northern Australia.

The cells of potentially toxic Microcystis strains containing mcyJ genotypes and cells containing the genus-specific cpcBA gene were quantified by a real-time PCR. The ratio of cells with mcyJ genotypes to the total Microcystis population in the water body was the highest (68.3%) in August when the cyanobacterial bloom reached its peak and the microcystin concentration in the water began to increase. A denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profile analysis of the mcyJ genotypes performed to monitor any changes in the toxic Microcystis population showed the appearance of new genotypes and the disappearance of existing genotypes in the reservoir water collected during the summer months, when compared with the profile for the samples collected in spring and autumn. However, very little change was observed over the course of the year as regards the population diversity of the sediment samples.					; Ahn, Chi-Yong/AAI-8370-2020; Boo, Sung/F-5734-2013; KIM, Song Gun/MAH-9094-2025	Ahn, Chi-Yong/0000-0002-9626-2755; Oh, Hee-Mock/0000-0002-2151-3687; 													0168-6496					OCT	2010	74	1					93	102		10.1111/j.1574-6941.2010.00947.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6941.2010.00947.x								20695890					WOS:000281638900009

Climate modelling for northern Europe indicates high summer temperatures and strong continentality. In eastern Europe, the scale of temperature variation and its influence on ecosystems is weakly recognised. Here, we present a multi-proxy reconstruction of YD conditions from Lake Gos ' ciaz (central Poland). The decadal-resolution analysis of its annually varved sediments indicates an initial decrease in Chironomidae-inferred mean July air temperature followed by steady warming. The pollen-inferred winter-to-summer temperature amplitude and annual precip-itation is highest at the Allerod/YD transition and the early YD (ca. 12.7-12.4 ky cal BP) and YD/Holocene (11.7-11.4 ka cal BP) transition. Temperature and precipitation were the main reasons for lake level fluctuations as reflected in the planktonic/littoral Cladocera ratio. The lake's diatom-inferred total phosphorus decreased with increasing summer temperature from about mid YD. Windy conditions in the early YD until 12.3 ka cal BP caused water mixing and a short-lived/temporary increase in nutrient availability for phytoplankton. The Chironomidae-inferred summer temperature and pollen inferred summer temperature, winter temperature and annual precipitation herein are one of only a few in eastern Europe conducted with such high resolution.					; Noryśkiewicz, Agnieszka/H-1473-2014; Rzodkiewicz (nee Lutyńska), Monika/KBD-2533-2024; Plociennik, Mateusz/R-1232-2018; Kramkowski, Mateusz/HGC-8797-2022; Zawisza, Edyta/B-7005-2015; Antczak-Orlewska, Olga/E-4587-2017; Camuera, Jon/AEC-9980-2022; Płóciennik, Mateusz/R-1232-2018; Słowiński, Michał/B-6546-2011	Rzodkiewicz (Lutynska), Monika/0000-0002-6672-2183; Nevalainen, Liisa/0000-0001-6837-8753; Blaszkiewicz, Miroslaw/0000-0003-4365-0938; Luoto, Tomi/0000-0001-6925-3688; Plociennik, Mateusz/0000-0003-1487-6698; ZAWISKA, IZABELA/0000-0002-5971-9728; Camuera, Jon/0000-0002-6799-7269; Brauer, Achim/0000-0002-6655-9451; Rudna, Marta/0000-0002-6772-9723; Seppa, Heikki/0000-0003-2494-7955; Antczak-Orlewska, Olga/0000-0001-9392-623X; Muller, Daniela/0000-0001-7458-7113													0341-8162	1872-6887				MAY	2022	212								106049	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106049	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106049		FEB 2022											WOS:000790442700004
J	Köhler, J; Behrendt, H; Hoeg, S				Köhler, J; Behrendt, H; Hoeg, S			Long-term response of phytoplankton to reduced nutrient load in the flushed Lake Muggelsee (Spree system, Germany)	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Biomass and structure of phytoplankton of a flushed, shallow lake were compared between a decade with hypertrophic conditions (1980-1990) and a period with 40-50% reduced external nutrient load (1991-1997). Nutrient concentrations in the inflow declined less than loads because of reduced discharge. At the same time, the phytoplankton biovolume decreased by 33% in spring (March-May) and 40% in summer (June-September, average 1980-1990 versus 1991-1997). The total phytoplankton biomass declined despite heavy internal phosphorus load in summer, an absence of macrophytes and reduced biomass of daphnids. Nutrient-based carrying capacities of Muggelsee diminished from the 1980s to recent years, but were still rarely fully saturated. Filamentous cyanobacteria dominated the phytoplankton under hypertrophic conditions but were much less abundant in recent years. Diatoms were less affected by nutrient reduction and became the dominant algal group in the 1990s. Phytoplankton development depended more strongly on the start conditions than on the seasonal averages of nutrient concentrations. Earlier exhaustion of phosphorus by diatoms was the only groper explanation of the shorter or lacking spring development of cyanobacteria from 1991-1997. During summer, cyanobacteria grew at the same rates as in the previous decade, but attained lower maxima because of their lower starting biomass. Obviously, temporary phosphorus limitation in spring might suppress the development of species with low growth rates in such flushed systems during the whole season.					; Köhler, Jan/C-2633-2014	Kohler, Jan/0000-0003-1894-2912; 													0003-9136					MAY	2000	148	2					209	229																WOS:000087119200003

In Central European lakes, the timing of the clear-water phase is linked to large-scale climatic forcing, with warmer winters being followed by an earlier onset of the clear-water phase. Mild winters may favour an early build-up of Daphnia populations, both directly through increased surface temperatures and indirectly by reducing light limitation and enhancing algal production, all being a consequence of earlier thermal stratification. We conducted a field experiment to disentangle the separate impacts of stratification depth (affecting light supply) and temperature on the magnitude and timing of successional events in the plankton. We followed the dynamics of the phytoplankton spring bloom, the clear-water phase and the spring peak in Daphnia abundance in response to our experimental manipulations. Deeper mixing delayed the timing of all spring seasonal events and reduced the magnitudes of the phytoplankton bloom and the subsequent Daphnia peak. Colder temperatures retarded the timing of the clear-water phase and the subsequent Daphnia peak, whereas the timing of the phytoplankton peak was unrelated to temperature. Most effects of mixing depth (light) and temperature manipulations were independent, effects of mixing depth being more prevalent than effects of temperature. Because mixing depth governs both the light climate and the temperature regime in the mixed surface layer, we propose that climate-driven changes in the timing and depth of water column stratification may have far-reaching consequences for plankton dynamics and should receive increased attention.

Wintertime Brine Discharge at the Surface of a Cold Polar Glacier and the Unexpected Absence of Associated Seismicity	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												A subglacial groundwater system beneath Taylor Glacier, Antarctica, discharges hypersaline, iron-rich brine episodically at the glacier surface to create Blood Falls. However, the triggering mechanism for these brine release events is not yet understood. Identifying which fracture processes are observed seismically can help us better characterize the hydrological system at Taylor Glacier, and more generally, provide us with a broader understanding of englacial hydrologic activity in cold glaciers. We document wintertime brine discharge using time-lapse photography. Subfreezing air temperatures during the brine discharge indicate that surface melt-induced hydrofracture is an unlikely trigger for brine release. Further, we analyze local seismic data to test a hypothesis that fracturing generates elevated surface wave energy preceding and/or coinciding with brine release events. Our results show no discernible elevated Rayleigh wave activity prior to or during Blood Falls brine release. Instead, we find a pattern of seismic events dominated by a seasonal signal, with more Rayleigh events occurring in the summer than the winter from the Blood Falls source area. We calculate that the volumetric opening of cracks that would generate Rayleigh waves at our detection limits are of similar size to myriad cracks in glacier ice, lake ice, and frozen sediment in the terminus area. We therefore propose that any fracturing coincident with brine release activity likely consists of a series of smaller opening events that are masked by other seismicity in the local environment.					; Carmichael, Joshua/AAQ-1452-2020; Carr, Chris/AAZ-4273-2021	Pettit, Erin Christine/0000-0002-6765-9841; Carr, Chris/0000-0002-9273-8584; 													2169-9003	2169-9011				MAR	2022	127	3							e2021JF006325	10.1029/2021JF006325	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JF006325													WOS:000776590100020

Round goby Neogobius melanostomus attraction to conspecific and heterospecific egg odours	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												In this study, cannibalistic and predatory responses of juvenile Neogobius melanostomus (either fed or deprived of food and caught during the reproductive summer or non-reproductive winter season) to water washings of fertilized eggs from conspecifics (N. melanostomus), heterospecifics (rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss) and control lake water were tested. Fed juveniles (summer season) spent significantly more time on the side of the flume containing stimuli from conspecific eggs over control water, while significantly preferring control water to heterospecific stimuli. In addition, fish showed a significant preference towards stimuli from conspecific eggs over heterospecific stimuli by associating near conspecific egg odours 1.5 times longer [Correction added after online publication 28 April 2011, text changed]. Fish that were deprived of food, regardless of whether caught during the summer or winter season, did not show any preference towards either conspecific or heterospecific stimuli. These findings show that conspecific egg odours attract fed juveniles and that there is a potential to lure fish to odour traps as a means of control.

Total lipids, triacylglycerols, and glycogen did not increase significantly until the temperature dropped to 7-degrees-C, and glycerol concentrations did not increase until after exposure to 4-degrees-C for 3 days. Thus, while decreased temperature triggered increased energy storage, glycerol synthesis required a cold stress. Shifting cold-stressed N. obscura back to 20-degrees-C resulted in rapid resynthesis of glycogen coupled with a decrease in glycerol, but no changes in total lipid and triacylglycerols.																			0008-4301					OCT	1993	71	10					2038	2041		10.1139/z93-288	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z93-288													WOS:A1993MJ08000014

To better understand how the heterogeneous land surface in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) contributes to precipitation, we used the water-vapor tracer (WVT) method coupled with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional climate model. The goals were to quantify the PR ratio, in terms of annual mean, seasonal variability and diurnal cycle, and to address the relationships of the PR ratio with lake treatments and precipitation amount. Simulations showed that the PR ratio increases from 0.1 in winter to 0.4 in summer when averaged over the TP with the maxima centered at the headwaters of three major rivers (Yangtze, Yellow and Mekong). For the central TP, the highest PR ratio rose to over 0.8 in August, indicating that most of the precipitation was recycled via local evapotranspiration in summer. The larger daily mean and standard deviation of the PR ratio in summer suggested a stronger effect of land-atmosphere interactions on precipitation in summer than in winter. Despite the relatively small spatial extent of inland lakes, the treatment of lakes in WRF significantly impacted the calculation of the PR ratio over the TP, and correcting lake temperature substantially improved both precipitation and PR ratio simulations. There was no clear relationship between PR ratio and precipitation amount; however, a significant positive correlation between PR and convective precipitation was revealed. This study is beneficial for the understanding of land-atmosphere interaction over high mountain regions.					; Chen, Fei/JZC-6314-2024; Miguez-Macho, Gonzalo/AAA-3295-2019	Miguez-Macho, Gonzalo/0000-0002-4259-7883; gao, yan hong/0000-0002-0403-2929; Chen, Fei/0000-0003-2573-3828; 													0930-7575	1432-0894				NOV	2020	55	9-10					2921	2937		10.1007/s00382-020-05426-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-020-05426-9		AUG 2020											WOS:000563748300001

The ratios show seasonal variations superimposed on a gradual change over nine years. The isotopic ratios started to increase in early 1990 and decrease in the spring of 1995. The seasonal variation which is high in winter and low in summer correlates with the temperature difference between lake water and ambient air. The large temperature difference in winter enhances the evaporation of lake water and produces the enriched isotopic ratios relative to the ratios in summer. The accumulation of snow and the decrease in the flux of meteoric water into the lake strengthens the wintertime isotopic enrichment. The enriched isotopic ratios of the lake water over a long time result from the addition of an end member with heavy isotopic ratios contained in a thermal fluid supplied to the lake. Considering the water balance in the lake, the isotopic ratios of the thermal fluid were found to be close to the lake water itself, suggesting the circulation of the lake water seeping through lake floor. Based on the correlation between Cl(-)concentration and the isotopic ratios, the contribution by the heavy end member was estimated to be 25-36% relative to the enrichment by evaporation. The heavy end member could be a liquid phase evolved from a parental fluid, which is a mixture of local meteoric water and a magmatic fluid as found in high-temperature volcanic gases.

The seasonal patterns observed were consistent and varied little between sampling years. Nematode abundance and biomass were highest in summer. Species richness and diversity peaked in winter. With 152 identified species, Obersee is the most species-rich lake ever described. Species number was not constant over years but the main assemblage structure hardly changed. The community was dominated by the same 4 species throughout the study. Colonization was very strong in winter while extinction rates were high in summer. This study shows that the community structure of free-living nematodes depends strongly on the season investigated.

In this study, seasonal sampling was conducted in algal- and macrophyte-dominated zones of Lake Taihu, China. High-resolution dialysis (HR-Peeper) and diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) techniques were used to measure soluble Sb and DGT-labile Sb in the sediment-water profiles at a 4 mm vertical resolution. Results showed that total Sb in sediments from the two zones were on average 3.50 mg/kg and 3.21 mg/kg in the algal- and macrophyte-dominated zones, respectively, with the residual fraction being 96.3% and 95.4% of the total Sb contents in the two zones. In winter, soluble Sb concentrations in both zones increased. This was probably due to the oxidation of Sb(III) to Sb(V) by Mn and Fe oxides. In summer and autumn, soluble Sb concentrations in the algal-dominated region remained low. This is attributed to the dominance of insoluble Sb(III) in sediments under anoxic conditions under eutrophic environments. In contrast, soluble Sb concentrations in the macrophyte-dominated zone were significantly high in summer and were 4.15-times higher than limits set by the World Health Organization (WHO). This likely resulted from the photochemical and rhizospheric oxidation of insoluble Sb(III) compounds. It is suggested that Sb contamination in the sediment-water system of the macrophyte-dominated zone deserves additional attention. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The delta has been constructed upon a flooding surface developed on a previous shelf-phase delta. There are three principal depositional zones: the subaerial delta plain, the distributary channel mouth region and the subaqeous delta. The subaerial delta plain is characterized by an anastomosing system of high-sinuosity channels and extensive thermokarst lake development. This region is greatly influenced by the annual cycle of seasonal processes including winter freezing of sediments and channels, ice-jamming and flooding in the early spring and declining river stage during the summer and autumn. Deposition occurs on channel levees and in thermokarst lakes during flood events and is commonly rhythmic in nature with discrete annual beds being distinguishable. In the channel mouth environment, deposition is dominated by landward accretion and aggradation of mouth bars during river- and storm surge-induced flood events. The subaqeous delta is characterized by a shallow water platform and a gentle offshore slope. Sediment bypassing of the shallow-water platform is efficient as a result of the presence of incised submarine channels and the predominance of suspension transport of fine-grained sediments. Facies of the shallow platform include silty sand with climbing ripple lamination. Offshore facies are dominated by seaward-fining fine sand to silt tempestites. Sea-ice scouring and sediment deformation are common beyond 10 m. water depth where bioturbated muds are the predominant facies. The low angle profile of the shallow-water platform is interpreted to be the combined response of a fine-grained delta to (1) storm sediment dispersal; (2) autoretreat as a result of the increasing subaerial and subaqeous area of deposition as the delta progrades out of its glacial valley; (3) limited water depth above the underlying flooding surface; and (4) efficient nearshore bypassing of sediment through subice channels at the peak of spring discharge. Several indicators of the cold climate can be used as criteria for the interpretation of ancient successions, including thermokarst lake development, submarine channel scours, freeze-thaw deformation and ice-scour deformation structures. Permafrost inhibits compaction subsidence and, together with the shallow-water setting, also limits autocyclic lobe switching. The cold climate can thus influence stratal architecture by favouring the development of regional-scale clinoform. sets rather than multiple, smaller scale lobes separated by autocyclic flooding surfaces.

The higher contamination of OPEs in the adjacent rivers indicated the impact of terrestrial input. Tris(1-chloropropan-2-yl) phosphate (TCIPP) was the predominant OPE in the four environmental sample groups investigated. The spatial distribution of OPEs in seawater varied greatly seasonally and was mainly affected by terrestrial input, with OPEs being redistributed under the influence of tidal currents. The partition coefficients (log Koc) of the OPEs were calculated, and their strong correlation with the log Kow (octanol-water) values suggested that the water-sediment allocation was significantly affected by hydrophobicity. The homologous relationships among the 7 OPEs with detection frequencies greater than 40% were identified by principal component analysis (PCA). The partial least squares regression (PLSR) model explicated that n-ary sumation OPEs cycling dynamics and principal controlling factors were dissimilar in the bay versus surrounding rivers. The risk quotient (RQ) faced by typical organisms in seawater and river water indicated that short-term OPEs exposure was safe for green algae, daphnia and fish. The organisms in rivers faced the higher ecological risk of OPEs in spring than in summer and winter. Therefore, the terrestrial transport of OPEs in spring should be controlled.					; He, Mengchang/B-6466-2012; wu, tingting/H-8032-2012; Ou-Yang, Wei/AGS-1930-2022	Wang, Baodong/0000-0002-1323-1372; 													0269-7491	1873-6424				DEC 1	2021	290								118074	10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118074	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118074		SEP 2021						34523525					WOS:000696711500004

Geochemical and mineralogical proxies beyond temperature: Autumn seasons trapped in freshwater nacre	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Measurements of trace element chemistry, mineralogy, and isotope geochemistry are rarely combined with known environmental data to provide a more complete story about how environmental conditions are recorded in biomineral carbonates. Here, cultured (farmed) pearls serve as relatively pristine time capsules to study these geochemical and mineral-based proxies. Cathodoluminescence (CL) imaging and Raman spectroscopic mapping on the & mu;m-scale reveals that heterogeneous crystal bonding environments, geochemistry, and organic contents across the growth history of a freshwater pearl reflect environmental shifts in Kentucky Lake, TN, USA. A major CL peak at 551 nm aligns with increased manganese and organic contents and correlates with lake conductivity and alkalinity data. These CL features are temporally offset from previous 10-& mu;m-scale aragonite nacre oxygen isotope measurements (& delta;18OArg) that record periods of minimum lake temperatures in winter seasons. Thus, we suggest that these trace element and organic features represent autumn or spring rainy seasons that experience lake turnover events and more land runoff rich in Mn and nutrients, increasing aragonite-bound Mn and organic contents in the nacre. This 551 nm signal is absent in Mn-poor saltwater pearl nacre. A second CL peak at 444 nm shows different heterogeneous features likely due to crystal structure shifts, as evidenced by correlations to a Raman map of translational (T): librational (L) mode height ratios typically signaling changes in nacre tablet orientation. Thus, we show that & mu;m-scale CL and Raman mapping may serve as complementary environmental proxies to novel SIMS-based & delta;18OArg temperature proxies in order to capture additional information about local lake environments at seasonal to sub-seasonal temporal resolutions.					; Valley, John/B-3466-2011; Bullock, Emma/A-3870-2016	Zhou, Chunhui/0000-0001-8366-4336; Farfan, Gabriela/0000-0001-5204-7044; Valley, John/0000-0003-3530-2722; Bullock, Emma/0000-0002-5678-3695													0016-7037	1872-9533				AUG 15	2023	355						126	137		10.1016/j.gca.2023.06.033	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2023.06.033		JUL 2023											WOS:001041946400001

Pond and lake dyes that block light to restrict algal photosynthesis are a relatively new product assumed to be an environmentally friendly since they are based on food dyes. Their use in urban garden ponds raises questions linked to mosquito oviposition, since coloured water can be an attractant. Culex (mostly pipiens) is commonly found in UK gardens and is a potential vector of viruses including the West Nile Virus (WNV). Any factors that significantly change the distribution and population of Cx pipiens could impact future risks of disease transmission. A gravid trap was used to catch female Cx pipiens mosquitoes for use in oviposition choice tests in laboratory and semi-field conditions. Two types of pond dye, blue and shadow (which looks slightly red), were tested for their impact on oviposition and survival of wild caught Cx pipiens. There were no significant differences in the number of egg batches laid when gravid mosquitoes were given a choice between either blue dye and clear water or shadow dye and clear water indicating that these dyes are not attractants. Larvae hatched from egg batches laid by wild-caught gravid females were used to measure survival to adulthood with or without dye, in a habitat controlled to prevent further colonisation. The experiment was run twice, once in the summer and again in the autumn, whereas the dyes had no impact on emergence in the summer, there were highly significant reductions in emergence of adults in both dye treated habitats in the autumn. Containers with or without shadow dye were placed outside to colonise naturally and were sampled weekly for larvae and pupae over a 6 month period through summer and autumn. There was a significant negative effect of shadow dye on pupal abundance in a three week period over the summer, but otherwise there was no effect. It is likely that population abundance and food was a more powerful factor for mosquito survival than the dye.																			1932-6203					MAR 28	2018	13	3							e0193847	10.1371/journal.pone.0193847	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0193847								29590133					WOS:000428603100035

To elucidate the spatiotemporal responses of macrobenthic communities and environmental factors in reservoirs, this study investigated macrobenthos and environmental parameters in Yinghu Lake during spring (May), summer (August), and autumn (November). The results showed that the trophic level index (TLI), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were significantly higher and pH was significantly lower (P < 0.05) at the developed sites (DS) than at the undeveloped sites (UDS). The survey identified 32 macrobenthos species representing 3 phylums and 5 orders. PERMANOVA analyses showed that the macrobenthic community structure of Yinghu Lake differed significantly between regions, Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri from the gathering collectors (20.47%) and Corbicula fluminea from the filtering collectors (7.82%) were the primary species driving the differences. The results of the two-way ANOVA indicated that species richness, the Margalef index (D), and the functional feeding group Margalef index (FFG-D) were significantly lower in summer than in autumn (P < 0.05). FFG-D was also significantly lower at the DS compared to the UDS (P < 0.05), while the interaction effects of season and region on these indicators were not significant (P > 0.05). Redundancy analysis (RDA) and generalized additive modelling (GAM) indicated that the permanganate index (CODMn) and total dissolved solids altered the macrobenthic community structure towards oligochaete and gathering collectors-dominated assemblages. Moreover, macrobenthic diversity was constrained by high total dissolved solids concentrations, sediment organic carbon (OC_s), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), low sediment total phosphorus (TP_s), high water temperature, and deep water. In summary, the spatiotemporal variations in water quality and macrobenthos communities in the reservoir were influenced by natural conditions and anthropogenic disturbances.

Significant differences were observed between sites and seasons. Individuals from the peat lakes Ngaroto and Hamilton (Rotoroa) had the highest incidence of deformities during summer (78 and 48%, respectively) and these declined significantly in winter (40 and 26%). No seasonal differences were observed in larvae from the two sites chosen in Lake Rotorua. Individuals close to the Hamurana Stream in Lake Rotorua showed the lowest number of malformed head capsules during summer (32%). In order to assess the influence of substrate type, larvae from two different locations were cultured through their entire life cycle in three different substrates. Results overall indicated no clear pattern of substrate effect although some structures may be more sensitive indicators of substrate physicochemistry than others. The incidence of deformity tended to decline with successive laboratory culture.

The estimated DIN flux from the river was always higher than that from the adjacent Lake Suigetsu, suggesting that DIN from the river was a primary N source. The seasonality of phytoplankton delta N-15 was largely determined by the relative strengths of external DIN fluxes (river and adjacent lake) and internal N cycling. A decrease of delta N-15 in phytoplankton during summer suggested an assimilation of low delta N-15 of NO3- regenerated within the lake. In contrast, an increasing delta N-15 trend in autumn suggested the assimilation of high delta N-15 of NH4+ from Lake Suigetsu. NH4+ provided 39-62% of the N assimilated by phytoplankton in the autumn, with isotopic discrimination ranging from 8.3 parts per thousand to 12.6 parts per thousand. These results show the importance of intra-annual variability in the concentrations and delta N-15 of major nutrient sources on the delta N-15 of phytoplankton.					; Yoshida, Takehito/O-9983-2014	Sugimoto, Ryo/0000-0002-6318-3452; Yoshida, Takehito/0000-0001-9178-3634													0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2014	59	1					37	47		10.4319/lo.2014.59.1.0037	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2014.59.1.0037													WOS:000339901800003

Equal numbers of fish (75) each were taken from ambient and thermally altered (> 10.degree. C ambient) areas of the lake. The total length and weight of each bass was noted, along with the presence or absence of lesions associated with red-sore disease (caused by the bacterium, Aeromonas hydrophila and the ciliate, Epistylis sp.). Blood was drawn, by heart puncture, from each bass and the following hematological parameters measured: hematocrit, Hb, Fe, total Fe-binding capacity, thyroxine, Na and K. Only the total Fe-binding capacity was significantly higher in bass with red-sore disease; none of the other blood parameters were significantly different in infected and uninfected bass. Bass from thermally altered locations had consistently higher hematocrits during both summer and winter. Bass from thermal and ambient locations were not different with respect to Fe, Fe-binding capacity, Na or K levels. However, bass taken during summer months had higher levels of circulating Fe than individuals in winter months. Summer bass had higher thyroxine levels than bass in winter. These results are discussed in terms of their relationship to red-sore disease, season and the impact of thermal effluent.

Using Tracking Data to Identify Gaps in Knowledge and Conservation of the Critically Endangered Siberian Crane (Leucogeranus leucogeranus)	REMOTE SENSING												The critically endangered Siberian crane (Leucogeranus leucogeranus) is the world's third most endangered species of crane. Despite the enhanced conservation actions in recent years, there are pieces of evidence that suggest that its population is continuously decreasing. To gain insights into the possible causes of the population decline, we tracked nine Siberian cranes in Russia and Mongolia using GPS transmitters. We obtained migration episodes based on over 0.31 million subsequent locations from 3283 bird days between June 1995 and December 2021. Siberian cranes migrated an average of 5604 +/- 362 km in spring from wintering to breeding areas and a mean of 5265 +/- 454 km from breeding to wintering areas. We identified 35 staging sites along the migration corridor, including 17 critical staging sites at which birds staged for >14 days and 18 stopover sites that supported individuals for more than two days within a ca. 200 km-wide migratory corridor. Of the areas used by the tagged cranes, 77% of the breeding areas in Russia, 55% of the staging areas, 99% of the non-breeding summering area in Mongolia, and 50% of the wintering areas in Poyang Lake in China lay outside the current protected area network. Although we should be prudent about interpreting the conservation gaps of the entire population from only a few tracked birds, these results strongly suggest that the current protection network for this numerically rare species is inadequate, requiring urgent review.					; Yi, Kun/ODK-5753-2025; Batbayar, Nyambayar/N-7066-2015	Zhang, Junjian/0009-0006-0643-6579; Higuchi, Hiroyoshi/0000-0002-1215-2736														2072-4292				OCT	2022	14	20							5101	10.3390/rs14205101	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14205101													WOS:000873625000001
J	VANNI, MJ; TEMTE, J				VANNI, MJ; TEMTE, J			SEASONAL PATTERNS OF GRAZING AND NUTRIENT LIMITATION OF PHYTOPLANKTON IN A EUTROPHIC LAKE	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Observations and experiments on zooplankton grazing and nutrient (N and P) limitation of phytoplankton of Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, revealed that the relative strength of the two factors varied markedly during the seasonal succession of phytoplankton. Furthermore, seasonal changes in grazing and nutrient limitation were caused not ony by seasonal changes in zooplankton community structure and nutrient availability but also by changes in phytoplankton community structure, which led to changes in edibility to zooplankton. The spring phytoplankton bloom of diatoms and small flagellates was highly vulnerable to grazing by both cyclopoid copepods and Daphnia, although Daphnia had a much stronger effect. Increased Daphnia grazing in late spring resulted in low phytoplankton biomass (the clear-water period) and a phytoplankton community dominated by colonial green algae-taxa vulnerable to grazing by Daphnia but not other zooplankton. Nutrients (N and P) did not limit phytoplankton growth during the spring bloom or the clear-water period. After the clear-water period, the summer phytoplankton community was dominated by blue-greens and Ceratium. Grazing effects by both Daphnia and copepods were low in summer, while nutrient limitation (both N and P) became severe. Reduced grazing impacts in summer may have resulted from prior intense grazing impacts, which led to dominance of grazing-resistant taxa. These results suggest that seasonal variation in the strength of grazing and nutrient controls in eutrophic lakes results from changes in zooplankton biomass and community structure, nutrient availability, and phytoplankton community structure interacting to determine phytoplankton seasonal succession.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				MAY	1990	35	3					697	709		10.4319/lo.1990.35.3.0697	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1990.35.3.0697													WOS:A1990DW93500011
J	HAWES, I				HAWES, I			THE SEASONAL DYNAMICS OF SPIROGYRA IN A SHALLOW, MARITIME ANTARCTIC LAKE	POLAR BIOLOGY												The filamentous chlorophyte Spirogyra forms a mat covering extensive areas of Spirogyra Lake, a small, shallow, Antarctic lake. It has an annual growth pattern, with a maximum standing crop of 400 .mu.g chlorophyll-a m-2 during the ice-free summer period. Nutrient concentrations were low and there was evidence for P-limitation. The attainment of such a high standing crop was probably dependent on the lake''s high specific dilution rate. Radiation flux was very low under winter ice cover and Spirogyra died back almost completely. The lake water became hypoxic and inorganic nutrients accumulated in both the water column and overwintering algal filaments. Spore formation was not observed, but changes in the composition of filaments indicated that polysaccharides, which had accumulated in summer, were depleted over the long, ice-covered winter period.

This study employed the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model to estimate the net ecosystem productivity (NEP) of the Dongting Lake wetland and explored the spatiotemporal dynamics and driving mechanisms of carbon sinks from 2000 to 2022, utilizing the Theil-Sen median trend, Mann-Kendall test, and attribution based on the differentiating equation (ADE). Results showed that (1) the annual mean spatial NEP was 50.24 g C/m(2)/a, which first increased and then decreased, with an overall trend of -1.5 g C/m(2)/a. The carbon sink was strongest in spring, declined in summer, and shifted to a carbon source in autumn and winter. (2) Climate variability and human activities contributed +2.17 and -3.73 g C/m(2)/a to NEP, respectively. Human activities were the primary driver of carbon sink degradation (74.30%), whereas climate change mainly promoted carbon sequestration (25.70%). However, from 2000-2011 to 2011-2022, climate change shifted from enhancing to limiting carbon sequestration, mainly due to the transition from water storage and lake reclamation to ecological restoration policies and intensified climate anomalies. (3) NEP was negatively correlated with precipitation and water level. Land use adjustments, such as forest expansion and conversion of cropland and reed to sedge, alongside maintaining growing season water levels between 24.06 similar to 26.44 m, are recommended to sustain and enhance wetland carbon sinks. Despite inherent uncertainties in model parameterization and the lack of sufficient in situ flux validation, these findings could provide valuable scientific insights for wetland carbon management and policy-making.

Seven sites located along the belt were sampled to determine the life cycle of this sponge. The lake is artificially regulated and the variation in water level is about 52 cm by day. Specimens were collected monthly from June 2000 to May 2001. According to the season, sponge morphology differs from thin encrusting laminae (in spring) to sleeve-shaped colonies (in summer) to small overwriting-wintering representatives. The colour also varies from uniformly green to brownish to green-spotted brownish. Ultrastructural investigation revealed that green sponges harbour zoochlorellae, which were not observed in the brownish colonies. These symbionts are endocellular and several may be found in the same sponge cell. The progressive pigmentation of the brownish sponges from spring onwards is coherent with the acquisition of the zoochlorellae from the environment. Histological investigation revealed that sexual activity is concentrated in a four month period (from May to August) and that sponges growing on old and young reeds are both involved in reproduction. Ephydatia fluviatilis is a gonochoristic species with overlapping phases of sperm and oocyte maturation. Our data suggest that temperature (which rises about 6 degreesC from April to May) plays a role in controlling gamete differentiation in this lake. The population of E. fluviatilis in Lake Piediluco lacks gemmulation and the small sponges adherent to the reed rootlets are the main over-wintering representatives. The release of larvae and their ensuing metamorphosis after settlement, coupled with natural sponge fragmentation, may explain the origin of the small overwintering colonies.

The empirical model was further validated with chlorophyll a data from a 2008 to 2009 dataset, with RMSE < 7.48 mu g l(-1) and r (2) = 0.978. The seasonal and inter-annual variability of the surface chlorophyll a concentration from 2006 to 2008 was then examined using Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis. The results revealed that the first four modes were significant, explaining 54.0% of the total chlorophyll a variance, and indicated that during the summer, algal blooms always occur in the northern bays, Meiliang Bay and Gonghu Bay, while they occur along the southwestern lakeshore during early summer, fall, and even early winter. The inter-annual variance analysis showed that the duration of algal blooms was from April to December of 2007, which was different from the bloom periods in 2006 and 2008. The results of EOF analysis show its potential for long-term integrated lake monitoring, not only in Lake Taihu but also in other large lakes threatened by accelerating eutrophication.

Because D. bland seems to constitute a new record" in the Balkans, the present study provides novel information on the biology and ecology of its planktonic larvae in four natural lakes and one reservoir located in western Greece. Dreissena bland larvae were present in all lakes and their abundance varied between 3.4 and 440 ind. l(-1). The larvae were present all year round, having greater abundance in spring and summer and lesser in winter. The species seems to have an extended reproductive period from early spring until late summer. The larvae are distributed mainly in the upper 20 m of the deep lakes Amvrakia and Trichonis, while are aggregated close to or within the thermocline layer in the latter lake. A size-specific depth distribution was observed, with larger larvae residing in deeper strata during the stratification period. Temperature appears to be the most important parameter affecting the abundance variation of the larvae in the natural lakes, while water retention time is the major parameter in Stratos reservoir. In contrast, the soft, muddy substratum of Lake Lysimachia seems to be the inhibiting factor for the existence of a viable population here. The great similarities in larval ecology between D. bland and D. polymorpha must be taken into consideration, as D. blanci could become another invasive species in freshwater ecosystems. Therefore, more research is required on the life cycle of this species, and the ecological and economic consequences of its presence in lakes and reservoirs of southeastern Europe.																			0076-2997	2168-9075					2012	55	1					135	150		10.4002/040.055.0109	http://dx.doi.org/10.4002/040.055.0109													WOS:000309244200009

D. studeri fed on both algae and bacteria with estimated filtering rates of 0.048 and 0.061 l ind(-1) day(-1)), respectively. Algae seemed to be the major food resource for the D. studeri population, however at times of low algal densities the bacterioplankton represented an important alternative food resource. The D. studeri grazing impact on the algal and bacterial standing stock was in general low (0.6-4.6% removed per day), but during the winter period this organism can remove up to 34% of the bacterial production (BP). At times D. studeri grazing can temporarily have a significant impact on the BP rates, though their impact was relatively low when compared to viral-induced bacterial mortality in the lake.

Water quality of Loch Leven: responses to enrichment, restoration and climate change	HYDROBIOLOGIA												It is usually assumed that climate change will have negative impacts on water quality and hinder restoration efforts. The long-term monitoring at Loch Leven shows, however, that seasonal changes in temperature and rainfall may have positive and negative impacts on water quality. In response to reductions in external nutrient loading, there have been significant reductions in in-lake phosphorus concentrations. Annual measures of chlorophyll a have, however, shown little response to these reductions. Warmer spring temperatures appear to be having a positive effect on Daphnia densities and this may be the cause of reduced chlorophyll a concentrations in spring and an associated improvement in water clarity in May and June. The clearest climate impact was the negative relationship between summer rainfall and chlorophyll a concentrations. This is highlighted in extreme weather years, with the three wettest summers having very low chlorophyll a concentrations and the driest summers having high concentrations. To predict water quality impacts of future climate change, there is a need for more seasonal predictions from climate models and a greater recognition that water quality is the outcome of seasonal responses in different functional groups of phytoplankton and zooplankton to a range of environmental drivers.

Climate Change and Teleconnections Amplify Lake Stratification With Differential Local Controls of Surface Water Warming and Deep Water Cooling	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Temperate lakes are experiencing increases in warming and stratification duration while global-scale teleconnections potentially exacerbate effects of climate change. We examined interannual surface and deep water temperature change and stratification phenology in a long-term, weekly data set (1985-2017) from a dimictic lake in New York State, USA. We developed a metric, called mixing action, to capture multiple facets about the stratified period. We found warming in surface waters and cooling in deep water. Surface warming was positively correlated with air temperature. Deep water cooling was positively correlated with spring mixing period length and deep water spring temperature, indicating a lag effect. Mixing action was correlated with global temperature anomaly and spring North Atlantic Oscillation index. With increasing summer stratification strength and length, dimictic lakes like Mohonk may continue shifting toward monomictic mixing regimes with increasing summer hypolimnetic anoxia and changing lake biogeochemistry, productivity, and habitat for aquatic organisms.					; Oleksy, Isabella/AAD-2249-2021	Richardson, David/0000-0001-9374-9624; Oleksy, Isabella/0000-0003-2572-5457; 													0094-8276	1944-8007				FEB 16	2021	48	5							e2020GL090959	10.1029/2020GL090959	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020GL090959													WOS:000629422400002

This complicates evaluation of measures to reduce nutrient loads. We used a mass-balance box model to calculate long-term (1968-2015) and seasonal source contributions to phosphorus (P) concentrations and cycling in the stratified Stockholm inner archipelago (IA), Baltic Sea. A drastic reduction of sewage P loads in the early 1970s reduced sewage from the major to a minor P source. Further P load reductions in the 1990s cut the direct contribution from the sewage point sources to the annual mean surface water P concentration from 10 mu g l(-1)(25%) to < 4 mu g l(-1)(12%). The largest contributions to the surface water P concentration are now (from 1996) inflowing seawater (37%), freshwater (25%), and P recycling from sediments below 20 m depth (26%). Variations in freshwater flushing give higher P concentrations in dry years, when dilution of P inputs from sediments and sewage is small, while in wet years, these inputs are greatly diluted. Source-partitioned phosphate uptake shows that the spring bloom is fueled mainly by P of seawater and freshwater origin, while the contribution from sewage point sources is minor. Since sediment P release is mostly recycled P from the settled spring bloom, the P inputs from seawater and freshwater are now the major drivers of the IA P cycle. Recycling of P from sediments boosts surface water P concentrations in autumn and winter, affecting management target concentrations.

In hatchery, it is advantageous to delay ovulation from several months because Arctic charr require temperatures below 6 degrees C for ovulation and it is easier to supply cold water to broodstock in winter than in fall. The acclimatization of Arctic charr in long days during fall delayed ovulation time of several months. This method had the disadvantage to extend the ovulation time over more than three months. This problem was suppressed by transferring again the broodstock under short days during December. The efficiency of the long day treatment to delay ovulation did not depend on its length when the treatment lasted longer than 1.5 months. In females acclimatized in long days during fall and winter, plasma gonadotropin levels (GTH II) were always very low. After a transfer from long days to short days in January, plasma GTH II levels raised within three weeks. Plasma GTH II levels were significantly lower during the ovulation period in females maintained under long days than in females transferred in short days. At this stage of reproductive cycle, plasma GTH I levels were always very low, whatever the photoperiod regime. A melatonin treatment given by intraperitoneal implants did not modify gonadotropin secretions in both long day or short day conditions. The pituitary responsiveness of females to a stimulation of gonadotropin secretion by GnRH injections did not differ between fish reared in long days or in short days. Pimozide treatment did not modify the pituitary responsiveness to GnRH in females acclimatized in long day photoperiod. As a whole, the results indicated that the inhibitory effect of long days on GTH II secretion did not involve a blockade by dopamine contrary to the inhibitory effect of warm temperatures on the same phenomenon. The inhibition of GTH II secretion at final stages of the reproductive cycles probably involved changes in the hypothalamic control of GTH II secretion.																			0767-2861						1998		350-51					241	253		10.1051/kmae:1998001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/kmae:1998001													WOS:000078537100002
J	O'Gorman, R; Lantry, BE; Schneider, CP				O'Gorman, R; Lantry, BE; Schneider, CP			Effect of stock size, climate, predation, and trophic status on recruitment of alewives in Lake Ontario, 1978-2000	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The population of alewives Alosa pseudoharengus in Lake Ontario is of great concern to fishery managers because alewives are the principal prey of introduced salmonines and because alewives negatively influence many endemic fishes. We used spring bottom trawl catches of alewives to investigate the roles of stock size, climate, predation, and lake trophic status on recruitment of alewives to age 2 in Lake Ontario during 1978-2000. Climate was indexed from the temperature of water entering a south-shore municipal treatment plant, lake trophic status was indexed by the mean concentration of total phosphorus (TP) in surface water in spring, and predation was indexed by the product of the number of salmonines stocked and relative, first-year survival of Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha. A Ricker-type parent-progeny model suggested that peak production of age-1 alewives could occur over a broad range of spawning stock sizes, and the fit of the model was improved most by the addition of terms for spring water temperature and winter duration. With the addition of the two climate terms, the Ricker model indicated that when water was relatively warm in spring and the winter was relatively short, peak potential production of young was nine times higher than when water temperature and winters were average, and 73 times higher than when water was cold in spring and winters were long. Relative survival from age I to recruitment at age 2 was best described by a multiple linear regression with terms for adult abundance, TP, and predation. Mean recruitment of age-2 fish in the 1978-1998 year-classes predicted by using the two models in sequence was only about 20% greater than the observed mean recruitment. Model estimates fit the measured data exceptionally well for all but the largest four year-classes, which suggests that the models will facilitate improvement in estimates of trophic transfer due to alewives.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				JUL	2004	133	4					855	867		10.1577/T03-016.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T03-016.1													WOS:000222708100004

We attached 26-g, back-mounted satellite-received radio tags (platform transmitting terminals; PTTs) to adult female Northern Pintails (Anas acuta) during (1) midwinter 2000-2003 in the northern Central Valley of California, (2) fall and winter 2002-2003 in the Playa Lakes Region and Gulf Coast of Texas, and (3) early fall 2002-2003 in south-central New Mexico. We tracked tagged birds after release and, in several instances, obtained multiple locations during single migratory flights (flight paths). We used data from 17 PTT-tagged hens along 21 migratory flight paths to estimate groundspeeds during spring (n = 19 flights) and fall (n = 2 flights). Pintails migrated at an average groundspeed of 77 +/-4 (SE) km/hr (range for individual flight paths = 40-122 km/hr), which was within the range of estimates reported in the literature for migratory and local flights of waterfowl (42-116 km/hr); further, groundspeed averaged 53 +/- 6 km/hr in headwinds and 82 +/- 4 km/hr in tailwinds. At a typical, but hypothetical, flight altitude of 1,460 m (850 millibars standard pressure), 17 of the 21 flight paths occurred in tailwinds with an average airspeed of 55 +/- 4 km/hr, and 4 occurred in headwinds with an average airspeed of 71 +/- 4 km/hr. These adjustments in airspeed and groundspeed in response to wind suggest that pintails migrated at airspeeds that on average maximized range and conserved energy, and fell within the range of expectations based on aerodynamic and energetic theory.						casazza, Mike/0000-0002-5636-735X													0043-5643					DEC	2005	117	4					364	374		10.1676/04-114.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1676/04-114.1													WOS:000234104000005
J	Müller, B; Meyer, JS; Gächter, R				Mueller, Beat; Meyer, Joseph S.; Gaechter, Rene			Alkalinity regulation in calcium carbonate-buffered lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Biogenic calcite precipitation is the removal of calcite (CaCO3) from the epilimnion to the sediments of hard-water lakes during summer stratification, caused by increased pH during algal blooms and by nucleation of calcite crystals on surfaces of micro-algae. Although this phenomenon has been studied for decades, details of the underlying mechanisms are still debated. Using results of approximately 70,000 alkalinity measurements from 13 hard-water Swiss lakes (each with approximately 30 yr to 50 yr of monitoring), we demonstrate that (i) calcium carbonate-buffered lakes act as alkalinity sinks during summer stratification but act as CO2 sources during and immediately after spring overturn; (ii) as the alkalinity concentration ([Alk(mix)]) and the total phosphorus concentration ([TPmix]) at spring overturn increase, increasingly more alkalinity is lost from the epilimnion during summer stratification; (iii) [Alk(mix)] is determined by the lake's discharge-weighted average inflow concentration ([Alk(in)]), flushing rate, mean depth and [TPmix]; and (iv) [Alk(in)] depends on the mineralogy and the land use affecting in-soil nitrification of ammonia and subsequent calcite dissolution in the catchment.

J	HAWES, I				HAWES, I			TURBULENCE AND ITS CONSEQUENCES FOR PHYTOPLANKTON DEVELOPMENT IN 2 ICE COVERED ANTARCTIC LAKES	BRITISH ANTARCTIC SURVEY BULLETIN												The development of physical and chemical profiles in 2 Antarctic lakes during late winter and spring are described. In oligotrophic Sombre Lake, gradients of temperature, O2, Cl- and PO43- concentrations evolved during the winter period and persisted until the break-up of ice cover. In response to these gradients, a stratified algal population developed, with maximum biomass near the base of the water column where nutrients were most readily available, despite low radiation levels. In eutrophic Heywood Lake, a different pattern was observed, with vertical mixing apparently breaking down winter gradients and maintaining a near homogenous distribution of all measured parameters from the start of growth in spring. This circulation enhanced the supply of both nutrients and radiation to the suspended phytoplankton and enabled a dense population to develop throughout the 5-m water column. Density currents and/or turbulent inflow of meltwater may be responsible for the observed mixing.																			0007-0262						1983		60					69	81																WOS:A1983RD59400005

This caused the winter concentrations of silicate and nitrate to decrease in the Eastern compartment, while those in the deeper Western compartment, more dependent on North Sea concentrations, hardly changed. The result was a levelling of the former East-West gradients for these nutrients. In East, summer concentrations of nitrate reached limiting levels in the post-barrier period and molar nitrate/ammonium ratios became < 1, indicating that any release of nitrogen must be important to stimulate phytoplankton growth in this area. Silicate summer concentrations in East, on the other hand, were higher in the new situation. In West, differences in summer nutrient concentrations between the old and new situation were smaller than in East, due to the still continuing exchange with the North Sea. Phytoplankton diatoms and flagellates In East during summer, N-depletion and longer residence times caused the phytoplankton to become strongly dependent on nutrient regeneration processes and increased zooplankton grazing. Average diatom biomass declined, but flagellate biomass rose during summer. Spring conditions for phytoplankton development in this area improved due to the increased water transparency, nutrients being present in excess, and this resulted in a higher 'new' production of diatoms than before. In West, summer biomass of diatoms decreased, probably due to increased consumption by mussels under conditions of longer residence times; nutrients were not limiting, due to important benthic mineralization processes and exchange with the North Sea. The previously existing West-East biomass gradients disappeared, or sometimes reversed. Experimental (mesocosm studies) as well as field data, reported in the literature, give evidence for the given explanations.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY 6	1994	283						101	116		10.1007/BF00024624	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00024624													WOS:A1994NQ71100010

Nitrogen form, time and rate of application, and nitrification inhibitor effects on crop production	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE												Nitrogen management options for anhydrous ammonia (NH3) and urea were compared in a barley-wheat-canola-wheat cropping sequence (2007-2010) at Watrous and Lake Lenore, SK. The treatment design included a factorial arrangement of N fertilizer form (NH3 versus urea), nitrification inhibitor application, time of N application (mid-September, mid-to late October, and spring) and four N fertilizer rates (0, 40, 80 and 120 kg ha(-1)). Anhydrous ammonia applications at 40 kg N ha(-1) in 2008 (fall) and in 2010 (all times of application) resulted in wheat yield reductions relative to the same applications for urea. For wheat years, yield was reduced for both fall versus spring N fertilizer applications, when no nitrification inhibitor was applied and the inclusion of nitrification inhibitor maintained wheat yield at similar levels across all times of N fertilizer applications, regardless of form. Protein concentration was approximately 2 g kg(-1) greater with urea compared with NH3 at both sites in 2008 and only at Watrous in 2010. Also, early versus late fall N fertilizer applications consistently increased N concentration of grain only for the 40 and/or 80 kg N ha(-1) rates. Effects of nitrification inhibitor on N concentration were not frequent and appeared to be minimal. Urea had greater agronomic efficiency (AE) than NH3 at the lower N fertilizer rates. The nitrification inhibitor had a positive effect on wheat AE only for early fall N fertilizer applications. It can be concluded that for maximum yields NH3 or urea will be suitable if applied at rates of 80 kg N ha(-1) and greater. If N fertilizer is applied at 40 kg N ha(-1), especially in fall without inhibitor, urea is better. In terms of protein concentration for wheat, urea seemed to better than NH3 and fall was better than spring application.																			0008-4220	1918-1833				MAR	2014	94	2					425	432		10.4141/CJPS2013-205	http://dx.doi.org/10.4141/CJPS2013-205													WOS:000336119600023

Culture-independent techniques were employed including denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and actinobacterial 16S rRNA gene phylogenetic analysis. The three hot springs and the hot spring-derived pond had pH of 6.8 to 7.9 and temperature of 50 to 81C. Actinobacteria were for the first time found to be very diverse in hot springs with temperature up to 81C, indicating that they have an unexpected capability of adapting to hot spring environments. A total of 346 actinobacterial clones were obtained from the three hot springs, and these clones were identified as 31 RFLP types, falling into the Actinomycetales (only limit to the Frankineae suborder), the Rubrobacterales, uncultured Candidatus Microthrix, unclassified Actinobacteria, and uncultured Candidate Division OP10.

Biogeography of Submerged Aquatic Vegetation (SAV) in the Pontchartrain Basin Species Salinity Zonation and 1953-2016 Lake Pontchartrain Trends	SOUTHEASTERN GEOGRAPHER												A biogeographic study of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in the Pontchartrain Basin of southeastern Louisiana was conducted. These plants provide numerous essential ecosystem services. Eighteen species occurred in different salinity zones ranging from freshwater to the saline waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Lake Pontchartrain SAV coverage was reduced by 70 percent from 1953 to 1990 due to increased turbidity from urbanization and shell dredging. A La Nina drought (1998-2001) increased SAV to 80 percent of the 1953 coverage, but declines occurred after the drought and there was extensive damage from Katrina and other hurricanes between 2005 and 2012. Coverage in 2016 is about 10 percent of the 1953 level. In these subtropical waters, some species were abundant during the winter and spring, but declined during the summer. Lower Basin SAV is also changing due to high rates of relative sea level rise and erosion of marsh and barrier islands.																			0038-366X	1549-6929				FAL	2017	57	3			SI		273	293		10.1353/sgo.2017.0025	http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/sgo.2017.0025													WOS:000408532000007

Our results indicate that the Indian monsoon mainly influenced Aweng Co during the Holocene. During the early Holocene, when summer insolation was at a maximum, the monsoonal influence was strong and the climate was warm and wet. Both the summer and winter insolation were relatively weak, and Aweng Co was cool and dry during the middle Holocene (6-3 ka), indicating a weakening of the Indian monsoon. The southward displacement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and relatively low atmospheric methane content may have contributed to the middle Holocene cooling on the WTP. During the late Holocene, with a further increase in winter insolation and decrease in summer insolation, the summer monsoon weakened and the MAAT on the WTP gradually increased. Depleted leaf wax hydrogen isotope ratios during the late Holocene can be attributed to accelerated glacier melting because of the elevated MAAT.

The audiolure consisted of broadcast amplified "solicitation" calls of Northern Saw-whet Owls (Aegolius acadicus) normally associated with courtship activities. From 1971 through 1985, using passive mist netting at Little Suamico, the mean number of owls captured each autumn was 57. Using an audiolure, from 1987 through 1995, the mean annual catch was 636 owls. During 1989, an audiolure was also tested at Finzel Swamp in western Maryland by comparing captures during adjacent 3-hour time blocks. Use of an audiolure significantly increased capture rates over passive mist netting. Audiolures are now being used by all major Northern Saw-whet Owl banding stations in the western Great Lakes area to net 2,000-3,000 owls each autumn. Audiolures have also proven effective for netting saw-whet owls during both the breeding and wintering seasons. Descriptions of the audiolure and basic characteristics of captures at simple autumn migration netting operations are also presented.																			0363-616X						1997	190						533	544																WOS:000077557600074

We evaluated the vertical distribution of Thaum in six subalpine deep lakes, in spring and summer, to ascertain if there was a Thaum vertical gradient common to all the lakes in the region, possibly related to lake mixing and stratification. We examined nine environmental variables potentially correlated with Thaum abundance. Thaum abundance ranged from 0.61 x 10(3) to 236 x 10(3) cells mL(-1), representing between 0.02 and 19 % of total prokaryotic cells, in the six lakes across different seasons. Although their absolute and relative abundance varied along the trophic gradient and with mixing conditions, a general pattern common to all the deep lakes was observed. In summer, the abundance of Thaum significantly increased with depth in all the lakes. Temperature emerged as the main environmental correlate of Thaum abundance in deep subalpine lakes. In spring, at low water temperature their abundance was significantly higher in warmer lakes and lower in colder lakes. Conversely, in summer, the correlation with temperature was inverse and Thaum thrived preferentially in the colder hypolimnion.

J	Kajak, Z; Prus, P				Kajak, Z; Prus, P			Time of Chironomus plumosus (L.) generations in natural conditions of lowland reservoir	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The time of Chironomus plumosus generation in the field conditions (shallow, eutrophic dam reservoir) was estimated to be about 3 weeks in the spring. This estimate has been possible due to simultaneous mass appearance of young larvae (the new generation) and the lack of older larvae at this time. Later in the season usually there was some amount of the youngest larvae, indicating the permanent emergence of imagos and the egg-laying, but without clear peaks of numbers and boundaries between successive generations. This regularity and the relatively low total numbers of larvae during the summer the heavy fish pressure on the benthos, not allowing for the mass appearance of young larvae and the estimate of the generation time. Fish pressure is probably weak in spring, during a spawning period, but then increase in the summer. The generation number could be theoretically as high as 5 during the vegetation season (May-October), assuming about 3 weeks for full larval development, as it was estimated at optimal feeding and oxygen conditions and low fish pressure in the spring. However some limiting factors like: oxygen deficits, the annoyance by fish and bestrewing of larval tubes with the mud transported by the water flow (range 150-500 m(3) s(-1) of the total inflow) increase in the summer. These factors can slow down larval development, resulting in observed lower generation number: 3 to 4 during a year.																			1505-2249						2004	52	2					211	222																WOS:000222010200010

Demographic analysis of the population of V. contectus revealed that two or more generations existed in the field throughout the year. The sex ratio was 1:1. Reproduction took place in the beginning of spring or at the end of autumn, depending on the water level and water temperature in the study area. Growth of newly born individuals mainly took place during spring and early summer. Von Berialanffy's method suggested that V. contectus may live up to five years to reach its maximum possible size (51 mm). Annual secondary production, calculated by Hynes' size frequency method, revealed a mean annual density of three individuals/m(2), a mean standing crop ((B) over bar) of 4.19 g dry body weight/(m(2).year), and an annual production (P) of 13.45 +/- 12.9 g dry body weigh/(m(2).year).

Flood pulse effects on benthic invertebrate assemblages in the hypolacustric interstitial zone of Lake Constance	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												In contrast to rivers, the effects of water level fluctuations on the biota are severely understudied in lakes. Lake Constance has a naturally pulsing hydrograph with average amplitudes of 1.4 m between winter drought and summer flood seasons (annual flood pulse (AFP)). Additionally, heavy rainstorms in summer have the potential to create short-term summer flood pulses (SFP). The flood pulse concept for lakes predicts that littoral organisms should be adapted to the regularly occurring AFP, i.e. taking advantage of benefits such as an influx of food sources and low predator pressure, though these organisms will not possess adaptations for the SFP. To test this hypothesis, we studied the aquatic invertebrate assemblages colonizing the gravel sediments of Lake Constance, the AFP in spring and a dramatic SFP event consisting of a one meter rise of water level in 24 h. Here, we introduce the term 'hypolacustric interstitial' for lakes analog to the hyporheic zone of running water ecosystems. Our results confirm the hypothesis of contrasting effects of a regular AFP and a random SFP indicating that the AFP enhances the productivity and biodiversity of the littoral zone with benthic invertebrates displaying an array of adaptations enabling them to survive. The littoral zones of lakes deliver important ecosystem services by regulating flood effects, producing biomass and supporting biodiversity. To maintain and foster these services, the maintenance or reintroduction of natural water level fluctuations and the conservation of the habitat structures of the hypolacustric interstitial are urgently needed.

High-frequency paleoclimate signals from Foulden Maar, Waipiata Volcanic Field, southern New Zealand: An Early Miocene varved lacustrine diatomite deposit	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												A freshwater diatomite deposit near Dunedin, South Island, New Zealand provides an exceptional archive of mid-latitude, seasonal climate variation during latest Oligocene-early Early Miocene time. The diatomite accumulated in a small similar to 1.5 km diameter maar-floored lake that formed during basaltic volcanism. Except for exposures of basanite dated at 23.2 Ma by 40Ar/39Ar, and remnants of a Paleogene sandstone and conglomerate cover, the diatomite body is surrounded by Otago Schist. Geophysical profiles indicate that the total diatomaceous sediment thickness may exceed 100 m. Two depositional facies are described from 15.5 m of weakly-consolidated fresh diatomite accessible in two pits. A thinly laminated facies, comprising 60% of the section, consists of dark brown and white couplets of average thickness 0.5 mm. Both brown and white laminae are composed essentially of frustules of a single pennate diatom, along with 1-2% of siliceous sponge spicules. Dark laminae also contain abundant 5-7.5 mu m diameter siliceous chrysophycean stomatocysts and organic matter. Decalcified complete skeletons of Galaxias, a southern hemisphere group of freshwater or diadromous fish, are found throughout. Diverse well-preserved leaves, some with attached scale insects, are dominated by Lauraceae. Rate flowers are also present. Trace fossils preserved in the laminated comprise 1-1.5 mm wide pale diatomaceous strings of probable faecal origin, and isolated 20-40 mm diameter sand lenses interpreted as faecal remains of swimming waterfowl. The second diatomite facies group comprises dark brown speckled beds, interpreted as sediment gravity flows. Up to 14 cm thick and interspersed throughout the study section, they incorporate abundant laminated diatomite flecks and leaves, and minor woody plant matter and terrigenous silt. Almost all are capped by 1-8 mm of white diatomite that is interpreted as post-flow fall-out of resuspended diatom frustules. Associated breccia and swirly beds up to 8 cm thick are composed of variably contorted clasts of laminated diatomite in a speckled matrix. Nodules, spheroids, and films of authigenic framboidal pyrite are commonly associated with plant and fish remains. As in modern lakes, white laminae likely formed from diatom blooms when light flux, temperature, or nutrients were optimal during spring-early summer; dark laminae accumulating during autumn-winter months. Laterally continuous pinstripe lamination, absence of bioturbation, and excellent fish and plant preservation indicate that the profundal lake and floor were anoxic. Periodic variations in couplet thickness of similar to 3-10 years compare with Quaternary records of El Nino-Southern Oscillation variability and indicate that the early Early Miocene low altitude New Zealand climate was seasonal and strongly ocean-influenced, as it is today.

Decrease of concentration and colloidal fraction of organic carbon and trace elements in response to the anomalously hot summer 2010 in a humic boreal lake	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The colloidal distribution and size fractionation of organic carbon (OC), major elements and trace elements (TE) were studied in a seasonally stratified, organic-rich boreal lake, Lake Svyatoe, located in the European subarctic zone (NW Russia, Arkhangelsk region). This study took place over the course of 4 years in both winter and summer periods using an in situ dialysis technique (1 kDa, 10 kDa and 50 kDa) and traditional frontal filtration and ultrafiltration (5, 0.22 and 0.025 gm). We observed a systematic difference in dissolved elements and colloidal fractions between summer and winter periods with the highest proportion of organic and organo-ferric colloids (I kDa-0.22 mu m) observed during winter periods. The anomalously hot summer of 2010 in European Russia produced surface water temperatures of approximately 30 degrees C, which were 10 degrees above the usual summer temperatures and brought about crucial changes in element speciation and size fractionation. In August 2010, the concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) decreased by more than 30% compared to normal period, while the relative proportion of organic colloids decreased from 70-80% to only 20-30% over the full depth of the water column. Similarly, the proportion of colloidal Fe decreased from 90-98% in most summers and winters to approximately 60-70% in August 2010. During this hot summer, measurable and significant (>30% compared to other periods) decreases in the colloidal fractions of Ca, Mg, Sr, Ba, Al, Ti, Ni, As, V, Co, Y, all rare earth elements (REEs), Zr, Hf, Th and U were also observed. In addition, dissolved (<0.22 mu m) TE concentrations decreased by a factor of 2 to 6 compared to previously investigated periods. The three processes most likely responsible for such a crucial change in element biogeochemistry with elevated water temperature are 1) massive phytoplankton bloom, 2) enhanced mineralization (respiration) of allochthonous dissolved organic matter by heterotrophic aerobic bacterioplankton and 3) photodegradation of DOM and photo-chemical liberation of organic-bound TE. While the first process may have caused significant decreases in the total dissolved concentration of micronutrients (a factor of 2 to 5 for Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn and Cd and a factor of >100 for Co), the second and third factors could have brought about the decrease of allochthonous DOC concentration as well as the concentration and proportion of organic and organo-mineral colloidal forms of non-essential low-soluble trace elements present in the form of organic colloids (Al, Y, Ti, Zr, Hf, Th, Pb, all REEs). It can be hypothesized that climate warming in high latitudes capable of significantly raising surface water temperatures will produce a decrease in the colloidal fraction of most trace elements and, as a result, an increase in the most labile low molecular weight LMW<1 kDa fraction. 0 2013 Elsevier B.V.

ORNIS FENNICA												Diet composition and prey selection of wintering Great Grey Shrike (Lanius excubitor) were studied at two sites in north-eastern Poland: in the Mazurian Lakeland and at Bialowieza Glade. The feeding habits of shrikes were recorded on the basis of 1582 prey items found in 1220 pellets, collected in years 1998-2003. Live-trapping of small mammals showed that in both habitats, Microtus voles predominated in rodent communities, with higher densities of the Common Vole (M. arvalis) in the Mazurian Lakeland, and the Root Vole W. oeconomus) in Bialowieza. At both sites, the two main shrike prey groups were small mammals and insects, with a lesser contribution of other prey (passerines, lizards and frogs). Voles comprised between 69 and 86% of consumed food biomass, while other small mammals comprised only 5-13% of prey biomass. Shrikes selectively hunted the Common Vole, especially in the habitat with a lower abundance of this species. On the other hand, in the habitat with a higher abundance of Common Voles, shrikes selected smaller individuals from this population, a feature that was not recorded in the habitat where the Root Vole was predominant. Therefore, intra- and inter-specific prey selection appears to be interrelated and dependent on prey abundance. The prey stored (here, prey impaled on thorns and spikes) by shrikes differed from the prey consumed. The Root Vole was not stored but occurred in the shrike diet. Frogs, newts and lizards were more often stored than consumed. Analysis of the proportion of skulls, pelvises and thigh-bones in pellets, suggests that at the end of winter and in early spring when voles numbers decline, shrikes consumed more whole vole bodies compared to the autumn.

We conducted an outdoor experiment to compare the effect of winter warming (heating by 3 degrees C) in combination with presence and absence of Daphnia grazing (D. similis) on phytoplankton standing crops and community structure under eutrophic conditions. When Daphnia were absent, warming was associated with significant increases in phytoplankton biomass and cyanobacterial dominance. In contrast, when Daphnia were present, warming effects on phytoplankton dynamics were offset by warming-enhanced grazing, resulting in no significant change in biomass or taxonomic dominance. These results emphasize that large-bodied zooplankton like Daphnia spp. may play an important role in modulating the interactions between climate warming and phytoplankton dynamics in nutrient rich lake ecosystems.

Phytoplankton Composition in Relation to Its Nutritional Value in Burullus Lagoon, Egypt	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												BURULLUS Lagoon, also known as Lake Burullus, is a brackish water lake in the Nile Delta in Egypt. In this study, changes in environmental conditions welt assumed to affect phytoplankton species composition and their biochemical structure. The biochemical content of phytoplankton in Lake Burullus was preliminarily explored. Winter cruises were compared with summer cruises from 12 sites representing the main eastern, middle, and western lake basins in 2018. Results revealed that phytoplankton exhibited seasonal variations. In particular, it attained the lowest value in winter (72300 units/L) and the highest value in summer (88700 units/L). This observation was consistent with the high total protein content (2692.5mg/L) in summer. The first major class was Chlorophyceae (37.9%) followed by Bacillariophyceae (29.31%) and Cyanophyceae (20.7%). By comparison, Euglenophyceae and Dinophyceae were rare classes constituting 8.63% and 3.4%, respectively. The maximum total biochemical contents were found in the middle of the lake in winter (870.5, 57.6, and 6.1 mg/L of proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids, respectively), indicating the increase in the total density of phytoplankton, especially Chlorophyceae (13700 units/L), in the central basin (29200 units/L). The optimum total biochemical structure was obtained in the western basin in summer (1909.1, 55.4, and 6.5mg/L of proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids, respectively), suggesting that the phytoplankton density increased to 56000 units/L. Q index showed that the middle and western basins were in mesotrophic to eutrophic states. These findings demonstrated that excessive nutrient loads of drainage water into Burullus Lagoon significantly affected the phytoplankton biodiversity Therefore, highly efficient management strategies must be developed and implemented in Burullus Lagoon.

Effect of imbalanced nutrients and immigration on Prymnesium parvum community dominance and toxicity:: results from in-lake microcosm experiments	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Prymnesium parvum, a haptophyte species, forms harmful blooms, including those that have caused severe fish kills in Texas, USA, over the past 6 yr. We studied P. parvum dynamics using in situ microcosm experiments at Lake Possum Kingdom, Texas, during 3 seasons (fall 2004, winter and spring 2005). Experimental treatments included full and partial nutrient enrichment (encompassing nitrogen [N] and phosphorus [P] deficient treatments), P. parvum immigration and combinations of these factors. In the control and N and P deficient treatments, P, parvum populations dominated the community, but only in the N deficient treatments did P. parvum experience a significant growth in the population. In contrast, when nutrients were not limiting, P. parvum tended to lose its competitive edge to other taxa such as chlorophytes, euglenophytes and diatoms, which then dominated the community. Population growth of P. parvum was also stimulated through immigration, but only during the winter experiment, a period of the year when bloom initiation is common. This finding suggests that movement into the water column may be an important process leading to P. parvum bloom initiation. Toxicity of P. parvum to fish was also affected by the nutrient changes: during conditions of no nutrient addition P. parvum was most toxic; intermediate toxicity was observed under N and P deficient conditions, and full nutrient enrichments resulted in nearly non-toxic conditions.					; Brooks, Bryan/B-2612-2010; Roelke, Daniel/B-5766-2008	Kiesling, Richard/0000-0002-3017-1826; Roelke, Daniel/0000-0002-3166-3793; Brooks, Bryan/0000-0002-6277-9852; Pinckney, James/0000-0002-6056-6511; 													0948-3055						2008	52	1					33	44		10.3354/ame01199	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame01199													WOS:000258334700004

The phytoplankton assemblage in the lake during summer, winter and the end of winter was dominated by Cryptomonas sp. and Cyclotella sp., with an average relative abundance of > 95%, based on phytoplankton biomass estimations. Isolation in summer resulted in the exclusion of Cyclotella sp., a decline of Cryptomonas sp. and an increase in M. aeruginosa and Anabaena sp. In winter, when M. aeruginosa was absent in the inoculum, isolation resulted in an increase in Cryptomonas sp. biomass and a decline of Cyclotella sp. At the end of winter Cryptomonas sp. initially increased but later declined following the increase in chlorophytes. The non-equilibrium state in Lake Chivero caused pioneer species to dominate rather than M. aeruginosa.																			0378-4738	1816-7950				JAN	2014	40	1					157	164		10.4314/wsa.v40i1.19	http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/wsa.v40i1.19													WOS:000336089900018
J	McGowan, S; Leavitt, PR; Hall, RI				McGowan, S; Leavitt, PR; Hall, RI			A whole-lake experiment to determine the effects of winter droughts on shallow lakes	ECOSYSTEMS												Lake-level fluctuations are common in the North American Great Plains region, where large-scale climate systems (El Nino, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) and periodic droughts cause substantial hydrologic variability in both summer and winter. To date, most such research has focused on the effects of summer droughts on prairie lake ecosystems; therefore, we studied the impact of water-level decline during winter on ecosystem structure and function. Specifically, we hypothesized that lower lake levels during winter would increase anoxia, freezing and scouring of benthos, fish kills, herbivory by zooplankton, and nutrient release from sediments. In addition, we tested the hypothesis that winter droughts may initiate a switch between alternative stable states (turbid, clear). Physical, chemical, and biological variables were monitored from 1996 to 2001 in both Wascana Lake, which experienced a 50% decline in lake level, and Buffalo Pound Lake, where water levels were constant. A combination of before-after-control-impact (BACI) and multivariate analyses showed that drawdown resulted in elevated NH4-N concentrations following reinundation; otherwise there were few detectable effects on lake water chemistry (PO4-P, NO3-N, total dissolved nitrogen, total dissolved carbon) or pelagic food web structure (phytoplankton, zooplankton), and the experimental lake remained in a macrophyte-rich state. There was, however, a 2.5-fold increase in macrophyte abundance and a shift from a community dominated by Ceratophyllum demersum before drawdown to one composed of Potamogeton pectinatus after manipulation. Overall, the lack of substantial dewatering effects suggests that lakes of the northern Great Plains may be resilient to severe winter conditions, possibly because of the recruitment of fish from regional metapopulations during summer. Further, our results indicate that lower water levels during winter likely promote the buffer mechanisms that reinforce a macrophyte-rich, clear-water state in shallow prairie lakes.					; Leavitt, Peter/A-1048-2013; Hall, Roland/K-3165-2019; McGowan, Suzanne/GZB-0118-2022	Hall, Roland/0000-0002-0314-6449; Leavitt, Peter/0000-0001-9805-9307; 													1432-9840	1435-0629				SEP	2005	8	6					694	708		10.1007/s10021-003-0152-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-003-0152-x													WOS:000232405300008

A population of D. alaskanus (Coleoptera: Dytiscidae) studied in a central Alberta lake was parasitized by members of the genus Eylais (Acari: Hydrachnellae).

Afferent blood flow in the costa and subcosta and the numerous blood sinuses in this region and abundant food sources. The smallest (= youngest) larvae were taken on the 1st beetles caught in early spring, indicating that some mite larvae overwinter on the host. Mites grow rapidly, reach maximum size in late June and July, and then enter the nonparasitic phase of the life cycle. Rates of parasitism (proportion of beetles with parasites) was highest in early spring, declined throughout the summer, and rose again in the fall. In this way. The parasitic phase of the mite''s life cycle occurs at the same time as the peak in the population of adult beetles. There was constant recruitment throughout the year into the population of larval mites indicating asynchronous cohorts or more than 1 mite species.																			0008-4301	1480-3283					1985	63	2					267	271		10.1139/z85-041	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z85-041													WOS:A1985AES2700009

To better understand how hypoxia influences the interaction and spatial overlap between planktivorous fishes (e.g., bay anchovy Anchoa mitchilli) and their mesozooplankton prey (e.g., Acartia tonsa), we contrasted the spatial distributions of these food-web components along the Bay's entire north-south axis during spring, summer, and fall 1996,1997, and 2000, and along several cross-Bay transects during summer of these same years. Pelagic fish biomass was estimated with a surface-towed split-beam echosounder. Dissolved oxygen and mesozooplankton biomass were simultaneously quantified using a towed, undulating ScanFish sensor package. Results indicate that hypoxia can disrupt the diel vertical migration behavior of planktivorous fishes in Chesapeake Bay during summer by reducing access to bottom waters and forcing fish to reside in well-oxygenated surface or nearshore waters. In turn, reduced access to bottom waters reduces spatial overlap with mesozooplankton prey, which appear to use the hypoxic zone as a refuge. Ultimately, we discuss how these hypoxia-driven changes in behavior and spatial overlap may influence food web interactions and bay anchovy recruitment in Chesapeake Bay. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J	Felzer, BA; Thompson, SL				Felzer, BA; Thompson, SL			Evaluation of a regional climate model for paleoclimate applications in the Arctic	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The Paleoclimates From Arctic Lakes and Estuaries (PALE) project has been investigating methods of doing high-resolution model-data comparisons for the Arctic. As a prelude to a paleosimulation of the North Atlantic region, a modem simulation using observationally driven reanalysis data has been completed. The ARCSyM mesoscale model has been configured for the North Atlantic region, including Labrador, Ungava, Baffin Island, Ellesmere Island, Greenland, and Iceland, with a resolution of 70 kin. This high resolution is necessary to predict sub-GCM grid-scale climate processes, such as precipitation and storm patterns that depend upon the detailed topography and coastlines of the region. Experiments were performed for the time period of September 1987 to March 1990, driven by observational analyses. The model accurately captures the major summer and winter circulation systems in the North Atlantic region. Comparisons with meteorological station data show high correlations for winter and summer surface temperatures, with a cold bias in winter and a warm bias in summer. Winter precipitation is well simulated by the model because it is driven by the large-scale circulation. The orographically driven summer precipitation is overrepresented and does not correlate well with observations, although the overall pattern is correct. These results show that the model is capable of capturing the correct temperature and precipitation patterns, although grid-to-grid comparisons are not possible. The mesoscale model is therefore useful for regionally based data-model comparisons, but should not be used to compare individual cores with specific model grids.					; Felzer, Benjamin/AAB-3456-2021	Felzer, Benjamin/0000-0002-3990-3739; 													2169-897X	2169-8996				NOV 16	2001	106	D21					27407	27424		10.1029/2000JD000217	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2000JD000217													WOS:000172312300013

Optical imagery is able to monitor supraglacial lakes during the summer season. Here we developed an alternative method using polarimetric SAR from Sentinel-1 during 2017-2020 to distinguish between liquid water and other surface types at the margin of the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream. This allows the supraglacial hydrology to be monitored during the winter months too. We found that the majority of supraglacial lakes persist over winter. When comparing our results to optical data, we found significantly more water. Even during summer, many lakes are partly or fully covered by a lid of ice and snow. We used our classification results to automatically map the outlines of supraglacial lakes, create time series of water area for each lake, and hence detect drainage events. We even found several winter time drainages, which might have an important effect on ice flow. Our method has problems during the peak of the melt season, but for the rest of the year it provides crucial information for better understanding the component of supraglacial hydrology in the glaciological system.

J	Stiller, M; Nissenbaum, A				Stiller, M; Nissenbaum, A			A stable carbon isotope study of dissolved inorganic carbon in hardwater Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee)	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												Nine depth profiles of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and its carbon-13 content [expressed as delta(13)C(DIC)] were measured during 1974/75 in hardwater Lake Kinneret. DIC decreased (and pH increased) in the upper layers of the stratified lake with a concomitant delta(13)C increase. These features were due to enhanced algal photosynthesis, which prevailed during spring and early summer and preferentially utilized dissolved (CO2)-C-12. During the same period, the DIC in the deep waters of the lake gradually increased and delta(13)C gradually decreased, due to in situ decomposition/oxidation of isotopically light organic debris which sank down from the upper layers. In autumn, the deepening of the thermocline added to the epilimnion these richer in DIC but isotopically lighter, hypolimnetic waters. The DIC of the deep layers continued to increase during autumn, but its delta(13)C(DIC) did not, because, in addition to DIC produced by oxidation of organic matter depleted in C-13, dissolution of carbonate particles enriched in C-13 was also taking place. During winter the DIC and delta(13)C(DIC) profiles reflected the mixing of the entire water column. The difference Delta between delta(13)C(DIC) and delta(13)C(plankton) was inversely correlated with the rate of primary productivity (r(2) = 0.85). The fractionation between delta(13)C (CO2)(aq) and delta(13)C(plankton) was correlated to the availability of (CO2)(aq) during most of the yearly cycle, except during the exponential growth period of the algal bloom. During the destratification and the turnover periods, for about 5-6 months, Lake Kinneret emitted CO2 to the atmosphere. The evasion rate of CO2 from the mixed-water column was about 6 x 10(-2) mole CO2 m(-2) day(-1) and may have produced measurable enrichment of delta(13)C(DIC) in the lake water. This situation was reversed during the rest of the year, when enhanced algal productivity prevailed, and the lake absorbed CO2 at a rate of about 0.7 x 10(-2) mole CO2 m(-2) day(-1). This invasion rate of CO2 was much smaller than evasion and did not affect delta(13)C(DIC). On an annual basis, Lake Kinneret is a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere.																			0038-2353					APR	1999	95	4					166	170																WOS:000081269900007

Carbon dynamics in a Boreal land-stream-lake continuum during the spring freshet of two hydrologically contrasting years	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												We studied in 2013 and 2014 the spring carbon dynamics in a Boreal landscape consisting of a lake and 15 inflowing streams and an outlet. The first year had weather and a hydrological regime typical of past years with a distinct spring freshet connected with the thaw of the average snowpack. The latter year had higher air temperatures which did not permit snow accumulation, despite similar winter precipitation. As such, there was hardly any spring freshet in 2014, and stream discharge peaked in January, i.e., the conditions resembled those predicted in the future climate. Despite the hydrological differences between the years, there were only small interannual differences in the stream CO2 and DOC concentrations. The relationship between the concentrations and discharge was stronger in the typical year. CO2 concentrations in medium-sized streams correlated negatively with the discharge, indicating dilution effect of melting snowpacks, while in large-sized streams the correlation was positive, suggesting stronger groundwater influence. The DOC pathway to these streams was through the subsurface soil layers, not the groundwater. The total amount of carbon transported into the lake was ca. 1.5-fold higher in the typical year than in the year with warm winter. In 2013, most of the lateral inputs took place during spring freshet. In 2014, the majority of inputs occurred earlier, during the winter months. The lateral CO2 signal was visible in the lake at 1.5 m depth. DOC dominated the carbon transport, and in both years, 12% of the input C was in inorganic form.

H. marcidus had univoltine cycle in all lakes surveyed and seasonal changes of density showed an early summer and an autumn peak interrupted by a mid-summer decline of larval abundance. Our results indicate that phenology of H. marcidus is sensitive to thermal regime and local differences in lake water temperature can lead to differences of the life history within the same population.

Time-series remotely sensed imagery provides a promising data resource for crop mapping by characterizing growth cycles over time. Therefore, this study explores summer maize mapping with composited time-series Sentinel-1A imagery of a typical crop field in China. First, time-series backscattering coefficients of major land-cover types (i.e. summer maize, peanut, forest, settlements, and water) are extracted from multi-temporal Sentinel-1A imagery. Second, according to the growth cycles of summer maize and peanut, the multi-temporal Sentinel-1A images are composited to enhance the characteristics of the summer maize growth cycle, while also eliminating redundant information and differences in phenology. Third, the decision-tree method is used to perform pixel-level classification; samples with an area of 1 km(2) are collected as validation datasets. The results show that Sentinel-1A VH-polarized images are more sensitive to the summer maize growth cycle than VV-polarized images. The summer maize cropping areas are estimated with an overall accuracy of 96.55% and a kappa coefficient of 0.93. The results suggest that multi-temporal Sentinel-1A imagery is capable of characterizing the growth cycle of summer maize, and provides a promising solution for accurate summer maize mapping, irrespective of weather conditions.					chen, cheng/JVZ-5931-2024; niu, zheng/M-9923-2017; Wang, Li/P-9811-2018; Tian, Haifeng/HLQ-5227-2023	Wang, Li/0000-0002-2929-4255; tian, haifeng/0000-0003-4567-2313; 													0255-660X	0974-3006				NOV	2021	49	11					2863	2874		10.1007/s12524-021-01428-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-021-01428-0		SEP 2021											WOS:000698303400001
J	Voigt, R; Grüger, E; Baier, J; Meischner, D				Voigt, Ricarda; Grueger, Eberhard; Baier, Janina; Meischner, Dieter			Seasonal variability of Holocene climate:: a palaeolimnological study on varved sediments in Lake Jues (Harz Mountains, Germany)	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Studies combining sedimentological and biological evidence to reconstruct Holocene climate beyond the major changes, and especially seasonality, are rare in Europe, and are nearly completely absent in Germany. The present study tries to reconstruct changes of seasonality from evidence of annual algal successions within the framework of well-established pollen zonation and C-14-AMS dates from terrestrial plants. Laminated Holocene sediments in Lake Jues (10 degrees 20.7' E, 51 degrees 39.3' N, 241 m a.s.l.), located at the SW margin of the Harz Mountains, central Germany, were studied for sediment characteristics, pollen, diatoms and coccal green algae. An age model is based on 21 calibrated AMS radiocarbon dates from terrestrial plants. The sedimentary record covers the entire Holocene period. Trophic status and circulation/stagnation patterns of the lake were inferred from algal assemblages, the subannual structure of varves and the physico-chemical properties of the sediment. During the Holocene, mixing conditions alternated between di-, oligo- and meromictic depending on length and variability of spring and fall periods, and the stability of winter and summer weather. The trophic state was controlled by nutrient input, circulation patterns and the temperature-dependent rates of organic production and mineralization. Climate shifts, mainly in phase with those recorded from other European regions, are inferred from changing limnological conditions and terrestrial vegetation. Significant changes occurred at 11,600 cal. yr. BP (Preboreal warming), between 10,600 and 10,100 cal. yr. BP (Boreal cooling), and between 8,400 and 4,550 cal. yr. BP (warm and dry interval of the Atlantic). Since 4,550 cal. yr. BP the climate became gradually cooler, wetter and more oceanic. This trend was interrupted by warmer and dryer phases between 3,440 and 2,850 cal. yr. BP and, likely, between 2,500 and 2,250 cal. yr. BP.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				NOV	2008	40	4					1021	1052		10.1007/s10933-008-9213-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-008-9213-7													WOS:000259481300003
J	Theiling, CH; Tucker, JK				Theiling, CH; Tucker, JK			Nektonic invertebrate dynamics and prolonged summer flooding on the lower Illinois River	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Prolonged extreme flooding during mid-summer 1993 provided an opportunity to investigate nektonic invertebrate dynamics in lower Illinois River floodplains and backwater lakes. We used plankton nets to sample flooded grass shorelines, flooded forests, and open water habitats during rising and falling stages of the flood. Transects oriented perpendicular to shore were sampled to investigate community composition along the floodplain gradient extending riverward. Invertebrate densities differed between samples collected on the rising stage of the flood (mean = 11,584 individuals m(-3)) and on the falling stage of the flood (mean = 78 individuals m(-3)). Density estimates from samples collected at the shoreline of the rising flood waters exceeded estimates from open water and the falling flood shoreline by two orders of magnitude. Corixids were the most abundant taxa found (78%) at flooded shorelines. Densities were highest in inundated grass habitats at the rising edge of the flood. Flooded trees had the next highest densities, followed by floating macrophytes and open water. Our findings exemplify the flood pulse hypothesis in that productivity, as measured by invertebrate density, increased dramatically on the rising flood but then fell just as dramatically on the falling flood.																			0270-5060					DEC	1999	14	4					499	510		10.1080/02705060.1999.9663708	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1999.9663708													WOS:000084518500011
J	BERGER, C; DEVAATE, AB				BERGER, C; DEVAATE, AB			LIMNOLOGICAL STUDIES ON THE EUTROPHICATION OF LAKE WOLDERWIJD A SHALLOW HYPERTROPHIC OSCILLATORIA DOMINATED LAKE IN THE NETHERLANDS	SCHWEIZERISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR HYDROLOGIE-SWISS JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Lake Wolderwijd (area 2700 ha, mean depth 1.60 m, residence time 0.9 yr), a man-made lake from 1967, was soon dominated by the blue-green alga O. agardhii, which formed a persistant bloom. Relatively small proportions of other blue-green algae species occurred in spring. The environment in the lake is continuously controlled and governed by the alga, resulting in a perfect homogeneity in the whole lake with respect to the biomass. The biomass in summer (30-40 mg/l dry wt) is only 30-50% greater than in winter. In winter 10-30% of the time is spend by the alga below 1% subsurface light intensity and in summer 20-60%. The specific oligophote capacities of O. agardhii combined with external factors as available nutrients, depth and residence time of Lake Wolderwijd provide a high degree of habitat control. Cause and effect of the observed phenomena are integrated in each other. The explanation of the ecological niche of the alga is therefore difficult. Comparison of Lake Wolderwijd with other less extreme Oscillatoria lakes in the Netherlands and the research done by others on continuous cultures are helpful means to approach the ecological niche of the alga. The possibility of creating its own optimal light climate at each temperature and incidence radiation, among others due to the nonconsumption by zooplankton, is a key factor for the persistant bloom of O. agardhii in Lake Wolderwijd. A mean depth of 0.7-2.5 m is considered as a condition sine qua non for this persistant bloom.																			0036-7842						1983	45	2					458	479		10.1007/BF02538134	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02538134													WOS:A1983SM75500010

Three CO2 levels (270 ppm, 380 ppm and 750 ppm) were implemented to simulate pre-industrial, present and predicted CO2 concentrations in the year 2100, respectively. The results showed that picophytoplankton accounted for a major proportion of phytoplankton in East Lake Taihu, and their chlorophyll-a content contributed a maximum of 79 % to the total chlorophyll-a concentration in winter. Phycocyanin-rich picocyanobacteria (PC-cells) dominated the picophytoplankton community in terms of cell number in East Lake Taihu in all seasons except winter, when only photosynthetic picoeukaryotes (PPEs) were observed. PC-cells were not sensitive to changes in CO2 within the tested CO2 range in this study. In contrast, CO2 elevation significantly increased the abundances of PPEs in spring but decreased their abundances in winter. High-throughout sequencing of PPEs was performed for sorted PPE samples in spring and winter from the three CO2 treatments. The results showed that Chlamydomonas and Cryptophyceae were not favored by the high CO2 treatment, whereas Chrysophyceae benefitted from an increase in CO2 level.

Higher investment in defence and enhanced colonization potential may both correlate with decreased competitive ability in plants. Herbivory may thus promote coexistence of plant species exhibiting divergent life history strategies. How different seasonally tied herbivore assemblages simultaneously affect plant community composition and diversity is, however, largely unknown. Two contrasting types of herbivory can be distinguished in the aquatic vegetation of the shallow lake Lauwersmeer. In summer, predominantly above-ground tissues are eaten, whereas in winter, waterfowl forage on below-ground plant propagules. In a 4-year exclosure study we experimentally separated above-ground herbivory by waterfowl and large fish in summer from below-ground herbivory by Bewick's swans in winter. We measured the individual and combined effects of both herbivory periods on the composition of the three-species aquatic plant community. Herbivory effect sizes varied considerably from year to year. In 2 years herbivore exclusion in summer reinforced dominance of Potamogeton pectinatus with a concomitant decrease in Potamogeton pusillus, whereas no strong, unequivocal effect was observed in the other 2 years. Winter exclusion, on the other hand, had a negative effect on Zannichellia palustris, but the effect size differed considerably between years. We suggest that the colonization ability of Z. palustris may have enabled this species to be more abundant after reduction of P. pectinatus tuber densities by swans. Evenness decreased due to herbivore exclusion in summer. We conclude that seasonally tied above- and below-ground herbivory may each stimulate different components of a macrophyte community as they each favoured a different subordinate plant species.

J	Arai, H; Fukushima, T				Arai, Hiroyuki; Fukushima, Takehiko			Impacts of long-term increase in silicon concentration on diatom blooms in Lake Kasumigaura, Japan	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												In the eutrophic Lake Kasumigaura in Japan, a trend of dissolved Si (DSi) concentration was detected over the last three decades, probably caused by the DSi release enhanced by an increase in sediment resuspension for the same period (Arai et al., Limnol., 13, 81-95, 2012). The present study described the long-term trends of the magnitude and seasonality of diatom blooms in the lake during 1981-2010 using the database and assessed the influencing factors for the trends by the numerical simulation of DSi and diatoms. The box model was developed based on the lake budgets (inflow, outflow, release and sedimentation) and the simple diatom growth model depending on DSi, temperature and light condition. As results, database analysis detected a long-term trend of increasing diatom abundance and a shift of blooming season from spring and autumn to the winter-spring period. Si could be regarded as a main nutrient factor limiting diatom growth by analyzing N:P:Si ratios. Our model simulation relatively well-reproduced the increasing trend and the shift of seasonality of DSi and diatoms, even though peaks of diatom blooms were underestimated in some years. Among input variables, the concentration of resuspended sediments radically increased. The model simulation with the input variables or parameters changed suggested as follows: (1) the recent DSi release from resuspended sediments enhanced diatom abundance and (2) the degradation of light condition caused by resuspension affected the shift of blooming season. These findings implicate the significance of the interactions between sediments and water to phytoplankton blooms.					; Fukushima, Takehiko/S-9801-2019	Fukushima, Takehiko/0000-0003-2494-309X; Arai, Hiroyuki/0000-0002-1427-063X													0003-4088	2100-000X					2014	50	4					335	346		10.1051/limn/2014027	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2014027													WOS:000346605600008
J	Markensten, H; Pierson, DC				Markensten, Hampus; Pierson, Donald C.			Weather driven influences on phytoplankton succession in a shallow lake during contrasting years: Application of PROTBAS	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												A dynamic model which simulates variations in the biomass of several phytoplankton functional groups (PROTECH) has been reconstructed into the PROTBAS (PROTech Based Algal Simulations) model, and was tested in a large (61 km(2)), shallow (mean depth 3.4 m) windexposed lake basin at the western end of Lake Malaren, Sweden. A subroutine was added to the model to estimate the variation in light extinction resulting from wind action and river discharge. Also the rate of regeneration of nitrogen and silica was modified. The model captured the overall magnitude and succession of phytoplankton during two contrasting years: a warm and calm calibration year, and a cold windy validation year. The model shows good behavior in the northern temperate climate, which includes ice cover during winter. However, there were discrepancies between measured and modeled spring growth and autumn decline of the phytoplankton. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

The variations in these proxy records are interpreted in terms of the past variation in the Asian monsoons. The two consistent and complementary records suggest that the East Asian monsoon system has fluctuated significantly from a strengthened winter monsoon during the last glaciation (25,000-12,000 yr BP) through a moderate to weak winter and summer monsoons during the deglaciation (12,000-10,000 yr BP) to an enhanced summer monsoon in the Holocene, Strengthening of the winter monsoon during the glacial is deduced from decreases in winter SST and increases in productivity indicators, such the abundances of alkenones and total organic carbon in the SCS. A stronger summer monsoon during the Holocene is inferred from the increases in floral productivity, the sedimentation rate of peat, the deposition of storm-related clay layers in the lake sediment, and the higher abundance of thermophyte Castanopsis. The 25 kyr paleomonsoon history registered in the SCS core and the Taiwan take sediments is in agreement with the climatic records of the Chinese Loess plateau.					; Chen, Min-Te/AAD-5990-2021	Wang, Chung-Ho/0000-0003-2014-6747; 													0012-821X					JAN	1997	146	1-2					59	72		10.1016/S0012-821X(96)00203-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0012-821X(96)00203-8													WOS:A1997WH33700007

The observed annual rainfall in inland Cambodia ranges from 1087 to 1528 mm on station-average. Approximately 5-20% of the annual rainfall occurs during the pre-monsoon season, 50-78% during the summer monsoon season, and 12-36% during the post-monsoon season. During the pre-monsoon season, rainfall is dominant on the coast and over the Cardamom Mountains, with a maximum in the afternoon. The rainfall amount is smaller around the Tonle Sap Lake. During the summer monsoon season, rainfall is larger in the northern region and smaller in the western region in inland Cambodia, in both amount and proportion to annual rainfall. The rainfall amount on the coast is distinctively large. The diurnal rainfall maximum occurs in the early afternoon in the Cardamom Mountains, in the afternoon on the plain at the southwestern side of the Tonle Sap Lake, in the evening on the wide area of the northeastern side of the lake, and in the early morning on the coast The clear regional characteristics in the diurnal rainfall pattern suggest significant effects of local features, even during the Asian summer monsoon season. During the post-monsoon season, rainfall is larger on the southwestern side of the Tonle Sap Lake with dominant nocturnal rainfall. These diurnal patterns are, however, not clear on some days, and analysis of the synoptic-scale atmospheric condition suggests the effect of the large-scale low-pressure system and disturbances on the appearance of the clear diurnal rainfall pattern. The effect of land-lake and mountain-valley circulations on forming the diurnal rainfall pattern is also implied from ground-observed meteorological data, although further numerical studies are required to examine the detailed mechanisms. The study of local effects on rainfall with consideration of the land-surface dynamics may aid flood and drought management in Cambodia by facilitating a greater understanding of its rainfall pattern.

Building upon the satellite-ground synchronization experiment that involves the in situ aquatic ecological monitoring conducted in Nansi Lake, which is the largest storage lake situated along the eastern route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project, we developed a phytoplankton density retrieval model utilizing the random forest (RF) method and Landsat-8 OLI data. On this basis, we mapped the seasonal fluctuations and spatial disparities in the phytoplankton densities from 2013 to 2023. Subsequently, we conducted a detailed analysis of the driving factors and considered both the natural and anthropogenic aspects. The results indicate that (1) the RF model, when utilizing three band combinations, yielded favorable results with R2, RMSE and MAE values of 0.67, 1.31 x 106 cells/L and 1.18 x 106 cells/L, respectively. (2) The phytoplankton densities exhibited both seasonal and spatial variations, with higher concentrations in summer and autumn than in spring and winter. Significantly, the northwestern region of Zhaoyang Lake and the southeastern region of Weishan Lake had substantially greater phytoplankton densities than did the other areas. Furthermore, overarching upward trends were observed from 2013 to 2023, reflecting an annual rate of increase of 3.32%. (3) An analysis of the causal factors indicated that temperatures and gross agricultural production levels are the primary drivers influencing the seasonal variations and distributions of phytoplankton densities. In the future, we will delve into the potential of deep learning and utilize various satellite sensors to explore the intricacies of phytoplankton monitoring, as well as the complex mechanisms that influence aquatic ecological health.

J	Werner, SM; Nordheim, E; Raffa, KF				Werner, SM; Nordheim, E; Raffa, KF			Impacts of the introduced basswood thrips (Thrips calcaratus Uzel) on forest health in the Great Lakes region	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Insect, disease, tree condition, weather, and soil data were sampled from 22 northern hardwood forest sites containing American basswood, Tilia americana L., in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota from 1998 to 2000. Basswood dieback increased by 10% during this period. Insect abundance on basswood foliage was dominated by Thysanoptera, of which the introduced basswood thrips, Thrips calcaratus Uzel, accounted for over 95% of total catch. There was little evidence of pathogens or abiotic stress factors having pronounced effects on basswood. Weak associations between basswood dieback and T calcaratus abundance suggest that it is an important component of basswood decline in the Great Lakes region, but that other factors are also involved. The native predator, Leptothrips mali (Fitch), is highly synchronized with the native basswood thrips, Neohydatothrips tiliae (Hood), with both species emerging in late spring and persisting into August. The two introduced herbivores, T calcaratus and Taeniothrips inconsequens (Uzel), peak in late spring before becoming almost totally absent by August. Numbers of adult T calcaratus in early May can be used to predict subsequent numbers of larvae. T calcaratus abundance was more variable among sites than among trees within a site. This indicates that future investigations will benefit most by increasing the number of study sites rather than more intensively surveying fewer sites. A significant year-by-site interaction was observed for both adult and larval T calcaratus. Adult populations were inversely associated with organic matter, calcium, nitrate, ammonium, soil pH, summer precipitation, April minimum temperature, April precipitation, and basswood live crown ratio. They were directly associated with low winter temperature and basswood crown light exposure. Larval T calcaratus were inversely associated with soil potassium, precipitation, basswood live crown ratio, and basswood crown position. They were directly associated with low winter and spring temperatures, basswood light exposure, and winter snowfall. Interpretation of these relationships must be tempered, however, by the presence of autocorrelations among many of these variables. This study shows that basswood is declining throughout the Great Lakes region, and T calcaratus, along with other contributing factors, are related to this phenomenon, (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The Results of Studying Diapausing Eggs (Cysts) of Brine Shrimp (Artemia) on the Bottom of Hypersaline Lakes of Altai Krai	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												The results of 2020 studies of bottom cysts of brine shrimp Artemia in Lake Kuchukskoe and Lake Bolshoe Yarovoe in Altai krai (Russia) are presented. Artemia cysts were observed year round at the bottom of both lakes. The number of cysts depended on the type of bottom sediment. The biomass of bottom cysts in Lake Kuchukskoe was 154.2 t in spring, of which available and visually intact cysts constituted from 11.8 to 25.2 t. Bottom cysts of Artemia were not available for 27% of the lake area in Lake Kuchukskoe due to the high salinity of the water and salt precipitation. The viability of cysts from shallow bottom areas was 8.9% in spring. In Lake Kuchukskoe, cysts from accumulations on the coast, washed away by the runoff of melt water, played the main role in the formation of first generation of Artemia in spring. The deep water of Lake Bolshoe Yarovoe predetermined the peculiarities of the temperature regime in spring, which prevented brine shrimp cysts from ascending from the bottom if the depth exceeded 7.0 m. Significant silt deposits at the bottom of the lake were an aggressive environment for cysts, as was followed by the presence of different groups of cyst quality: visually intact, with defective chorion, gray or black. The biomass of bottom cysts in Lake Bolshoe Yarovoe was 38 934 t in autumn 2020, which exceeded the reproductive capacity of the Artemia population per year. This testified to the long-term period of accumulations of cysts at the bottom and their partly participation in the formation of the Artemia first generation in spring. In spring, the maximum hatching rate of nauplii from bottom cysts was 16% from depths exceeding 9.0 m and 26%, from a depth of 8.0 m. The viability of bottom cysts from Lake Bolshoe Yarovoe does not exceed 15% at the average; unhatched floating cysts settle back to the bottom in summer.																			1995-0829	1995-0837				OCT	2023	16	5			SI		899	911		10.1134/S1995082923050097	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1995082923050097													WOS:001091893300012
J	Hodgson, S; Quinn, TP				Hodgson, S; Quinn, TP			The timing of adult sockeye salmon migration into fresh water: adaptations by populations to prevailing thermal regimes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Anadromous fishes migrate to sea, apparently to take advantage of growing conditions, and return to fresh water to spawn. Despite favorable growing conditions at sea in summer, some populations leave the ocean in spring, many months prior to spawning. We hypothesized that this premature migration is a consequence of the fish having to avoid stressful summer temperatures in order to access certain suitable areas for spawning in the fall. We tested this idea in sockeye salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka, by compiling data on the timing of migration and spawning and the freshwater temperature regime along the migration route in populations throughout the species' North American range. The timing of migration varied among populations and was primarily related to temperature regime during migration and the timing of spawning. When temperatures were moderate (<19degreesC), sockeye salmon tended to migrate to the vicinity of the spawning grounds about 1 month prior to spawning, regardless of the length of the freshwater migration. However, populations on whose migration route the average temperature exceeded 19degreesC displayed two basic patterns. Some populations entered fresh water prior to the warmest period, months before spawning, whereas others migrated after the period of highest temperatures had occurred.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				MAR	2002	80	3					542	555		10.1139/Z02-030	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/Z02-030													WOS:000175011400017

The water samples were extracted by solid-phase extraction (SPE), and OCPs were analyzed by gas chromatograph equipped with a Ni-63-ECD detector. The investigation results indicated that the concentration of total OCPs varied from 4.07 to 13.5 ng center dot L-1 with an average value of 7.15 ng center dot L-1 in spring, and from 12.5 to 30.1 ng center dot L-1 with an average value of 19.9 ng center dot L-1 in autumn. Jiuxi Valley was slightly contaminated by OCPs, and the concentrations of sigma HCHs and sigma DDTs in the river were at relatively low levels. HCHs were the main pollutant in spring, and also in autumn, and alpha-HCH was the main component of the HCH isomers at most sampling points. Source analysis indicated that local use of lindane or input of fresh gamma-HCH contributed to the presence of HCHs. New inputs were the major sources of DDTs, aldrin, heptachlor, and endrin. The OCP levels of this investigation were within the standard limits set by a majority of the water quality standards and guidelines of China, WHO, European Union, and Canada. However, although the gamma-HCH concentrations at all sampling sites, endrin concentrations at all sampling sites, and beta-HCH concentrations at most sampling sites were below the human health water quality standard, and the levels of other tested OCPs (alpha-HCH, p,p '-DDD, p,p '-DDE, p,p '-DDT, aldrin, and heptachlor) exceeded the value of EPA-recommended water quality criteria for human health, which indicated potential risks to human health around the region.																			2090-9063	2090-9071				FEB 27	2020	2020								5101936	10.1155/2020/5101936	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/5101936													WOS:000522119000003

In eutrophic lakes, large amounts of the cyanobacterium Microcystis may overwinter in the sediment and re-inoculate the water column in spring. 2. We monitored changes in pelagic and benthic populations of Microcystis in Lake Volkerak, The Netherlands. In addition, sedimentation rates and the rate of recruitment from the sediment were measured using traps. These data were used to model the coupling between the benthic and pelagic populations and to calculate the contribution of overwintering benthic and pelagic populations to the magnitude of the pelagic summer bloom. 3. Changes in the benthic Microcystis population showed a time lag of 3-14 weeks compared with the pelagic population. This time lag increased with lake depth. The largest amount of benthic Microcystis was found in the deepest parts of the lake. These observations suggest horizontal transport of sedimented Microcystis from shallow to deep parts of the lake. 4. Recruitment from and sedimentation to the sediment occurred throughout the year, with highest recruitment and sedimentation rates during summer. Model simulations indicate that the absence of benthic recruitment would reduce the summer bloom by 50%. 5. In spring, the total pelagic population was three to six times smaller than the total benthic population. Yet, model simulations predict that the absence of this small overwintering pelagic population would reduce the summer bloom by more than 64%. 6. Reduction of the overwintering pelagic populations, for instance by flushing, may be a useful management strategy to suppress or at least delay summer blooms of Microcystis.

J	HORN, H				HORN, H			THE EFFECTS OF SAMPLING INTERVALS ON PHYTOPLANKTON GROWTH AND LOSS VALUES DERIVED FROM SEASONAL PHYTOPLANKTON BIOMASS VARIATIONS IN AN ARTIFICIAL LAKE	INTERNATIONALE REVUE DER GESAMTEN HYDROBIOLOGIE												Detailed vertical phytoplankton sample series with good resolution were taken every 3-4 days for almost 2 yr from the artificial Lake Saidenbach. The intervals between samplings were systematically increased by regularly ignoring certain samples so that 6 different annual curves based on different sampling frequencies were obtained to describe phytoplankton variations in the course of the year from a single time series. In this way the effect of the interval between samplings on the results of phytoplankton studies and on the rates of change and turnover calculated from the biomass could be studied. Maximum rates of change and turnover values yielded by half-weekly samplings are 20-30% higher than those yielded by weekly samplings. Sampling intervals smaller than 3-4 days yield not much increased rates of change and turnovers. This implies that short term changes in the phytoplankton are more accurately detected by half-weekly samplings. Depending on the nature and objectives of the investigations, sampling intervals of 3-4 wk are sufficient in the winter, but during the growth period (spring to autumn) samples should be taken at least once a week or fortnightly.																			0020-9309						1984	69	1					111	119		10.1002/iroh.19840690112	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19840690112													WOS:A1984SR74700007

Seasonal and environmental factors affecting growth of Illinois pondweed	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												Illinois pondweed (Potamogeton illinoensis Morong) is a native submersed plant that is widely distributed throughout North America and occurs in about 15% of Florida lakes. These experiments evaluated the effects of season, salinity, water flow, and substrate on biomass accumulation and seed production by Illinois pondweed. Seasonal growth studies conducted over a 1-yr period revealed that maximum growth occurred in the summer when water temperatures were between 26 and 30 C. Seed production by 8-wk-old plants was highest in summer, but seeds developed in spring and fall as well. Growth was reduced when water salinity was 5.02% and plants died at salinities >= 8.57%. Greatest weight of plants cultured in 660-L mesocosms was achieved when water flowed at >= 9.1 L min(-1). Growth in substrates with 2.7% organic matter (OM) was about three times greater than growth in sand only, but additions of organic matter (OM) to 73% elicited no additional growth. Illinois pondweed grew well in coarse to very coarse silica sand particle sizes, whereas hydrilla [Hydrilla verticillata (L.f.) Royle] produced minimal growth. These data suggest that substrate particle size may have a more important effect on the distribution of submersed plants in waterways than other hydrosoil characteristics such as nutrients and OM content.																			0146-6623					JUL	2018	56						101	106																WOS:000456764800004
J	Billman, EJ; Rasmussen, JE; Watson, J				Billman, Eric J.; Rasmussen, Josh E.; Watson, Jackie			EVALUATION OF RELEASE STRATEGIES FOR CAPTIVE-REARED JUNE SUCKER BASED ON POSTSTOCKING SURVIVAL	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												The recovery program for the endangered June sticker (Chasmistes horns) relies on population augmentation to overcome recruitment deficits. Successful recruitment of artificially propagated individuals is affected by release timing, release size, and rearing techniques. We examined the effect of release timing and release size (total length [TL] and a relative condition factor [W-r]) on recruitment probability of hatchery-reared June sucker (Utah Division of Wildlife Resources Fisheries Experiment Station [FES]) and captive-reared June sucker (Red Butte Reservoir [RBR] refuge population) stocked across multiple years. Because source and year effects were confounded, we assessed the probability of recruitment individually for each major stocking event (i.e., source x year combination). Successful recruitment occurred if an individual was recaptured or detected at least once during annual spawning runs up Utah Lake tributaries. For stocking events from RBR, probability of recruitment was highest in individuals stocked during spring and early summer but decreased as summer progressed. No difference existed between spring and fall stocking events. June sucker from the FES stocked in October had lower overall probability of recruitment than those stocked in August. The relationships between recruitment probability and TL and W-r for stocking events from RBR were hump shaped, with peaks at approximately 375 mm TL and 100%, respectively. For FES individuals, a positive relationship existed between recruitment probability and TL, for individuals stocked during August only; no relationship existed between the recruitment probability and W-r. Release timing and release size affected the recruitment success of captive-reared June sucker; therefore, recovery plans should incorporate these factors in augmentation efforts to maximize augmentation efficiency and success.

Over one year Epischura was infected by procercoids of proteocephalids at a prevalence of 0.13% (in Listvenichnyi Bay, South Baikal). Male E. baicalensis were infected more (0.39%). The number of procercoids of genus Proteocephalus was 2.7 specimens/m(3). The largest number of procercoids was found in females (1.26), the least in the third copepodid stage (0.03 specimens/m(3)). Because of the close ecological contacts between E. baicalensis and Coregonus autumnalis migratorius it is probable that E. baicalensis is infected by P. exiguus, the species usually found in C. a. migratorius (Zaika, 1965). The parasite lives for about 8 months in the winter-spring Epischura generation and about 10 months in the summer generation.

The comparison of results from these two lakes could have been reliably made, because they were characterized by a similar trophic state (meso-eutrophic), were located in the same climatic zone, and were examined at the same time but differed in terms of morphometry (area, depth, and shape) as well as land use of catchment area. These dimictic lakes were characterized by hypolimnetic oxygen deficits in summer. The internal loading of phosphorus was analysed on the basis of ex situ experiments with intact cores of bottom sediments sampled at two stations, situated in the profundal (the deepest place in the lake) and in the littoral (2.0m depth). The results indicated that a higher phosphorus load was released from bottom sediments in the profundal zone than in the littoral zone of both lakes. Phosphorus release from the profundal zone was twofold higher in Prawe Lake than in Lusowskie Lake. It reached 2.6mgPm(-2)d(-1) in spring and winter in the larger and deeper Lusowskie Lake, compared to 6.04mgPm(-2)d(-1) in autumn in the smaller and shallower Prawe Lake. In the littoral zone, phosphorus release reached 1.67mgPm(-2)d(-1) and 0.16mgPm(-2)d(-1) in both lakes, respectively. Differences in phosphorus internal loading between the lakes were due to differences in the stability of thermal stratification, time of water mixing and oxygen concentration in the depth profile of the lake.

Here, we use multiple proxies from Pinus cembra trees from God da Tamangur, combining tree ring anatomy and stable isotope chronologies to reconstruct seasonal glacier mass balance (i.e., winter, summer, and annual mass balance) for the nearby Silvretta Glacier over the last 2 centuries. The combination of tree ring width, radial diameter of earlywood cell lumina, and latewood radial cell wall thickness provides a highly significant reconstruction for summer mass balance, whereas for the winter mass balance, the correlation was less significant but still robust when radial cell lumina were combined with delta 18 O records. A combination of the reconstructed winter and summer mass balances allows the quantification of the annual mass balance of the Silvretta Glacier for which in situ measurements date back to 1919. Our reconstruction indicates a substantial increase in glacier mass during the first half of the 19th century and an abrupt termination of this phase after the end of the Little Ice Age. Since the 1860s, negative glacier mass balances have been dominant and mass losses accelerate as anthropogenic warming picks up in the Alps.					; Stoffel, Markus/A-1793-2017; CORONA, Christophe/I-2095-2012; Huss, Matthias/JLL-6340-2023	Nicolussi, Kurt/0000-0002-1737-4119; Stoffel, Markus/0000-0003-0816-1303; CORONA, Christophe/0000-0002-7645-6157; 													1814-9324	1814-9332				JUN 5	2024	20	6					1251	1267		10.5194/cp-20-1251-2024	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-20-1251-2024													WOS:001239331600001

Lake Whitefish Diet, Condition, and Energy Density in Lake Champlain and the Lower Four Great Lakes following Dreissenid Invasions	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Lake Whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis support some of the most valuable commercial freshwater fisheries in North America. Recent growth and condition decreases in Lake Whitefish populations in the Great Lakes have been attributed to the invasion of the dreissenid mussels, zebra mussels Dreissena polymorpha and quagga mussels D.bugensis, and the subsequent collapse of the amphipod, Diporeia, a once-abundant high energy prey source. Since 1993, Lake Champlain has also experienced the invasion and proliferation of zebra mussels, but in contrast to the Great Lakes, Diporeia were not historically abundant. We compared the diet, condition, and energy density of Lake Whitefish from Lake Champlain after the dreissenid mussel invasion to values for those of Lake Whitefish from Lakes Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario. Lake Whitefish were collected using gill nets and bottom trawls, and their diets were quantified seasonally. Condition was estimated using Fulton's condition factor (K) and by determining energy density. In contrast to Lake Whitefish from some of the Great Lakes, those from Lake Champlain Lake Whitefish did not show a dietary shift towards dreissenid mussels, but instead fed primarily on fish eggs in spring, Mysis diluviana in summer, and gastropods and sphaeriids in fall and winter. Along with these dietary differences, the condition and energy density of Lake Whitefish from Lake Champlain were high compared with those of Lake Whitefish from Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Ontario after the dreissenid invasion, and were similar to Lake Whitefish from Lake Erie; fish from Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Ontario consumed dreissenids, whereas fish from Lake Erie did not. Our comparisons of Lake Whitefish populations in Lake Champlain to those in the Great Lakes indicate that diet and condition of Lake Champlain Lake Whitefish were not negatively affected by the dreissenid mussel invasion.

A Tale of Two Seasons: Distinct Seasonal Viral Communities in a Thermokarst Lake	MICROORGANISMS												Thermokarst lakes are important features of subarctic landscapes and are a substantial source of greenhouse gases, although the extent of gas produced varies seasonally. Microbial communities are responsible for the production of methane and CO2 but the "top down" forces that influence microbial dynamics (i.e., grazers and viruses) and how they vary temporally within these lakes are still poorly understood. The aim of this study was to examine viral diversity over time to elucidate the seasonal structure of the viral communities in thermokarst lakes. We produced virus-enriched metagenomes from a subarctic peatland thermokarst lake in the summer and winter over three years. The vast majority of vOTUs assigned to viral families belonged to Caudovirales (Caudoviricetes), notably the morphological groups myovirus, siphovirus and podovirus. We identified two distinct communities: a dynamic, seasonal community in the oxygenated surface layer during the summer and a stable community found in the anoxic water layer at the bottom of the lake in summer and throughout much of the water column in winter. Comparison with other permafrost and northern lake metagenomes highlighted the distinct composition of viral communities in this permafrost thaw lake ecosystem.					; Langlois, Valérie/ISS-1028-2023; Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019	Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938; Girard, Catherine/0000-0002-3899-0180; Langlois, Valerie/0000-0003-1326-7081; Culley, Alexander/0000-0001-6639-9112														2076-2607				FEB	2023	11	2							428	10.3390/microorganisms11020428	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms11020428								36838393					WOS:000941398700001
J	Vyhlídalová, T; Soldánová, M				Vyhlidalova, Tereza; Soldanova, Miroslava			Species-specific patterns in cercarial emergence of Diplostomum spp. from snails Radix lagotis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY												The cercarial emergence patterns of three species of Diplostomum (Diplostomum 'mergi', Diplostomum spathaceum and Diplostomum parviventosum) parasitizing freshwater first intermediate host Radix lagotis sampled in Most Lake, Czech Republic, were studied under various experimental conditions, i.e. field, laboratory and incubator, and seasons, i.e. spring, summer and autumn. We discovered unexpected daily periodicity-dependent species-specific emergence patterns among the three Diplostomum spp. depending on experimental conditions. At the same time, the intraspecific variation of D. spathaceum cercarial release in response to seasonal conditions was observed. We found that a complex array of mechanisms can affect Diplostomum species-specific patterns in cercarial emergence, of which behavioural characteristics of fish related to reproduction and feeding processes are considered the most important factors. This might represent a specific adaptive evolutionary mechanism to maximise transmission success while avoiding competition for host resources. Our results contribute to a better understanding of ecological and epidemiological aspects with respect to specific adaptive strategies compartmentalised among species of Diplostomum and consequences for infection risk in fish hosts.

Palynological Evidence From the Altai Mountains for the Links Between the Asian Westerly Jet Streams and Monsoon System During the Holocene	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The Asian westerly jet streams in the upper troposphere play a pivotal role in shaping precipitation patterns, sustaining the diverse but fragile ecosystems in arid Central Asia. Despite their significance, the evolution history of these jet streams and their synergistic effects with the monsoon systems on regional climate change in Asia during the Holocene remain poorly understood. To address this gap, we present a continuous pollen record since 8.6 cal ka BP from Lake Shuang in the Altai Mountains. The first two principal components of the pollen data are employed to track regional changes in vegetation, summer moisture, and winter temperature. Meanwhile, the pollen data and the TraCE-21ka simulation results were compared to reveal the dynamic mechanism of regional climate change. Results indicate a humid phase spanning the interval similar to 8 to 5 cal ka BP in this region, which broadly coincides with the intensification of the Indian Summer Monsoon. This temporal correlation is potentially linked to the poleward shift of the Asian jet, as suggested by simulation results. Furthermore, our data show a consistent winter warming trend throughout the Holocene, indicated by changes in the dominant tree pollen taxa and a reduction of cold-resistant-taxa. This trend is associated with the weakening of the East Asian Winter Monsoon, influenced by increasing winter solar insolation and atmospheric CO2 concentration. Overall, our research provides strong paleoclimatological evidence highlighting the interconnected meteorological roles of the Asian jet and monsoon systems in shaping regional climates.

Temporal succession, spatial dynamics and diversity of phytoplankton in the meromictic Laguna de la Cruz: the role of stratification patterns	LIMNETICA												Laguna de La Cruz is a small meromictic karstic lake located in Cuenca (Central Spain), whose stratification and thermal mixing patterns largely determine the structure and composition of its phytoplankton populations. In this lake, the succession in the oxic zone of the water column starts, with the autumnal mixing, with some diatom species, such as Cyclotella delicatula, of the functional codon B, dominating the community throughout the oxic water column during the winter. This species persists in spring, but then linked to deeper layers. In spring, at the beginning of the thermal stratification, picocyanobacteria, crypto-phytes, and dinoflagellates develop in upper layers, corresponding, respectively, to the functional coda Z, Y, and Lo, with the first two being progressively restricted to the oxycline as the stratification advances. As stratification advances, dense populations of chlorophytes belonging to the functional groups F, X, and J develop in the epilimnion and the metalimnion, while towards the end of the summer Cosmarium species, belonging to the functional group N-A, are selected and become dominant until the autumnal mixing favors again the diatoms. As a whole, the strong stratification of the water column allows for the appearance of different niches with a differential vertical distribution of the phytoplankton during the stratification periods, which favors its diversity within the whole water column. However, several types of disturbances, such as episodes of heavy rainfall, horizontal movements of water bodies and, in particular, the whitening that occurs every year towards the middle of summer, alter the successional pattern to some extent.					; Dolores, Maria/AAD-5003-2021; Mozo, Antonio/AAE-3707-2020; Camacho, Antonio/I-3417-2015; Miracle, Maria/G-3482-2016	Vicente-Pedros, Eduardo/0000-0002-8814-9912; Camacho, Antonio/0000-0003-0841-2010; Picazo Mozo, Antonio/0000-0002-7572-9686													0213-8409	1989-1806					2019	38	1					1	20		10.23818/limn.38.09	http://dx.doi.org/10.23818/limn.38.09													WOS:000457181700001
J	Locklin, J; Corbitt, D; McMahon, R				Locklin, Jason; Corbitt, Devin; McMahon, Robert			Settlement, density, survival and shell growth of zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha, in a recently invaded low latitude, warm water Texas reservoir	AQUATIC INVASIONS												Zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha, introduced to US freshwaters in 1986, have expanded into at least 19 Texas reservoir lakes since 2009. In Texas, they occupy the lowest latitudes in their North American and European range where summer surface water temperatures can exceed their upper thermal limit of 30 degrees C. Little is known of its population dynamics in such warm-water bodies, knowledge of which will be important for development/implementation of effective mussel management strategies. Zebra mussels were first discovered in Belton Lake, central Texas, in 2013 and developed a dense population by 2014. Belton Lake mussel settlement dynamics were studied from March 2016 to May 2017 on steel chains vertically suspended from a floating marina dock. Three chains were deployed at bimonthly intervals with mussel densities recorded monthly thereafter at each meter of depth until experiment termination. Shell growth rates and densities were also determined for emersed mussels at various sites in the reservoir after a 52-day period of high water. Spring cohort settlement occurred from June to September 2016 and fall cohort settlement from November 2016 to May 2017. Peak spring and fall cohort settlement densities were 1,025 mussels m(-2) on July 2016 and 175 m(-)(2) on February 2017, respectfully. Bottom to surface hypoxia from August (51.58%-71.14% DO) to October 2016 (49.04%-52.13% DO) extirpated the spring cohort by September 2016 and delayed fall cohort settlement until December 2016. Mean mussel settlement density increased with distance downstream from 0 mussels m(-2) in the reservoir's shallow, inlet end to 21,160 mussels m(-2) at its deeper wider outlet end suggesting that mussel densities tend to be greatest in deeper, wider, low-flow, down-stream ends of impounded water bodies. Mean mussel shell growth rates across six sites were 127.9 mu m day(-1), one of the fastest recorded for mussels in Europe and North America. Two annual reproductive periods, rapid growth rates and early maturity are likely to lead to zebra mussel population expansion to problematic sizes within 1-2 years after introduction into warm southwestern water bodies, leaving little time for development/implementation of effective mussel macrofouling control/mitigation strategies. Thus, development of effective macrofouling management/mitigation plans should be undertaken prior to establishment of mussels in a water body.																			1798-6540	1818-5487				SEP	2020	15	3					408	434		10.3391/ai.2020.15.3.04	http://dx.doi.org/10.3391/ai.2020.15.3.04													WOS:000601377700004

Temporal and Spatial Variations of Nutrients in Baiyangdian Lake, North China	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS												Baiyangdian Lake is the largest shallow freshwater body in the North China Plain. In this study, the spatial and temporal variations of nutrients have been studied based on the monthly data of eight state monitoring stations from 2000 to 2009. The results showed that: (1) Total phosphorus and total nitrogen were major pollutants in Baiyangdian Lake. The synthesized trophic state index indicated that the lake was in eutrophic or supereutrophic state. (2) Total phosphorus concentrations were higher in summer and autumn, and total nitrogen concentrations were higher in autumn and winter for most years from 2000 to 2009. Inter-annual water quality analysis showed that Baiyangdian Lake was seriously polluted in 2006, and the water quality in 2009 was the best in recent decade. (3) The water quality in the west of the lake was worse than that in eastern section, which caused by the point source pollution. In addition, nitrogen and phosphorus from non-point source might enter the lake through domestic sewage, the wastes and animal husbandry from the villages in the lake. (4) Variations of water level were influenced by both precipitation and water recharges. Total phosphorus concentrations in the lake were negatively correlated with water levels for most years, inferring that the dilution effects of water recharges could relieve water pollution in Baiyangdian Lake. This study suggested that the integrated management of water resources should focus on both pollution source control and water recharge regulations.					; xia, xinghui/A-9116-2008	Xia, Xinghui/0000-0002-8663-6346; 													1726-2135					JUN	2011	17	2					102	108		10.3808/jei.201100192	http://dx.doi.org/10.3808/jei.201100192													WOS:000292279200006

Convectively driven transport in temperate lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Penetrative convection in the surface layer of a midsize temperate lake (5 km(2)) was investigated in both summer and winter using a conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) logger mounted on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) flown repeatedly along horizontal transects at selected depths. In summer, the epilimnion cooled differentially during a calm evening (240 and 297 W m(-2) on the east and west sides of the lake, respectively). These cooling rates agree well with the average net heat flux of 270 W m(-2) estimated from meteorological data. Density currents were driven by this differential cooling. In winter, CTD profiles during a sunny day showed four distinct thermal layers beneath the ice (similar to 50 cm thick), consistent with radiative penetrative convection: a stratified diffusive layer just beneath the ice (top 1.6 m); a well-mixed convective layer (that deepens at 1.14 m d(-1) and warms at 0.015 degrees C d(-1) during the observation period); an entrainment layer (1.5 m thick); and a weakly stratified quiescent layer (to bottom). AUV transects, flown at constant depths in each layer, revealed a 150-m wide region displaying evidence of penetrative convection, surrounded by regions with negligible heat changes. These high-resolution, horizontal CTD measurements provided insight into previously unresolved physical dynamics of the well-mixed layer of a temperate lake in quasi-shear-free conditions that would have been difficult to quantify during summer months and impossible under winter ice cover without the use of an AUV platform.

A method of estimating the numbers of fungal propagules by continuous flow centrifugation, pour plating and scanning was tested and the probable losses during processing determined. For zoospores and zoospore cysts the loss of viable propagules was within the range 5-25%. This method was then used on samples from the lake. Zoospores and zoospore cysts were the predominant propagules recovered. There was a seasonal periodicity in propagule numbers, per unit volume, with 3, rather than 2, maxima: early spring, early summer and autumn. There was a diurnal periodicity in numbers, per unit volume of propagules with 2 maxima (early afternoon and late evening), the relative importance of which varied through the year. Similar diurnal and seasonal fluctuations were found in all the oomycete genera collected, with the possible exception of Phytophthora. Experiments showed that in lakewater zoospores had a short life-span. Thus the number, per unit volume, of zoospores recovered may be indicative of the activity of the fungi. No single factor accounted for the fluctuations observed.

Through spectral measurement and highthroughput sequencing techniques, the structural, network, and evolutionary characteristics of generalists and specialists in Baiyangdian lake inflow rivers from 2021 to 2023 were analyzed, and the influences of environmental factors and DOM on their dynamics were quantified. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) identified two protein-like components (C1+C2) and one humus-like component (C3). Among them, the protein-like components were significantly higher in urban reclaimed water (URW) than in non-urban reclaimed water (NRW), while the humus-like component was higher in summer than in winter (P < 0.001). The relative concentration of DOM was higher in summer, showing overall low humification and strong autochthonous characteristics (FI > 1.8, HIX <4). Actinobacteriota and Proteobacteria were the main components of generalists and specialists. Species replacement had a much greater impact on beta-diversity than richness differences. The network structure of winter and NRW exhibited more complex topological properties, and the stability of generalist networks was lower than that of specialists. Stochastic processes dominated the community assembly process (63.73 %-93.94 %), with generalists in summer being more influenced by stochastic processes, while the opposite was true in winter. The BiSSE model indicated that specialists exhibited higher diversification potential than generalists. Path analysis showed that in summer URW, diversity and protein-like components had the greatest impact on the network stability of generalists and specialists, respectively. In NRW, humus-like component had the greatest impact on the network stability of specialists. This study clarified the mechanism by which the seasonal characteristics of DOM drive the ecological strategy differentiation of generalists and specialists in rivers, providing a theoretical basis for watershed ecological management.

Lake-size dependency of wind shear and convection as controls on gas exchange	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												High-frequency physical observations from 40 temperate lakes were used to examine the relative contributions of wind shear (u(*)) and convection (w(*)) to turbulence in the surface mixed layer. Seasonal patterns of u(*) and w(*) were dissimilar; u(*) was often highest in the spring, while w(*) increased throughout the summer to a maximum in early fall. Convection was a larger mixed-layer turbulence source than wind shear (u(*)/w(*) < 0.75) for 18 of the 40 lakes, including all 11 lakes < 10 ha. As a consequence, the relative contribution of convection to the gas transfer velocity (k, estimated by the surface renewal model) was greater for small lakes. The average k was 0.54 m day(-1) for lakes < 10 ha. Because u(*) and w(*) differ in temporal pattern and magnitude across lakes, both convection and wind shear should be considered in future formulations of lake-air gas exchange, especially for small lakes.

However, the limited number of quantitative temperature records in Northeast (NE) China covering the last deglaciation hampers a complete understanding of the mechanisms and processes behind the temperature changes that occurred in that region. Here, we present a quantitative reconstruction of summer temperature over the last deglaciation based on bacterial branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) analyzed from the sediment sequence of Lake Kielguo, a small volcanic lake in NE China. The results show that summer temperature was lowest during the interval ca. 20-18.2 calibrated (cal.) k.y. B.P. with a value of similar to 11.1 degrees C and increased by similar to 1.9 degrees C during Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1) and by similar to 2.7 degrees C during the transition to the Bolling-Allerod (B-A). The summer temperatures during the B-A warm interval and Younger Dryas cold interval were similar to 14.1 degrees C and similar to 12.0 degrees C, respectively. The summer temperature record from the Lake Kielguo sediment sequence indicates that summer warming dominated the climate change state during HS1 in East Asia, which is different from the cooling pattern controlled by winter temperatures in the North Atlantic and Greenland realms. This distinction can be explained by weakened winter cooling signals triggered by the collapse of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation when these signals propagated to East Asia, and increased summer temperature warming controlled by orbital and greenhouse gases during HS1 in East Asia.

Dispersal of tournament-displaced largemouth bass and spotted bass in Lake Martin, Alabama	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Anglers fishing in tournaments for black basses Micropterus spp. often displace fish great distances from the site of capture. Accumulation of black bass, which may have negative effects on populations and the fishery, can occur when many tournaments displace large numbers of fish to a single tournament processing site. Thirty-nine largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides and spotted bass M. punctulatus were implanted with radio transmitters in spring 2005 and tracked for nearly 1 year. Twenty of these fish were transported to a popular tournament release site on Lake Martin (16,188 ha), Alabama, to observe the effect of simulated tournament displacement on movement and dispersal. The other fish were released after radio tag implantation at their capture site and served as control fish. In addition, 7 fish/species were collected from tournaments and implanted with transmitters in fall 2005 and tracked for 4.5 months to monitor postrelease behavior. In spring, displaced fish moved more than control fish after 3-4 weeks and dispersed from the release site over time. Movement and behavior of displaced fish was altered for up to 6 months after release compared with control fish. After 10 weeks, displaced fish moved an average of 7.4 km and control fish moved an average of 1.3 km; during the first 6 months, daily movement was about two to five times greater for displaced fish. Tournament-displaced fish tagged in fall 2005 moved less than the fish subjected to simulated displacement in spring 2005, and less movement in fall coincided with cooler and falling water temperatures. Some fish remained within 2 kin of the release site for up to 3 months. In fall 2004 and spring 2005, anglers released at least 6,600 black bass at the site. We estimated that black bass biomass increased by 6-9 kg/ha within 2 km of the release site, translating to a probable 50-100% increase in resident black bass biomass. Fisheries managers should encourage or require the use of release boats, transport trailers equipped with live wells, and multiple release sites on reservoirs where tournament-related accumulation is suspected.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				JUN	2008	28	3					678	687		10.1577/M07-082.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M07-082.1													WOS:000257780100006
J	Jones, JB; Mulholland, PJ				Jones, JB; Mulholland, PJ			Carbon dioxide variation in a hardwood forest stream: An integrative measure of whole catchment soil respiration	ECOSYSTEMS												The concentration of CO2 in stream water is a product of not only instream metabolism but also upland, riparian, and groundwater processes and as such can provide an integrative measure of whole catchment soil respiration. Using a 5-year dataset of pH, alkalinity, Ca2+, and Mg2+ in surface water of the West Fork of Walker Branch in eastern Tennessee in conjunction with a hydrological flowpath chemistry model, we investigated how CO2 concentrations and respiration rates in stream, bedrock, and soil environments vary seasonally and interannually. Dissolved inorganic carbon concentration was highest in summer and autumn (P < 0.05) although the proportion as free CO2 (pCO(2)) did not vary seasonally (P > 0.05). Over the 5 years, pCO(2) was always supersaturated with respect to the atmosphere ranging from 374 to 3626 ppmv (1.0- to 10.1-fold greater than atmospheric equilibrium), and CO, evasion from the stream to the atmosphere ranged from 146 to 353 mmol m(-2) d(-1). Whereas pCO(2) in surface water exhibited little intra-annual or interannual variation, distinct seasonal patterns in soil and bedrock pCO(2) were revealed by the catchment CO2 model. Seasonally, soil pCO(2) increased from a winter low of 8167 ppmv to a summer high of 27,068 ppmv. Driven by the seasonal variation in gas levels, evasion of CO2 from sails to the atmosphere ranged from 83 mmol m(-2) d(-1) in winter to 287 mmol m(-2) d(-1) in summer. The seasonal variation in soil CO2 tracked soil temperature (r(2) = 0.46, P < 0.001) and model-derived estimates of CO2 evasion rate from soils agreed with previously reported fluxes measured using chambers (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.62, P < 0.05) supporting the model assumptions. Although rates of CO, evasion were similar between the stream and soils, the overall rate of evasion from the channel was only 0.4% of the 70,752 mol/d that evaded from soils due to the vastly different areas of the two subsystems. Our model provides a means to assess whole catchment CO2 dynamics from easily collected and measured stream-water samples and an approach to study catchment scale variation in soil ecosystem respiration.

L-1) encompasses an annual range of 1.0-1.5 units in each lake, with lowest values characteristically occurring during the late winter and early spring. In detailed investigations of one lake, we evaluated strong acid inputs, shifts in pCO2, and changes in organic acids as possible mechanisms for pH depression. Our results indicate the seasonal pH depressions are caused largely by pCO2 increases under the ice. Despite an acidic snowpack the pH depression could not be attributed to input of acid meltwater because total alkalinity did not change in the lake. Our results emphasize the importance of using measurements other than pH in investigating the causes of acid dynamics of natural waters.

We sampled 40 sites consisting of ten major soil types at spring (wet) and late-summer (dry) seasons. The sample locations range from semi-arid to arid with an annual mean air temperature from 1.2 to 10.7 degrees C and annual precipitation from less than 200 to around 400 mm. Overall topsoil total (STC), organic (SOC), and inorganic (SIC) carbon did not change significantly between spring and late summer. STC and SOC show a wave like pattern from north to south with two maxima in northern and southern Kazakhstan and one minimum in central Kazakhstan. With a few exceptions SIC content at northern sites is generally low, whereas at Lake Balkhash SIC can exceed 75% of STC. Independent of the seasons, SOC significantly differed among soil types. Total nitrogen content distribution among our sampling sites followed a similar pattern as SOC with significant differences between soil types occurring in northern, central and southern Kazakhstan.					; Sydykova, Kamilya/N-7448-2019; Mussurova, Saule/JPY-4049-2023; Kabimoldayev, Ilyas/LTZ-1294-2024; Yapiyev, Vadim/U-9460-2017; Suleimenova, Akmaral/GXH-4449-2022; Schonbach, Christian/B-1998-2009; Inglezakis, Vassilis/F-8554-2013; Schönbach, Christian/B-1998-2009	Suleimenova, Akmaral/0000-0003-2102-4426; Yapiyev, Vadim/0000-0001-8090-5122; Inglezakis, Vassilis/0000-0002-0195-0417; Kabimoldayev, Ilyas/0009-0001-4933-0962; Schonbach, Christian/0000-0002-0693-7617; Naizabekov, Sanzhar/0000-0001-5833-6883														2052-4463				NOV 13	2018	5								180242	10.1038/sdata.2018.242	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2018.242								30422127					WOS:000449923500002

During the summer, discharge levels were changed from top to bottom in the 8th wk, back to top in the 9th, all at 0.71 m3/s (= 25 ft3/s), and returned to the bottom in the 10th, but at 1.4 m3/s (= 40 cfs). Changing the discharge level had little or no impact on the thermal regime within the lake or downstream at 1.14 m3/s and only a moderate impact on water in the lake near the dam at 0.71 m3/s bottom discharge by generating double thermoclines. O2 depletion rates were greatest near the surface of the lake, mainly due to temperature effects, but increased greatly at the 3 m depth, the level of the top discharge port, when discharge was changed from bottom to top. Discharge of anoxic waters through the bottom of the dam caused a drop in O2 content immediately downstream but O2 content returned to inflow values within 1 km downstream of the dam.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1983	101	3					179	188		10.1007/BF00009873	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00009873													WOS:A1983QT55200002

The effects of temperature and solar intensity on the photolytic behavior of diluted bitumen were evaluated. Simultaneously, the photolytic similarities and differences between diluted bitumen and crude oil were compared. It was found that, in all test oils, the decrease of all total petroleum hydrocarbons followed a pseudo-first-order reaction kinetic with the exposure time regardless of seasons. Aromatic fractions had the highest apparent rate constants. Similarly, the chemical fingerprinting analysis of test oils demonstrated that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their alkylated homologues (APAHs) were the most photosensitive compounds among the identified targets, followed by n-alkanes, then terpanes, and steranes. The photolytic efficiencies of the target petroleum hydrocarbons in ASMB#5 were generally higher than the two diluted bitumen. Photolysis of APAHs occurred faster in summer than in winter; however, APAHs with different number of rings and degree of alkylation did not have obvious photolytic differences. These phenomena suggest that the photolytic similarities between dilbits and conventional crude oil depend on their similar chemical structure of petroleum hydrocarbons; their differences depend on the specific oil properties. The accumulated solar irradiation intensity and temperature are the main factors contributing to their photolytic differences for winter and summer exposed oils. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Two trials were held at each workshop, with group discussion between trials. Variation in counting and classifying marks was considerable, such that reporting rates for A1-A3 marks varied two to three fold among observers of the same lake trout. Observer variation was greater for classification of healing or healed marks than for fresh marks. The workshops highlighted, as causes for inconsistent mark classification, both departures from the accepted protocol for classifying marks by some agencies, and differences in how sliding and multiple marks were interpreted. Group discussions led to greater agreement in classifying marks. We recommend ways to improve the reliability of marking statistics, including the use of a dichotomous key to classify marks. Laboratory data show that healing times of marks on lake trout were much longer at 4 degreesC and 1 degreesC than at 10 degreesC and varied greatly among individuals. Reported A1-A3 and B1-B3 marks observed in late summer and fall collections likely result from a mixture of attacks by two year classes of sea lamprey. It is likely that a substantial but highly uncertain proportion of attacks that occur in late summer and fall lead to marks that are classified as A1-A3 the next spring. We recommend additional research on mark stage duration.

Phosphorus availability in sediments from a tidal river receiving runoff water from agricultural fields	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Eutrophication of surface water is a worldwide concern. Sediments may play an important role in buffering phosphorus (P) concentration in the overlying water column. However, information on the spatial variation of sediment P availability as affected by agricultural water discharge and hydrological conditions is limited. In this study river sediments were sampled in spring, summer, fall and winter, respectively from seven locations along a main tributary (Ten Mile Creek, TMC), which receives surface runoff water from agricultural lands and discharges into the Indian River Lagoon, south Florida, USA, and analyzed for P availability. Simultaneously, hydrological variables were measured on the spot and river water samples were collected for analyses of water quality. The results demonstrated that available Pin the sediments of TMC as measured by several commonly used extraction procedures had a large spatial variation. The downstream locations had a greater amount of available Pin the sediments than the upstream locations, which is attributable to the settlement of finer particles due to slower water flow and increased influence from salt water in the downstream locations where the fresh river water gradually mixed with salt water from the Indian River Lagoon. Phosphorus availability in the sediments appeared to be related to P sorption by iron and aluminum oxides and the competition for adsorbing sites between SO42- and PO43-. This spatial variation of P availability agrees with the elevation of chlorophyll a (Chla) in overlying water body in the downstream locations of TMC, indicating that the internal P source plays an important role in triggering an algal boom in surface water systems.

We also fitted immature and adult Bald Eagles with apparent origins in Canada with PTTs on their wintering grounds in central and southern California in 1997-2002. Post-fledging California eagles moved northward in their first summer, three to coastal and near-coastal central British Columbia and one to Great Slave Lake in Canada's Northwest Territories (ca. 1200-1400 and 2200 km by straight line, respectively). Three eagles with still-functioning PTTs returned to California between October and April. In subsequent years, the California-fledged eagles returned to or near their original northern summer areas in British Columbia or Northwest Territories annually for as many as 2 yr. Migrations of one young California eagle to and from Great Slave Lake were geographically similar to those of adult and immature Bald Eagles we studied concurrently that spent the breeding season in Canada and wintered in California, but timing of movements differed. In migrations subsequent to their first year, California eagles departed California later (late May to late July) than wintering migrants of all ages (mid-February to mid-March), and returned as early as September, while the winter migrants did not arrive in California until December-January.																			0892-1016					JUN	2007	41	2					106	112		10.3356/0892-1016(2007)41[106:AMOBET]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3356/0892-1016(2007)41[106:AMOBET]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000248192900003
J	VINICOMBE, K				VINICOMBE, K			BREEDING AND POPULATION FLUCTUATIONS OF THE LITTLE GREBE	BRITISH BIRDS												The breeding and seasonal fluctuations of little grebes T. ruficollis are discussed, based on counts made during 1970-1979 at Chew Valley Lake, Avon [England, UK] and augmented by counts made during the winter of 1976/1977 on Anglesey, Gwynedd. Wherever possible, the information is compared with corresponding details for great crested grebes Podiceps cristatus. Annual fluctuations in breeding numbers are related to a large extent to water level. The breeding season for both species is protracted, but most broods hatch in late summer, late July/early Aug. for little and late June to early Aug. for great crested grebes, both with a pronounced peak in the 2nd half of July. Most broods were of 1 or 2 young, with an average at Chew of 1.76 for little and 1.73 for great crested grebes. At Chew, the little grebe is mainly a summer visitor, with only a small, vestigial winter population. Breeding little grebes arrive mainly from mid March, and the largest numbers occur in July, Aug. and Sept., with the addition of the summer''s young. They remain to molt, mainly during Aug. and Sept., when they become readily visible on the lake, but there is no evidence for an appreciable outside influx, unlike the great crested grebe. Numbers rapidly decline to reach a Jan./Feb. low. Corresponding figures from Anglesey tie in well with those from Chew, though proportionally more (41% compared with 13%) remain in midwinter. Some moved onto salt or brackish water in Oct. with a peak in Nov., but these too largely moved on by midwinter. Possible wintering areas are discussed. Some probably move onto rivers and streams, and many to the south coast, but some probably move farther afield and winter on the Continent.																			0007-0335						1982	75	5					204	218																WOS:A1982NN54200002

Most of the sea bays have suffered severe eutrophication, water quality deterioration, ecosystem degradation and other problems. Although many countries and local governments have carried out corresponding environmental protection actions, the evaluation of their effectiveness still requires monitoring technology and data support for long-term water environment change. In this study, we take Yueqing Bay, the fourth largest bay in China, as a case to study the satellite-based water quality monitoring and variation analysis. We established a nutrient retrieval model for Yueqing Bay to produce a long-term series of nutrient concentration products in Yueqing Bay from 2013 to 2020, based on Landsat remote sensing images and long-term observation data, combined with support vector machine learning and water temperature and satellite spectra as input parameters, and then we analyzed its spatiotemporal variations and driving factors. In general, nutrient concentrations in the western part of the bay were higher than those in the eastern part. Levels of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) were lower in summer than in spring and winter, and reactive phosphate (PO4-P) levels were lower in summer and higher in autumn. In terms of natural factors, physical effects (e.g., seasonal variations in flow field) and biological effects (e.g., seasonal differences in the intensity of plankton photosynthesis) were the main causes of seasonal differences in nutrient concentration in Yueqing Bay. Nutrient concentration generally increased from 2013 to 2015 but decreased slightly after 2015. Over the past decade, the economy and industry of Yueqing Bay basin have developed rapidly. Wastewater resulting from anthropogenic production and consumption was transported via streams into Yueqing Bay, leading to the continuous increase in nutrient concentrations (the variation rates: a(DIN)> 0, a(PO4-P)> 0), which directly or indirectly caused high nutrient concentrations in some areas of the bay (e.g., Southwest Shoal at the mouth of Yueqing Bay). After 2015, the various ecological remediation policies adopted by cities around Yueqing Bay have mitigated, to some extent, the increasing nutrient concentration trends (the variation rates: a(DIN)< 0, a(PO4-P)< 0), but not significantly (P > 0.1). The environmental restoration of Yueqing Bay also requires continuous and long-term ecological protection and restoration work to be effective. This research can provide a reference for ecological environment monitoring and remote sensing data application for similar semi-enclosed bays, and support the sustainable development of the bay.

Observational Study of Wind Channeling within the St. Lawrence River Valley	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												The presence of orography can lead to thermally and dynamically induced mesoscale wind fields. The phenomenon of channeling refers to the tendency for the winds within a valley to blow more or less parallel to the valley axis for a variety of wind directions above ridge height. Channeling of surface winds has been observed in several regions of the world, including the upper Rhine Valley of Germany, the mountainous terrain near Basel, Switzerland, and the Tennessee and Hudson River Valleys in the United States. The St. Lawrence River valley (SLRV) is a primary topographic feature of eastern Canada, extending in a southwest-northeast direction from Lake Ontario, past Montreal (YUL) and Quebec City (YQB), and terminating in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. In this study the authors examine the long-term surface wind climatology of the SLRV and Lake Champlain Valley (LCV) as represented by hourly surface winds at Montreal, Quebec City, and Burlington, Vermont (BTV). Surface wind channeling is found to be prominent at all three locations with strong bidirectionalities that vary seasonally. To assess the importance of the various channeling mechanisms the authors compared the joint frequency distributions of surface wind directions versus 925-hPa geostrophic wind directions with those obtained from conceptual models. At YUL, downward momentum transport is important for geostrophic wind directions ranging from 2408 to 3408. Pressure-driven channeling is the dominant mechanism producing northeasterly surface winds at YUL. These northeasterlies are most prominent in the winter, spring, and autumn seasons. At YQB, pressure-driven channeling is the dominant physical mechanism producing channeling of surface winds throughout all seasons. Of particular importance, both YUL and YQB exhibit countercurrents whereby the velocity component of the wind within the valley is opposite to the component above the valley. Forced channeling was found to be prominent at BTV, with evidence of diurnal thermal forcing during the summer season. Reasons for the predominance of pressure-driven channeling at YUL and YQB and forced channeling at BTV are discussed.

The distribution of PTSs, including 15 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, 6 alkylphenols, and 8 metal(loid)s, along with nutrients, exhibited relatively high concentrations with irregular temporal fluctuations in the inner estuary. During winter and spring, phytoplankton communities showed good ecological quality, with an average of 28 species and a density of 1750 cells L-1. In contrast, during summer, there was a significant increase in the density of freshwater species (max 45,000 cells L-1). These assemblages were categorized into three seasonal groups, featuring dominant taxa like blue-green algae and diatoms. Temperature and nutrient levels were the principal factors influencing phytoplankton assemblages, while PTSs had a minor impact. Overall, phytoplankton assemblages displayed strong seasonal variation, mainly influenced by freshwater input and nutrient availability.

Large orbitally forced wet/dry extremes occur during interglacial time, similar to 130 to 80 ka, and conditions between these two extremes prevail during glacial time, similar to 70 to 15 ka. Orbital precession causes high seasonality in Northern Hemisphere (NH) insolation at similar to 125, 105, and 83 ka, with stronger and northward extended summer monsoon rains in North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula and increased winter rains in the Mediterranean Basin. The combined effects of these two seasonally distinct rainfall regimes increase vegetation and narrow the width of the Saharan-Arabian desert and semidesert zones. During the opposite phase of the precession cycle (similar to 115, 95, and 73 ka), NH seasonality is low, and decreased summer insolation and increased winter insolation cause monsoon and storm track rains to decrease and the width of the desert zone to increase. During glacial time (similar to 70 to 15 ka), forcing from large ice sheets and lowered greenhouse gas concentrations combine to increase winter Mediterranean storm track precipitation; the southward retreat of the northern limit of summer monsoon rains is relatively small, thereby limiting the expansion of deserts. The lowered greenhouse gas concentrations cause the near-equatorial zone to cool and reduce convection, causing drier climate with reduced forest cover. At most locations and times, the simulations agree with environmental observations. These changing regional patterns of climate/vegetation could have influenced the dispersal of early humans through expansions and contractions of well-watered corridors.

DYNAMICS OF 137Cs UPTAKE FROM WATER TO PRUSSIAN CARP (CARASSIUS GIBELIO)	NUCLEAR PHYSICS AND ATOMIC ENERGY												The rate constants of Cs-137 uptake in Prussian carp (Carassius gibelio) from the water with a potassium content of 2 mg.L-1 at T = 5 degrees C without feeding (kw = 0.045 +/- 0.001 day(-1)), at T = 12 degrees C with "clean" feeding (0.046 +/- 0.002 day(-1)) and at T = 22 degrees C with "clean" feeding (0.062 +/- 0.006 day-1) were obtained in a series of aquarium experiments. The results showed that rates of Cs-137 uptake in fish from water without and with feeding did not significantly differ at different temperatures of water (T = 5 - 22 degrees C) and were two orders of magnitude lower than the rate constants of 137Cs uptake in Prussian carp with feed in Chornobyl exclusion zone (11.4 +/- 2.6 day(-1)). This makes it possible to obtain products with Cs-137 content below the permissible level (150 Bq.kg(-1)) while providing fish with clean feeds even in the most radioactively contaminated reservoirs of the exclusion zone. A decrease in the potassium content in water from 2 to 0.2 mg.L-1 (no feeding, T = 5 +/- 1 degrees C) resulted in an increase in the rate of Cs-137 uptake into the fish from the water by 1.6 times. An increase in the potassium content in water by 10 times up to 20 mg L-1 resulted just in a decrease of 20 % in the rate. The levels of Cs-137 activity concentration in fish in contaminated water at temperatures below 10 degrees C will be two orders of magnitude lower compared to radioactive contamination of water in the summer season (T = 22 degrees C). This is extremely important for the correct prediction of fish contamination in the autumn-winter-spring period at a water temperature of less than 10 degrees C when some fish stop feeding.

Sediment fluxes correspond to seasonal climatic variations. The diatom flux shows two distinct peaks in September and November, whereas the flux of chrysophyte stomatocysts shows a maximum in May. The blooms of diatoms may be related to the subsequent deepening of the thermocline in September and lake overturn in spring and November, and in flux of nutrient-rich groundwater sometime after the onset of the summer monsoon. The fluxes of organic matter and siliciclastics show a distinct seasonal pattern. They are varying between 0.03 and 0.56 g m(-2) d(-1) and reach a maximum in May. Quartz in the trap samples indicates that the siliciclastic matter may originate from distant aeolian sources. Sediment trap data and thin section investigations confirm the seasonality of Lake Sihailongwan sediments. Dark-colored layer, which mainly consists of valves of Cyclotella comta, might be deposited during autumn, and then is followed by a light-colored mixed layer starting with siliciclastics deposited after ice-out. The varved sediments in the U-shaped Lake Sihailongwan represent a sensitive siliciclastic and geochemical archive of paleoenvironmental variability in this data-sparse area. Detailed investigations of varved sediments should provide decadal to annual records of seasonal sediment flux and its relation to climatic parameters. Especially the diatomaceous layer is regarded to indicate summer climatic fluctuations, while the thick siliciclastic layer could be an indictor of dust events.

Spatial, seasonal, and historical variation of phytoplankton production in Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												There have been few direct measurements of phytoplankton production made in Lake Michigan since invasive dreissenid mussels became established in the lake. Here we report the results of 64 measure-ments of phytoplankton primary production made in Lake Michigan during 2016 and 2017. We con-ducted two lake-wide surveys, one in the spring 2016 isothermal period and one after summer stratification in 2017 and examined seasonal production with bi-weekly sampling between May and November 2017 at an offshore station in the southwestern part of the lake. We assessed nearshore-offshore gradients by sampling at three transect locations on three occasions in 2017. Spring 2016 pro-duction and production:biomass (P:B) ratios (reflective of growth rates) were similar across the lake and were higher than those reported before dreissenid mussels became established, suggesting that despite decreases in phytoplankton biomass, growth rates remain high. Summer 2017 production and growth rates increased from south to north. Areal production in 2017 peaked in late summer. Mean 2017 sum -mer production (499 & PLUSMN; 129 mg C m ⠁2 day ⠁1) was lower than values reported prior to the mussel invasion, and the fraction of total production occurring in the deep chlorophyll layer was about half that measured pre-mussels. At the offshore site picoplankton accounted for almost 50 % of the chlorophyll. As spring P:B ratios have increased and summer P:B and seston carbon:phosphorus ratios have not changed, we con-clude that the decrease in phytoplankton production in Lake Michigan is due primarily to grazing by mussels rather than to stronger nutrient limitation.& COPY; 2022 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Ellen; Bouffard, Wayne			Movement of sea lamprey in the Lake Champlain basin	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) are a nuisance aquatic species in the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain that have devastated native fish populations and hampered the restoration of sport fisheries. This study examined inter-basin movement of sea lamprey in Lake Champlain to identify tributaries that contribute parasitic-phase sea lamprey and provide information for prioritizing those tributaries for sea lamprey control. A total of 4,125 recently metamorphosed sea lamprey was captured in tributaries to Lake Champlain and marked using coded wire tags between the fall of 2001 and winter 2003. These sea lamprey migrated to the lake to prey on salmonids and other fishes and returned to tributaries to spawn about 12-18 months after migration. We recaptured 6 tagged sea lamprey from the lake from spring 2002 through winter 2004, and 35 from tributaries in spring 2003 and 2004. We noted no apparent trends in movement among basins. Sea lamprey were collected at distances up to 64 kin from their natal tributaries. Tributary contributions of parasites were significantly differentfrom expectations it? the 2002 parasitic-phase cohort (chi(2) = 9.668, p < 0.011, 3 df), suggesting differential survival rates among out-migrating transformers from different tributaries. Estimates of the lake-wide out-migrating transformer population for the 2002 and 2003 parasitic-phase cohorts were 269,139 55,610 (SD) and 111,807 +/- 23,511 (SD). Results from this study suggest that sea lamprey movement is not inhibited by causeways dividing sub-basins, but movement among sub-basins is somewhat constrained. This indicates that management efforts to control sea lamprey should continue to treat the lake as a single system.

Seasonal Sediment and Nutrient Transport Patterns	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												It is essential to understand sediment and nutrient sources and their spatial and temporal patterns to design effective mitigation strategies. However, long-term data sets to determine sediment and nutrient loadings are scarce and expensive to collect. The goal of this study was to determine seasonal patterns of suspended sediment (SS), total N (TN), and total P (TP) concentrations and loadings for three USGS gauge sites located at the Fort Cobb Reservoir Experimental watershed (FCREW) located in southwestern Oklahoma. Measured instantaneous discharge, SS, TN, and TP concentration data were used to develop lognormal water quality-discharge relationships. The water quality-discharge relationships were used to generate estimated seasonal concentrations and loads based on hourly or 30-min interval discharge. The estimated concentrations and loads were used to determine seasonal patterns for SS, TN, and TP relative to the respective state water quality criteria. Decreasing and increasing monotonic trends were observed for the seasonal time series loads for all three sites, but they were insignificant based on the Spearman test (alpha = 0.05). The largest loads were estimated during the wet springs and summers. The study SS, TN, and TP target concentrations were exceeded in one season or another. The study results showed that the priority locations to implement the TN and TP conservation practices were the Lake Creek and Willow Creek subwatersheds during the winter and spring seasons. Common practices to mitigate nutrients and suspended sediments include nutrient management, no-till, conversion of cultivated land to pasture, riparian buffers, and animal exclusion.

Organic P (P-o) mineralization processes induced by alkaline phosphatase (APase) regulated by phoD-encoding microorganisms in the lake ecosystems was still ambiguous due to the transseasonal shift of water temperatures and depths. Different P pools in the water and sediments of Shijiuhu Lake at varied seasons were measured using chemical extraction methods and solution (31)p NMR. The alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) in the sediments were assessed together with enzyme kinetic parameters. The abundances and compositions of microbial communities encoding functional gene phoD were also obtained using high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that Po concentrations remarkably increased from winter toward spring when having higher water depths due to the terrigenous input and biomass deposition. Noteworthy elevation in the PO43- concentration was observed in the interstitial water during the spring, particularly at around 5 cm sediment depth with value reaching as high as 0.43 mg/L. The degradation and mineralization of momoesters and diesters with higher concentrations in the sediments of spring aggravated the PO43- load in the interstitial water. Higher APA reaching 91.6 mu g/(g center dot h) in spring was responsible for the mineralization of P-o. Remarkably upwards increasing of absolute abundance of phoD-encoding gene in spring reaching up to 2.6 times of that in winter facilitated the generation of APA in spring. Cobetia and Calothrix followed by Aquabacterium and Mitsuaria were the most abundant phoD-encoding genera with relative abundance > 4%. Weakly positive correlation between dominant bacterial genera and APA and P fractions suggested that low-abundance genera was also involved in the APA generation and P-o hydrolysis. These results indicate that spring with high water temperature and depth facilitate the mineralization of Po in the sediment and increase of labile PO43 load in the water, further provide valuable information for the management of eutrophic lakes.																			0043-1354	1879-2448				JUL 15	2023	240								120107	10.1016/j.watres.2023.120107	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2023.120107		MAY 2023						37244018					WOS:001057933500001

To assess the phytoplankton production capacity of western Lake Erie, primary production was monitored in situ every other week at Middle Sister Island from spring to early autumn in the years 2002 and 2003. Physical parameters (light penetration, temperature, and dissolved oxygen), chlorophyll a, and major nutrients (total phosphorus and nitrate) were also measured. A decrease in primary production, based on monthly weighted means, was observed in summer 2003 (0.04-0.78 g C(.)m(-2.)d(-1)) when compared to 2002 (0.65-2.06 g C(.)m(-2.)d(-1)), correlating well with a reduced and more variable depth of the euphotic zone. Chlorophyll a and total phosphorus concentration, however, were higher in 2003. These data demonstrated that changes in carbon fixation are regulated by short and long term variability in the underwater light climate of the western basin of Lake Erie that are associated with wind events.

These studies have provided 5 years of record prior to operation of the Bradley Lake Hydroelectric Project and 8 years of record under the required operational instream flow regime. The character of the river changed substantially after project operation with summer and fall now much reduced and winter flow somewhat increased. Pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) spawning success appeared to be generally improved and more consistent under the regulated flow regime, presumably a result of now stabilization and guaranteed winter minimum flow. Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) spawning and rearing habitat improved, resulting in a small, but stable, chinook run. Chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) use may be reduced under the operational regime, possibly because fewer upwelling areas exist with the lower now. Potential attraction of pink salmon to the tailrace rather than to the river was monitored by tracking fish with ultrasonic tags. These studies indicated that, while some fish were temporarily attracted to the tailrace area, most fish left the tailrace quickly and entered the river.																									2000	2000	1					197	202																WOS:000088719600033

Cloned 16S rRNA genes from this system were used for putative identification of taxa dominating the T-RFLP profiles. Both cloning and T-RFLP analysis indicated that Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Cytophaga-Flavobacterium and Proteobacteria were the most abundant bacterioplankton groups in the Delta. Despite the broad variety of sampled habitats (deep water channels, lakes, marshes, agricultural drains, freshwater and brackish areas), and the spatial and temporal differences in hydrology, temperature and water chemistry among the sampling campaigns, T-RFLP electropherograms from all samples were similar, indicating that the same bacterioplankton phylotypes dominated in the various habitats of the Delta throughout the year. However, principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least-squares regression (PLS) of T-RFLP profiles revealed consistent grouping of samples on a seasonal, but not a spatial, basis. beta-Proteobacteria related to Ralstonia, Actinobacteria related to Microthrix, and beta-Proteobacteria identical to the environmental Clone LD12 had the highest relative abundance in summer/fall T-RFLP profiles and were associated with low river flow, high pH, and a number of optical and chemical characteristics of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) indicative of an increased proportion of phytoplankton-produced organic material as opposed to allochthonous, terrestrially derived organic material. On the other hand, Geobacter-related beta-Proteobacteria showed a relative increase in abundance in T-RFLP analysis during winter/spring, and probably were washed out from watershed soils or sediment. Various phylotypes associated with the same phylogenetic division, based on tentative identification of T-RFLP fragments, exhibited diverse seasonal patterns, suggesting that ecological roles of Delta bacterioplankton were partitioned at the genus or species level.

Of the tagged geese, eight left Qinghai Lake and began autumn migration. Of these eight, four completed their autumn migration, lasting 50 to 90 days, using one of two migration routes to their wintering grounds near Caohai Lake in Guizhou Province, Yarlung Zangbo valley in Tibet, and Kohima in India. The tagged geese each stopped at three to four sites and traveled 1,270 to 1,470 km from their breeding to wintering grounds.

The enzymatic activity was maximal in summer (between 20 and 69,4 mu mol P-PO43-.h(-1).mg(-1) in the epilimnion) and minimal in spring and in autumn (varying from 0,1 to 10 mu mol P-PO43-.h(-1).mg(-1)). This activity was greatest in the epilimnion and became weaker with depth. APA appeared to be inversely related to the concentration of orthophosphate. Finally, the main peak of the alkaline phosphatase activity seemed to be strictly associated with blooms of Cyanobacteria. In the presence of a similar concentration of orthophosphate, algae showed a higher uptake rate of this nutrient than Cyanobacteria. Therefore, Cyanobacteria were more often obliged to resort to the phosphatase activity for mineralizing organic phosphorus. The observed differences in the phosphorus assimilation between algae and Cyanobacteria might explain ecological successions related to the seasonal variations.

All basins occupy an agricultural catchment in the municipality of Dywity (Olsztyn Lakeland). They are characterized by a small surface area (1-41 ha) and a shallow depth (1.6-3.6 m). The objective of this study was to analyze water level variability and determine the retention capacities of the examined basins. The survey covered three hydrological years between 2005 and 2007. Water levels were monitored on a weekly basis. Retention capacities were determined from bathygraphic curves for average water levels (based on bathymetric maps which were developed for the needs of the study). An analysis of the retention capacities of the studied basins during winter and summer points to higher levels of water accumulation in winter in all reservoirs. Lower retention in summer can be attributed to high ambient temperatures which speed up water evaporation and actual evapotranspiration from aquatic vegetation. The differences observed between the summer seasons in the analyzed hydrological years (other than evaporation which lowers retention) indicate that summer precipitation levels significantly affect retention capacity. The difference in the overall volume of water retained in all basins between the "dry" year of 2005 and the "wet" year of 2007 reached 104,600 m(3). Total winter retention during the three-year survey was determined at 1,511,600 m(3), and it was 69,700 m(3) higher in comparison with summer retention. The greatest fluctuations in the volume of retained water were noted in closed basins. In one of the studied reservoirs, a nine-fold difference was observed between the minimum and maximum retention levels.

J	Sousounis, PJ; Grover, EK				Sousounis, PJ; Grover, EK			Potential future weather patterns over the Great Lakes region	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Evaluating changes in synoptic patterns is tantamount to understanding regional climate change. To date, the synoptic evaluations that have been done regarding climate change output from General Circulation Models have been restricted mainly to examining changes in storm tracks across large areas (the Atlantic Ocean). In this study, output from the Canadian Coupled Climate Model (CGCM1) and the Hadley Coupled Climate Model (HadCM2) are examined relative to present conditions to evaluate potential changes in synoptic patterns over the Great Lakes region towards the end of this century. These models were used as part of the U.S. National Assessment of Climate Change. Both models show a decrease in the number of extremely cold days, an increase in the number of extremely hot days, and an increase in precipitation for the future-particularly for heavy precipitation (> 12.5 mm) events. The Canadian Model shows more of a precipitation increase from December to July. The Hadley Model shows more of a precipitation increase from July to December. Both models show a decrease in surface windspeed and an increase in the number of days with an easterly wind component. Both models exhibit decreases in cyclone numbers for the future. The Canadian Model shows a general decrease in the number of moderately strong cyclones and decreases in each month. The Hadley Model shows a slight increase in the number of strong cyclones but a greater decrease in the number of weak cyclones-especially during the spring. The Canadian Model exhibits significant decreases in the number of anticyclones in summer and significant increases occur in fall but does not exhibit any systematic changes in terms of intensity. The Hadley Model shows a slight increase in the number of weak anticyclones but a greater decrease in the number of strong anticyclones. Most of the decreases occur during the summer-so that the seasonal distribution is more uniform. All of the changes are consistent with changes in the general large scale flow patterns. An understanding of all these synoptic changes provides richness and a more conceptual understanding of how climate change may affect the Great Lakes region.																			0380-1330						2002	28	4					496	520		10.1016/S0380-1330(02)70602-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(02)70602-3													WOS:000180411100003
J	Dean, WE; Schwalb, A				Dean, WE; Schwalb, A			The lacustrine carbon cycle as illuminated by the waters and sediments of two hydrologically distinct headwater lakes in north-central Minnesota, USA	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH												The accumulation rates of CaCO3 and organic carbon (OC) in lake sediments are delicately balanced between production in the epilimnion and destruction in the hypolimnion. The cycling of these two forms of carbon makes a "carbon pump" that greatly affects the biogeochemical cycles of other elements. To further understand these biogeochemical dynamics, the lakes, streams, and wetlands of the Shingobee River headwater area of north-central Minnesota have been subjected to intensive hydrologic and biogeochemical studies. Williams Lake, situated close to the highest point in the regional flow system, is hydrologically closed, with no surface inlet or outlet, and ground water and precipitation as the only sources of water. Shingobee Lake, situated at the lowest point in the regional flow system, has the Shingobee River as an inlet and outlet. The surface waters of both lakes are oversaturated, and the bottom waters undersaturated, with respect to CaCO3 during the summer. The small amount of CaCO3 that is precipitated in the epilimnion of Williams Lake during the summer is dissolved in the undersaturated hypolimnion and sediments with the result that no CaCO3 is incorporated into the profundal surface sediments. Because of the high phytoplankton productivity of Shingobee Lake, sufficient CaCO3 is produced in the epilimnion that large amounts survive the corrosive hypolimnion and sediments, and an average of 46 wt. % accumulates in surface sediments. Another consequence of higher phytoplankton productivity in Shingobee Lake is that the hypolimnion becomes oxygen deficient within a month after overturn in both the spring and fall. Because of reducing conditions that develop in the hypolimnion of Shingobee Lake, high concentrations of dissolved Fe and Mn accumulate there during summer stratification. Precipitation of Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides during periods of fall and spring overturn results in high concentrations of Fe and Mn in surface sediments. In Williams Lake, high concentrations of Fe and Mn do not build up in the hypolimnion. The concentration of CaCO3 is about 80 wt. % in lower Holocene sediments of both lakes. The lower Holocene sediments in both lakes also contain high concentrations of Fe and Mn, and the lower Holocene sediments of Shingobee are laminated. The waters of both lakes had identical values of delta(13)C and delta(18)O during the early Holocene, but the waters of Williams Lake "evolved" during the early Holocene, increasing about 10parts per thousand in both delta(13)C and delta(18)O. Deposits of lacustrine marl occur as much as seven meters above the present elevation of Williams Lake, the highest of the two lakes. Taken together, these observations suggest that the lakes were once connected to form a larger lake called Lake Willobee with a hypolimnion that was anoxic, at least seasonally.

J	Cyr, H				Cyr, Helene			Temperature variability in shallow littoral sediments of Lake Opeongo (Canada)	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Near-shore sediments support the most productive and diverse biological communities in lakes and are the sites of intense biogeochemical activity. Understanding what drives temperature and short-term temperature variability in near-shore sediments is important because benthic organisms and processes are temperature-dependent. I compared sediment and near-bottom water temperatures throughout the growing season (May-September) at 5 shallow near-shore sites in Lake Opeongo (Ontario, Canada). These sampling sites were more or less exposed to hydrodynamic forces and had different sediment characteristics but were not influenced by groundwater flow. The sediments were cooler than the overlying water column, especially in spring. Sediment temperature tracked water temperature and, therefore, was variable over short time scales (h-d). Temperature changes in near-shore sediments were smaller and slightly delayed compared to those in the overlying water. Over a whole season, temperature variability measured 5 cm below the sediment surface was, on average, 40 to 60% lower than that observed in the overlying water. The reduction in temperature variability was related to sediment characteristics and differed seasonally. Thermal diffusivity of these near-shore lake sediments ranged over an order of magnitude (0.0006-0.007 cm(2)/s). Thermal diffusivity increased with decreasing sediment particle size and was lower in spring than in summer and autumn. Overall, these results suggest that wind-driven hydrodynamic forces, which determine the frequency and intensity of upwellings and drive water movements in the shallow parts of Lake Opeongo, also determine the spatial structure and temporal variability of near-shore sediment temperature.																			2161-9549	2161-9565				SEP	2012	31	3					895	907		10.1899/11-099.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1899/11-099.1													WOS:000309905100017

The climate-landcover relationships influencing stream temperature have not been comprehensively evaluated in Southeast Alaskan watersheds, many of which provide spawning and rearing habitat for five species of Pacific salmon. Thus, improving our understanding of current streamwater thermal regimes is critical to assess how stream temperatures across the region may be altered by ongoing climate change. We evaluated seasonal streamwater thermal regimes in forty-seven salmon-spawning watersheds in Southeast Alaska to assess the influence of watershed geomorphic and landscape characteristics on streamwater temperature and sensitivity to variation in air temperature. Stream temperatures were measured during the 2015 water year and analyzed for winter and summer seasons. Mean summer stream temperatures ranged from 4.0 degrees C-17.2 degrees C, while mean winter stream temperatures were less variable (0.5 degrees C-3.5 degrees C). Maximum weekly average temperatures ranged from 4.3 degrees C-21.5 degrees C. Regression and time-series analyses revealed that low gradient watersheds with higher lake coverage experienced warmer summer stream temperatures and were more sensitive to air temperature fluctuations compared to streams draining watersheds with high gradients. Winter mean stream temperatures were warmer in higher gradient watersheds with greater forest and lake coverage. These findings demonstrate that streamwater thermal regimes and sensitivity to air temperature are strongly moderated by watershed geomorphology and landcover, resulting in substantial thermal heterogeneity in streams across the complex terrain characterizing the coastal temperate rainforest of Southeast Alaska.

Modeling spatial and temporal variations in temperature and salinity during stratification and overturn in Dexter Pit Lake, Tuscarora, Nevada, USA	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												This paper examines the seasonal cycling of temperature and salinity in Dexter pit lake in and northern Nevada, and describes an approach for modeling the physical processes that operate in such systems. The pit lake contains about 596,200 m 3 of dilute, near neutral (pHs 6.7-9) water. Profiles of temperature, conductivity, and selected element concentrations were measured almost monthly during 1999 and 2000. In winter (January-March), the pit lake was covered with ice and bottom water was warmer (5.3 degrees C) with higher total dissolved solids (0.298 g/L) than overlying water (3.96 degrees C) and 0.241 g/L), suggesting inflow of warm (11.7 degrees C) groundwater with a higher conductivity than the lake (657 versus 126-383 mu S/cm). Seasonal surface inflow due to spring snowmelt resulted in lower conductivity in the surface water (232247 mu S/cm) relative to deeper water (315-318 mu S/cm). The pit lake was thermally stratified from late spring through early fall, and the water column turned over in late November (2000) or early December (1999). The pit lake is a mixture of inflowing surface water and groundwater that has subsequently been evapoconcentrated in the and environment. Linear relationships between conductivity and major and some minor (B, Li, Sr, and U) ions indicate conservative mixing for these elements. Similar changes in the elevations of the pit lake surface and nearby groundwater wells during the year suggest that the pit lake is a flow-through system. This observation and geochemical information were used to configure an one-dimensional hydrodynamics model (Dynamic Reservoir Simulation Model or DYRESM) that predicts seasonal changes in temperature and salinity based on the interplay of physical processes, including heating and cooling (solar insolation, long and short wave radiation, latent, and sensible heat), hydrologic flow (inflow and outflow by surface and ground water, pumping, evaporation, and precipitation), and transfers of momentum (wind stirring, convective overturn, shear, and eddy diffusion). Inputs to the model include the size and shape of the lake, daily meteorological data (short wave radiation, long wave radiation or cloud cover, air temperature, vapor pressure, wind speed, and rainfall), rates for water inputs and outputs, the composition of inflowing water, and initial profiles of temperature and salinity. Predicted temperature profiles, which are influenced by seasonal changes in the magnitude of solar radiation, are in good agreement with observations and show the development of a strong thermocline in the summer, erosion of the thermocline during early fall, and turnover in late fall. Predicted salinity profiles are in reasonable agreement with observations and are affected by the hydrologic balance, particularly inflow of surface and groundwater and, to a lesser degree, evaporation. Defining the hydrodynamics model for Dexter pit lake is the first step in using a coupled physical - biogeochemical model (Dynamic Reservoir Simulation Model-Computational Aquatic Ecosystem Dynamics Model or DYRESM-CAEDYM) to predict the behavior of non-conservative elements (e.g., dissolved O-2, Mn, and Fe) and their effect on water quality in this system.

J	Johnson, JH				Johnson, James H.			Habitat use by subyearling Chinook and coho salmon in Lake Ontario tributaries	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The habitat use of subyearling Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) was examined in three tributaries of Lake Ontario. A total of 1781 habitat observations were made on Chinook salmon (698) and coho salmon (1083). During both spring and fall, subyearling coho salmon used pool habitat with abundant cover. During spring, principal component analysis revealed that water depth was the most important variable governing subyearling Chinook salmon habitat use. Substrate materials used by Chinook salmon in the spring and coho salmon in the fall were significantly smaller than were present on average within the study reaches. When the two species occurred sympatrically during spring they exhibited similar habitat selection. Although the habitat used by coho salmon in Lake Ontario tributaries was consistent with observations of habitat use in their native range, higher water velocities were less important to Chinook salmon than has previously been reported.

This can affect crucial ecosystem services. Our study investigated constructed wetland optimisation regarding depth and water residence time (WRT) during different seasons to remedy dark water colour and high TOC concentrations, while retaining nitrogen removal. We conducted eleven-day experiments with deep-brown, shallow-brown and shallow-control treatments, in June and November 2023, using 18 small constructed wetlands at an experimental wetland area in southern Sweden. At the beginning of both experiments, the flow through the wetlands was halted and extracted peat was added to the brown treatments, to increase absorbance and TOC concentrations. Thereafter, changes in absorbance, TOC concentration and total nitrogen (TN) concentration were measured. A maximum TOC reduction of 25% was reached with a WRT of two days in summer and one day in autumn. A maximum absorbance reduction of 40% and 65% was reached with a WRT of one day in summer and two days in autumn, respectively. TN removal was not affected by TOC addition. We conclude that constructed wetlands increase water clarity and boost carbon degradation if their WRT, especially during summer, is sufficiently short. If WRT exceeds two to three days in summer, internal carbon production together with low oxygen levels and increased iron (Fe) mobilization, may instead increase downstream brownification. Our study shows that wetlands with a depth of 0.6 m and a short WRT of one to two days may mitigate the effects of brownification.

Carbon Dioxide and Methane Dynamics in a Small Boreal Lake During Winter and Spring Melt Events	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												In seasonally ice-covered lakes, carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emission at ice-off can account for a significant fraction of the annual budget. Yet knowledge of the mechanisms controlling below lake-ice carbon (C) dynamics and subsequent CO2 and CH4 emissions at ice-off is limited. To understand the control of below ice C dynamics, and C emissions in spring, we measured spatial variation in CO2, CH4, and dissolved inorganic and organic carbon from ice-on to ice-off, in a small boreal lake during a winter with sporadic melting events. Winter melt events were associated with decreased surface water DOC in the forest-dominated basin and increased surface water CH4 in the mire-dominated basin. At the whole-lake scale, CH4 accumulated below ice throughout the winter, whereas CO2 accumulation was greatest in early winter. Mass-balance estimates suggest that, in addition to the CO2 and CH4 accumulated duringwinter, external inputs of CO2 and CH4 and internal processing during ice-melt could represent significant sources of C gas emissions during ice-off. Moreover, internal processing of CO2 and CH4 worked in opposition, with production of CO2 and oxidation of CH4 dominating at ice-off. These findings have important implications for how small boreal lakes will respond to warmer winters in the future; increased winter melt events will likely increase external inputs below ice and thus alter the extent and timing of CO2 and CH4 emissions to the atmosphere at ice-off. Plain Language Summary Many lakes are ice-covered for a portion of the year, where ice serves as a barrier to the atmosphere, trapping greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide and methane. At ice-off, these greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere. Yet due to difficulties associated with sampling ice-covered lakes, there is limited information about the factors that contribute to carbon dioxide and methane release at ice-off. Moreover, projected warmer winters, with increased precipitation as rain and reduced duration of ice cover, suggest that the contributing factors may change in the future. To gain insight into greenhouse gas dynamics in ice-covered lakes, we measured carbon dioxide and methane from ice-on to ice-off in a small boreal lake during a winter with sporadic melting events. We show that winter melt events alter carbon inputs below ice with implications for the timing and type of greenhouse gases released at ice-off. Our study brings new insight to greenhouse gas dynamics in ice-covered lakes and highlights challenges in understanding the implications of changing ice-cover patterns as the climate warms.					; Klaus, Marcus/AAL-1818-2021; Laudon, Hjalmar/J-3074-2013; Sponseller, Ryan/ABI-7338-2020	Karlsson, Jan/0000-0001-5730-0694; Klaus, Marcus/0000-0003-0747-3524; Laudon, Hjalmar/0000-0001-6058-1466; 													2169-8953	2169-8961				AUG	2018	123	8					2527	2540		10.1029/2018JG004622	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JG004622													WOS:000445731100016

Differences were found in colonization process between two fishponds, two seasons and between two sites at each fishpond (central part, fishpond shore). Oligotrophic fishpond U trech kratkych can be characterized by better light conditions and lower temperatures. While equal vertical distribution of periphytic, algae was observed at oligotrophic site, their relative cover decreased continuously in spring and strongly in summer with the increasing depth at eutrophic site. Oligotrophic fishpond can be characterized by very slow colonization rate and increasing abundance of Chrysophyceae. On the other hand Cyanobacteria were more frequent in eutrophic fishpond where periphyton displayed high colonization rate. Diatom species richness was the highest at oligotrophic site during spring experiments. The sites near the fishpond shore compared to sites in the central part of the fishpond can be characterized by higher rate of colonization, higher periphyton relative cover, lower proportion of Chrysophyceae and higher proportions of diatoms and cyanophytes indicating probably higher trophic level.

In light of recent reductions in phosphorus loading to the lake, we examined long-term monitoring data to determine if this trend might be reversing. Spring total phosphorus concentrations, although highly variable, declined approximately 1 mug.L-1 throughout the lake between 1983 and 2000. Spring soluble silica concentrations, an indicator of total in-lake reserves, increased from 1.1 to 1.6 mg.L-1 during this period. Summer epilimnetic silica concentrations in the southern basin were at apparently limiting levels of approximately 0.15 mg.L-1 until 1991 and then increased sharply. A similar trend was seen in the northern basin. Summer diatom populations increased in both basins after 1991, and ordination analyses suggest that the species composition of both spring and summer communities has responded to these silica increases. These results document for the first time a reversal of the silica depletion sequence and provide the most compelling evidence to date that phosphorus load reductions are having an impact on the Lake Michigan ecosystem.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				OCT	2002	59	10					1639	1647		10.1139/F02-132	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F02-132													WOS:000179393400007

During the dry (fall/winter) and rainy (spring/summer) seasons, we monitored fifteen limnological variables (water temperature, atmospheric precipitation, total carbon, organic carbon, inorganic carbon, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, coefficient of vertical light extinction, organic nitrogen, NH4+, free CO2, bicarbonate, total phosphorus, total suspended solids and pH. Except for nutrients (total phosphorus, NH4+ and organic nitrogen), dissolved oxygen, inorganic carbon and free CO2, the limnological variables differed between the dry and rainy seasons, where the water quality was influenced by the flood pulse. The NP rates of E. najas were significantly higher (p = 0.023) in the dry season. A marked difference was also observed for NP of U. breviscapa growing in dry and rainy seasons (p = 0.0135). The NP of E. najas and U. breviscapa during the rainy season was different from the dry season (p = 0.001). No significant differences in the NP between the two species were registered during the dry season. The hydrological regime changed the water chemistry and clearly affected the yield of NP of E. najas and U. breviscapa, although these macrophytes were influenced differently by the seasonal changes of physical and chemical variables. The higher NP of U. breviscapa compared to that of E. najas was related to the lower requirement of underwater radiation in photosynthesis than to E. najas. Moreover, the low availability of ions in the water column associated with lower temperatures in the dry season contributed to the decrease in NP of U. breviscapa during this period.						da Cunha Santino, Marcela Bianchessi/0000-0001-6048-0745; Bianchini Junior, Irineu/0000-0002-9121-3794													0100-8404	1806-9959				SEP	2022	45	3					1129	1138		10.1007/s40415-022-00828-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40415-022-00828-x		AUG 2022											WOS:000843065800001

Given the spring warming observed during the last decades, and its impact on snowmelt and hydrological processes, searching for spring climate proxies is receiving increasing attention. Tree-ring anatomical features and intra-annual widths were used to reconstruct the regional March to May mean air temperature from 1770 to 2016 in eastern boreal Canada. Nested principal component regressions calibrated on 116 years of gridded temperature data were developed from one Fraxinus nigra and 10 Pinus banksiana sites. The reconstruction indicated three distinct phases in spring temperature variability since 1770. Ample phases of multi-decadal warm and cold springs persisted until the end of the Little Ice Age (1850-1870 CE) and were gradually replaced since the 1940s by decadal to interannual variability associated with an increase in the frequency and magnitude of warm springs. Significant correlations with other paleotemperature records, gridded snow cover extent and runoff support that historical high flooding were associated with late, cold springs with heavy snow cover. Most of the high magnitude spring floods reconstructed for the nearby Harricana River also coincided with the lowest reconstructed spring temperature per decade. However, the last 40 years of observed and reconstructed mean spring temperature showed a reduction in the number of extreme cold springs contrasting with the last few decades of extreme flooding in the eastern Canadian boreal region. This result indicates that warmer late spring mean temperatures on average may contribute, among other factors, to advance the spring break-up and to likely shift the contribution of snow to rain in spring flooding processes.

Movements and habitat use of loons for assessment of conservation buffer zones in the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												Oil and gas development in the Arctic Coastal Plain, Alaska, may pose threats to wildlife. Management guidelines within the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska dictate buffer zones for coastal wildlife habitat and for breeding and foraging sites of yellow-billed loons (YBLOs; Gavia adamsii), a species of conservation concern. However, few data exist to assess the value of these buffer zones for YBLOs or for sympatrically breeding red-throated loons (RTLOs; G. stellata) and Pacific loons (PALOs; G. pacifica). We evaluated movements of these loons on the Arctic Coastal Plain to understand: 1) seasonal timing; 2) marine habitat use; and 3) spatial characteristics of breeding home ranges. We then used those findings to evaluate current management strategies in the context of loon biology. Compared to RTLOs and PALOs, YBLOs nested on larger lakes, stayed on them longer, had larger home ranges, but less frequently used the marine environment in summer. During autumn, YBLOs and PALOs were located farther from shore than during spring or summer, whereas RTLOs used the marine environment similarly during all three seasons. Management buffers established for YBLO nesting areas corresponded well with nest site space use of all three species, suggesting cross-taxa applicability of current management guidelines for nesting habitat. However, the majority of loon locations on the Arctic Coastal Plain were outside of coastal buffer zones established to protect fish and wildlife habitat within the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. These findings can inform assessment of conservation buffer zones to mitigate anthropogenic disturbance to loons in Alaska. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Sexual and seasonal variations of mercury in smallmouth bass	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												We assessed sexual and seasonal variations of total mercury in the muscle tissue of smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) in the South Fork of the Shenandoah River, Virginia. The average concentration of total mercury in the muscle tissue of bass sampled was 0.79 mu g/g wet weight and ranged from 0.30 to 1.38 mu g/g. There were significant positive relationships between the mercury level in muscle tissue and the length, weight, and age of bass sampled. Mean concentrations of total mercury differed significantly between sexes following adjustment for length and weight and were 20% higher in females than males. Differences among seasons were nearly significant after adjustment for length and were 14 and 21% higher during spring than summer and fall following adjustment for length and weight.

Meteorological patterns at PLNWR are such that some portion of the refuge is downwind of the poultry facility 52%, 66%, 57%, and 50% of time during winter, spring, summer, and fall, respectively. Air concentrations and dry deposition rates are highest in the northeasterly direction from the facility, consistent with prevailing wind patterns. Dry deposition rates along the axis of highest concentrations are 10.1 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) at the refuge boundary closest to the facility, decreasing to 5.4 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) 1.5 km further downwind and continuing to decrease non-linearly to a deposition rate of 1.4 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) 8-10 km downwind. Approximately 10% of the refuge model domain receives >= 3.0 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) as dry NH3 deposition. Depending on the definition of the background air concentration, annual nitrogen loading to the refuge from background NH3 dry deposition and NH3 dry deposition associated with elevated concentrations downwind of the facility is between 41% and 79% higher than background dry NH3 deposition alone. Relative to the total N deposition budget for the refuge, which includes all nitrogen compounds, total background N deposition plus NH3 dry deposition associated with elevated concentrations downwind of the facility is, correspondingly, 6-10% greater than background total N deposition alone. From a process standpoint, predicted fluxes are most sensitive to uncertainty in the parameterization of the cuticular resistance.

Both the numbers and volume of individual species were enumerated based on cell counts with an inverted microscope. A succession similar to algal succession in the local lakes occurred. The diatoms were dominant during the spring and fall and blue-gree algae were dominant during the summer. The algal concentrations have increased up to 40-fold the concentrations of the 1920''s, since the installation of locks and dams. The maximum freshweight standing crop was 4 mg .cntdot. 1-1 in 1928 (Reinhard 1931), 13 mg .cntdot. 1-1 in 1975, a wetyear, and 47 mg .cntdot. 1-1 in 1976, a relatively dry year with minimal current discharge. The diatoms varied from 36-99%, the blue-green algae from 0-44% and the cryptomonads from 0-50% of the total standing crop. The green algae were always present but never above 21% of the biomass. The dominant diatoms in recent years were centric-Strephanodiscus and Cyclotella spp. (maximum 50,000 ml-1). The dominant blue-green algae were Aphanizomenon-flos-aquae (L.) Ralfs ex Born. et Flahault and Oscillatoria agardhii Gomont (maximum 800 ml-1). These algal species are also present in local lakes. Shannon diversity values indicated greatest diversity of algae during the summer months.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1981	83	2					295	301		10.1007/BF00008280	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008280													WOS:A1981ME24600015

Particulate and vapor phase PAHs in ambient air and particulate and dissolved phases in rain samples were collected and analyzed. More than 95% of atmospheric PAHs were in the vapor phase and about 73% of PAHs in the rain were in the dissolved phase. Phenanthrene and napthalene were the dominant compounds in air vapor and rain dissolved phases, respectively, while 5 and 6 ring PAH were predominant in the particulate phase of both air and rain samples. Total PAH concentrations ranged from 4 to 161 ng m(-3) in air samples and from 50 to 312 ng l(-1) in rain samples. Temporal variability in total PAH air concentrations were observed. with lower concentrations in the spring and fall (4-34 ng m (-3)) compared to the summer and winter (37-161 ng m(-3)). PAHs in the air near Galveston Bay are derived from both combustion and petroleum vaporization. Gas exchange from the atmosphere to the surface water is estimated to be the major deposition process for PAHs (1211 mug m(-2) yr(-1)), relative to wet deposition (130 mug m(-1) yr(-1)) and dry deposition (99 mug m(-1) yr(-1)). Annual deposition of PAHs directly to Galveston Bay from the atmosphere is estimated as 2 t yr(-1). (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In field experiments we compared growth rates of dreissenids on live specimens of the freshwater bivalve Anodonta cygnea to growth rates of dreissenids on stones. Dreissena density in the study lake was about 1000 m(-2) in most places, Anodonta density approximately 1 m(-2) and about 50% of the Anodonta were infested with 10-30 Dreissena. In summer/autumn small dreissenids generally grew faster on live Anodonta than on stones. Similar trends were observed for spring, but differences of growth increments between dreissenids on live Anodonta and stones were usually not significant. Dreissenids settled down or moved towards the ingestion/egestion siphons of Anodonta and ingestion siphons of dreissenids were directed towards siphons of Anodonta. These results suggest that dreissenids can use the food provided by the filter current of the large Anodonta.																			1434-2944	1522-2632					2006	91	2					113	121		10.1002/iroh.200510834	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.200510834													WOS:000237896500001

A simple thermodynamic model verified that the current climatic conditions in the study area allow sustainable palsa development. A ground penetrating radar (GPR) survey of the palsa under both winter and summer conditions revealed its internal structure and the size of its frozen core. GPR imaging in summer detected the upper peat/core boundary, and imaging in winter detected a deep reflector that probably represents the lower core boundary. This indicates that only a combined summer and winter GPR survey completely reveals the lateral and vertical extent of the frozen core of the palsa. The core underlies the active layer at a depth of similar to 0.6m and extends to about 4m depth. Its lateral extent is similar to 15m x similar to 30m. The presence of the frozen core could also be traced as minima in surface temperature and ground conductivity measurements. These field methods and thermodynamic models can be utilised in studies of climate impact on Arctic wetlands.

Water and surface sediment samples were collected at 35 sampling sites in January 2014 (winter) and July 2015 (summer). The physicochemical characterization showed that there were obvious changes in the trophic status and eutrophic index of five lake regions, which was mainly due to the difference of organic matter source. Based on the analysis of aquatic environmental characteristics, the organic nitrogen or nitrate nitrogen was the main storing form in the overlying water of five lake regions. In addition, nitrate nitrogen in pore water was lower than in overlying water, while ammonia nitrogen in pore water was higher than in overlying water. According to the DGGE profiles, temporal and spatial variations of bacterial community were apparent. Bacterial diversity was higher in summer than in winter and increased with the decrease in the lake region trophic status. The dendrogram of the bacterial community similarities revealed that samples were almost all grouped into two defined clusters (summer and winter), which indicated that season rather than region was the dominant factor. Canonical correspondence analysis demonstrated that ammonia nitrogen and nitrate-nitrite nitrogen in the sediment and pore water, organic matter and temperature significantly influenced the sediment bacterial community in the five lake regions.

J	Kuczynska-Kippen, N				Kuczynska-Kippen, Natalia			Habitat choice in rotifera communities of three shallow lakes: impact of macrophyte substratum and season	HYDROBIOLOGIA					11th International Rotifer Symposium	MAR 11-18, 2006	Natl Autonomous Univ Mexico, Mexico City, MEXICO	Autonomous Metropolitan Univ, Unit Xochimilco	Natl Autonomous Univ Mexico			The distribution of rotifer communities between emergent (Typha angustifolia) and submerged (Chara tomentosa) vegetation and a comparatively open water zone were compared during the spring, summer and autumn seasons at three macrophyte-dominated lakes. This survey identified 107 rotifera species of which 58% of the taxonomical structure was common for the three examined lakes. Stoneworts with a more complicated spatial and morphological structure (having a much longer stem length than the narrow leaf cattail), supported higher rotifer densities. The stem length appeared to be the best predictor of all the macrophyte parameters and pH and chlorophyll a for the chemical variables, for explaining the variation of rotifer densities using the stepwise multiple forward regressions. The distribution of pelagic species did not differ between particular sites, which may have reflected the behavioural requirements of those rotifers. Some of them remained in the open water zone while others seeking an anti-predator refuge, gathered within macrophyte stands during the daytime. Moreover, there were nine Chara-associated species recorded and only one Typha-associated species was noted. The similarity of rotifer communities was most strongly influenced by particular habitat and season.

J	Song, XC; Jing, L				Song, Xiaocheng; Jing, Liu			Annual Observations of Climatic Impacts in the Songhua River Basin, China	ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY												Heat fluxes have been recognized as determinant regarding the river effect on microclimate. The relationship between rivers and the atmosphere is particularly significant for heat fluxes and varies with the meteorology and hydrology. In this study, based on annual observation data from the Songhua River Basin (Harbin, China), a regression and a stochastic model were used to analyze the relationship of the atmosphere-river daily maximum temperatures and evaluate the heat fluxes. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the river temperature was 2.21 degrees C with the regression method, improving to 0.83 degrees C with the stochastic model. The net shortwave radiation flux was the dominant heat gain component, while the latent heat flux accounted for the main heat loss. The sensible heat flux represented the smallest contribution. The river thermal effect in summer mainly resulted from the latent heat exchange, while the effect of the sensible heat exchange tended to be stronger in spring and autumn.																			1687-9309	1687-9317					2015	2015								138436	10.1155/2015/138436	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2015/138436													WOS:000367263800001
J	Carline, RF				Carline, Robert F.			Regulation of an unexploited brown trout population in Spruce creek, Pennsylvania	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The purpose of this paper is to describe the annual variations in the density of an unexploited population of lotic brown trout Salmo trutta that has been censused annually for 19 years and to explore the importance of density-independent and density-dependent processes in regulating population size. Brown trout density and indices of stream discharge and water temperature were related to annual variations in natural mortality, recruitment, and growth. Annual mortality of age-1 and older (age-1+) brown trout ranged from 0.30 to 0.75 and was best explained by discharge during spring and by brown trout density. Recruitment to age I varied fivefold. Density of age-1 brown trout was inversely related to spawner density and positively related to discharge during the fall spawning period. The median length of age-1 brown trout was positively related to discharge during summer and fall. Relative weight was inversely related to the density of age-2+ brown trout. The interactive effects of discharge and brown trout density accounted for most of the annual variation in mortality. recruitment, and growth during the first year of life. Annual trends in the abundance of age-1+ brown trout were largely dictated by natural mortality.																			0002-8487					JUL	2006	135	4					943	954		10.1577/T05-028.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T05-028.1													WOS:000240325200009

Bacterioplankton Community as a Biological Element for Reservoirs Water Quality Assessment	WATER												The Water Framework Directive (WFD) is used to evaluate the water quality of aquatic ecosystems. Phytoplankton is the only biological element considered in the reservoirs water quality assessment. In this study, we aimed to assess the use of the bacterioplankton community as an indicator of water quality, using a culture-independent assay (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, DGGE). Four Portuguese reservoirs (Miranda, Pocinho, Aguieira and Alqueva) were analysed in four periods (autumn 2018, spring and autumn 2019, and spring 2020). Bacterial total abundance had similar values for Miranda, Pocinho and Aguieira, and generally lower values for Alqueva. Diversity and richness values did not show a clear trend. Negative correlations were observed between some nutrients and the bacterial community. Overall, members of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, Nitrospirae and Proteobacteria were identified in all sampling sites. In Alqueva, no spatial, temporal or water body quality relationships with bacterial community were observed, which may be due to its higher size, low water velocity rate and higher residence times. However, in Miranda, Pocinho and Aguieira, a strong spatial and temporal bacterial community dynamic was observed. Furthermore, the presence of some species (e.g., Acinetobacter sp.) may reflect the poor water quality that was not detected by the WFD approach.

J	Encina, L; GranadoLorencio, C				Encina, L; GranadoLorencio, C			Seasonal changes in condition, nutrition, gonad maturation and energy content in barbel, Barbus sclateri, inhabiting a fluctuating river	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												The objective of this study was to investigate the seasonal cycle of condition, nutrition and gonad development, as well as the magnitude of seasonal variations in energy content of somatic and gonad tissues in juveniles, males and females of Sclater's barbel, Barbus sclateri, from the upper Guadalete River (south Spain). The influence of reproductive cycle on somatic changes was also investigated and discussed. Measurements of condition factor (K), somatic index (SI). gonadosomatic index (GSI) and somatic and gonad energy content (J g(-1) dw) were made in individual specimens taken from the Guadalete River monthly for 12 months. This freshwater ecosystem is characterised by strong seasonal fluctuations in water and flow level, temperature and food supply. It was found that in general juveniles, males and females of barbel exhibited a similar condition, nutrition and somatic energy cycle throughout the year, with the highest values in spring and the lowest in summer. Depletion of K, SI and somatic energy storage from spring until mid-summer seems to be associated with high metabolic demands during this period, and in adult fish also with spawning-related activity. The gonad index and energy content of the gonad were the highest in April and the lowest in summer for both sexes. Spawning took place during late spring - early summer, with fish quiescent by mid summer. The energy required for ovarian development (3970 J g(-1) dw) was greater than the one for testes development (2763 J g(-1) dw). Data on gonad energy content indicated a period (March to April) of intense energy accumulation (64% males and 37% females) which was related to the decline in the average somatic energy content in males and females. The somatic energy content was linearly related to K and SI. In the same way, GSI correlated positively with gonad energy. Linear trends were found between somatic parameters (K, SI and energy content) and gonad parameters (GSI and energy content).					; Encina Encina, Lourdes/JXM-2169-2024	Encina Encina, Maria Lourdes/0000-0002-8218-3327; Granado Lorencio, Carlos Antonio/0000-0002-3322-4276; 													0378-1909					SEP	1997	50	1					75	84		10.1023/A:1007381414397	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1007381414397													WOS:A1997XW48700008

Initially, the hypolimnetic increase was attributed solely to redox-controlled release of Hg from bottom sediments. However, subsequent depth profiles of Hg indicated that hypolimnetic Hg enrichment could also result from the downward transport and recycling of particulate Hg prior to incorporation in the sediments. Contrasts between Fe and Hg cycles in this lake reinforce this notion. Increases in hypolimnetic Fe were observed during both summer and winter O2 decreases. In contrast, hypolimnetic Hg concentrations declined during winter. In the ice-free season, the distribution of particulate mercury (Hg(p)) correlated with the distribution of chlorophyllous particulates in this lake, re-emphasizing the importance of biotic processes in controlling Hg cycling in the hypolimnion.

Data were collected over 2 yr, including daily measurements for 1 yr of N, P, Si and chlorophyll a in water leaving the lake. The hypolimnion remained stagnant in summer and inorganic-N peaked after lake overturn. NO3-N showed a marked seasonal cycle in concentration and total flux in water leaving the lake, which may not correspond with input rates from the catchment. Melosira granulata var. angustissima dominated the phytoplankton in summer, and Chlamydomonas spp. and Cyclotella spp. in winter. In summer, weekly cycles in algal abundance, which correlated inversely with NO3-N and DRP [dissolved reactive phosphorus] concentrations, were dictated by weekly flow cycles resulting from the requirements of hydro-electric power generation. Flow rate and temperature appear the dominant factors regulating phytoplankton abundance. Shorter residence time and probably slower growth rates in winter and longer residence and more rapid growth in summer interact critically. Phytoplankton production in river lakes such as Ohakuri with a brief water residence time is more appropriately represented by the mass flow of algal material through it than by the abundance of the standing stock. Summer phytoplankton biomass in Lake Ohakuri is equivalent only to a mildly eutrophic condition, but the amount generated and then lost from the lake is equivalent to production in a lake of much higher trophic status in a closed basin.																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1983	17	2					169	183		10.1080/00288330.1983.9515995	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1983.9515995													WOS:A1983QZ78000006

Sedimentary history, palynological record and inorganic geochemical indicators	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY					2nd International Congress of Limnogeology (ILIC 2)	MAY 25-28, 1999	UNIV WESTERN BRETAGNE, INST UNIV EUROPEAN MER, PLOUZANE, FRANCE		UNIV WESTERN BRETAGNE, INST UNIV EUROPEAN MER			Piston cores from Lake Steisslingen, a small hard water lake situated 20 kin west of Lake Constance and mainly supplied by submerged springs, reveal a record of the environmental history going back to 15 600 cal yr BP. From the Bolling to ca. 9800 cal yr BP the sediments are partly seasonally laminated. From then on up to the Middle Ages the lamination is mostly undisturbed providing a high resolution time scale by varve counting, a detailed pollen profile and 13 AMS C-14-analyses. All investigated sediment sections show evidence of exceptionally high sulphate concentrations in the lake water, which lead to the fixation of all reactive iron as pyrite. The high sulphur content can only be attributed to S-rich water supplied by the submerged springs, thus indicating the Miocene 'Obere Meeres Molasse' as the dominant aquifer. Since soil erosion is strongly reduced due to increased forest density in the Preboreal/Boreal, the submerged springs are the main nutrient source for the lake. Mixing or stable stratification of the waterbody mostly depends on nutrient availability and bioproductivity in the epilimnion. The controlling external factors are wind, and changes in water level and/or temperature. At the end of the Younger Dryas and during the Preboreal low water levels and precipitation rates are assumed. The water column mixing was regular, bioproductivity high, and high degradation activity of organic matter led to a redissolution of calcite. The hydrological separation of a northern shallow lake (Secried) probably fell into the period of this low lake level. Around 10 450-10 300 cal yr BP the lake level rose, but never again reached the former level. Between 10000 and 7200 cal yr BP, non-glacial varves are even found in shallower parts of the lake, indicating a stable anoxic monimolimnion with a rising chemocline. Bioproductivity was low. Wind protection provided by the now dense forestation and favourable climatic conditions (e.g. high summer temperatures and low winter temperatures) seem to be the responsible factors. Fluctuating human impact is identified from about 7400 cal yr BP until permanent settlement by the Alemanni about 1500 cal yr BP. Strong human influence is observed from 2000 cal yr BP onwards, when agricultural activity and clearing of the shoreline vegetation by man caused high soil erosion rates and thus eutrophication. At about 800 cal yr BP the recent hydrological conditions were established by implementing an artificial drain, thus lowering the lake level.

SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL WATER QUALITY VARIABILITY IN AQUATIC HABITATS OF A CULTIVATED FLOODPLAIN	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												The floodplains of lowland rivers contain diverse aquatic habitats that provide valuable ecosystem services but are perturbed when intensively cultivated. Hydrologic, water chemistry and biological (fish) conditions in five aquatic habitats along the Coldwater River, Mississippi, were measured for more than 4years: the river, two severed meanders that functioned as backwaters, a managed wetland and an ephemeral channel draining cultivated fields. Off-channel habitats were connected to downstream regions 0.10% to 32% of the dry season and 24% to 67% of the wet season. The median temperatures for the five monitored sites ranged from 18 degrees C to 23 degrees C, the median total solids concentration for all sites was 135mg L1, the median total phosphorus was 0.29mg L1 and the median total nitrogen was 1.56mg L1. Chemical and physical water quality displayed strong seasonal differences between the wet winter/spring and the dry summer/fall periods so that temporal variation consisted of gradual seasonal trends superimposed on strong diurnal variations. All off-channel habitats exhibited periods of hypoxia and temperatures >30 degrees C during the dry season. Between-site gradients of water and habitat quality were strongly coupled to water depth and runoff loading. The rehabilitation of one backwater by increasing water depth and diverting agricultural runoff was associated with improved water quality and fish species richness relative to an adjacent untreated backwater. The diversion of polluted runoff and the use of water control structures to maintain greater water depth were observed to be effective management tools, but the former reduces the water supply to habitats that tend to dry up and the latter reduces connectivity.

(Mel)			Geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol monitoring versus a combination of sensory and chemical analyses in drinking water odor evaluation	AQUA-WATER INFRASTRUCTURE ECOSYSTEMS AND SOCIETY												Odor occurrences in Summit Water Treatment Plant (SWTP) drinking water were evaluated by two methods. One method was the common practice of monitoring geosmin (GEO) and 2-methylisborneol (2-MIB) only. It led to the conclusion that the odor events primarily originated from Silverwood Lake (a water source for SWTP) and took place during late summer and mid-fall to early winter. The other method combined flavor profile analysis (FPA), gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and Sensory GC. FPA captured a recurring moldy odor, unlike the earthy/musty odor expected from GEO and 2-MIB. 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine (IPMP) was identified as its cause by GC/MS and Sensory GC. More importantly, IPMP and its moldy odor were mainly produced in Lytle Creek (the second water source for SWTP) from late fall to mid-winter. Thus, monitoring only GEO and 2-MIB led to incomplete understanding of the chemical causes as well as the spatial and temporal patterns of SWTP's odor events. The case study serves as a precaution against equating the presence of GEO and 2-MIB with the overall drinking water odor occurrences despite the popularity of the approach. Instead, a combination of FPA and, as needed, subsequent GC/MS and Sensory GC is necessary for complete drinking water odor evaluations.

J	Moyer, AN; Moore, RD; Koppes, MN				Moyer, Alexis N.; Moore, R. D.; Koppes, Michele N.			Streamflow response to the rapid retreat of a lake-calving glacier	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												There has been increasing attention over the last decade to the potential effects of glacier retreat on downstream discharge and aquatic habitat. This study focused on streamflow variability downstream of Bridge Glacier in the southern Coast Mountains of BC between 1979 and 2014, prior to and during a period in which the glacier experienced enhanced calving and rapid retreat across a lake-filled basin. Here we combined empirical trend detection and a conceptual-parametric hydrological model to address the following hypotheses: (1) streamflow trends in late summer and early autumn should reflect the opposing influences of climatic warming (which would tend to increase unit-area meltwater production) and the reduction in glacier area (which would tend to reduce the total volume of meltwater generated), and (2) winter streamflow should increase because of displacement of lake water as ice flows past the grounding line and calves into the lake basin. In relation to the first hypothesis, we found no significant trends in monthly discharge during summer. However, applying regression analysis to account for air temperature and precipitation variations, weak but statistically significant negative trends were detected for August and melt season discharge. The HBV-EC model was applied using time-varying glacier cover, as derived from Landsat imagery. Relative to simulations based on constant glacier extent, model results indicated that glacier recession caused a decline in mean monthly streamflow of 9% in August and 11% in September. These declines in late-summer streamflow are consistent with the results from our empirical analysis. The second hypothesis is supported by the finding of positive trends for December, January, and February discharge. Despite the modelled declines in late-summer mean monthly streamflow, recorded discharge data exhibited neither positive nor negative trends during the melt season, suggesting that Bridge Glacier may currently be at or close to the point of peak water. Further analysis of the impact of lake-terminating glaciers on downstream discharge is needed to refine the peak water model.

However, little is known about the sources, migration and transformation of hydrochemical composition, and the driving mechanisms, in such systems. In this study, the hydrochemical characteristics and processes in the linked Yellow River-Hetao Irrigation District-Lake Ulansuhai system were studied, based on a comprehensive hydrochemical and stable isotope analysis of water samples collected during spring, summer, and autumn. The results showed that the water bodies in the system were weakly alkaline with a pH range of 8.05-8.49. The concentrations of hydrochemical ions showed an increasing trend in the water flow direction. Total dissolved solids (TDS) were less than 1000 mg/L (freshwater) in the Yellow River and the irrigation canals, and increased to more than 1800 mg/L (saltwater) in the drainage ditches and Lake Ulansuhai. The dominant hydrochemical types varied from SO4 center dot Cl-Ca center dot Mg and HCO3-Ca center dot Mg types in the Yellow River and the irrigation canals to Cl-Na type in the drainage ditches and Lake Ulansuhai. The ion concentrations in the Yellow River, the irrigation canals, and the drainage ditches were highest during summer, while ion concentrations in Lake Ulansuhai were highest during spring. The hydrochemistry of the Yellow River and the irrigation canals was mainly affected by rock weathering, while evaporation was the principal controlling factor in the drainage ditches and Lake Ulansuhai. Water-rock interactions including the dissolution of evaporites and silicates, the precipitation of carbonates, and cation exchange were the main sources of hydrochemical compositions in this system. Anthropogenic inputs had a low impact on the hydro-chemistry. Therefore, greater attention should be paid in future to hydrochemical variations, especially salt ions, in the management of linked river-irrigation-lake system water resources.

J	Atekwana, EA; Krishnamurthy, RV				Atekwana, EA; Krishnamurthy, RV			Seasonal variations of dissolved inorganic carbon and δ13C of surface waters:: application of a modified gas evolution technique	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Seasonal concentrations and delta(13)C of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in a river-tributary system in Kalamazoo, southwest Michigan, USA, have been measured using a modified gas evolution technique. The technique makes use of evacuated glass septum tubes pre-loaded with phosphoric acid and a magnetic stir bar. Water samples are injected into these septum tubes in the field, which eliminates problems associated with CO2 loss/gain during sample storage and transfer to the vacuum line during DIC extraction. Using this technique, a precision of 1% and 0.1 parts per thousand can be achieved for DIC concentrations and delta(13)C(DIC) measurements, respectively. As this technique provides reliable measurements of DIC concentrations and carbon isotope ratios, it was used to evaluate the processes that control DIC in the river-tributary system. Results of DIC concentration and delta(13)C(DIC) measurements of water samples from the river-tributary system show that the DIC pool is mostly dominated by groundwater. The DIC concentrations and delta(13)C(DIC) are within the ranges measured for the most isotopically evolved groundwater in this region. Seasonal variations superimposed on the baseline values are attributed to secondary processes such as CO2 invasion from the atmosphere, enhanced recharge from lakes and biological activities of photosynthesis, respiration, and decay. With the onset of spring, there is a concurrent increase in the DIC concentration and delta(13)C(DIC) Of these streams. A simultaneous increase in concentration and C-13 enrichment of the riverine DIC pool is consistent with CO2 invasion and recharge from lakes. During the summer, biological activity is the predominant control on shifts in the DIC pool. Although photosynthesis, respiration and decay occur during this time, decreases in the DIC concentration and increases in the delta(13)C(DIC) indicates CO2 removal from the pool by photosynthesis. In the late summer-early fall, photosynthesis declines and respiration and decay cause an increase in the DIC concentration and a decreases in the delta(13)C(DIC). When biological activity decreases significantly during the late fall and winter months, the river and most of its tributaries approach a baseline DIC concentration and delta(13)C(DIC) Similar to that of isotopically fully evolved groundwater in the Kalamazoo area. Although this holds true for tributaries and the main river, the timing and magnitude of shifts from background DIC is different for individual streams. The magnitude of shifts in the DIC concentration and delta(13)C(DIC) is most pronounced in tributary streams because of the short residence time of water in these streams. This study shows that DIC concentration and delta(13)C(DIC) measurements can be successfully used to evaluate the timing and dominance of the major processes that influence DIC in a riverine system.

J	Harrison, SSC; Hildrew, AG				Harrison, SSC; Hildrew, AG			Epilithic communities and habitat heterogeneity in a lake littoral	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												1. Stones along the shore of a eutrophic English lake in summer have one of two epilithic assemblages. Many stones are covered with dense filaments of the macro-alga Cladophora glomerata and the tubes of detritivorous/browsing chironomids, Others have few algal filaments and are dominated by gallery-building caddis larvae (Tinodes waeneri). These communities are patchily distributed along the shore, macro-algae dominating in areas away from riparian trees and on tall, rather than flat stones. The origins of this dichotomy were assessed in a field experiment that provided new surfaces for colonization, according to a planned schedule in time and space. 2. To examine temporal heterogeneity, artificial substrata (clay tiles) were introduced into the littoral each month from February to October 1995 and harvested on several occasions from 1 to 9 months later. 'Large' scale spatial heterogeneity was investigated by introducing tiles into three locations along the shore that differed with respect to shoreline trees. At a smaller scale, tiles were introduced with varying degrees of accessibility to dispersing insect larvae by placing them directly on the lake bed, above the bed on platforms, or as stacks of several tiles (to mimic tall stones). 3. There was a distinct temporal separation in the colonization of invertebrates, with tube-building chironomid larvae dominating substrata in spring, before being displaced by Tinodes in summer. A strong temporal pattern in algal productivity, with spring and autumn maxima and a summer minimum, was attributable to nutrient limitation in summer. 4. In summer, there was a strong spatial separation of organisms at large and small scales. In patches under or near trees, chironomids and Cladophora were replaced by Tinodes larvae. Cladophora remained abundant away from trees, where tiles were never colonized by the crawling Tinodes larvae, originating from egg masses laid beneath trees. Areas distant from oviposition sites may act as a grazing refugium for Cladophora and its associated chironomids. At a smaller scale, the inability of Tinodes to colonize the upper surfaces of tall stones also created spatial refugia for algae and chironomids, even within patches of generally high Tinodes density. 5. There was also evidence of a temporal grazing refugium for Cladophora. Cladophora filaments which colonized tiles introduced in April subsequently resisted grazing by Tinodes newly recruiting in June. Filaments colonizing tiles introduced before or after April, however, were vulnerable to Tinodes. The precise mechanism for this is unclear, however. 6. Spatiotemporal patterns in the epilithic community were caused by the external factors of a seasonally fluctuating nutrient supply and a patchy riparian strip of trees and the intrinsic factors of habitat choice, and the life history phenology of the organisms concerned. Our results infer strong direct biotic interactions among species( particularly grazing of Cladophora by Tinodes), indirect interactions between Tinodes and several chironomids via habitat engineering (i.e. the removal of Cladophora as chironomid habitat) and the crucial role of spatiotemporal heterogeneity in decoupling those interactions.																			0021-8790					JUL	2001	70	4					692	707		10.1046/j.1365-2656.2001.00529.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2656.2001.00529.x													WOS:000170005700016

The aim of this research was to describe and quantify the seasonal migration patterns and fine-scale movement profiles of Brachymystax lenok, a threatened, potadromous salmonid that inhabits the highly connected, boreal river basins of Siberia and northern Asia. During this study 21 mature individuals were monitored over a 15 month period in the upper Eroo River basin, Mongolia, using passive acoustic telemetry. Mean (+/- SD) B.lenok home ranges were 19.1 +/- 15.1km (median=11.5km), with maximum longitudinal movements detected > 45.3km. Two periods of increased movements were identified; the first in late summer/early autumn when 10 B.lenok moved into deeper, overwintering pools, with the second period occurring in late spring and early summer when nine B.lenok were detected entering the surrounding tributaries. Diel activity and depth typically increased during daylight hours followed by decreased activity or resting periods in shallower river sections at night. These results highlight the need to maintain a high level of river connectivity and adequate fishing season closures by implementing and enforcing an expansive spatiotemporal management plan that can better protect and recover the Mongolian B.lenok populations. Such measures should be transferable to other threatened, potadromous fish species residing throughout the world's boreal river basins.					; Büttner, Olaf/C-6306-2008; Borchardt, Dietrich/D-1729-2009; Karthe, Daniel/AAS-5562-2020; Buttner, Olaf/C-6306-2008	Karthe, Daniel/0000-0003-0288-0593; Kaus, Andrew/0000-0001-5042-3413; Borchardt, Dietrich/0000-0002-6074-2829; Buttner, Olaf/0000-0002-4332-5441													0906-6691	1600-0633				JUL	2018	27	3					752	766		10.1111/eff.12390	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12390													WOS:000434638800011

Seasonal variability in phytoplankton stable carbon isotope ratios and bacterial carbon sources in a shallow Dutch lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Ecosystem metabolism of lakes strongly depends on the relative importance of local vs. allochthonous carbon sources and on microbial food-web functioning and structure. Over the year ecosystem metabolism varies as a result of seasonal changes in environmental parameters such as nutrient levels, light, temperature, and variability in the food web. This is reflected in isotopic compositions of phytoplankton and bacteria. Here, we present the results of a 17-month study on carbon dynamics in two basins of Lake Naarden, The Netherlands. One basin was restored after anthropogenic eutrophication, whereas the other basin remained eutrophic. We analyzed natural stable carbon isotope abundances (C-13) of dissolved inorganic carbon, dissolved organic carbon and macrophytes, and combined these data with compound-specific C-13 analyses of phospholipid-derived fatty acids, produced by phytoplankton and bacteria. Isotopic fractionation (epsilon) between phytoplankton biomass and CO2(aq) was similar for diatoms and other eukaryotic phytoplankton, and differences between sampling sites were small. Highest epsilon values were observed in winter with values of 23.5 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand for eukaryotic phytoplankton and 13.6 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand for cyanobacteria. Lowest epsilon values were observed in summer: 10.5 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand for eukaryotic phytoplankton and 2.7 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand for cyanobacteria. The annual range in C-13(bact) was between 6.9 parts per thousand and 8.2 parts per thousand for the restored and eutrophic basin, respectively, while this range was between 11.6 parts per thousand and 13.1 parts per thousand for phytoplankton in the restored and eutrophic basin, respectively. Correlations between C-13(phyto) and C-13(bact) were strong at both sites. During summer and fall, bacterial biomass derives mainly from locally produced organic matter, with minor allochthonous contributions. Conversely, during winter, bacterial dependence on allochthonous carbon was 39-77% at the restored site, and 17-46% at the eutrophic site.

Differences in tolerance of pondweeds and charophytes to vertebrate herbivores in a shallow Baltic estuary	AQUATIC BOTANY												It has been suggested that herbivorous waterfowl may be important in shaping aquatic plant communities in shallow wetlands. As such, a shift from canopy forming pondweeds to bottom-dwelling charophytes in a formerly turbid pondweed dominated lake has been partly attributed to waterfowl herbivory. Here we study the separate and combined effects of both belowground herbivory in spring by whooper swans and Bewick's swans, and grazing in summer by waterfowl and fish on the community composition in a shallow Baltic estuary during one year. The macrophyte community was dominated by charophytes (mainly Chara aspera) with Potamogeton pectinatus and Najas marina present as subdominants. Other species were rare. Both spring and summer herbivory had no effect on total plant biomass. However, P. pectinatus was more abundant in plots that were closed to spring and summer herbivores. N. marina was more abundant in grazed plots, whereas Chara spp. biomass remained unaffected. Probably belowground propagules of both C. aspera and P. pectinatus were consumed by swans but since C. aspera bulbils were numerous it may have compensated for the losses. P. pectinatus may not have fully recovered from foraging on tubers and aboveground biomass. Our results are in line with other studies in Chara dominated lakes, which found no effect of grazing on summer aboveground Chara biomass, whereas several studies report strong effects of herbivory in lakes dominated by P. pectinatus.

J	HAMILTON, DJ; ANKNEY, CD; BAILEY, RC				HAMILTON, DJ; ANKNEY, CD; BAILEY, RC			PREDATION OF ZEBRA MUSSELS BY DIVING DUCKS - AN EXCLOSURE STUDY	ECOLOGY												Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) are a novel and abundant potential food source for several species of diving ducks in the Great Lakes region. Using predator exclusion cages, behavioral observations, and analyses of duck gizzard contents, we examined the predator-prey relationship between zebra mussels and their duck predators during the fall migratory period in Lake Erie at Point Pelee, Ontario. Diving ducks feeding on zebra mussels in the area reduced mussel biomass by 57% during the period of heaviest feeding, but had no measurable impact on mussel numbers. Birds were size-selective predators, preferentially taking medium and large mussels over the more common small ones, thereby altering the size structure of the mussel population. Ducks were abundant at Point Pelee only during late fall, and differences between cages and control areas had disappeared by the following spring. Overall, ducks had little lasting impact on mussel populations, but mussel abundance may have determined duck concentration in the area. Duck staging populations were higher in 1990, when mussels were more abundant, than in 1991, when mussels were much scarcer. Effective predator control of zebra mussels in the portion of the Great Lakes region that freezes over winter is unlikely because diving ducks are unable to overwinter in the area. However, mussels have become an important food source for diving ducks, and temporary reductions of mussel density through predation are likely in areas where ducks feed during migratory periods. Similarly, in regions where ducks are resident through winter, greater and longer lasting effects may be observed.

At Goose Lake Prairie (GLP), Gaussian ordination of 49 vegetation stands, using plant cover data for 40 species, assigned stands x-vector values and ordered them along a soil moisture-nutrient gradient. Prairie dropseed cover data plotted over ordered stands yielded a significant Gaussian curve across a relatively narrow gradient segment. In contrast, colonization and spore abundance had significant negative linear correlations with stand x-vector values that decreased from the drier, low-nutrient portion of the gradient to the wetter, high-nutrient sector. Variation in spore abundance suggested that no VAM fungal species responded to environmental gradient conditions in a manner similar to that of prairie dropseed. The differential responses of host and VAM mycobionts across the gradient suggest that their respective success may be partially independently determined or limited by different parameters. Also, the generally ubiquitous VAM fungal distributions suggest that the host may be more sensitive to gradient conditions than its mycobiont associates. Colonization and spore abundances at GLP were significantly negatively correlated with available Ca and Mg, and pH. Spore abundance was significantly positively correlated with available K. Neither colonization nor spore abundance were significantly correlated with available P, total N, or organic matter. Seasonally, patterns of VAM colonization and rhizosphere spore abundance varied, having significant positive correlations at GLP and Weston Cemetary Prairie (WCP) in some seasons but not others. In general, colonization levels were highest in fall 1983 for GLP and fall 1984 for WCP. For 1984, increasing colonization was observed from spring (WCP) or summer (GLP) to fall.																			0002-9122	1537-2197				APR	1987	74	4					564	573		10.2307/2443836	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2443836													WOS:A1987G843300012

Weather variables as drivers of seasonal phosphorus dynamics in a shallow hypertrophic lake (Laguna Chascomus, Argentina)	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												We investigated the effect of weather and hydrological variables on the phosphorus concentration in a large, shallow lake, Laguna Chascomus. Total phosphorus (TP) concentrations were high (609.0 +/- 196.0 mu g L-1) and within the range typical of hypertrophic lakes. TP showed a bimodal seasonal pattern with maxima occurring near spring and fall equinoxes, and the minima around winter and summer solstices. The bulk of TP (> 80 %) corresponded to the particulate fraction (i.e., seston). We used data collected during the period 2005-2007 to develop regression models of particulate phosphorus (Ppart) vs. weather and hydrological variables, i.e., incident solar radiation (I 0), wind speed (W), mean depth (Z) and water temperature (T). The parameterized models were subsequently used to predict the Ppart concentrations for the 2008 dataset. For developing the first model we took the standard approach of regressing Ppart vs. the independent variables. An alternative to the standard approach was suggested by previous findings from an outdoor experiment demonstrating that increases in incident light resulted in higher seston concentrations, but higher light levels also resulted in lower sestonic P content (Ppart / seston). Thus, for developing the second model we regressed (i) the concentration of seston and (ii) the sestonic P content vs. weather variables, and subsequently calculated Ppart as the product of these two estimates. When confronted against data collected on 2008, the first model failed to explain any significant proportion of the total variance in Ppart (R-2 = 0.05, p = 0.28, n = 24), while the second model accounted for 32 % of the variance in Ppart (R-2 = 0.32, p = 0.004, n = 24). We suggest that the opposite seasonal trends of seston and Ppart / seston provide a plausible mechanism for explaining the bimodal seasonal pattern of TP observed in this hypertrophic shallow lake.

Seasonal Depth-Related Gradients in Virioplankton: Standing Stock and Relationships with Microbial Communities in Lake Pavin (France)	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												This study presents a depth-related survey of virioplankton abundance in Lake Pavin (Massif Central, France), in relation to the abundances of heterotrophic prokaryotes, picocyanobacteria (Pcy), autotrophic picoeukaryotes (Peu), and of autotrophic (ANF) and heterotrophic (HNF) nanoflagellates. The sampling strategy was designed to be representative of the physico-chemical gradients of the whole water column of the lake, and the seasonal variability as well. In mixolimnic surface waters, all communities were present and viral abundance peaked in summer and autumn. Viral abundance was significantly correlated (p < 0.001) with Pcy, Peu, and ANF, indicating that cyanophages and perhaps other phytoplankton viruses represent a significant pool of viral standing stocks in the mixolimnion of Lake Pavin. Microautotrophs were absent in the deep monimolimnic water masses, where viruses and heterotrophic prokaryotes exhibited highest seasonal abundances in summer and/or autumn and were significantly correlated (p < 0.001) to each other. This indicates that the anoxic monimolimnion of Lake Pavin is an exclusive habitat for viruses and heterotrophic prokaryotes. We conclude that in this habitat, host availability is prevalent over other factors (temperature, oxygen, nutrients, grazers) in favoring viral proliferation.					; Sime-Ngando, Télesphore/M-4134-2019; Robin, Agnes/C-5238-2015; Cauchie, Henry-Michel/K-8123-2014	Robin, Agnes/0000-0003-3044-2304; Cauchie, Henry-Michel/0000-0003-4780-6100; Sime-Ngando, Telesphore/0000-0002-7240-5803													0095-3628	1432-184X				NOV	2009	58	4					728	736		10.1007/s00248-009-9535-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-009-9535-7								19475444					WOS:000271461000005

The results showed that the vegetation coverage of the entire area remained at a medium level with average NDVI being 0.46 during 2000-2015. At a yearly scale, water was the key factor controlling the reed growth in Lake Baiyangdian. NDVI variations in each season had different water/energy driving factors. In spring, summer and autumn, vegetation growth was mainly affected by net radiation, air temperature and air temperature, respectively. Time-lags between NDVI and the meteorological parameters varied from parameters and seasons. Taken together, this research broadened our cognition about response characteristics of NDVI dynamics to water and energy variations through adding an important meteorological parameter (i.e., net radiation). With the rapid construction of XNA, it could be helpful for accurately understanding impacts of climate change on vegetation growth and be beneficial for effective ecosystem management in water shortage areas.					wang, xuan/JBJ-6948-2023; Li, Chunhui/AAV-2243-2021; Chen, Xiang/JUF-0248-2023	Zhang, Yunlong/0000-0003-1589-6981; Chunhui, Li/0000-0003-0067-4112													2045-2322					OCT 29	2018	8								15971	10.1038/s41598-018-33968-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-33968-w								30374106					WOS:000448589200047

During summer 2001, the intense water utilization of Lake Arancio reservoir reduced the water level significantly, which coincided with the formation of intense blooms formed by the microcystin (MC)-producing cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa. During summer 2003, Lake Arancio was continuously filled and the vertical stratification of the water column was maintained resulting in five to sixfold lower cell numbers of M. aeruginosa. For both years, a significant relationship between MC net production and Microcysytis cell growth was observed, implying that Microcystis cell numbers can be used to infer MC concentrations in water. Unexpectedly, dense blooms of the MC-producing cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens occurred during winter 2005/2006 in the reservoirs Lake Pozzillo, Prizzi, Nicoletti, and Garcia but have not been reported earlier. In this season, MC concentrations higher than those recorded in summer were measured, implying that monitoring of Mediterranean drinking water reservoirs needs to be intensified during winter, a season usually considered to be less prone to the formation of cyanobacterial blooms.

Reproductive Strategies and the Origin of Parapatric and Sympatric Forms of Arctic Charr Salvelinus alpinus (Salmonidae) in the System of Lakes Bol'shoe Leprindo and Maloe Leprindo (Northern Transbaikalia)	JOURNAL OF ICHTHYOLOGY												In the system of lakes Bol'shoe Leprindo and Maloe Leprindo (Lena basin, Transbaikalia), spawning of two isolated populations of the dwarf form of Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus was studied. The results supplemented with the data about the exterminated large form from these lakes, demonstrate a unique combination of sympatric and parapatric charr forms with autumn (large form), summer (dwarf form, Bol'shoe Leprindo) and first recorded in Russia winter-spring (dwarf form, Maloe Leprindo) spawning peaks. In both lakes, the dwarf form spawns in the profundal zone at silty bottom at the depth 25-58 m: in Bol'shoe Leprindo, from late June to October with peak in July-August when water temperature is 5-6 degrees C, in Maloe Leprindo from January to July, with peak in January-March when temperature is 2.5-3.0 degrees C. Eggs laid in July-August in Bol'shoe Leprindo develop for 3.0-3.5 months, eggs laid in January-March in Maloe Leprindo, for about 4.0-4.5 month; in both lakes they are actively consumed by burbot Lota lota. Due to smaller egg size the dwarf form has twice as high individual relative fecundity as the large form, which compensates for high egg mortality. It is supposed that the differences in spawning strategies were formed as the result of outcompeting of the dwarf form by the large form from the littoral to the profundal zone, where perennial low temperature favoured the prolongation and displacement of their spawning time. These differences determined reproductive isolation and genetic divergence between three charr populations.					; Alekseyev, Sergey/AAH-9405-2020; Matveev, Arcadii/AAA-5932-2022; Samusenok, Vitaliy/AAR-4762-2021	Alekseyev, Sergey/0000-0001-9726-9484; 													0032-9452	1555-6425				JUL	2019	59	4					527	544		10.1134/S0032945219040015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0032945219040015													WOS:000483669200006

Samples were analyzed for phosphorus- and nitrogen-based nutrients, and concentrations were examined for trends with catchment state, land use, and seasonality. Total phosphorus (TP) and phosphate concentrations were consistently higher during rain/melt events relative to baseflow. Nitrogen parameters, however, exhibited either concentrating behavior or little change in concentration across a range in flows (chemostasis) depending on the parameter and catchment. Despite differences in land use among the four watersheds, TP concentrations during rain/melt events did not vary among stations; however, spatial variability was observed for other parameters, especially nitrate which was elevated in watersheds on the north shore of the Harbour. Seasonal variability was generally not observed for TP concentrations, mirroring the lack of temporal trends for TSS. In contrast, elevated concentrations of nitrate and phosphate were observed during the fall and/or winter period, except in the primarily agricultural watershed where concentrations were elevated during the summer growing season. Highly elevated concentrations of ammonia and nitrate were observed in some watersheds during the unseasonably cold winter of 2010-2011 but not in the comparatively warm winter of 2011-2012. Implications of the study are discussed including the inferred potential impacts of climate change on nutrient dynamics given the strong contrasts in weather patterns observed between years, and exploration of the feasibility of mitigation measures given the data trends.

J	Alfonso, MB; Arias, AH; Piccolo, MC				Alfonso, Maria Belen; Arias, Andres Hugo; Piccolo, Maria Cintia			Microplastics integrating the zooplanktonic fraction in a saline lake of Argentina: influence of water management	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												This study address for the first time in Argentina and the South American continent the effect of water management on the presence of microplastics (MPs) in a shallow lake, assessing their contribution to the zooplankton fraction. Water samples were collected in the lake and its principal affluent, an irrigation channel, from winter 2018 to summer 2019 with a zooplankton net (47 mu m). MPs were present in all analyzed samples, with a dominance of fibers, black color, and <= 1000 mu m range size. MPs concentration was maximum during summer at the lake (180 MPs m(-3)) while during spring (140 MPs m(-3)) at the channel. Rotifers and cyclopoids dominated the zooplanktonic fraction at both sites which range sizes (< 200 to 600 mu m) included most of the size range found for MPs (50-950 mu m). According to our results, the MPs found represents a potential risk for the first levels of the food web. In the lake, the concentration of MPs concerning total zooplankton abundance was higher when the channel was closed. Nevertheless, when the channel was open, the higher concentration in summer matches with the increase of tourism and an extraordinary rainfall. Our results suggest that while the runoff of agro-industrial waste regulates the MPs concentration in the channel, its water management, the touristic activities, and the runoff of MPs from nearby urban settlements regulate the concentration of MPs in the lake. These findings emphasize the need for better treatment of urban and agro-industrial waste that develops near continental aquatic systems, mainly in those where tourism activities are frequent and treatment facilities scarce.					; Alfonso, Maria/JNS-2767-2023	Arias, Andres Hugo/0000-0003-3322-330X; Piccolo, Maria Cintia/0000-0002-5184-9149; Alfonso, Maria Belen/0000-0003-0543-8098; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				JAN 16	2020	192	2							117	10.1007/s10661-020-8080-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-020-8080-1								31950283					WOS:000513897600003

Effects of nutrients and dissolved organic matter on the response of phytoplankton to ultraviolet radiation: experimental comparison in spring versus summer	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The effects of nutrients and dissolved organic matter (DOM) on the response of phytoplankton community structure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) was studied using natural phytoplankton assemblages from Lake Giles (Northeastern Pennsylvania), a temperate, oligotrophic, highly UVR-transparent lake. Microcosm experiments were conducted in 1-l bags in the spring and summer. A factorial design was used, with two UVR treatments (ambient and reduced), two nutrient treatments (control with no nutrients added, and nitrogen and phosphorus addition together), and two DOM treatments (control of 1 mg l(-1) and doubled). In April, UVR affected the overall phytoplankton community structure, causing a shift in the dominant species. Significant interactive effects of UVR x nutrients and UVR x DOM were found on total phytoplankton biovolumes. In July, all taxa responded positively to the N + P addition, and were affected differentially by the UVR treatments. The initial communities varied in April and July, but Synura sp. and Chroomonas sp. were present in both seasons. Synura sp. responded positively to the addition of DOM in April and the reduction of UVR in July. Chroomonas sp. responded positively to the reduction of UVR in April and the addition of nutrients in July. The differential sensitivity of these two species suggests that changing environmental factors between spring and summer promoted differences in the relative importance of UVR in changing phytoplankton community structure.

The aim of this study was to explore the degradation of OM in surface sediments of a shallow lake (Baiyangdian Lake, China) under seasonal temperature variations. For this, we used the amino acid-based degradation index (DI) and the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics and sources of OM. Sediment OM in the lake mainly originated from freshwater aquatic plants and terrestrial C4 plants. The sediment at some sampling sites was affected by surrounding crops. The organic carbon and total nitrogen contents, and the total hydrolyzed amino acid concentrations in the sediments were highest in summer and lowest in winter. The lowest DI occurred in spring, which indicated that the OM in the surface sediment at this time was highly degraded and relatively stable, and the highest DI occurred in winter, which showed that the sediment was fresh. The water temperature was positively correlated with the organic carbon content ( p < 0.01) and total hydrolyzed amino acids concentration ( p < 0.05). Seasonal variations in the overlying water temperature had a large effect on OM degradation in the lake sediments. Our results will facilitate the management and restoration of lake sediments that suffer from endogenous release of OM in a warming climate.(c) 2022 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Physical and chemical parameters were monitored every two weeks for one year and P. australis decomposition rates were measured using the leaf bag technique during two seasons (autumn and spring). Decomposition dynamics were analyzed for the contribution of macrobenthic invertebrate colonizers and the influence of intermittent water level variations. Seasonal trends for changes in physical and chemical parameters were observed in relation to the underground origin of the water supply, which also affected the macrobenthic invertebrate communities. Decomposition rates k differed significantly between seasons (k = 0.0131 in autumn and k = 0.0115 in spring) but remained within a narrow range, reflecting the trend for changes in water temperature. Our findings show that the variability in decomposition rates was largely due to water level fluctuations (46.7% relative importance), rainfall (12.4% relative importance) and macrobenthic invertebrate communities dominated by shredders (23.9% relative importance; 40.9-93.7% of the collected samples). The influence of physical and chemical changes, particularly water temperature, was less important (relative importance 1.82%).					; Pastorino, Paolo/T-5288-2019; Prearo, Marino/AAF-3369-2021	Pastorino, Paolo/0000-0002-0585-1168; PIZZUL, ELISABETTA/0000-0001-9916-5005; Bertoli, Marco/0000-0001-8345-6107; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY	2020	847	9					2123	2140		10.1007/s10750-020-04237-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-020-04237-7		APR 2020											WOS:000526238700001

Seasonal variation of zebra mussel susceptibility to molluscicidal agents	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. The zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha is a well-known biofouler, having potentially serious impacts on freshwater-dependent industries. Chemical treatment is the most popular approach to control this pest. The identification of potential peaks of increased susceptibility of the species to molluscicidal agents may provide environmental and economic benefits, allowing control to be achieved through lower toxin load. 2. In this study, the seasonal pattern of the tolerance of zebra mussels to three reference toxicants with distinct modes of action was recorded by conducting static bioassays. The annual profiles of dry tissue weight of a reference individual and mussels' filtration rate were also followed. 3. The tolerance of the species to toxicants was found to follow a pronounced annual cycle, increasing up to 22 times between early summer and winter. 4. The role of temperature and filtration rate as predictors of the mussels' susceptibility was confirmed, but there was no relation between this and the animals' body condition. Indeed, this study contradicts the common belief that physiologically exhausted adult zebra mussels are more susceptible to chemical control measures. 5. Synthesis and applications. The results presented here enlarge the body of knowledge of D. polymorpha biology and may have practical implications at three levels. First, they reinforce the importance of judicious sampling while testing molluscicides against zebra mussels as well as the specification of the specimens' collection date in toxicological studies. Secondly, they provide information that may be useful to the design of reactive chemical control strategies. In particular, they suggest that the dosage scheme in periodic treatment may be optimized to take advantage of the significant variation of a mussel's susceptibility between late spring and autumn. Finally, the outcome of this study highlights the need of taking into account the seasonality of bivalve responses in ecological risk assessment and the regulation of the discharge of chemicals into surface waters.

J	Mcpartland, MY				Mcpartland, Mara Y.			Decadal-scale variability and warming affect spring timing and forest growth across the western Great Lakes region	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY												The Great Lakes region of North America has warmed by 1-2 degrees C on average since pre-industrial times, with the most pronounced changes observable during winter and spring. Interannual variability in temperatures remains high, however, due to the influence of ocean-atmosphere circulation patterns that modulate the warming trend across years. Variations in spring temperatures determine growing season length and plant phenology, with implications for whole ecosystem function. Studying how both internal climate variability and the "secular" warming trend interact to produce trends in temperature is necessary to estimate potential ecological responses to future warming scenarios. This study examines how external anthropogenic forcing and decadal-scale variability influence spring temperatures across the western Great Lakes region and estimates the sensitivity of regional forests to temperature using long-term growth records from tree-rings and satellite data. Using a modeling approach designed to test for regime shifts in dynamic time series, this work shows that mid-continent spring climatology was strongly influenced by the 1976/1977 phase change in North Pacific atmospheric circulation, and that regional forests show a strengthening response to spring temperatures during the last half-century.

J	Timoney, KP				Timoney, Kevin P.			Flooding in the Peace-Athabasca Delta: climatic and hydrologic change and variation over the past 120 years	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Over the past 120 years, major temporal variations in river flows, lake levels, flood occurrence, wildlife abundance, and vegetation communities, coupled with spatial heterogeneity, have provided fertile ground for narratives of change within the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD). In this paper, I show that simple cause-effect explanations and reliance on short-term datasets have misled through over-generalization and have failed to account for the ecosystem's natural range of variation. Spring break-up discharge correctly predicts 71 to 90% of the binary outcomes (floods, no floods), but break-up discharge is weakly-related to flood magnitude. River regulation has not reduced Peace River spring flood frequency or magnitude. Contrary to popular belief, spring break-up discharge to the PAD from the Peace River's point of regulation at Hudson Hope has increased, not decreased, since regulation. Conversely, suppression of early May to late August discharge is the most noteworthy effect of Peace River regulation, but its ecological impacts remain poorly documented. Flows of the Peace and Athabasca Rivers are strongly correlated and exhibit similar daily, annual, and decadal patterns. An 8-year highstand of Lake Athabasca occurred just prior to river regulation. Lake Athabasca levels prior to the 1960s and after reservoir-filling did not differ significantly but were 60-80 cm lower than during the 1960-1967 highstand. Climatic changes have been complex. The clearest trends are winter warming and a PDSI regime shift from wet and variable to drier and less variable conditions since 1980. Spring flooding is preceded by greater winter precipitation upstream of the PAD and colder winters at the PAD. Spring ice-run floods without ice jams can recharge portions of the PAD including perched basins. I describe two water management approaches that would recharge large areas. Ecosystem complexity and cognitive biases hamper greater understanding of the dynamics of this globally significant ecosystem.																			0165-0009	1573-1480				DEC	2021	169	3-4							34	10.1007/s10584-021-03257-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-021-03257-z													WOS:000732977900001

Geographical location, climate, hydrology, and vegetation composition of wetlands determine the diversity of birds. This study investigated species richness, seasonal diversity, and composition of wetland birds in three prominent water bodies of western Nepal, namely Ghodaghodi, Rani, and Jokhar lakes, from 2021 to 2022 in summer and winter using the point count method. We observed 59 wetland bird species across three wetlands, where both the richness and diversity were significantly higher in the winter. Paired t-tests revealed significant seasonal differences (p < 0.001) in diversity, species richness, and abundance at both Ghodaghodi and Rani lakes. The highest species richness was observed at Ghodaghodi (n = 58), reflecting its significance as a vital bird habitat. In contrast, diversity was higher in Rani Lake during both seasons (Winter H = 2.98, Summer H = 2.79). NMDS followed by ANISOM test also showed that bird community structure varies across lakes and seasons. Indicator species analysis showed that out of 59 species, 26 species are associated with one or different sites, whereas 18 of them are associated with the summer or winter season. We observed the Anatidae family with the highest relative diversity (RDI = 28.81%) and reported 1 globally vulnerable species and 7 globally near-threatened species. While in Jokhar Lake, the abundance does not vary between the seasons. This study revealed substantial differences in bird species across seasons and lakes showing that each wetland offers a distinct ecological niche for bird species. The findings reinstate the importance of these wetlands as crucial habitats for the diversity of birds and species composition. This research contributes to the conservation and management of these ecosystems, aiding the protection of wetland birds in Nepal.					; Bhattarai, Dr. Bishnu Prasad/P-1239-2015; Bhattarai, Dr. Bishnu/IXN-1797-2023	Baral, Hem Sagar/0000-0002-9810-5104; Bhattarai, Dr. Bishnu Prasad/0000-0001-5741-6179; Thapa, Tej/0000-0003-1892-1919; Pant, Siddha Raj/0000-0002-7856-2914													2045-7758					DEC	2024	14	12							e70538	10.1002/ece3.70538	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.70538								39691434					WOS:001379597400001

Based on field measured data of Lake Chaohu between 2009 and 2018, the quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA) was modified for the particular scenario of that lake to derive absorption coefficients based on the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) bands. By changing the reference wavelength to longer ones and building a relationship between the value of spectral power for particle backscattering coefficient (Y), suspended particulate matter (SPM), and above-surface remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs), we improved the accuracy of the retrieval of total absorption coefficients. The absorption coefficients of gelbstoff and non-algal particulates (a(dg)) and absorption coefficients of phytoplankton (a(ph)) in Lake Chaohu were also derived by changing important parameters according to Lake Chaohu. The derived a(ph)tend to be bigger than measured a(ph)in this study, while derived a(dg)tend to be smaller than measured data. We also used the corrected MODIS surface reflectance product (MOD09/MYD09) to calculate the a(ph)(443), a(ph)(645), and a(ph)(678) by the model proposed in this study. It shows that in summer and autumn, a(ph)tended to be higher in the northwestern part of Lake Chaohu, and were relatively lower in the spring and winter, which is similar to previous studies. Overall, our study provides an algorithm that is effectively used in the case of Lake Chaohu and applicable to the data obtained by MODIS, which can be used for further study to investigate the change law of absorption coefficients in long time series by applying MODIS data.					; Hu, Minqi/MSZ-3308-2025; ma, rong/GVU-3096-2022	Ma, Ronghua/0000-0002-4485-4636; 														2072-4292				JUN	2020	12	12							1940	10.3390/rs12121940	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12121940													WOS:000554638800001
J	Shook, K; Pomeroy, J; van der Kamp, G				Shook, Kevin; Pomeroy, John; van der Kamp, Garth			The transformation of frequency distributions of winter precipitation to spring streamflow probabilities in cold regions; case studies from the Canadian Prairies	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Hydrological processes alter the states and/or locations of water, and so they can be regarded as being transformations of the properties of the time series of input variables to those of output variables, such as the transformation of precipitation to streamflow. Semi-arid cold regions such as the Canadian Prairies have extremely low annual streamflow efficiencies because of high infiltration rates, large surface water storage capacities, high evaporation rates and strong climate seasonality. As a result snowfall produces the majority of streamflow. It is demonstrated that the probability distributions of Prairie spring streamflows are controlled by three frequency transformations. The first is the transformation of snowfall by wind redistribution and ablation over the winter to form the spring snowpack. The second transformation is the melt of the spring snowpack to produce runoff over frozen agricultural soils. The third is the transformation of runoff to streamflow by the filling and spilling of depressional storage by connecting fields, ponds, wetlands and lakes. Each transformation of the PDF of the input variable to that of the output variable is demonstrated at a number of locations in the Canadian Prairies and is explained in terms of the hydrological processes causing the transformation. The resulting distributions are highly modified from that of precipitation, and the modification depends on which processes dominate streamflow formation in each basin. The results demonstrate the need to consider the effect of the interplay among hydrological processes, climate and basin characteristics in transforming precipitation frequency distributions into those of streamflow for the design of infrastructure and for water management.

Daily wet-only precipitation, twice-weekly 24-h vapor and particulate samples, snowmelt, and stream water were analyzed for total Hg by cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry (CVAFS) and for other trace metals by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Between December 1992 and August 1994, total mercury in precipitation ranged from 1.5 to 26 ng/L; the highest concentrations generally occurred during the summer months. Vapor phase Hg ranged from 1.2 to 4.2 ng/m(3) without much seasonal variation. Particulate phase Hg ranged from 1 to 43 pg/m(3) with the highest concentrations occurring in the winter months. Wet deposition of total Hg in precipitation totaled 9.27 mu g/m(2) for 1993. Total Hg wet and dry deposition, using estimated vapor phase dry deposition, was 15.1 mu g/m(2) for 1993 with the greatest deposition rates in the summer months. Total Hg concentrations in one monitored small catchment stream were 1 to 3 ng/L during base flow conditions and reached 79 ng/L at peak flow during spring snowmelt. Hg concentrations in 0.2 mu m filtered fractions, however, were consistently around 2 ng/L, even during peak flows. Highest total Hg concentrations were associated with high flow rates, suggesting suspension of Hg-containing organic sediments. Synoptic sampling of rivers in the same drainage basin also showed significant increases in total Hg during snowmelt periods. Measurements of accumulated snow on the ground indicated that less than 50% of the Hg deposited during winter was measured in the snowpack, suggesting possible losses of Hg might be occurring from the snowpack. Finally, future research directions to better understand the ecological cycling of Hg are discussed.																					1-880611-10-4				1997							245	258																WOS:000072818300013

The simulations are compared with new centennial-resolving paleo-reconstructions inferred from various well-dated multi-proxies from two core regions, the Himalaya and Central India. A qualitative moisture index is derived from the proxies and compared with simulated moisture anomalies. The reconstructed paleo-hydrological changes between the Little Ice Age and the Medieval Climate Anomaly depict a dipole pattern between Himalaya and Central India, which is also captured by the model. In the Medieval Climate Anomaly the model exhibits stronger (weaker) dipole signals during summer (winter) compared to Little Ice Age. In summer (winter) months of "Medieval Climate Anomaly minus Little Ice Age" the model simulates wetter conditions over eastern (western and central) Himalaya. Over Central India, a simulated weakening of Indian Summer Monsoon during warmer climate is coincident with reconstructed drying signal in the Lonar Lake record. Based on the model simulations, we can differentiate three physical mechanisms which can lead to the moisture anomalies: (i) the western and central Himalaya are influenced by extra-tropical Westerlies during winter, (ii) the eastern Himalaya is affected by summer variations of temperature gradient between Bay of Bengal and Indian subcontinent and by a zonal band of intensified Indian-East Asian monsoon link north of 25 degrees N, and (iii) Central India is dominated by summer sea surface temperature anomalies in the northern Arabian Sea which have an effect on the large-scale advection of moist air masses. The temperatures in the Arabian Sea are linked to the Ind Pacific Warm Pool, which modulates the Indian monsoon strength. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Among them, the Xihu Lake has reached mild eutrophication with a TLI value of 56.33, both Cibi Lake and Haixihai Lake are mesotrophic with TLI value of 36.03 and 33.48, respectively. The results of diversity analysis showed a significant negative correlation between a-diversity (include Species richness, Shannon-Wiener index, Simpson index and Pielou index) and lake nutrient status. Among them, Xihu Lake showed the lowest a-diversity in all seasons, Haixihai Lake exhibited the middle a-diversity, Cibi Lake indicated the highest a-diversity. Non-metric multidimensional ordination showed that there were obvious spatial structures differences among the macrophyte communities in the three lakes. Macrophyte community composition in the three lakes was more similar in summer and autumn, but there was a wider gap in spring and winter. The redundancy analysis indicated distinct differences between diversity index and ecological factors, the eigenvalues of Axis 1 and Axis 2 being, respectively, 36.13% and 8.15%. Environmental factors could explain 44.8% of the total variation in macrophyte communities structure. Among these, nitrogen, phosphorus, water transparency and water temperature contributed 50.2%, 3.5%, 3.8% and 27.5%, respectively.Conclusions: In summary, the community structure of macrophytes in plateau shallow lakes is co-regulated by seasons and nutrients.					yin, chengjie/C-4162-2018; Chaochao, Lv/JKI-1102-2023	yin, chengjie/0000-0002-2318-8486; Wen, Zihao/0000-0003-3885-5568; 														2296-7745				JUN 16	2023	10								1182823	10.3389/fmars.2023.1182823	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2023.1182823													WOS:001021737200001

These observations include continuous profiles of nitrate and bisulfide using a new instrument for in situ ultraviolet spectrophotometry. Anoxic seawaters in this 200-m-deep basin can be found as shallow as 7 m. However, Nitinat Lake is surprisingly dynamic, with a deep-water renewal time of only about 5 yr and significant spatial and temporal variability. Exchange with the ocean is limited by the size of the linking channel, and during low tides the outflow is subject to an hydraulic control. This nonlinearity causes a relatively large fortnightly cycle in water level and explains flooding events associated with heavy rainstorms. In addition, the restricted flow makes deep-water renewal gradual so that anoxic conditions are preserved. Intermediate waters (5-40 m in depth) are renewed alternately by oxygenation from surface mixing in winter and by upwelling of anoxic water and horizontal inflow of subducted ocean water in summer. The horizontal inflow results in a subsurface region of suboxic water in mid-fjord during summer. No suboxic regime is evident at either the river end of Nitinat Lake (where oxygen and sulfide-rich regions adjoin in a nitrate-depleted water column) or at the ocean end of Nitinat Lake (where oxygen and nitrate-rich regions sometimes overlap with sulfide-rich regions). Maximum phytoplankton levels near the surface are high in both winter and summer. A second peak in biological activity appears near the anoxic boundary, possibly as a result of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. Sulfate-reducing bacteria are also present in anoxic water in both seasons and just above the oxic/anoxic interface in winter and just above the suboxic/anoxic interface in summer.					; Laval, Bernard/J-9861-2012	Laval, Bernard Edmond/0000-0002-4810-9246; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAY	2007	52	3					1002	1017		10.4319/lo.2007.52.3.1002	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2007.52.3.1002													WOS:000246690000009

In this study, parameterized grain size endmember analysis is used to reveal the characteristics of sedimentary dynamics, material sources, and environmental evolution of a loess profile in Focun, Zibo City, Shandong Province, China. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages of the profile ranged from 3.02 +/- 0.45 ka to 100.99 +/- 13.58 ka. The grain size components of the sediments in the profile were divided into five endmembers. EM1 represents a mixed clay component of pedogenesis, EM2 represents a fine silt component transported by high-altitudewesterlies, EM3 represents material that settled in the form of floating dust, EM4 represents a silt component transported by low-altitude near-source areas, and EM5 represents short-distance suspended materials transported under dust storms. Combinedwith a lowfrequencymagnetic susceptibility (chi(lf)) and chromaticity (a*), the characteristics of grain size endmembers indicate changes in sedimentary environments since the last interglacial (MIS 5). In MIS 5 the winter monsoon accumulation was low, with high accumulation during the summer monsoon, and an unstable climate. In MIS 4 the winter monsoon produced high accumulation, with low accumulation during the summer monsoon, and frequent dust storms. In MIS 3 the winter monsoon accumulation was low, westerly circulation and summer monsoon accumulation were high, and the climate waswarmand humid. In MIS 2 thewintermonsoon accumulationwas high, summer monsoon accumulation was low, and the climate was dry and cold. InMIS 1 the westerly circulation and winter monsoon accumulationwere low, summermonsoon accumulation was high, and the climatewaswarmandwet. This reflects the regional response to global climate change. This study shows that the parametric grain size endmember analysismethod is feasible in studying the sedimentary dynamics, material sources and sedimentary environment of loess in Shandong Province.

Azua Valley Lake and integrated water resources management in Vitoria-Gasteiz	DAMS AND RESERVOIRS, SOCIETIES AND ENVIRONMENT IN THE 21ST CENTURY, VOLS 1 AND 2	Proceedings and Monographs in Engineering Water and Earth Sciences				International Symposium on Dams in the Societies of the 21st Century	JUN 18, 2006	Barcelona, SPAIN	Spanish Environm Minist				The Azua Valley Lake is the most emblematic element of the Integrated Water Reclamation and Reuse Plan for the Vitoria region that began in 1992. The off-stream lake has a capacity of 7 hm(3), satisfies the latest environmental requirements, and is located at 75 m above and 2 km distance from the surface water reservoirs supplying the regional areas of Bilbao and Vitoria. The lake will be able to store the winter-spring excess of reclaimed water produced at the Vitoria-Gasteiz water reclamation facility, so it can be used for agricultural and landscape irrigation during the summer, and also for in-stream ecological flow substitution. The use of reclaimed water will result in equivalent surface water flows available for urban water supply, improved protection against flooding, and an additional production of 2 million kWh annually of hydroelectric energy.																					0-415-40423-1				2006							117	+																WOS:000242923100017

Previous studies focus on the prevalence of parasites, but changes in infection intensity over time have rarely been studied. As infection intensity can be quantified by qPCR, we measured infection intensity during different seasons, which is important for our understanding of parasite transmission mechanisms. Methods Wild birds were captured at the Thousand Island Lake with mist nets and tested for avian hemosporidiosis infections using nested PCR. Parasites were identified using the MalAvi database. Then, we used qPCR to quantify the infection intensity. We analyzed the monthly trends of intensity for all species and for different migratory status, parasite genera and sexes. Results Of 1101 individuals, 407 were infected (37.0%) of which 95 were newly identified and mainly from the genus Leucocytozoon. The total intensity trend shows peaks at the start of summer, during the breeding season of hosts and during the over-winter season. Different parasite genera show different monthly trends. Plasmodium causes high prevalence and infection intensity of winter visitors. Female hosts show significant seasonal trends of infection intensity. Conclusions The seasonal changes of infection intensity is consistent with the prevalence. Peaks occur early and during the breeding season and then there is a downward trend. Spring relapses and avian immunity are possible reasons that could explain this phenomenon. In our study, winter visitors have a higher prevalence and infection intensity, but they rarely share parasites with resident birds. This shows that they were infected with Plasmodium during their departure or migration and rarely transmit the disease to resident birds. The different infection patterns of different parasite species may be due to vectors or other ecological properties.					jin, tinghao/JMP-7037-2023; Hellgren, Olof/C-7420-2014; Ding, Ping/H-1817-2015; Wu, Qiang/IAP-9071-2023	WU, Qiang/0000-0002-3005-4072; Bensch, Staffan/0000-0002-0082-0899													1756-3305					JUL 4	2023	16	1							218	10.1186/s13071-023-05848-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-023-05848-4								37403099					WOS:001024451900001

Nine alligators (5 females, 4 males) were outfitted with radio transmitters and monitored on Newnan''s Lake, Alachua County, Florida. Study animals were located 627 times via telemetric signals and visual observations. Female alligators were more sedentary than males during all 4 seasons. Greatest movements and largest seasonal range for both sexes occurred during the spring. Females showed no evident preference for either lake or swamp habitat during the spring, while males preferred the open lake. There was activity range reduction during the summer for both sexes. Then, males preferred the open lake while females restricted themselves to surrounding swamps. Preference for the swamp during the summer by females may be due to nest construction, egg laying and attendance at nest sites.																			0022-1511	1937-2418					1979	13	2					157	164		10.2307/1563922	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1563922													WOS:A1979JW95300005

This may lead to variations in methylmercury (MeHg) exposure over a year, although no biomonitoring studies have documented this issue in Circumpolar populations, the most exposed to international Hg emissions. Our aim was to characterize seasonal variations in MeHg exposure among pregnant Inuit women from Nunavik and to identify country foods responsible for these variations. Between October 2016 and March 2017, 97 participants were recruited. Blood mercury (Hg) was tested and hair Hg was measured by centimeter as a surrogate for monthly MeHg exposure over the past year. Latent class growth analysis was conducted to identify groups of pregnant women with similar hair Hg monthly trajectories. Country foods consumption was documented by season. Seasonal daily intakes of MeHg were estimated based on concentrations in country foods. Retrospective monthly hair Hg analyses revealed that MeHg exposure was lowest in winter, and highest in summer and early fall months. Three latent classes (groups) of pregnant women with similar trajectories of monthly hair Hg variations were identified: high (n = 20, 21%), moderate (n = 38, 41%) and low variation (n = 35, 38%). Beluga meat was the country food contributing to most of daily MeHg intake, primarily during summer and fall, and was the only one associated with the odds of being classified into moderate and high variation groups (OR 95% CI: 1.19 [1.01-1.39] and 1.25 [1.04-1.50]). These findings underscore the importance of monthly variations in exposure to MeHg due to the seasonality of local foods consumed and responsible for elevated MeHg exposure. Further studies critically need to understand local diet fluctuations over a year to adequately assess MeHg exposure, adopt timely preventive interventions and evaluate the effectiveness of the Minamata Convention.

The Environmental Service of Fribourg (SEn) has monitored this lake once a month for several years by water profiles (water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity) at its deepest part. The SEn identified the stratification of water masses as one of the main causes for oxygen consumption in the hypolimnion. In the present study, a Lander System was deployed in Lake Murten from April to September 2015 at 20 m depth at the northwestern part of the lake to monitor water temperature and dissolved oxygen at higher resolution (30 s interval). These records were compared with time series of atmospheric parameters like atmospheric temperature, wind speed and precipitation. A clear correlation of lake temperatures with wind speed was observed during the Spring and Autumn. The water mass stratification evolved through the season and reached its peak during Summer, preventing surface turbulences to reach the deeper part (20 m) of the water column and to partially oxygenate the metalimnion.

C. Temperature-response curves for rates of brood production and development were determined by laboratory experiments and field observation. The life history and population dynamics were observed over a full annual cycle (1981) for a field population located at Rocky Run, Porter''s Lake, Nova Scotia, Canada. On a natural (i.e., sidereal) time scale, the generations appear to have very different life histories: the two summer generations have short lives, rapid development and mature at small size (classic r-selection), whereas the overwintering generations have relatively low rates of mortality, slow development and mature at large size (classic K-selection). This pattern (larger size at maturity at lower temperatures) is widespread in aquatic poikilotherms. Similar life-history differences are evident among cohorts of the summer generations that mature at different temperatures. When time is expressed on a physiological scale that removes the effect of temperature on embryonic development and reproductive rate, the variation within and among generations is greatly reduced. In particular, an apparent alternation between r- and K-selection largely disappears. Because the generations are temporally isolated, it might be surmised that natural selection acting on the summer generations might antagonize the effects of natural selection acting on the fall and winter generations. However, the scaling of the rates of development, maturation, growth, reproduction and mortality on the physiological time scale derived from the temperature dependence of development and reproductive rate gives a very different and more homogeneous pattern.																			0025-3162	1432-1793					1990	107	1					129	139		10.1007/BF01313250	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01313250													WOS:A1990EG72800015

SEASONAL VARIATIONS OF PHYTOPLANKTON IN RELATION TO ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES IN THE SOUTHERN MEDITERRANEAN (TONGA LAKE, NORTHEAST ALGERIA)	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The spatial and temporal dynamics of phytoplankton communities were examined in relation to environmental characteristics in Tonga Lake, situated in the Southwestern Mediterranean (Algeria). Monthly samples were collected from November 2021 to October 2022 at two key locations: one near the sluices and another at the centre of the lake. The study assessed the taxonomic composition, abundance, and diversity index of phytoplankton. A total of 43 genera of phytoplankton were identified within the lake. Notably, diatoms were predominant, with 24 genera identified, compared to 12 genera of Cyanobacteria and 7 genera of Dinoflagellates, highlighting seasonal shifts in these taxa. During the summer months, the community was primarily composed of Aphanizomenon sp., Nostoc sp., Asterionella sp., Planktothrix sp., Dinophysis sp., Cyclotella sp., and Tropidoneis sp., correlating with elevated concentrations of ammonium (NH4), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), and temperature (T degrees). Conversely, the spring season was marked by the prevalence of Stauroneis, Achnanthes, Cymbella, Anomoeneis, Gomphonema, Mastogloia, Navicula, Nitzschia, Peridinium, and Surirella.

Despite the low waterfowl abundance recorded in summer, exclusion-cage experiments evidenced intense herbivory on the biomass, canopy height and flowers of R. cirrhosa (flowers abundance was similar to 8 times higher inside exclusion cages; 1015.7 +/- 269.8 flw m(-2)). For P. pectinatus, exclusion cage experiments did not evidence waterfowl consumption, in spite of the presence of flowers, which suggest preference for reproductive tissues of R. cirrhosa. In addition, the higher abundance of R. cirrhosa flowers compared to P. pectinatus (similar to 10 times higher inside the exclusion cages) was likely influenced by more intense herbivory on the former species. Although waterfowl abundance increased in autumn and winter, experiments did not evidence herbivory effects during that period, possibly because of enhanced availability of alternative resources and decreased plant biomass and canopy height reducing encounter rates. Hence, our results suggest that waterfowl effects on submerged macrophytes in Mediterranean aquatic ecosystems are strongly influenced by seasonal changes in the availability of food resources and its flowering events. The higher herbivory on R. cirrhosa and its flowers in summer suggest that waterfowl grazing may be driven by food preference for reproductive tissues, and could have a strong effect on the community structure and abundance of submerged macrophytes.

J	Kirschner, AKT; Velimirov, B				Kirschner, AKT; Velimirov, B			A seasonal study of bacterial community succession in a temperate backwater system, indicated by variation in morphotype numbers, biomass, and secondary production	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The investigation of the bacterial community in the Kuhworter Wasser, a macrophyte-dominated arm of the River Danube backwater system near Vienna, revealed that variation in microbial densities and biomass could be related to a characteristic sequence in morphotype composition over the seasons. Maximal bacterial cell numbers and biomass occured in early summer, with values of up to 9 x 10(9) cells l(-1) and 122 mu g C l(-1), respectively, caused by a massive increase of vibrio-shaped cells. On the other hand, in early spring, filamentous bacteria were responsible for a marked increase in bacterial biomass, making up 40% of the total bacterial biomass. Over the year, rod-shaped cells were the dominating morphotype, while the biomass of cocci was rather negligible. In winter, cell numbers and biomass showed minimal values with 2.0 x 10(9) cells l(-1) and 28 mu g C l(-1) respectively, and bacteria were considered to be substrate and temperature limited during this period. Saturation values of the incorporation of H-3-thymidine into DNA, for the estimation of bacterial secondary production, varied seasonally, ranging from 5 nM to 40 mM. Thus, saturation experiments needed to be conducted on a regular basis. Also, the amount of labeled thymidine in the DNA, as a percentage of labeled thymidine in the TCA precipitate, varied over the year. Minimum values of 45% were recorded during the cold season, while maximum values of 75-80% at the beginning of June coincided with high chlorophyll a values and minimal K-m-values derived from saturation experiments. The potential role of the nitrogen-rich nucleoside thymidine as a readily utilizable substrate for bacteria during labeling experiments, under varying conditions of substrate availability, is discussed. Bacterial secondary production rates ranged from 0.3 mu g C l(-1) h(-1) in winter to values of 10 mu g C l(-1) h(-1) in August, where phytoplanktonic biomass reached the summer maximum, and bacterial biomass was calculated to be renewed 3 times per day. An estimation of the bacterial carbon demand showed that for the major part of the year, with the exception of early spring, the bacterioplankton community in the Kuhworter Wasser was dependent on carbon sources other than phytoplanktonic primary production.

In the present study, the distribution and mobility of phosphorus fractionations (PFs) in eutrophic water and sediments were investigated in the absence or presence of two macrophytes, that is, reed and cattail, in a constructed wetland in autumn and spring. The removal efficiencies of total P in water, soluble reactive phosphorus and total dissolved phosphorous were 51.85%-63.75%, 74.52%-95.96% and 72.23%-83.02%, respectively. PFs mainly presented in permanent forms in sediments. In the absence of macrophytes in autumn, P in the overlying water was related to the mobile iron-bound phosphorus (Fe-P) in the sediment. In the presence of macrophytes, P in the overlying water was related to stable occluded phosphorus (O-P) in sediments which reduced the possibility of P release. In summary, macrophytes contributed to the stability of P in sediments and limited the release of P from sediment to overlying water, especially in spring.

The Meteorological Service of Canada has recently developed a mobile scanning lidar facility capable of fast azimuth and elevation scanning profiles of the lower troposphere The lidar was located downwind of the stack source and the scanning speeds were adjusted to allow a complete scanning profile to be collected within 30-60 seconds. The lidar portion of the study was divided into four three-week parts. Ontario Power Generation-Nanticoke is a coal-ired generating station on die shores of Lake Erie. The lidar ground location selected for both the summer and winter study was approximately 8.5 km cast of the stacks. The other location was the Noranda-Horne Smelter in Northern Quebec. The lidar was located approximately 4.6 kin SE of the smelter during the winter and approximately 2.5 km NNE during the summer study. Preliminary lidar results will be shown for both Nanticoke and Noranda with a focus on the differences between winter and sumnmer periods when the humidity and boundary layer dynamics were very different. New algorithms are being developed to extract boundary layer heights and plume heights for comparison with model predictions.																			0277-786X		0-8194-4271-2				2002	4546						101	110		10.1117/12.453988	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.453988													WOS:000175314100015
J	Zic, V; Branica, M				Zic, V; Branica, M			The distributions of iodate and iodide in Rogoznica Lake (East Adriatic Coast)	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												This study was performed in order to obtain information on the influence of an acute anoxic event (September, 1997) on distribution and speciation of inorganic iodine in the water column of a small, intensely eutrophicated salt lake. The variations in iodate and iodide depth distributions during the investigated period (1998-2000) were in accord with seasonal changes in redox conditions. During the stratification period (spring and summer), the concentration ratio between iodate and iodide in the upper layers was high, whereas during late summer and autumn, as a result of water column de-stratification and mixing of highly reducing deep water with the oxic layer, lower ratios and more uniform depth distributions were observed. The massive mortality of lake organisms induced by anoxic conditions and sulphide presence throughout the water column was registered by the end of September 1997, when overturn of the lake occurred. The concentrations of iodate in the oxic upper layers were elevated for more than a year after the mass-mortality event (up to 0.55 mu mol L-1), whereas iodide concentrations remained high for more than 2 years in deep anoxic water (up to 2.27 mu mol L-1). These data suggest that biogeochemical renewal processes affecting the concentrations of inorganic iodine in the lake water are slow compared to those that govern the speciation of iodine. The role of sediment-water interactions and iodine-rich organic species in the production of iodide are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

However, few studies have compared the impact of different levels of hunting intensities on the activity patterns of ungulates before, during, and after a culling program. We investigated how different culling intensities affect the activity patterns of sika deer on Nakanoshima Island in Lake Toya, Hokkaido, Japan using camera-trap surveys comparing the period of treatment before, during, and after a culling program. We used the number of deer photographed per hour per camera as an index of activity. Sika deer showed consistent crepuscular activity patterns (i.e., dawn and dusk) during spring-summer and trimodal activity patterns (i.e., dawn, dusk, and midnight) in autumn throughout the study period. In response to increased culling intensity, the activity peaks shifted slightly towards the night. The shift towards nocturnal activity persisted during post-culling period. Understanding the changes in activity patterns in response to culling intensity could be used to facilitate population control and assist in establishing a night shooting program. Thus, wildlife managers should consider night shooting once hunting during day time has shifted the normal diurnal activity of deer to nocturnal activity.

A regime shift in Lake Superior ice cover, evaporation, and water temperature following the warm El Nino winter of 1997-1998	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Significant trends in Lake Superior water temperature and ice cover have been observed in recent decades, and these trends have typically been analyzed using standard linear regression techniques. Although the linear trends are statistically significant and contribute to an understanding of environmental change, a careful examination of the trends shows important nonlinearities. We identify a pronounced step change that occurred in Lake Superior following the warm El Nino winter of 1997-1998, resulting in a "regime shift'' in summer evaporation rate, water temperature, and numerous metrics of winter ice cover. This statistically significant step change accounts for most of the long-term trends in ice cover, water temperature, and evaporation during the period 1973-2010, and it was preceded (and followed) by insignificant linear trends in nearly all of the metrics examined. The 1998 step change is associated with a decrease in winter ice duration of 39 d (a 34% decline), an increase of similar to 2-3 degrees C in mean surface water temperature (July-September averages), and a 91% increase in July-August evaporation rates, reflecting an earlier start to the summer evaporation season. Maximum wintertime ice extent decreased by nearly a factor of two, from an average of 69% of the lake surface area (before 1997-1998) to 36% after the step change. This reassessment of long-term trends highlights the importance of nonlinear regime shifts such as the 1997-1998 break point-an event that may be related to a similar shift in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation that occurred around the same time. These pronounced changes in Lake Superior physical characteristics are likely to have important implications for the broader lake ecosystem.					; Verhamme, Edward/KYQ-4334-2024	Wang, Jia/0000-0003-4154-9721; Verhamme, Anne/0000-0002-2201-1865													0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2014	59	6					1889	1898		10.4319/lo.2014.59.6.1889	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2014.59.6.1889													WOS:000345462700006
J	Luo, J; Wang, XR; Yang, H; Yu, JZ; Yang, LY; Qin, BQ				Luo, Jun; Wang, Xiaorong; Yang, Hong; Yu, Jian Zhen; Yang, Longyuan; Qin, Boqiang			Atmospheric phosphorus in the northern part of Lake Taihu, China	CHEMOSPHERE												Eutrophication, which has been linked to enhanced nutrient loading in lakes, estuarine and coastal waters, is common to many water bodies in China, including Lake Taihu. The atmosphere is an important and growing source of new nutrients entering water bodies. To assess the impact of atmospheric phosphorus (P) on water quality of Lake Taihu, we have estimated the atmospheric input of P by measuring its concentrations in aerosols and in rainwater. Samples were collected at the northeastern part of the lake. The P concentration in total suspended particle ranged from 0.054 to 0.300 mu g m(-3). Concentrations of P in aerosols in the winter and autumn samples were higher than those in the spring and summer samples. Soluble inorganic P (SIP), which provides direct nutrient sources to algae, accounts for 4.9%-83.4% of the total P. Principal Component Analysis of the measured aerosol constituents and examination of inter-species correlation indicate that SIP was correlated with elemental carbon, water soluble organic carbon, NO(3)(-), and Ca(2+). Such correlations could be explained if two nearby coal-fired power plants were a major aerosol P sources. The average concentration of the total P in rain water samples was 0.082 +/- 0.058 mg P/L. The annual deposition flux of P into the northern part of Lake Taihu was estimated to be in the range of 0.04-0.44 kg ha(-1) year(-1) through dry deposition and 0.33 kg ha(-1) year(-1) through wet deposition. The combined wet and dry deposition was less than 8% of riverine P input, therefore the atmospheric deposition was only a minor contributor to P in Lake Taihu at the time of this study.

The content of Al in sediments and in bottom water was determined in relation to chemical conditions. The study was carried out in a four-year cycle, during spring and autumn. The aim of the study was to determine the level and accumulation of aluminum in sediments of rivers supplying dam reservoirs storing water for consumption. The sediments studied were mineral in nature, with neutral pH and moderate sulfate content. The level of Al and heavy metals in the sediments was the highest in the Nysa Szalona River and the lowest in the Strzegomka River, which was also evident in the concentration factor (CF). In terms of season, higher Al contents were recorded in sediments in autumn than in spring, which was also reflected in the concentration factor (CF). Along the course of the river, a gradual decrease in Al levels was observed in successive tributaries in the Nysa Szalona and Strzegomka Rivers, while there was no apparent regularity for the Bystrzyca. Against this background, a comparison of extreme sites below the springs and at the reservoir outlet shows that values were higher in the Nysa Szalona below the springs, and lower in the Strzegomka and Bystrzyca below the reservoir outlet. The general picture of Al and heavy metal loading of the studied sediments shows the lowest loading for the Strzegomka, only the enrichment factor (EF) was the lowest for the Nysa Szalona: metal pollution index (MPI)-S < B < NS, contamination factor (C-f)-S < B < NS, degree of contamination (DC)-S < NS < B, EF-NS < B < S, geoaccumulation index (I-geo)-S < B < NS, CF-S < NS < B.

Comparative Analysis Of Ecological State Of Winter And Summer Phytoplankton In Drainless Mesotrophic Lake (Altai Krai, Russia)	RESEARCH JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL SCIENCES												The investigation findings are of interest in the fundamental hydrobiological studies and new methodological approaches to the phytoplankton ecological state assessment. In mesotrophic-eutrophic lake the active vegetation of plankton algae was revealed at the end of winter under snow (0.13-0.34 m) and ice (0.56-0.70 m) layers at water temperature of 0-4.5 degrees C along the water column (6 m depth). The winter phytoplankton involved species from Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta, Euglenophyta, Dinophyta, Cryptophyta, Ochrophyta and Cyanobacteria. The maximum abundance and biomass are due to passive plankters, incapable of active phototaxis from Microcystis, Gomphosphaeria, Chroococcus, Anabaena, Gloeocapsa, Cyanothece, Monoraphidium, Scenedesmus, Dictyosphaerium and Hyaloraphidium genus. In the ice cover period, the species number reaches 52-56, the abundance - 26.4-1056.0 th. cells/l, biomass - 0.2-12.2 g/m(3), the chlorophyll a concentration - 1.8-24.1 mg/m(3). Although these characteristic values appeared to be high for the cold period (at low temperature and insufficient light), they were lower than in the summer season (more than 100 species, 0.11-1.74 mln. cells/l, 0.64-18.16 g/m(3) and 27.49-83.40 mu g/m(3), respectively). It is noted that algae growth in winter period was limited by the depth of snow cover, but not of the ice. Water temperature affects the species composition and chlorophyll a concentration, but not the algae abundance and biomass. The microscopic method results for determining the plankton algae concentration were compared with the non-contact methods of investigation (spectrophotometric method of light attenuation recording). The assumption that since algae photosynthesis is most active in the blue (wavelength is 400-460 nm) and red (670-800 nm) spectral zones, the absorption of these light waves will be maximum, was confirmed by experimental data. The trend of increasing algae abundance, chlorophyll alpha concentration and spectral light attenuation in the blue and red light from the surface to the bottom during the summer season and the ice cover period at 0.13 m snow depth was noted.																			0975-8585					SEP-OCT	2018	9	5					1285	1297																WOS:000447016800164
J	YATES, C; DECOSTA, J				YATES, C; DECOSTA, J			SOME BAG EXPERIMENTS ON TIBBS-RUN LAKE, WV, A EUTROPHIC ACIDIFIED LAKE	INTERNATIONALE REVUE DER GESAMTEN HYDROBIOLOGIE												Tibbs Run Lake was sampled from December 1979 to December 1980, monthly during the winter and biweekly during the spring, summer, and autumn. Primary production was measured from March 1980 to February 1981, either monthly or biweekly, as indicated above. The mean annual hydrogen ion concentration was equivalent to pH 4.33. This pH was 46% lower (based on H+ concentrations) than the 1977-1978 mean. The low pH of the lake is due to inputs of acid precipitation and the low buffering capacity of the watershed. Predictions of further reductions in the lake pH, based on mean annual hydrogen ion concentrations and hydrogen ion retention coefficients (RH) from Shellito (1979) and this study, indicate that the lake pH should reach an equilibrium with the precipitation pH between 1982 and 1985, assuming the precipitation pH continues to average 4.10. The stratified period mean chlorophyll a and total phosphorus concentrations were 22.1 mg/m3 and 19.3 mug/l, respectively. Total phosphorus loading to the lake was 0.233 gP/m2/yr. To examine the effects of neutralization and fertilization with phosphorus an in situ bag enclosure experiment, lasting 16 days, was performed during the summer of 1980. In the bags, phosphorus (20 mug/l on days 0,4,8,12 as KH2PO4) was added alone and in combination with a base addition (1N KOH). The base additions raised the pH to approximately 7.8. Other treatments included base addition alone and a control. The maximum chlorophyll a concentration was found in the phosphorus treatment (approximately 30 mg/m3) on day 6. The phosphorus plus base treatment exhibited a 10 day lag before reaching a maximum chlorophyll a concentration (approximately 27 mg/m3) on day 16. The highest production rate was found in the phosphorus plus base treatment on day 12 (approximately 27 mgC/m3/hr.). A similar bag experiment, lasting 46 days, was performed during the late summer and early autumn of 1980. The treatments were the same as in the first experiment, however, the nitrate-nitrogen depletion in the lake and treatments necessitated the addition of nitrogen (2 mg/l as NaNO3) to one of each replicate treatment on day 5. On day 34, the maximum chlorophyll a concentrations were found in the phosphorus plus base nitrogen treatment (approximately 120 mg/m3) and the phosphorus plus nitrogen treatment (approximately 38.8 mg/m3). The control plus nitrogen treatment was submerged and possibly contaminated on day 5. All treatments not receiving nitrogen, except for the phosphorus plus base treatment, decreased in the chlorophyll a concentration throughout the experiment. The phosphorus plus base treatment peaked in the chlorophyll a concentration on day 45 (approximately 28 mg/m3) despite non-detectable levels of nitrate-nitrogen. The maximum primary production rate was found in the phosphorus plus base plus nitrogen treatment (approximately 32 mgC/m3/hr.) on day 11.

This causes the spilling or 'cascading' of relatively dense water from the shallows down the sloping sides of the lake in the form of gravity currents, 2 - 15 m thick and typically 0.1 degreesC cooler than the ambient. The flow is intermittent with 'slugs' of cold water lasting, on average, for 8 hrs with mean downslope speeds of 5.2 cms(-1) The temperature and thickness of the slugs is however variable, with pulses of colder water lasting for 1-3 hrs, each preceded by a 'front' in which thickness increases and temperature falls by about 0.01 degreesC per min. The net volume flux carried by the 'slugs' is 18.5 times the mean winter flow into the lake from rivers.

Low-Nitrate-Days (LND), a Potential Indicator of Cyanobacteria Blooms in a Eutrophic Hardwater Reservoir	WATER QUALITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF CANADA												When nitrate was low in a hypereutrophic, hardwater reservoir, cyanobacteria proliferated into blooms Based on this observation an index was developed that relates an easily measurable variable, the period of Low-Nitrate-Days (LND), to the period when nuisance cyanobacteria (blue-greens) proliferate and "bloom The bloom indicator LND (d yr(-1)) was defined as the period of time during summer and early fall when nitrate concentration is below a lake-specific threshold This concept was valuable in Fanshawe Lake, a southern Ontario reservoir of the Thames River in the Lake Erie catchment basin, where traditional bloom indicators are rare A nitrate threshold of 1 to 2 mg L-1 is supported by occasional observations of chlorophyll (Chl) concentration, blue-green biomass, visual inspection, and photographic documentation Fanshawe Lake's water quality (phosphorus, Chl, and Secchi disk transparency) varied from summer to summer and LND ranged from 0 to 175 d yr(-1) with a long-term average of 62 d yr(-1) for 38 years LND was positively and significantly correlated with average summer total phosphorus concentration (available for 8 years), but not Chl (n = 6) nor transparency (n = 11), possibly because of an invasion by the zebra mussel Dreissena LND values agreed well with cyanobacteria biomass indicators predicted from other models Significant relationships with 38 years of flows and the climatic index (winter North Atlantic Oscillation) reveal that during high-flow years estimated cyanobacteria blooms are infrequent, while during low-flow years bloom periods are extended and the water quality is poor Investigations on other man-made lakes and river sections of the Thames River, and preliminary studies on natural lakes with differing trophic states show that LND may be a useful variable in all lakes and reservoirs where nutrient limitation switches from phosphorus to nitrogen during summer					Nurnberg, Gertrud/AFM-9725-2022	Nurnberg, Gertrud/0000-0003-1752-6562													1201-3080						2007	42	4					269	283																WOS:000207773300004

Samples from the lake display a range from -1.36%. to -0.10% in summer and from -0.30%, to -0.07 parts per thousand in winter, while river samples vary from -0.88 parts per thousand to -0.07 parts per thousand, in summer and from -0.35 parts per thousand. to -0.03 parts per thousand in winter. The average iron isotope composition of aerosol samples is +0.10 parts per thousand, which is very similar to that of igneous rocks (0.09 parts per thousand). The SPM in most rivers and water column showed seasonal variation in delta Fe-56 value: the delta Fe-56 values of SPM in summer were lower than in winter. The seasonal variation in delta Fe-56 value of the riverine SPM should be ascribed to the change in source of particulate Fe and geochemical process in the watershed: More particulate Fe was leached from soil and produced by weathering of pyrite widely distributed in coal-containing strata. It is suggested that both allochthonous inputs and the redox iron cycling control the variations of delta Fe-56 values for SPM in lake. During summer stratification, an Fe cycle named "ferrous wheel" is established near the redox boundary where the upwardly diffusing Fe(II) is oxidized and the reactive Fe oxides formed will continuously sink back into the reduction zone to complete the cycle. The delta Fe-56 values for SPM reach the minima, -0.88 parts per thousand, for DB station and -1.36 parts per thousand. for LJK station, just near the redox boundary as a result of the Fe cycling, where a rough 45% to 76% of Fe in these particles was produced by the repetitive cycle. Due to random transportation and diffusion, delta Fe-56 values of the particles near the redox zone distributed into approximately a Gaussian shape. The good negative correlation existed between delta Fe-56 values and Fe/Al ratios for DB station, suggesting that they together can be used as good indicators of the redox-driven Fe transformations.

Samples were taken from 3 depths in the euphotic zone at 5 nearshore stations in Lake Erie near Ashtabula, Ohio. A bimodal pattern of distribution was observed with fall and spring maxima and the dominance of Bacillariophyceae. The maxima were equal in magnitude, but the fall peak was longer in duration and was dominated by Stephanodiscus niagarae and Pediastrum simplex. The spring biomass peak was observed on a single collection date and was composed principally of S. niagarae, Skeletonema subsalsum, Melosira italica and Cyclotella sp.

C.; Couture, Patrice			Temporal variations in kidney metal concentrations and their implications for retinoid metabolism and oxidative stress response in wild yellow perch (Perca flavescens)	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												The objective of this study was to determine if temporal variations in tissue metal concentrations are related to biomarkers of retinoid metabolism and oxidative stress responses in juvenile yellow perch (Perca flavescens). To this end, kidney metal (Cd, Cu and Zn) concentrations were measured in fish sampled in spring and fall 2012 in four lakes representing a wide range of water and sediment metal contamination in the Rouyn-Noranda (Quebec) region. Lakes Opasatica and Helene were considered as reference lakes while lakes Dufault and Marlon were metal-contaminated. Kidney concentrations of Cd, Cu and Zn varied widely between spring and fall in fish from both clean and metal-contaminated lakes. An inter-lake difference in renal metal concentrations was only observed for Cd, with fish from Lake Marlon consistently displaying higher concentrations. In the spring, the concentrations of liver dehydroretinol, dehydroretinyl palmitate and total vitamin A esters were higher in fish sampled in the most contaminated lake. Strong temporal variations in the concentrations of these metabolites, as well as in the percentage of liver free dehydroretinol and the epidermal retinol dehydrogenase 2 transcription levels, were observed in fish living in the most metal-impacted lake, with generally higher values in the spring. In contrast to liver, in muscle, no clear seasonal variations in the concentrations of dehydroretinol, dehydroretinyl stearate or in the percentage of free dehydroretinol were observed in fish captured in the most contaminated lake. Temporal variations of traditional biomarkers of oxidative stress response were also observed in the most metal-impacted lake. For example, the transcription level of the gene encoding Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase-1 in liver and muscle catalase activity of perch sampled in the most contaminated lake were higher in spring than in fall. Positive relationships were found between kidney Cd concentrations and the transcription level of the gene encoding glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and all forms of retinoid concentrations in liver in spring, except with the percentage of free dehydroretinol where the correlation was negative. Our results translate to a state of stress caused by Cd and illustrate that temporal variations in tissue metal concentrations affect retinoid metabolism and antioxidant capacities in juvenile wild yellow perch. Overall this study contributes to highlight the importance of considering temporal variations when investigating the consequences of metal contamination on the physiology of wild fish.

J	NORTHCOTE, TG				NORTHCOTE, TG			MIGRATORY BEHAVIOUR OF JUVENILE RAINBOW TROUT, SALMO-GAIRDNERI, IN OUTLET AND INLET STREAMS OF LOON LAKE, BRITISH-COLUMBIA	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												The marked differences in response to water current, exhibited by juvenile rainbow trout migrating into Loon Lake from its outlet and inlet streams, were studied both in the field and in experimental laboratory apparatus. All available evidence argued against genetically discrete outlet and inlet stocks, each maintaining different innate responses to water current. Difference in water temperature between streams was shown, in field and laboratory experiments, to regulate direction of juvenile trout migration through action on behaviour associated with downstream movement, maintenance of position and upstream movement. In laboratory experiments with cool (5 and 10[degree]C) flowing water, recently emerged fry rarely made contact with the stream bottom in darkness and exhibited much more downstream movement than in warm ( > 14[degree]C) water. In cool streams of the Loon Lake system (daily mean consistently <113[degree]C) large numbers of recently emerged fry moved downstream in darkness. Laboratory experiments indicated that combination of cool water (10[degree]C) and long day length (16 hours) induced downstream movement of fingerlings. In the field, fingerlings moved downstream largely in late spring and summer in cool streams of the Loon Lake system. In laboratory experiments with warm (15 and 20[degree]C) flowing water, recently emerged fry made frequent contact with the stream bottom in darkness and exhibited much less downstream movement than in cool (10[degree]C) water. In the warm outlet stream (daily mean in summer usually < 15[degree]C) recently emerged fry maintained position in darkness. Laboratory experiments suggested that short day length (8 hours) may facilitate maintenance of position exhibited by fingerlings in streams during late autumn and winter. Upstream movement of fry recorded in the field and tested in the laboratory was most pronounced in warm water ( > 14[degree]C). Fingerlings subjected to rapid 5-degree (C) increases in water temperature in an experimental stream exhibited an immediate increase in upstream movement. Upstream movement in summer of large fry and fingerlings occurred only in the warm outlet stream; daily periodicity of upstream movement was positively correlated with sharp rises in water temperature. Evidence examined from four other widely separated stream systems indicated an environmental control of migration in juvenile rainbow trout similar to that demonstrated in the Loon Lake stream system. Possible mechanisms and interaction of factors controlling migratory patterns between and within streams are discussed. Significance of the predominant role played by temperature is considered.																									1962	19	2					201	270		10.1139/f62-013	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f62-013													WOS:A1962WV53600002
J	Zeng, S; Lei, SH; Qin, ZH; Song, WW; Sun, Q				Zeng, Shuai; Lei, Shaohua; Qin, Zihong; Song, Weiwei; Sun, Qiang			Long-term remote observations of particulate organic phosphorus concentration in eutrophic Lake Taihu based on a novel algorithm	CHEMOSPHERE												Monitoring the long-term spatiotemporal variations in particulate organic phosphorus concentration (CPOP) is imperative for clarifying the phosphorus cycle and its biogeochemical behavior in waters. However, little attention has been devoted to this owing to a lack of suitable bio-optical algorithms that allow the application of remote sensing data. In this study, based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, a novel absorption-based algorithm of CPOP was developed for eutrophic Lake Taihu, China. The algorithm yielded a promising performance with a mean absolute percentage error of 27.75% and root mean square error of 21.09 mu g/L. The long-term MODIS-derived CPOP demonstrated an overall increasing pattern over the past 19 years (2003-2021) and a significant temporal heterogeneity in Lake Taihu, with higher value in summer (81.97 +/- 3.81 mu g/L) and autumn (82.07 +/- 3.8 mu g/L), and lower CPOP in spring (79.52 +/- 3.81 mu g/L) and winter (78.74 +/- 3.8 mu g/ L). Spatially, relatively higher CPOP was observed in the Zhushan Bay (85.87 +/- 7.5 mu g/L), whereas the lower value was observed in the Xukou Bay (78.95 +/- 3.48 mu g/L). In addition, significant correlations (r > 0.6, P < 0.05) were observed between CPOP and air temperature, chlorophyll-a concentration and cyanobacterial blooms areas, demonstrating that CPOP was greatly influenced by air temperature and algal metabolism. This study provides the first record of the spatial-temporal characteristics of CPOP in Lake Taihu over the past 19 years, and the CPOP results and regulatory factors analyses could provide valuable insights for aquatic ecosystem conservation.

France). Diaphanosoma brachyurum and Ceriodaphnia pulchella were strictly limited to the warm stratified period (July to October), whereas Bosmina longirostris and Bosmina coregoni were dominant during spring and autumn. Daphnia longispina was the only species to occur throughout the year with higher densities in spring. In spring and late autumn, the discharge of the inflowing river Verdon was high and the abundance of all species showed a gradient over the whole lake with lower densities close to the inflow. During the stratified period, water inflow was very low and species showed different patterns. Densities of the small form Ceriodaphnia pulchella were similar all along the long axis of the lake, whereas Daphnia densities were significantly higher near the dam. The distribution pattern of Diaphanosoma, an intermediate-sized species, showed similar trends to that of Daphnia. The only planktivorous fish in the pelagic zone, the bleak (Alburnus alburnus), fed mostly on large-bodied species (> 1.0 mm) and was more abundant close to the inflow current. A comparison between the length frequency distributions of cladocera upstream and downstream provided a clear demonstration of the effects of size-selective predation on prey populations. Finally, the interactions between spatial heterogeneity and long-term development of the zooplankton community and the indirect effects of predation are discussed.						pont, Didier/0000-0001-5187-0135													0018-8158					NOV 22	1990	207						259	267		10.1007/BF00041464	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00041464													WOS:A1990EW45800031
J	Trojanowska, AA; Izydorczyk, K				Trojanowska, Adriana Anna; Izydorczyk, Katarzyna			Phosphorus Fractions Transformation in Sediments Before and After Cyanobacterial Bloom: Implications for Reduction of Eutrophication Symptoms in Dam Reservoir	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												In order to observe the spatial phosphorus (P) fractions transformations in sediments in relation to bacterial abundance and enzyme hydrolysing organic P-alkaline phosphatase (APA), samples from 35 stations from eutrophic Sulejow Reservoir were taken in spring after flood and in summer after cyanobacterial bloom breakdown. The results show pronounced fluctuations: decrease of average total P in sediments, despite organic matter delivery after cyanobacterial bloom, in parallel with increase of labile P (8.3%) and Ca-bounded P (16.6%) fractions and decline of organic P fraction (28.5%). Higher alkaline activity in sediments in the spring delivered nutrients to water column and supported cyanobacterial bloom development during the summer. Positive correlation between APA and organic P (r=0.37, p<0.01, n=70) and negative with labile inorganic P (r=-0.44, p<0.01, n=70) in sediments proved significant role of the APA in phosphorus transformation in sediments and internal loading in the reservoir. During summer, APA was significantly related to bacterial number (r(-)0.36, p<0.01, n(-)35) and bacterial abundance was correlated to organic matter content (r(-)0.36, p<0.01, n(-)35). Such pattern of temporal variations of P transformation in sediments indicates order of solutions for enhancement of recultivation effects of eutrophic dam reservoirs: (1) reduction of organic matter supply in spring and (2) sediment inactivation during summer.

It is concerned that HPAIVs may be perpetuated in the lakes in Siberia where migratory water birds nest in summer. To monitor whether HPAIVs circulate in migratory water birds, intensive surveillance of avian influenza has been performed in Mongolia and Japan in autumn each year. Until 2008, there had not been any H5N1 viruses isolated from migratory water birds that flew from their nesting lakes in Siberia. In autumn 2009, A/mallard/Hokkaido/24/09 (H5N1) (Mal/Hok/24/09) was isolated from a fecal sample of a mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) that flew from Siberia to Hokkaido, Japan. The isolate was assessed for pathogenicity in chickens, domestic ducks, and quails and analyzed antigenically and phylogenetically. Results: No clinical signs were observed in chickens inoculated intravenously with Mal/Hok/24/09 (H5N1). There was no viral replication in chickens inoculated intranasally with the isolate. None of the domestic ducks and quails inoculated intranasally with the isolate showed any clinical signs. There were no multiple basic amino acid residues at the cleavage site of the hemagglutinin (HA) of the isolate. Each gene of Mal/Hok/24/09 (H5N1) is phylogenetically closely related to that of influenza viruses isolated from migratory water birds that flew from their nesting lakes in autumn. Additionally, the antigenicity of the HA of the isolate was similar to that of the viruses isolated from migratory water birds in Hokkaido that flew from their northern territory in autumn and different from those of HPAIVs isolated from birds found dead in China, Mongolia, and Japan on the way back to their northern territory in spring. Conclusion: Mal/Hok/24/09 (H5N1) is a non-pathogenic avian influenza virus for chickens, domestic ducks, and quails, and is antigenically and genetically distinct from the H5N1 HPAIVs prevailing in birds in Eurasia and Africa. H5 viruses with the HA gene of HPAIV had not been isolated from migratory water birds in the surveillance until 2009, indicating that H5N1 HPAIVs had not become dominant in their nesting lakes in Siberia until 2009.

Accelerated sediment phosphorus release in Lake Erie's central basin during seasonal anoxia	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Eutrophication remains a serious threat to Lake Erie and has accelerated over past decades due to human activity in the watershed. Internal phosphorus (P) loading from lake sediment contributes to eutrophication, but our understanding of this process in Lake Erie is more uncertain than for its riverine P inputs. Past study has focused on incubating sediment cores in oxic or anoxic conditions, meaning we know little about sediment flux during state transitions. We used 56 controlled sediment core incubation experiments to quantify rates and onset of P release in Lake Erie's central basin as a function of depositional environment, season (spring, summer, and fall), temperature, and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration. P flux under oxic or hypoxic (> 0 to <= 2 mg L-1 DO) conditions was slow (0.31-0.50 mg m(-2) d(-1)) compared to anoxic P flux (5.19-30.7 mg m(-2) d(-1)). The transition between slow and fast flux occurred within 24 h of anoxia (0 mg L-1 DO). Oxic or anoxic P flux was generally similar across seasons and incubation temperatures (8 degrees C and 14 degrees C). In 14 degrees C incubated cores anoxic P flux onset was earliest in fall, when sediments had already been exposed to anoxic conditions in the lake. Re-oxygenation of experimental cores that temporarily developed anoxia reversed the direction of P flux, but P release resumed at similar rates once the water returned to anoxia. Understanding the effects of hypolimnion oxygen conditions on internal P loading allows us to better constrain nutrients sources and implications for P budget management.

Annual and Interannual Variability in the Diffuse Attenuation Coefficient and Turbidity in Urbanized Washington Lake from 2013 to 2022 Assessed Using Landsat-8/9	REMOTE SENSING												Water clarity, defined in this study using measurements of the downwelling diffuse light attenuation coefficient (K-d) and turbidity, is an important indicator of lake trophic status and ecosystem health. We used in-situ measurements to evaluate existing semi-analytical models for K-d and turbidity, developed a regional turbidity model based on spectral shape, and evaluated the spatial and temporal trends in Lake Washington from 2013 to 2022 using Landsat-8/9 Operational Land Imager (OLI). We found no significant trends from 2013 to 2022 in K-d or turbidity when both the annual and full datasets were considered. In addition to the spring peak lasting from April through June, autumn Kd peaks were present at all sites, a pattern consistent with seasonal chlorophyll a and zooplankton concentrations. There existed no autumn peak in the monthly turbidity dataset, and the spring peak occurred two months before the K-d peak, nearly mirroring seasonal variability in the Cedar River discharge rates over the same period. The K-d and turbidity algorithms were thus each more sensitive to different sources of water clarity variability in Lake Washington.					; Schulien, Jennifer/KOD-1722-2024	Schulien, Jennifer/0000-0003-1428-9370; DeGasperi, Curtis/0000-0002-2520-7046; 														2072-4292				OCT	2023	15	20							5055	10.3390/rs15205055	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15205055													WOS:001092660200001

The venting areas are inconspicuous, except in winter when the vents form snow-free areas of unfrozen ground, each with a surface area of 1-15 m(2). The temperature and chemical composition of the warm air vents have been monitored from March 2009 to July 2010. The temperature of the warm air and ground surface at the venting sites ranged from 6.6 to 20.0 degrees C, whereas that of the ambient air ranged from -13.2 to 20.0 degrees C. The difference between atmospheric and vent air temperatures is greater in cold-weather months. The warm air has low CO2 content, but has otherwise normal atmospheric gas composition. Warm air volumetric flow varies from 2.1 to 19.9 L/m(2)/s in winter, when it contains between <10 and 18 ppm CO2. In summer, the venting areas are more diffuse, with volumetric flow rates ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 L/m(2)/s, and are less depleted in CO2 (260-370 ppm). Frozen ground is likely focusing airflow in winter compared to summer. We present a conceptual model in which air enters the steep flanks of the chrysotile milling waste heap, into which CO2 reacts with Mg-rich minerals, stripping CO2 from air by exothermic mineral carbonation reactions. Considering the surface area of summer and winter venting areas, flow rates, and concentration of CO2 in warm air vents, we estimate that the Black Lake mine heap passively captures at least 0.6 kt CO2 per year.					; Klein, Matthieu/ABI-6887-2020; Duchesne, Josee/ACO-0812-2022; Maldague, Xavier/AAJ-7044-2020; Beaudoin, Georges/B-7108-2009; Constantin, Marc/AFO-2218-2022; Molson, John/AFI-1639-2022	Molson, John/0000-0002-6581-8044; Duchesne, Josee/0000-0002-6327-4864; Lemieux, Jean-Michel/0000-0003-3845-3040; Constantin, Marc/0000-0003-2184-8783; Maldague, Xavier/0000-0002-8777-2008; Beaudoin, Georges/0000-0002-4029-2648													0091-7613	1943-2682				MAR	2012	40	3					275	278		10.1130/G32583.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/G32583.1													WOS:000301171200023

Vittorino plain (Rieti, Central Italy), where evidences of past and present hydrothermal activity exists. In winter (February 2011) lake Paterno waters were almost completely mixed, whereas in summer time (July 2011) thermal and chemical stratifications established. During the stratification period, water and dissolved gas chemistry along the vertical water column were mainly controlled by biological processes, such as methanogenesis, sulfate-reduction, calcite precipitation, denitrification, and NH4 and H-2 production. Reducing conditions at the interface between the bottom sediments and the anoxic waters are responsible for the relatively high concentrations of dissolved iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn), likely present in their reduced oxidation state. Minerogenic and biogenic products were recognized at the lake bottom even during the winter sampling. At relatively shallow depth the distribution of CH4 and CO2 was controlled by methanotrophic bacteria and photosynthesis, respectively. The carbon isotope signature of CO2 indicates a significant contribution of deep-originated inorganic CO2 that is related to the hydrothermal system feeding the CO2-rich mineralized springs discharging in the surrounding areas of lake Paterno. The seasonal lake stratification likely controls the vertical and horizontal distribution of fish populations in the different periods of the year.

The raw water is extracted from 35 m depth from the Lake Maridalsvannet. E. coli was detected in 18% of the daily samples. In general, most samples positive for E. coli were observed during the autumn turnover periods, but even in some samples taken during warm and dry days in July, with stable temperature stratification in the lake, E. coli was detected. The daily samples gave useful additional information compared with the weekly routine samples about the hygienic raw water quality and the hygienic barrier efficiency of the lake under different weather conditions and seasons. The winter 2013/2014 was much warmer than the winter 2012/2013. The monitoring supported the hypothesis that warmer winters with shorter periods with ice cover on lakes, which may be a consequence of climate changes, may reduce the hygienic barrier efficiency in deep lakes used as drinking water sources.

Understanding the ecology of these blooms is key for predicting succession patterns, especially given the impact of climate change on winter conditions. To elucidate the relationships between exponential algal growth, abiotic conditions, and vertical nutrient transport, we investigated the phytoplankton community in a deep temperate reservoir during the winter-to-spring transition. We collected biweekly physical, chemical, and phytoplankton data, along with monthly sedimenting material data. We found that our study system can support the exponential growth of diatom species in late winter during circulation, 6-10 weeks before stratification onset, and once photosynthetically active radiation had reached 1.3 mol m(-2) d(-1). The phytoplankton community was mainly dominated by diatoms, motile species, and Planktothrix rubescens. These species displayed distinct growth patterns and ecological strategies, likely as an adaptation to the varying abiotic conditions during this period. Specifically, P. rubescens was evenly distributed during circulation and formed a deep chlorophyll layer at similar to 11 m depth immediately after stratification onset. Additionally, a few of these dominant phytoplankton species predominantly influenced vertical nutrient transport through sedimentation. Our results demonstrate that exponential phytoplankton growth can occur in temperate lakes before stratification onset under low light conditions if there is sufficient time before grazing begins and sinking losses increase. Our findings emphasize winter's significant role in shaping species distribution in subsequent seasons and underscores the need for an annual perspective in limnology.

Recent increases in annual, seasonal, and extreme methane fluxes driven by changes in climate and vegetation in boreal and temperate wetland ecosystems	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Climate warming is expected to increase global methane (CH4) emissions from wetland ecosystems. Although in situ eddy covariance (EC) measurements at ecosystem scales can potentially detect CH4 flux changes, most EC systems have only a few years of data collected, so temporal trends in CH4 remain uncertain. Here, we use established drivers to hindcast changes in CH4 fluxes (FCH4) since the early 1980s. We trained a machine learning (ML) model on CH4 flux measurements from 22 [methane-producing sites] in wetland, upland, and lake sites of the FLUXNET-CH4 database with at least two full years of measurements across temperate and boreal biomes. The gradient boosting decision tree ML model then hindcasted daily FCH4 over 1981-2018 using meteorological reanalysis data. We found that, mainly driven by rising temperature, half of the sites (n = 11) showed significant increases in annual, seasonal, and extreme FCH4, with increases in FCH4 of ca. 10% or higher found in the fall from 1981-1989 to 2010-2018. The annual trends were driven by increases during summer and fall, particularly at high-CH4-emitting fen sites dominated by aerenchymatous plants. We also found that the distribution of days of extremely high FCH4 (defined according to the 95th percentile of the daily FCH4 values over a reference period) have become more frequent during the last four decades and currently account for 10-40% of the total seasonal fluxes. The share of extreme FCH4 days in the total seasonal fluxes was greatest in winter for boreal/taiga sites and in spring for temperate sites, which highlights the increasing importance of the non-growing seasons in annual budgets. Our results shed light on the effects of climate warming on wetlands, which appears to be extending the CH4 emission seasons and boosting extreme emissions. Climate warming is expected to increase global methane emissions from wetland ecosystems. As in-situ tower measurements only span a few years, we used machine-learning to hindcast changes in methane emissions at 22 towers. In recent decades, we found that half of the sites showed significant increases in annual, seasonal, and extreme methane fluxes of at least 10%. Our results shed light on the effects of climate warming on wetlands, which appears to be extending methane emission seasons.

DATA IN BRIEF												This article presents a dataset on 71 pesticide levels and the identification of additional synthetic organic chemicals, including pharmaceuticals and industrial compounds, conducted during May-June (spring) and end of September- October (autumn) 2019, timed to the rice cultivation cycle, the region's main agricultural activity. A total of 130 samples (100 water and 30 sediments) were collected from 51 strategically selected sites, including rivers, irrigation channels, Albufera Lake, and Mediterranean outlets, utilizing a combination of targeted and non-targeted screening (NTS) methods. The dataset encompasses physical-chemical parameters for both spring and autumn seasons. Advanced analytical techniques, such as high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), were employed to detect contaminants beyond traditional methods, providing critical insights for environmental management and policy development. The findings contribute to addressing gaps in knowledge regarding contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) and their distribution across different environmental compartments. These data supplement the findings of the research article "Fingerprinting of Emerging Contaminants in L'Albufera Natural Park (Valencia, Spain): Implications for Wetland Ecosystem Health".

J	CARPENTER, SR				CARPENTER, SR			ENRICHMENT OF LAKE-WINGRA, WISCONSIN, BY SUBMERSED MACROPHYTE DECAY	ECOLOGY												Enrichment of hard-water eutrophic Lake Wingra by decomposition of submersed aquatic vegetation is analyzed. A model was constructed to predict daily release of dissolved total P (DTP) and dissolved organic matter (DOM) from decaying macrophyte shoots. Inputs to the model are daily mortality, the N and P contents of senescing tissues and water temperature. Three mechanisms are modeled: leaching of P, decay of coarse particulate organic matter and respiration of DOM. In field tests, the model predicted decay rates and the P content of decaying shoots fairly accurately. Decomposition of Myriophyllum spicatum accounts for about half of the observed flux of DTP and DOM from the littoral zone to the pelagial zone of Lake Wingra. During summer and autumn decaying macrophytes are a major source of biologically available DTP and decomposable DOM for the pelagic community of the lake. Macrophyte decay potentially stimulates pelagic production. Substantial differences in the timing of DTP and DOM release occur among comparably productive stands of different species decomposing in the same lake. Release of dissolved materials by Potamogeton pectinatus stands occurs during summer, and is nearly completed by the time release by Vallisneria americana stands begins to increase. Most release from V. americana stands occurs after mid-Aug. Release of dissolved materials by a typical stand of M. spicatum is more or less continuous during summer and autumn. When Lake Wingra was dominanted by V. americana (.apprxeq. 1900) the rate of enrichment by macrophyte decay during summer was probably less than the present rate. During a period of domination by Potamogeton sp. (.apprxeq. 1955-1965) enrichment by macrophyte decay during summer may have exceeded the rate of internal loading that occurred after the invasion of M. spicatum.

Eight research plots representing early developmental stages (forest plantation and thicket stage) of Scots pine stands were established. Five traps baited with cow dung were set in each of the plots. In total, 24,811 specimens representing 34 species of dung beetles (coprophagous Scarabaeoidea) were collected. The structure of dung beetle communities inhabiting forest plantations and thicket stages of pine stands changes in the course of the vegetation season. The culmination of the process takes place in July, when a dramatic drop in the number of both individuals and species occurs. Dung beetle communities inhabiting forest plantations and thicket stages of pine stands are dominated by earth-boring dung beetles (Geotrupidae). The proportion of individuals representing Aphodiinae and Scarabaeinae dung beetles amounts to less than 40% of the total. Anoplotrupes stercorosus plays the role of the superdominant in those communities, and Trypocopris vernalis is a superdominant or dominant species. Two communities of dung beetle were differentiated, based on the season of adult activity: spring-autumn type (characterized by high species richness and the presence of Agrilinus ater, Calamasternus granarius, Chilothorax paykulli, Copris lunaris, Esymus merdarius, Heptaulacus testudinarius, Melinopterus sphacelatus, Nimbus contaminatus, Oxyomus sylvestris and Rhyssemus puncticollis) and spring-summer type (characterized by the lowest species richness and the presence of Bodilopsis rufa, B. sordida, Geotrupes spiniger, Limarus zenkeri, Othophorus haemorrhoidalis and Rhodaphodius foetens).

Perch in fed and starved treatments suffered 1 and 46% mortality, respectively, mortality being higher among the smaller individuals. Winter duration was an important determinant of both total mortality and the intensity of size-selective mortality. Size-selective mortality also occurred in yellow perch from the same stock kept overwinter in an in situ lake enclosure with natural food. Fall and spring population estimates for two cohorts of young-of-the yellow perch from Lake St. George also indicated the occurrence of size-selective overwinter mortality. We present a quantitative technique for identification of size-dependent mortality and size-dependent growth from sequential length frequency distributions. This technique allowed identification of overwinter size-selective mortality for five natural cohorts sampled in the field. Results from a stochastic simulation model, incorporating observed variability in both first year growth and winter duration suggest that overwinter starvation mortality can cause substantial variability in year-class strength that is independent of adult stock size.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				NOV	1989	46	11					1958	1968		10.1139/f89-246	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f89-246													WOS:A1989CA35700016

Here, we present a branched GDGTs-based temperature reconstruction from the sediments of Maar Lake Huguangyan in tropical China. The record reveals that the mean temperature during the Oldest Dryas was 17.8 degrees C, which was followed by a two-step increase of 2-3 degrees C to the Bolling-Allerod, a decrease to 19.8 degrees C during the Younger Dryas, and a rapid warming at the onset of the Holocene. The Oldest Dryas was about 2 degrees C warmer than the Younger Dryas. The reconstructed temperature was weighted towards the wintertime since the lake is monomictic and the mixing process in winter supplies nutrients from the lake bottom to the entire water column, greatly promoting biological productivity. In addition, the winter-biased temperature changes observed in the study are more distinctive than the summer-biased temperature records from extra-tropical regions of East Asia. This implies that the temperature decreases during abrupt climatic events were mainly a winter phenomenon. Within the limits of the dating uncertainties, the broadly similar pattern of winter-weighted temperature change observed in both tropical Lake Huguangyan and in Greenland ice cores indicates the occurrence of tightly-coupled interactions between high latitude ice sheets and land areas in the tropics. We suggest that the winter monsoon (especially cold surges) could play an important role in the rapid transmission of the temperature signal from the Arctic to the tropics. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Understanding the mechanisms and processes that control algal blooms is of great concern. The phytoplankton community of Karaoun Reservoir, the largest water body in Lebanon, is poorly studied, as in many freshwater bodies around the Mediterranean Sea. Sampling campaigns were conducted semi-monthly between May 2012 and August 2013 to assess the dynamics of its phytoplankton community in response to changes in physical-chemical and hydrological conditions. Karaoun Reservoir is a monomictic waterbody and strongly stratifies between May and August. Changes in its phytoplankton community were found to be a result of the interplay between water temperature, stratification, irradiance, nutrient availability and water level. Thermal stratification established in spring reduced the growth of diatoms and resulted in their replacement by green algae species when nutrient availability was high and water temperatures lower than 22 degrees C. At water temperature higher than 25 degrees C and low nutrient concentrations in summer, blooms of the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa occurred. Despite different growth conditions in other lakes and reservoir, cyanobacterium Aphanizomenon ovalisporum dominated at temperatures lower than 23 degrees C in weakly stratified conditions in early autumn and dinoflagellate Ceratium hirundinella dominated in mixed conditions, at low light intensity and a water temperature of 19 degrees C in late autumn. We believe that the information presented in this paper will increase the knowledge about phytoplankton dynamics in the Mediterranean region and contribute to a safer usage of reservoir waters.

A total of 19 randomly distributed sites were sampled (van-Veen grab, 4 replicates, 500 mu m) on two dates. Total mean densities of the heterogeneously distributed benthos were low with 921.3 ind./m(2) and 640.3 ind./m(2) in summer and winter, respectively. Neither density nor composition differed significantly between seasons. Insecta, mainly Chironomidae, were most abundant, followed by Crustacea, mainly Synelobus stanfordi (Tanaidae), and Oligochaeta. Cluster analyses, linked subsequently by a nodal analysis, revealed the presence of three benthic zones (centre, margin, marsh), distinguished by benthos density and composition, including differential species and species assemblages. This result is remarkable as the shallow lakes of Brazil's coastal plains are exposed to permanently blowing north-east winds.																			0003-9136					OCT	1997	140	4					533	548																WOS:A1997YL64200005

Nevertheless, the progressive growth of ice volume through the austral winter and spring months generates haline convection capable of mixing the water column to a depth at least as great as that achieved by wind-induced turbulence in the summer ice-free period. Further, cold and very saline brines may form at the shallow periphery of a lake and flow downslope, penetrating to the lake centre below the convectively mixed layer. Detailed temperature profiles of hypersaline Organic Lake provide the first evidence for these density currents in saline lakes of the Vestfold Hills. These data indicate a dynamic responsiveness to periods of relatively cold weather, and that the resulting density currents may be sufficiently small in volume to have little effect on the anoxia of bottom layers in these meromictic lakes. Alternating periods of negative and positive water balance may also be significant in the formation and destruction of meromixis in these saline lakes, which lack outflow streams. If a lake has been through a period of negative water balance, becoming relatively more saline, and then begins to be diluted during a subsequent period of positive water balance, the winter haline convection will penetrate to progressively shallower depths and deeper layers may stagnate, marking the onset of meromixis. An increase in the winter level of Organic Lake over ten years indicates the speed with which the Vestfold Hills' lakes may experience significant change in salinity despite the generally small catchments of these lakes.																			0031-0182					MAY	1991	84	1-4					99	107		10.1016/0031-0182(91)90038-S	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0031-0182(91)90038-S													WOS:A1991FU23800007

Among these fish, 213 were captured in offshore waters of the North Pacific Ocean in spring and summer, 1971-72, These sockeye salmon were identified as the fish from the Nishibetsu River by characteristic scale patterns. Most of the sockeye salmon were caught in the western North Pacific (west of 170 degrees E), Fish of ocean age 1 were separated into immature and maturing fish by their ocean distribution. Immature fish resided in offshore waters but maturing fish moved westward to Hokkaido from spring to summer. Fish of ocean age 2 were maturing and moved westward as did maturing fish of ocean age 1. Fork length increased steadily from spring to summer. These results indicate that the juveniles produced from the eggs of lacustrine sockeye salmon were capable of migrating to offshore waters of the North Pacific and, as adults, returning to the river to which they had been transplanted.																					0-85238-246-4				1999							168	181																WOS:000086510500012

The loss of P from soils to stream waters was more from catchments a with intensive dairy cattle farming in the west than from the less intensively stocked/arable catchments in the northeast, with striking differences being seen between the two regions. In the northeast, intensive animal farming caused less P loss in drainage water than arable management. Larger mean annual concentrations were seen in the west (0.076-0.142 mg PO4-P/l as molybdate-reactive phosphate-MRP) compared with the northeast (0.012-0.025 mg PO4-P/l), a feature caused by the combination of limited P-retention in the western Gleysols and smaller inputs to the largely-podzolic northeastern catchments.

We examined, experimentally, the effect of increasing irradiation-intensities on the combined photochemical and microbial degradation of CDOM and DOC. This was done by using a simulated mixed water column: aged water from a humic lake was exposed to four irradiation-intensities - representing winter, early and late spring, and summer conditions (0.10, 0.16, 0.36, and 0.58 W/m(2)) - and compared with dark controls over 37 days. We found a linear relationship between CDOM degradation and irradiation-intensities up to 0.36 W/m(2); the degradation rate saturated at higher intensities, both at specific wavelengths and for broader intervals. After 37 days at high irradiation-intensity, CDOM absorption of irradiation at 340 nm had been reduced by 41%; 48% of DOC had been removed and DOC degradation continued to increase. Aromaticity (SUVA(254)) declined significantly over 37 days at the two lowest but not at the two highest UV- intensities; levels in unexposed control water remained constant. Direct observations of the humic lake showed that CDOM absorption of irradiation (340 nm) declined by 27% from winter to summer. A model based on hydrological CDOM input and CDOM degradation calculated from field measurements of UV-radiation and experimental CDOM degradation with UV-exposure from sunlight accurately predicted the annual course as observed in the lake. With no external CDOM input, 92% of the CDOM could be degraded in a year. The results support the notion that combined photochemical and microbial CDOM degradation can be remarkably higher in lakes than previously thought and that humic lakes retain their color due to light absorption by ongoing CDOM input.

The Landsat TM images of the lake were analysed by remote sensing to study sediment and thermal plumes in the lake. A computer program, ''Integrated Image Computing System'' (IICS), was used for the analytical and numerical processing of the images. The temporal and spatial transport of sediments and thermal plumes were identified. In the summer and fall, regions of high turbidity were observed in the deep areas of the lake, at the shiping canal which is located at the center of the lake, while in the spring the high turbidity zones were observed along the shorelines of the lake. The surface temperature obtained by the remote sensing technique was in the same range as the temperatures measured at the same dates when the images were taken.																					1-896513-02-6				1996		6					795	807																WOS:A1996BH53J00077

Seasonal changes of abundance and biomass of Leptodora, that directly influence predatory impact, were analyzed and related to both abiotic and biotic parameters. The data suggest that Leptodora can influence the zooplankton community, but only in limited periods during the summer season, with the most pronounced impact in August. Leptodora can apparently accelerate the summer decline of spring cladoceran species, although it does not trigger the shift to summer species.

Silicate concentrations and phosphorus availability (inferred from P-32 incorporation) varied widely but had little direct influence on photosynthetic performance. W-B caused up to 80% loss of photosynthetic capacity in 1-day simulated surface exposures (artificial light) and up to 40% loss in half-day exposures (natural light), quantitatively consistent with reported responses of marine phytoplankton. The widely varying nutrient status and photoadaptive state (as inferred from photosynthetic light responses) of the phytoplankton had no significant influence on their sensitivity to UV-B radiation, and midsummer communities were as sensitive as spring or fall communities. To a first approximation, the impact of UV-B was proportional to the seasonal variation in surface UV-B irradiance being maximal near the summer solstice.

However, past changes of the EAWM have not been clearly established so far due to the lack of suitable proxy records. Here, we at first establish an index of the EAWM by comparing the results of a sediment trap experiment and 100-year sedimentary record from Huguang Maar Lake (HML) with modern records of the EAWM, Siberian High (SH) and Arctic Oscillation (AO). Secondly, we present a continuous record of the strength of the EAWM for the past 14,500 years based on sedimentary diatom assemblages in HML. The record is derived from fluctuations in the relative abundance of two planktonic diatom species. The link with the EAWM intensity is through high wind speeds inducing turbulent mixing, which stimulates the productivity of the meroplanktonic species Aulacoseira granulata. The diatom record of the past 14,500 years shows that the EAWM shifted from strong to weak from the early to late Holocene. This linked to both changes in winter temperature at high-latitudes and in El Nino conditions in the tropics. Our record shows that the EAWM and East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) as recorded in stalagmites, were in-phase instead of anti-correlated on orbital time scales during the Holocene. On a millennial time scales, the EAWM was anti-phase with the EASM during the Last Glacial Holocene transition. However, during the early middle Holocene the relationship between the EAWM and EASM shows spatial variations. In northern China, the records show significant anti-phase, but in southern China the anti-phase was not observed. During the late Holocene, we did not find any clear relationship between the EAWM and EASM. We also explored the link between the EAWM and the Australian summer monsoon (ASM). Anti-phase of the ASM with summer insolation in the Southern Hemisphere is an enigmatic exception that cannot be explained by the classic theory of insolation. During early Holocene the EAWM was in-phase with the Australian summer monsoon (ASM), which provides the first direct evidence to support the hypothesis that the intensity of the EAWM affected, at least in part, the strength of the ASM.

Differences in epicuticular wax structure were determined by scanning electron microscopy and quantified by a coefficient of occlusion. Statistically significant increases in stomatal occlusion occurred for the three O-3 bioindicator sites, with the higher O-3 sites having the most affected stomata for all three clones as well as for all treatments including elevated CO2, elevated O-3, and elevated CO2 + O-3. We recorded statistically significant differences between aspen clones and between sampling period (spring, summer, fall). We found no statistically significant differences between treatments or aspen clones in stomatal frequency. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The effects of salt exclusion during ice formation on circulation in lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL FLUID MECHANICS												Laboratory experiments have been performed to investigate the effects of salt exclusion on the behaviour of lakes with salinities up to 8 g L-1. At these salinities the freezing temperature is less than the temperature of maximum density and, unlike sea-ice, a reverse temperature stratification forms beneath the ice that can support at least some of the excluded salt. Temperature time series at four depths showed that salt exclusion drives cascades of localised overturning, while the persistence of reverse temperature stratification indicated that mixing was not complete. While our array of temperature sensors had insufficient spatial resolution to provide full details of the flow, we hypothesize that: at salinities of 1 and 2 g L-1 salt is released relatively uniformly and forms a layer of elevated salinity immediately below the ice, which supports double-diffusive salt-fingering; and at salinities of 4 and 8 g L-1, salt plumes penetrate the reverse stratification. After the ice melted, a relatively fresh surface layer formed above a more saline layer, sufficient to suppress spring turnover. Our measurements compare favourably with field observations from lakes, and highlight the importance of salt exclusion on biogeochemical processes in lakes.

FISH ARTIFICIALLY FED	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												The diurnal and annual locomotory activity cycles of four brown trout confined in separate cages on the bed of Windermere and fed artificially from the lake surface are described. The annual activity curves were very similar, the fish being less active during the winter than in the summer with maximum activity occurring in June and again in August. The diurnal activity patterns were also very similar with a sharp rise in activity at dawn each day after an inactive night, the increased activity being maintained throughout the light period and falling rapidly at dusk. Two of the fish were fed daily at irregular times and two were fed automatically every 2 hr. The similarity of the activity patterns of these four fish and also the similarity to the patterns of unfed fish described in a previous paper suggests that light and not food is the prime stimulus to locomotory activity in brown trout.																									1964	21	1					133	138		10.1139/f64-011	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f64-011													WOS:A1964WZ50500011

The ciliate remained active during winter, and contained chlorophyll even though the level of light available for photosynthesis was minimal.

A seasonal study in one of the lakes, Ace Lake, revealed that M. rubrum was present throughout the year at abundances ranging from 1 x 10(4) to 3.5 x 10(5) cells l(-1). During the winter period, when little light penetrated the lake's ice cover, cells were most common immediately under the ice at 2 m, where cell numbers were typically 8 x 10(4) cells l(-1).

Classic indicators and diel dissolved oxygen versus trend analysis in assessing eutrophication of potable-water reservoirs	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Potable source-water reservoirs are the main water supplies in many urbanizing regions, yet their long-term responses to cultural eutrophication are poorly documented in comparison with natural lakes, creating major management uncertainties. Here, long-term discrete data (June 2006-June 2018) for classical eutrophication water quality indicators, continuous depth-profile data for dissolved oxygen (DO), and an enhanced hybrid statistical trend analysis model were used to evaluate the eutrophication status of a potable source-water reservoir. Based on classical indicators (nitrogen, N and phosphorus, P concentrations and ratios; phytoplankton biomass as chlorophyll a, chl a; and trophic state indices), the reservoir was eutrophic to hypereutrophic and stoichiometrically imbalanced. Anoxia/hypoxia occurred for 7-8 months annually systemwide, even throughout the water column for days to weeks in some years; and elevated total ammonia (up to 900 mu g tNH(3) L-1) in surface waters from late summer/fall through late winter/early spring suggested substantial internal legacy nutrient loading. These surprising DO and tNH(3) phenomena may characterize many reservoirs in urbanizing areas, and the associated cascade of negative impacts may increasingly affect them under global warming. Total organic carbon (TOC), seasonally influenced by phytoplankton biomass, commonly exceeded 6 mg L-1, which is problematic for potable-water treatment, and significantly trended up over time. Wet-year inflow dilution influenced an apparent decreasing trend in nutrients within the hypereutrophic upper reservoir, which receives most tributary inputs. Nevertheless, significant reservoirwide trends (increasing total phosphorus [TP], phytoplankton chl a, TOC) and mid- and/or lower region trends (increasing total nitrogen [TN], tNH(3), decreasing TN:TP ratios) suggest that water quality degradation from eutrophication has worsened over time. These findings support broadly applicable recommendations to strengthen protection of potable source-water reservoirs in urbanizing watersheds: (1) protective numeric water quality criteria are needed for TOC as well as TN, TP, and chl a; (2) continuous diel data capture more realistic DO conditions than traditional sampling, and can provide important insights for water treatment managers; and (3) assessment of reservoir eutrophication status to track management progress over time should emphasize classic indicators equally as statistical trends, which are highly sensitive to short-term meteorological forcing						Reed, Robert E/0000-0002-2364-4584; Allen, Elle/0009-0001-3560-1768; Kinder, Carol/0000-0003-4210-1347													1051-0761	1939-5582				JUN	2022	32	4							e2541	10.1002/eap.2541	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eap.2541		MAR 2022						35072953					WOS:000774684600001

Inhibition of the decomposition of Zostera capricornii litter by macrobenthos and meiobenthos in a brackish coastal lake system	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												As part of the development of rapid assays to measure ecological processes, rates of decomposition of eelgrass, Zostera capricornii were measured using litter bags placed at different distances from the sea in a coastal lake system. Average loss of dry mass over 28 d in bags with coarse mesh, which excluded animals > 1.5 mm, varied from 364 to 448 mg in late winter to between 644 and 868 mg in autumn, depending on locality. Rates of loss were significantly greater in bags with small mesh (0.063 mm), from which all macrofauna were excluded, varying from 420 to 532 mg and from 868 to 924 mg in winter and autumn, respectively. There were consistent negative correlations between loss of litter and numbers of macrofauna and meiofauna in the bags. Rates of decrease in the organic fraction of the litter were positively correlated with numbers of animals. The results imply that the fauna inhibited decomposition, possibly by reducing microbial populations through grazing.																			1559-2723	1559-2731				OCT	2006	29	5					802	809		10.1007/BF02786531	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02786531													WOS:000241837400009

However, remote estimates of chl-a can be difficult in water bodies that have high levels of total suspended matter (TSM). In this study, we examined the applicability of the synthetic chlorophyll index (SCI) and a parameter relevant to chlorophyll pigments (H-chl) used in conjunction with remote-sensing data to predict chl-a concentrations (Cchl-a) in Taihu Lake, a highly turbid hypereutrophic lake in eastern China. We sampled water quality and surface spectral properties at 250 field stations throughout the lake over five sampling periods spanning 2years. Because data acquired at 31 stations could not be used due to equipment failure or blue-green algal blooms, we used data acquired at the remaining 219 stations. We then randomly selected parts of the spectral properties data (N=164) to calibrate bands used in the SCI algorithm and established cubic polynomial models to estimate Cchl-a with SCI and H-chl as the independent variables. We evaluated the accuracy of these models using data from the remaining 55 stations that were not used for calibration. Our results showed the following trends: (1) the parameter of H-chl performed better than SCI in estimating C-chla in Taihu Lake; (2) H-chl showed optimal performance in winter, average performance in spring, and poor performance in summer and autumn; (3) H-chl was appropriate for the NAP-dominant waters with high C-TSM and low Cchl-a, but was not suitable for organism-dominant waters with low C-TSM; and (4) in short, H-chl had limited usability in turbid and eutrophic waters.					; wu, yuanfeng/GVU-6762-2022; Zhang, Bing/JOZ-7091-2023; Zou, Lei/AAV-8227-2020	Zou, Lei/0000-0001-6206-3558; wu, yuan feng/0000-0001-8427-9851; 													0143-1161	1366-5901				JAN 2	2014	35	1					289	305		10.1080/01431161.2013.870679	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2013.870679													WOS:000328812200018

Beavers living in river habitat had larger summer home ranges than those living in ponds (p < 0.05), but there were no differences between river and lake or pond and lake dwelling beavers (p>0.05). However, when non-family Beavers were excluded from the analysis, there was no significant difference in home range size among the habitats (p>0.05). Summer core areas were significantly smaller for pond Beavers than for river animals (p<0.05) when non-family Beavers were included, but not when they were excluded from the analysis (p>0.05), and there were no differences between pond and lake or river and lake animals (p>0.05). In fall there were no differences in home range or core area size among the habi tats (p>0.05). The percent of the home range included in the core area did not differ among the habitats in summer or fall (p>0.05). The percent of activity occurring in the core area did not differ among the habitats in summer, but in fall core activity was greater for lake than river Beavers regardless of whether non-family Beavers were included in the analysis (p<0.05), but there were no differences between pond and river or pond and lake (p>0.05).																			0008-3550					APR-JUN	1997	111	2					217	222																WOS:A1997XJ31500006

Although annual temperatures remained relatively constant (21 +/- 4degreesC), densities of T. prasinus mexicanus displayed a bimodal pattern, with highest densities during the summer and winter. Also, the vertical water column was nearly homeothermal, but all life stages avoided the top 2 m of the water column during clear summer days and utilized this stratum during the winter when light was reduced. Females within the population were egg-bearing throughout the entire year, which led to high annual mean densities (>200 animals/L).

This study investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and its interactions with water quality parameters in Giheung Reservoir, South Korea. Monthly water samples were collected at three depths, measuring fifteen physicochemical properties alongside DOM characterization using Excitation-Emission Matrix Parallel Factor Analysis (EEM-PARAFAC), identifying four DOM components: C1 (microbial protein-like), C2 (humic-like), C3 (terrestrial humic-like), and C4 (tyrosine/tryptophan-like). Seasonal stratification influenced DOM distribution, with humic-like DOM (C2, C3) accumulating in deeper layers during summer, while proteinlike DOM (C1, C4) dominated surface waters due to enhanced biological productivity, and mixing periods homogenizing DOM across depths. The dimictic thermal regime, with moderate summer stratification and full mixing in spring and autumn, governed these patterns. 2D correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS) identified sequential DOM variation across layers, with humic-like DOM increasing at depth during stratification. Fluorescence indices-Fluorescence Index (FI), Humification Index (HIX), and Biological Index (BIX)-were integrated into structural equation modeling (SEM), showing that temperature and dissolved oxygen strongly drive protein-like DOM, while nitrogen and phosphorus compounds shape DOM reactivity. These findings enhance understanding of DOM biogeochemical processes and provide valuable insights for reservoir management to maintain water quality.

Three out of eight recorded species of chydorids were common, with abundance minima in late summer and maxima in autumn. Eurycercus lamellatus (O. F. Muller, 1776) and Acroperus harpae (Baird, 1835) were monocyclic, whereas Chydorus sphaericus (O.F. Muller, 1776) was seemingly acyclic. Females of E. lamellatus appeared in early June and grew to maximum sizes of 2-2.5 mm in early August. Parthenogenesis started in late July and two summer generations could be distinguished by size distributions. Gamogenesis took place in September. Acroperus harpae females appeared in early June and grew to maximum sizes of around 0.7 mm in early August. Parthenogenesis started in early July and gamogenesis took place in September and October. Parthenogenetic females of C. sphaericus appeared already at ice-break and had constant sizes of around 0.4 mm through the entire season. Males or ephippial females were not observed. The acyclic life history may be an adaptation to the challenging environment of this subarctic lake. Summer generations could not be distinguished in the two small-sized species, but both populations reached high abundances in autumn. The abundance of E. lamellatus increased from August, but then decreased, possibly as a result of fish predation. We argue that the present results are typical for large oligotrophic lakes in subarctic Europe.

The detailed analysis of the spatial variability of the effect of NAO on water levels in lakes concerned 19 lakes with statistically uniform hydrometric material. Two matrices were obtained for each of the lakes, composed of 156 coefficients of correlation calculated between monthly water stages and monthly and seasonal NAO indices. They provided the basis for performing two variants of classification of lakes by Ward's method. Four typological classes were distinguished for each variant. It was determined that stronger correlations occur in the case of water stages in lakes with seasonal than those with monthly NAO indices. The strongest effect of NAO on water stages is observed in the winter-spring period. Spatial variability of the effect has been recorded, resulting from the climatic conditions of a given region. Lakes located in the south-western part of the studied area constitute an evidently separate group. In the negative phase of NAO, they are distinguished by higher water stages in the winter-spring period. This may be associated with more frequent thaws during winters, and increased supply to lakes in the period.

The role of warm, dry summers and variation in snowpack on phytoplankton dynamics in mountain lakes	ECOLOGY												Climate change is altering biogeochemical, metabolic, and ecological functions in lakes across the globe. Historically, mountain lakes in temperate regions have been unproductive because of brief ice-free seasons, a snowmelt-driven hydrograph, cold temperatures, and steep topography with low vegetation and soil cover. We tested the relative importance of winter and summer weather, watershed characteristics, and water chemistry as drivers of phytoplankton dynamics. Using boosted regression tree models for 28 mountain lakes in Colorado, we examined regional, intraseasonal, and interannual drivers of variability in chlorophyllaas a proxy for lake phytoplankton. Phytoplankton biomass was inversely related to the maximum snow water equivalent (SWE) of the previous winter, as others have found. However, even in years with average SWE, summer precipitation extremes and warming enhanced phytoplankton biomass. Peak seasonal phytoplankton biomass coincided with the warmest water temperatures and lowest nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratios. Although links between snowpack, lake temperature, nutrients, and organic-matter dynamics are increasingly recognized as critical drivers of change in high-elevation lakes, our results highlight the additional influence of summer conditions on lake productivity in response to ongoing changes in climate. Continued changes in the timing, type, and magnitude of precipitation in combination with other global-change drivers (e.g., nutrient deposition) will affect production in mountain lakes, potentially shifting these historically oligotrophic lakes toward new ecosystem states. Ultimately, a deeper understanding of these drivers and pattern at multiple scales will allow us to anticipate ecological consequences of global change better.					; Oleksy, Isabella/AAD-2249-2021	Lammers, Roderick/0000-0002-1507-8631; JOHNSON, PIETER/0000-0002-7997-5390; Oleksy, Isabella/0000-0003-2572-5457; Beck, Whitney/0000-0002-0306-6086													0012-9658	1939-9170				OCT	2020	101	10								10.1002/ecy.3132	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.3132		SEP 2020						32628277					WOS:000569446300001

Ice Cover and Extreme Events Determine Dissolved Oxygen in a Placid Mountain Lake	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												A decrease in hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen (DO) is a commonly seen effect of climate change. However, in oligotrophic Lake Tovel (Italy), a deep mountain lake, annual mean DO (% saturation) has increased from near anoxia to >20% in the bottom layer (35-39 m). We analyzed long-term patterns of DO (1937-2019) using different methods (correlation and trend analysis, identification of extreme events) to link DO to drivers and indices of mixing. While spring mixing remained temporally limited, later ice-in (5.1 days decade(-1)) and the positive relationship between ice-in and DO the following year evidenced autumn mixing as the main driver for hypolimnetic DO increase. Extreme meteorological events also replenished hypolimnetic DO. Using DO and conductivity (1995-2019), we identified 14 deep mixing events with hypolimnetic DO > 40%. Density-based indices (Schmidt stability, relative thermal resistance, Lake Number, and Wedderburn Number) only partially captured these events that were related to snowmelt, flooding, and cold spells during spring and autumn, with a carryover effect sometimes lasting >1 year. Recently, annual mean DO in the upper layer decreased beyond temperature-dependent solubility. This decrease was not comprehensively confirmed by statistical tests but was possibly linked to atmospheric stilling. We suggest that Lake Tovel's shift from meromixis to dimixis was driven by climate warming (i.e., increasing air temperature 0.6 degrees C decade(-1)) that delayed ice-in and increased autumn mixing. Our work underlines the vulnerability of mountain lakes and their different response to climate change with respect to more studied lowland lakes.

Our data corroborate findings from literature that climate developments apparently contrast between the summer rainfall zone (SRZ) and winter rainfall zone (WRZ) over the last 9900years, especially during the early and middle Holocene. During the early Holocene (9900-7800 cal. yr BP), a minimum of grass pollen suggests low summer rainfall in the SRZ, and the initial presence of Renosterveld vegetation indicates relatively wet conditions in the WRZ. Toward the middle Holocene (7800-2400 cal. yr BP), a rather moist savanna/grassland rich in grasses suggests higher summer rainfall in the SRZ resulting from increased austral summer insolation and a decline of fynbos vegetation accompanied by an increasing Succulent Karoo vegetation in the WRZ, which possibly suggests a southward shift of the Southern Hemisphere westerlies. During the last 2200years, a trend toward higher aridity was observed for the SRZ, while the climate in the WRZ remained relatively stable. The Little Ice Age' (ca. 700-200 cal. yr BP) was rather cool in both rainfall zones and drier in the SRZ while it was wetter in the WRZ.					; Wefer, Gerold/S-2291-2016; Gerold, Wefer/S-2291-2016; Schefuß, Enno/A-7101-2015; Wu, Weichao/Q-6501-2018; Meadows, Michael/AAH-2461-2020; Schefuss, Enno/A-7101-2015	Dupont, Lydie/0000-0001-9531-6793; Wefer, Gerold/0000-0002-6803-2020; Zhao, Xueqin/0000-0003-3354-3768; Wu, Weichao/0000-0001-8728-5990; Meadows, Michael/0000-0001-8322-3055; Schefuss, Enno/0000-0002-5960-930X													0959-6836	1477-0911				JUN	2016	26	6					843	857		10.1177/0959683615622544	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683615622544													WOS:000376305700002

We use sequential sediment traps in southern Lake Michigan (1997-2000) to capture settling Daphnia ephippia and sediments, characterizing ephippial production and sediment interactions during hazardous conditions. Each year, there was an enormous pulse of A mendotae ephippia (ca. 7.2 x 10(13) ephippia, 1.2 x 10(14) diapausing eggs) that coincided with autumn population decline. Most ephippia settled through the water column, although a few were captured at the water surface and blown shoreward. The duration and amplitude of the autumn ephippial fluxes were similar among years. Ephippial production was positively correlated with water column depth, a consequence of Daphnia spatial abundance. In contrast, resuspension of ephippia was inversely related to water column depth and spatially complex, influenced by waves, coastal currents, and offshore gyre circulation. Large winter storms created nearshore sediment plumes, could resuspend vast numbers of ephippia (e.g., 10 March 1998 storm; 1.9 x 10(12) ephippia and 3.1 x 10(12) diapausing eggs), and were important in the formation of "egg banks." Almost all newly produced and resuspended diapausing eggs came from D. mendotae, with very few from two other species (D. retrocurva, D. dentifera) that dominated waters 12 yr ago. These observations suggest a relatively short relaxation time for species cycling out of egg banks in Lake Michigan (<10 yr), due in part to (1) differential resuspension of unconsolidated versus consolidated sediments and (2) the spatially restricted nature of "high-sedimentation" zones. Our study is the first use of sequential sediment traps to document diapause egg production.

J	Carmack, E; Vagle, S				Carmack, Eddy; Vagle, Svein			Thermobaric Processes Both Drive and Constrain Seasonal Ventilation in Deep Great Slave Lake, Canada	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												The contrasting roles of seasonal stratification and seasonal ventilation are among the most important attributes of lake systems in defining their geochemistry, biology and response to climate forcing. The physical processes that regulate these processes are especially significant in very deep lakes, where the joint effect of temperature and pressure on water density becomes important. Here we report on a year-long time series (2019-2020) of temperature from a mooring deployed in seasonally ice covered and dimictic Great Slave Lake (614 m depth). Because the temperature of maximum density (T-MD) decreases with increasing pressure, once similar to 4 degrees C water begins to sink, it is no longer at its depth-specific maximum density and additional processes are required to drive convection and convective mixing. The key physical mechanism governing deep-water renewal is the conditional thermobaric instability. We show here that (a) different temperature dynamics control the quantity and timing of convective renewal in the upper similar to 200 m versus deep-water renewal below; (b) fall and spring deep-water renewal events are asymmetric and linked to weather during the brief time of ice forming (melting) and surface temperatures cooling (warming) through 4 degrees C; (c) short term variability (days to weeks) related to the length of time between surface waters passing through T-MD and ice formation (fall) and melt (spring) shapes the subsequent thermal structure; and (d) the penetration of solar radiation through ice in early spring drives penetrative convection in the upper layer, deepening the mixed-layer, and this likely affects the timing of spring phytoplankton production. Plain Language Summary Seasonal water stratification and exchange of heat, water and gases with the overlying atmosphere are important attributes of lakes in defining their geochemistry, biology and response to climate change. The physical processes that regulate these are especially important in very deep lakes, like Great Slave Lake (GSL) (614 m depth). Here we use data from a yearlong mooring of thermistors in GSL (2019-2020) to investigate the physical processes that are important and show that these processes likely affects the timing of spring phytoplankton production in the lake. Key Points The key physical mechanism governing deep-water renewal in very deep Great Slave Lake is the conditional thermobaric instability Waters below the thermobaric horizon (similar to 200 m) maintain permanent stratification due to thermobaric effects and are ventilated by downwelling events and intrusions Fall and spring deep water renewal events are asymmetric and linked to weather during the brief time of ice forming (melting) and surface temperatures cooling (warming) through 4 degrees C																			2169-9003	2169-9011				DEC	2021	126	12							e2021JF006288	10.1029/2021JF006288	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JF006288													WOS:000757163400001

Year-round patterns in bacterial production and biomass in Lake Simcoe, Ontario, Canada: are heterotrophic bacteria a significant contributor to low hypolimnetic oxygen?	INLAND WATERS												Bacteria serve an important function in aquatic environments and are associated with nutrient regeneration, carbon (C) metabolism, and secondary production. This is the first study to measure heterotrophic bacterial production, abundance, biomass, and biovolume in Lake Simcoe, Ontario. Excessive phosphorus loading resulting in low hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations has impacted the cold-water fishery in Lake Simcoe. We tested the hypothesis that bacteria contributed to dissolved oxygen declines in Lake Simcoe and examined the environmental factors impacting bacterial activity. Spatial and temporal variations in the microbial community were measured from June 2010 to July 2011. A dual-isotope method (H-3-TdR and C-14-leu) was used, resulting in mean (+/- standard deviation) annual epilimnetic bacterial production estimates of 0.130 +/- 0.173 and 0.268 +/- 0.304 mu g C L-1 h(-1), respectively. The mean annual bacterial abundance was 1.49 +/- 1.53 cells x 10(9) L-1, with a mean biomass of 1.21 +/- 1.34 mu g C L-1 and a mean biovolume of 0.0043 +/- 0.0030 mu m(3) cell(-1). These estimates had distinct seasonal patterns, with consistently lower bacterial activity in the winter relative to the spring, summer, and fall. Differences between epilimnetic and hypolimnetic bacterial activity were inconsistent for the 4 bacterial parameters measured. Lake temperature, chlorophyll a, and dissolved organic C concentrations were the most significant factors influencing the annual epilimnetic patterns in the examined bacterial parameters. Annual bacterial production was low in Lake Simcoe and does not seem to be a major contributor to the low hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations in the lake.																			2044-2041	2044-205X					2013	3	2					235	252		10.5268/IW-3.2.536	http://dx.doi.org/10.5268/IW-3.2.536													WOS:000318267500010

Duelling narratives of chironomids and pollen explain climate enigmas during The Last Glacial-Interglacial transition in North Island New Zealand	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The Last Glacial-Interglacial Transition (LGIT) was a dynamic stage of Earth's history, and the difficulty of reconstructing this complex interval may be compounded by divergent proxy records, often collected from the same archive. To overcome this obstacle, we exploit the contrasting biological preferences of chironomids to both summer temperature and degree days (positive) and pollen to both the length of the growing season (positive) and winter duration (negative), recorded by a small lake in the central North Island of New Zealand. The climate proxy records are anchored to shifting zonal boundaries (e.g., southern westerly wind belt) via the hydrogen isotope ratios of leaf wax n-alkanes (delta D-wax). These results enable us to interrogate the structure of the LGIT and address two fundamental questions: 1) Is there evidence for Holocene-like temperatures during the early deglacial? and 2) Were early Holocene summers cool? Lake sediment delta D-wax values indicate a poleward retreat of the westerlies around 18,000 calibrated years before present (cal kyr BP), signalling the onset of climate amelioration for the region. Remarkably, the independently derived summer and mean annual temperature reconstructions are anti-phased. Chironomid-inferred summer temperatures surpass modern values by 17.5 cal kyr BP, whereas polleninferred mean annual temperatures remain supressed. Summers cool from 17.5 to 11 cal kyr BP, when they reach a minimum for the record, while winter and mean annual temperatures simultaneously warm to a maximum. The chironomid record generally traces regional insolation, although an Antarctic template imprints on this trend with declining summer temperatures during the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR) and warming during the Younger Dryas (YD). Forest development during the early LGIT, on the other hand, is supressed by cool, dry winters, punctuated by severe frosts, despite being set against a backdrop of overall warming; the successional pattern is best explained by a latitudinal retreat of the westerlies. Our findings underscore the complementarity of multiple bioproxy responses and reveal the importance of seasonal heat and energy distribution during the LGIT. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

While ecological corridors enhance connectivity and biodiversity, specific mechanisms by which landscape composition and configuration influence bird diversity remain unclear. This study examines bird community distribution along the Qingshan Lake Greenway in Hangzhou during autumn and winter, using 17 observation points across wetlands, forests, and mixed habitats. The key findings indicate that wetlands have significantly higher species richness compared to forests and mixed habitats, underscoring wetlands' critical role in supporting diverse bird communities. Greenways primarily facilitate short-distance bird movement with limited permeability between habitats. Additionally, greenway effectiveness in enhancing bird diversity depends heavily on design and structural characteristics. This research highlights the necessity of incorporating microhabitat design and diverse habitat configurations in greenway planning to enhance ecological connectivity and biodiversity. It provides essential insights for urban planners and ecologists, emphasizing detailed landscape composition and configuration analyses. Future research should include year-round studies and advanced ecological monitoring technologies to validate and expand these findings, ultimately contributing to more effective urban biodiversity conservation and sustainable development strategies.																				2073-445X				AUG	2024	13	8							1192	10.3390/land13081192	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land13081192													WOS:001306009800001

The weight, fattening rate and length of stay of spring passage birds varied from one site to another. In scrub and thicket at Kariobangi, Nairobi, passage and new arrival continued each year into May. Few birds stayed to fatten and weights over 16 g (40% above mean winter weight) were practically never recorded. At Lake Nakuru, thousands of birds were present during late April-early May 1972. Many stayed to fatten for 1-3 wk and weights over 16 g (maximum 21.5 g) were not uncommon. New arrivals of lean birds continued into May. At Athi River, in 1971, many of the birds present during mid-late April stayed 1-2 wk and fattened rapidly and 20% of all late April weights were in the range 16-21 g. Mean fattening rates at Nakuru and Athi River were 0.31 and 0.64 g/day, respectively. The migration strategy and potential flight range of Kenyan spring birds was discussed.

Record flooding of the Illinois River, Illinois, in 2013 reconnected two floodplain preserves under restoration that had been disconnected from the river by levees for > 80 years. Differences in hydrological connections between sites created a natural experiment where field-based data collection could be employed to document flood effects. Levee failure and subsequent river connection at Merwin Preserve increased nutrient capture and floodwater retention, shifted microbial and invertebrate communities, increased fish species richness, spawning and nursery habitat, and stimulated production of moist-soil plant communities during summer drawdown that provided foraging habitat for spring-migrating waterfowl. However, increased hydrologic connectivity during the growing season resulted in loss of submersed vegetation and habitat for autumn-migrating waterfowl. In contrast, river water overtopped the levee at Emiquon Preserve during a 6-day event that resulted in marginal changes in the bacterial community and negligible changes in water quality and community diversity. Tradeoffs among ecological services should be carefully considered when reconnection of highly altered rivers to restored lakes and wetlands is proposed.					; Casper, Andrew/B-3179-2013; Kent, Angela/D-6124-2011; Lemke, Mike/AFC-8860-2022	Casper, Andrew/0000-0003-3450-0209; Dungey, Keenan/0000-0002-9920-2280; Lemke, Michael/0000-0002-3714-3617													0018-8158	1573-5117				DEC	2017	804	1					151	175		10.1007/s10750-017-3220-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-017-3220-5													WOS:000414375700010
J	Irwin, BJ; DeVries, DR; Wright, RA				Irwin, BJ; DeVries, DR; Wright, RA			Evaluating the potential for predatory control of gizzard shad by largemouth bass in small impoundments: A bioenergetics approach	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum is an important fish species that call have strong effects on aquatic communities throughout the southeastern and midwestern USA. Gizzard shad often become overabundant, competitively reducing growth and recruitment of sport fishes. Using field data and bioenergetics simulations, we evaluated the potential for largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides to control the abundance of gizzard shad in small impoundments. We sampled 1.313 largemouth bass stomachs, of which 66% contained prey, from four ponds during 1998 and 1999. Large (greater than or equal to350-mm) largemouth bass consumed the greatest biomass of gizzard shad, eating gizzard shad throughout most of the year. Gizzard shad were more abundant in the stomach contents of largemouth bass less than 350 nun long during late summer and early fall than during winter and early spring. Variation in the mortality of predatory largemouth bass (21% versus 31%), as estimated from weighted catch-curves, resulted in only slight variation (6-7%) in estimates for total annual consumption of gizzard shad. Using Population estimates from the ponds, we considered three predator densities (low - 49/ha: intermediate = 172/ha; and high = 351/ha) in our simulations. Bioenergetics simulations suggested that largemouth bass Populations in these ponds at intermediate and high densities could annually consume between 50 and 186 kg/ha of gizzard shad. Comparison of all estimated range of age-0 gizzard shad abundances and bioenergetics estimates of predator consumption indicated that largemouth bass predation could regulate the abundance of age-0 gizzard shad in small ponds.

Yr BP cooling event in southern Sweden	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Highly resolved sediment stratigraphic and stable isotope records from a lake in south-central Sweden give evidence of relatively humid summers during the wide-spread cold event at c. 8200 cal. BP. A transient lake-level rise led to increased catchment erosion followed by enhanced phytoplankton production and disturbance of the Chara-dominated algal community. An associated increase in the deposition of organic material resulted in hypolimnetic oxygen deficit and methane formation as inferred from elevated sulphur content of the sediments and strong depletion in (13)C of bulk organic material. In combination with dry and cold winter conditions as revealed by other proxy records, these data suggest the development of a strongly seasonal climate in northwestern Europe in response to altered atmospheric circulation at this stage. Enhanced zonal circulation with frequent cyclonic activity and increased effective humidity probably characterized the summer climate of southern and central Scandinavia, consistent with conditions inferred for continental Europe. In contrast, the winter climate was dominated by blocking high-pressure circulation, giving rise to cold and dry conditions.

J	Bijak, S				Bijak, Szymon			TREE-RING CHRONOLOGY OF SILVER FIR AND ITS DEPENDENCE ON CLIMATE OF THE KASZUBSKIE LAKELAND (NORTHERN POLAND)	GEOCHRONOMETRIA												The current paper presents investigation of the response of silver firs growing near Kartuzy in the Kaszubskie Lakeland (northern Poland) to climate conditions. Tree-ring width series covering the period of 1914-2006 were built and correlated with mean monthly temperature and precipitation. Dependence of the growth of analysed firs on winter, early spring and summer temperature was observed. Significant relation to moisture availability was detected only for January. Analysis of pointer years revealed similar driving forces that were obtained by correlation and response function investigation. Reaction of firs from the Kaszubskie Lakeland to the extreme climate conditions is analogous to the exhibited at other sites of this species localised outside distribution range. Investigated silver firs seem to have found favourable growth conditions in the studied area and further cultivation of that species in northern Poland may turn to be successful.						bijak, szymon/0000-0001-5298-6105													1897-1695						2010	35						91	94		10.2478/v10003-010-0001-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10003-010-0001-9													WOS:000280107900010

Seasonal dynamics of the exotic Daphnia lumholtzii and native macro-zooplankton species were studied for 2 years in six inter-connected lakes in Florida, U.S.A. The lakes ranged widely in pH, colour and trophic status, and were dominated by copepods. 2. Ail six lakes contained both D. lumholtzii and the native D. ambigua, but the two species did not overlap in time. D, ambigua was dominant in autumn-spring, coinciding with lower water temperature, higher transparency and lower nutrient and chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations than in summer, when D. lumholtzii was dominant. 3. Based on the field observations, temperature optima were 24 degrees C for D. ambigua and 29 degrees C for D. lumholtzii, suggesting that temperature plays a role in determining dominance among the daphnids of subtropical Florida lakes. 4. D. lumholtzii has not displaced native cladocerans but occupies a 'vacant' seasonal niche, unexploited due to the inability of native taxa to tolerate high temperature. Furthermore, D. lumholtzii did not significantly alter algal-zooplankton interactions. There was evidence of top-down control by grazing, but it was primarily attributable to the native taxa.					east, t/KVY-8260-2024														0046-5070	1365-2427				SEP	2000	45	1					21	32		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00614.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00614.x													WOS:000089718300002

Sunlight, season, snowmelt, storm, and source affect E. coli populations in an artificially ponded stream	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Reducing fecal indicator bacteria, such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), in streams is important for many downstream areas. E. coli concentrations within streams may be reduced by intervening ponds or wetlands through a number of physical and biological means. A section of Dunes Creek, a small coastal stream of southern Lake Michigan, was impounded and studied for 30 months from pre-through post-construction of the experimental pond. E. coli reduction became more predictable and effective with pond age. E. coli followed the hydrograph and increased several-fold during both rainfall and snowmelt events. Seasonally, the pond was more effective at reducing E. coli during summer than winter. Late summer, non-solar reduction or inactivation of E. coli in the pond was estimated at 72% and solar inactivation at 26%. E. coli DNA fingerprinting demonstrated that the winter population was genetically more homogeneous than the summer population. Detection of FRNA coliphages suggests that there was fecal contamination during heavy rain events. An understanding of how environmental factors interact with E. coli populations is important for assessing anticipated contaminant loading and the reduction of indicator bacteria in downstream reaches.

Biotic and Abiotic Factors Affecting the Population Dynamics of Ceratium hirundinella, Peridinium cinctum, and Peridiniopsis elpatiewskyi	DIVERSITY-BASEL												The present research was conducted to assess the impact of abiotic and biotic factors on the growth of freshwater dinoflagellates such as Ceratium hirundinella, Peridinium cinctum, and Peridiniopsis elpatiewskyi, which reduce the quality of drinking water in the Zayandeh Rud Reservoir. To this end, 152 algal and zoological samples were collected from the reservoir located in the Central part of Iran in January, April, July, and October 2011. Abiotic factors such as pH, temperature, conductivity, transparency, dissolved oxygen, and nutrient concentration of the water were measured in all study stations. The results showed that the population dynamics of dinoflagellates in the Zayandeh Rud Reservoir was different depending on season, station, and depth. The findings proved that C. hirundinella was one of the dominant autumn planktons in the highest biovolume in the Zayandeh Rud Reservoir. While P. elpatiewskyi was present in the reservoir throughout a year with biovolume peak in summer. Accompanying bloom of P. elpatiewskyi and C. hirundinella, P. cinctum also grew in well-heated summer and autumn waters. It was further found that Ceratium density was positively correlated with sulfate ion concentrations, while the growth of P. cinctum and P. elpatiewskyi were associated, first and foremost, with NO2- and Mn.

Exclosure experiments were repeated in summer and winter, under high and low natural fish abundance, respectively. Fish exclusion effects on detritus processing and fungal conditioning were consistent with trophic cascade predictions only in summer. In winter, however, results indicated that a trophic cascade was induced by predatory invertebrates. In both seasons, variations in detritivores abundance generally supported a cascade scenario, whereas several taxon-specific departures occurred during the experimental periods. We conclude suggesting that predators may continuously regulate leaf detritus processing in lake littoral zones, through a seasonal shift in the relative contribution of fish and invertebrate predation.					; Mancinelli, Giorgio/A-7679-2013; mancinelli, giorgio/A-7679-2013	ROSSI, LORETO/0000-0001-8014-5397; mancinelli, giorgio/0000-0002-5833-7322; Costantini, Maria Letizia/0000-0001-6242-558X													1434-2944						2007	92	2					117	134		10.1002/iroh.200510962	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.200510962													WOS:000246906800003
J	Xi, X				Xi, Xin			On the Geomorphic, Meteorological, and Hydroclimatic Drivers of the Unusual 2018 Early Summer Salt Dust Storms in Central Asia	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												A series of synoptically forced dust events, including an extreme salt storm from the Aralkum desert, stuck large parts of Central Asia during early summer 2018, causing flight cancellation, widespread haze, and salt deposition on croplands. This manuscript explores the geomorphic, meteorological, and hydroclimatic drivers of the unusual dust activity based on the three prerequisite factors of dust outbreak: sediment supply, sediment availability, and dust-uplifting winds. Dry lake beds and lower river floodplains are identified as the source area of frequent dust episodes likely due to the abundant supply of fine-grain sediments. Whereas, minimal dust activity was detected at the region's major sandy deserts. The salt dust storms were triggered by cold intrusion and strong postfrontal winds at the southeast flank of a rapidly developing anticyclone over western Russia which was enhanced by the Scandinavian blocking upstream. The 2018 early summer dust events in Central Asia were identified as part of spatially compounding weather hazards linked to a slow-moving synoptic wave pattern across the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes. Finally, the aeolian sediment availability at the dust source areas was enhanced by below-average soil moisture and vegetation during summer 2018 linked to reduced precipitation in the preceding winter. The 2017/18 winter precipitation deficit was driven by a double-dip, Central Pacific La Nina episode associated with large-scale precipitation-suppressing subsidence and enhanced moisture flux divergence over Central Asia.

Juvenile (340 to 432 mm eye to fork length) paddlefish (N=32) exhibited variable movement patterns but remained in the upper reservoir reaches throughout the three-year study. Movement rates ranged from 35 to 3,464 m/h with 90% of all locations in the upper third (51 km) of the reservoir. Increased movement rates were weakly correlated with increased water temperature (r=O. 16, P=0.04). Daytime paddlefish movement peaked in July and August. However, diel movements were variable among seasons. In spring, movement rates did not differ among diel periods, whereas summer movements were lower during crepuscular periods and fall movements were lowest during the day. Although paddlefish were stocked at two locations in Lake Francis Case, they appeared to disperse and use reservoir areas similarly.

Spring cold water intrusions as the beginningof the cold intermediate layer formation in the Baltic sea	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Thermohaline intrusions are a typical feature of the Baltic Sea water body. We report observations of vivid colder/saltier intrusion activity in intermediate layers and upper pycnocline of the Gdansk Bay (the south-eastern part of the Baltic Sea) in early spring (March-April, 2013). Extremely low water temperature (down to 1.4-2 degrees C) and specific water salinity (S((A) over tilde)7.5-7.8) of the intrusions point at a possible area of the intrusion waters formation: within the upper mixed layer in the Arkona/Bornholm basins at the end of March. Data on water temperature and salinity available from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) data repository, data of the Arkona Becken automated station, meteorological information, and remote sensing data for March-April 2013 are used to confirm the conclusions. It is confirmed once again that the transfer from the two-layered winter water stratification to the three-layered summer one in the Baltic Sea is a consequence of the sea-scale exchange process. The latter is manifested as simultaneous advection in upper and intermediate layers of waters with lower and higher salinity, correspondingly. The reported extremely cold intrusions indicate the beginning of the formation of the Cold Intermediate Layer (CIL), which thus contains waters of the Arkona/Bornholm basins. The main environmental factors driving the observed vivid intrusions in April 2013 are easterly winds and negative buoyancy fluxes due to seasonal solar heating of waters with the temperature below that of the density maximum. Substantial prolongation of the period of seasonal vertical mixing might be the most important process related to the transition of water temperature over the temperature of the density maximum (T-md) in the Baltic Sea. With the climate warming, the cooling of surface waters below the T-md becomes rare, limiting deep ventilation of Baltic waters in spring.

Multi-year landscape-scale assessment of lakewater balances in the Slave River Delta, NWT, using water isotope tracers	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												We apply a coupled-isotope tracer model to quantify end-of-thaw-season (fall) lakewater balances in the Slave River Delta (SRD), Canada, during 2003-2005, which effectively differentiates the relative importance of hydrological processes across this complex northern freshwater landscape. The model incorporates Great Slave Lake evaporated vapour to the ambient atmospheric vapour pool and is thus tailored to the hydroclimatic setting of the delta, which experiences onshore winds. Results, expressed as evaporation-to-inflow ratios (E/I) for 41 delta lakes, reflect the role of spring break-up flooding and local hydrological setting. Fall E/I ratios for lakes where water balances are dominated by exchange with the Slave River or Great Slave Lake are low (0.06-0.53) and do not vary substantially during the three-year monitoring period. E/I ratios for flood-dominated lakes in the active delta are moderate (0.26-0.98) and have low inter-annual variability, even in the absence of spring flooding. This suggests that annual flooding during the spring break-up period is not necessary to maintain positive (E/I < 1) water balances in flood-dominated lakes, but multiple years without flooding would clearly lead to greater cumulative evaporation. Fall E/I ratios are generally higher and more variable in evaporation-dominated lakes in the relict delta (0.42 to > 1), although greater snowmelt runoff tends to occur in sub-sectors with mature spruce forest and offsets open-water vapour loss. Our results indicate that spring inputs (river flooding and snowmelt runoff) are key components of the hydrological evolution of SRD lakes during the openwater season, and distinguish regions of the delta where expected declines in river discharge and climate warming will likely cause lake-level drawdown. Such findings have particular relevance for informed ecosystem management in the Peace-Athabasca-Slave watershed, where unprecedented industrial development is imposing substantial additional pressure on freshwater resources.

J	Rupasinghe, PA; Chow-Fraser, P				Rupasinghe, Prabha Amali; Chow-Fraser, Patricia			Relating pre-fire canopy species, fire season, and proximity to surface waters to burn severity of boreal wildfires in Alberta, Canada	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Increased global temperature, drought, and extreme weather have increased the frequency and intensity of wildfires in Canadian Boreal forests. We examined how burn severity was related to canopy species composition and proximity to water in six large boreal forest stands across northern Alberta (two in the Bistcho Lake region, three in Wood Buffalo National Park, and one in the Richardson backcountry) and a smaller stand close to the town of Slave Lake (204-5217 km(2)). We used Landsat 5, 7, and 8 satellite images that included two phenological stages (spring, summer, or fall), followed by Support Vector Machines (SVM) classification to map the distribution of pre-fire canopy species. To quantify the burn severity of each fire, we used the Landsat images to calculate the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR); we then combined dNBR for all affected areas to develop the Standardised Burn Impact Score (SBIS), that quantifies the average impact of each fire based on the size of the burned area and mean burn severity per pixel. In general, pre-fire dominance of coniferous species (jack pine and spruce) led to higher SBIS values while pre-fire dominance of broad-leaved species (aspen, birch, and poplar) led to lower values. Mean burn severity and SBIS values increased when fire events occurred at a distance of 1 km or greater from surface waters (e.g. lakes, rivers, and streams). We further analyzed the influence of fire season on burn duration and the proportion of canopy species being burned in each season. We found that fires that were ignited in spring lasted longer and burned more deciduous stands compared to fires that were ignited in summer. By integrating burn impact over very large temporal and spatial scales, we have confirmed the general influence of pre-fire canopy species on burn severity, and the ameliorating effect of surface waters on fire behavior at the landscape level.																			0378-1127	1872-7042				SEP 15	2021	496								119386	10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119386	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119386		MAY 2021											WOS:000675530600002

Abundance estimates from horizontally stratified (by water column depth) data were within 9-11% of vertically stratified estimates during spring but over 20% higher during summer. By extrapolation to all water depths, we estimated total pelagic biomass as 274.6 kt for spring and 410.8 kt for summer. During both seasons, smaller fishes were nearer to the surface and nearer shore than larger individuals, and acoustic measures of size approximated the sizes of fishes caught in trawls. Bioenergetic model simulations suggest that 60% of the available production of alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) was either consumed by stocked salmonines (52.9%) or commercially harvested (7.1%) in 1987.

P.; Sharma, Suman			Stable isotope ratios in precipitation and their relationship with meteorological conditions in the Kumaon Himalayas, India	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												For the first time, environmental isotopic (delta(2)H, delta(18)O, (3)H) data, predominantly based on precipitation samples in the Kumaon Himalayas, India, have been used to understand the influence of various meteorological factors governing rainout processes in the region. Further, the data are also used to understand the orographic effects in precipitation and to estimate the altitude effect in stable isotopic ratios in precipitation, etc. The interpretation of the isotopic data revealed that the source of moisture for winter (October-February) and summer (May) precipitation in the Kumaon Himalayas is mainly from the Western Disturbances whereas for the remaining period the source is monsoonal (southwest). The delta(2)H-delta(18)O relationship in the local precipitation during the monsoon season shows a distinct seasonal effect, with a slope of 7.6. The winter and summer precipitation samples measured higher environmental (3)H compared to southwest monsoon samples, thus indicating continental evaporated moisture. There is wide range of altitude effects (delta(18)O variation per 100 m elevation: -0.30 parts per thousand [July-August]; -0.57 parts per thousand [September]) with the mean altitude effect being -2.61 parts per thousand and -0.36 parts per thousand per 100 m elevation for delta(2)H and delta(18)O respectively. These values are different from that reported earlier for the region based on the isotopic compositions of springs/rivers samples. The 'altitude effect' in successive precipitation is basically a temperature dependent phenomenon and is explained on the basis of adiabatic cooling related rainout process (dry adiabatic lapse rate, moist adiabatic lapse rate and saturated adiabatic lapse rate for moist air mass). The altitude effect is found to be more reliable in case of delta(2)H, as deuterium is least affected by secondary evaporation. The effect of secondary evaporation has been observed on the true "altitude effect". Secondary evaporation of rainfall increases the oxygen isotopic ratios and the increase is directly proportional to the vertical distance travelled by the raindrops through air.

At the same time, the Tianshan Mountains, a vitally important water resource supply zone and ecological barrier, are located in the heart of arid central Asia. Frequent dust storms in this region endanger snow and ice melting as well as ecological security within the Tianshan Mountains. In the present study, the CALIPSO data and HYSPLIT model were combined to assess the spatiotemporal features and potential sources of aerosols over the North Tianshan (NT), East Tianshan (ET), Central Tianshan in the East (CTE), Central Tianshan in the West (CTW), West Tianshan (WT), and South West Tianshan (SW). Results showed that the atmospheric aerosol subtypes had an apparent spatial variability. Dust and polluted dust were the two most dominant aerosol subtypes with the two accounting for over 76% of detected aerosols. The occurrence frequency of the dust within NT, ET, CTE, and CTW showed seasonal variation with two peaks in spring and autumn, while that of WT and SW peaked only in summer. The occurrence frequency of polluted dust in the ET region differed from that found in NT, CTE, CTW, WT, and SW. During all seasons, polluted dust was the dominant aerosol subtype recorded at heights from 2 km to 5 km in NT and WT. Vertically, dust and polluted dust were the most common subtypes observed between 1 and 8 km in SW. The top altitude of the dust and polluted dust layer over most of the Tianshan Mountains was greater than 5 km. The thickest dust layer over the Tianshan Mountains appeared in summer with a value larger than 2.0 km, and the thickness of the polluted dust layer was approximately between 1.0 and 1.5 km in spring. In comparison, the southwesterly transport pathways are the primary route for atmospheric aerosols to the Tianshan Mountains, which have the greater potential to carry natural and anthropogenic aerosols. Therefore, the Karakum Desert, Kyzylkun Desert, Moyunkum Desert, and Gurbantunggut Desert are the primary potential sources of dust and polluted dust aerosols over the Tianshan Mountains in arid central Asia.

J	Chen, YZ; She, YT				Chen, Yuzhuang; She, Yuntong			Long-term variations of river ice breakup timing across Canada and its response to climate change	COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												River ice breakup has extensive implications on cold-region hydrological, ecological and river morphological systems. However, spatial and temporal breakup patterns under the changing climate are not well explored on large scale. This study discusses the spatial-temporal variations of breakup timing over terrestrial ecozones and five selected river basins of Canada based on long-term (19502016) data record. The link between the discovered patterns and climatic drivers (including air temperature, snowfall and rainfall), as well as elevation and anthropogenic activities are analyzed. An overall earlier breakup trend is observed across Canada and the spring air temperature is found to be the main driver behind it. However, the most pronounced warming trends across Canada is observed in winter. Spring warming trend is not as strong as winter warming and even becomes weak as period changes from 19502016 to 19702016, resulting in more stations showing later and significant later breakup during 19702016. Breakup pattern also displays evident spatial differences. Significant earlier breakup trends are mainly seen in western Canada (e.g. the Nelson River basin) and Arctic where spring warming trends are evident. Later and mixed breakup trends are generally identified in regions with weak warming or even cooling trends, such as Atlantic Canada and the St. Lawrence River basin. Spring snowfall generally delays breakup. Spring rainfall usually advances breakup dates while winter-rainfall can also delay breakup through refreezing. The increased snowfall in the north and increased rainfall in the south may be the reason why breakup timing is more sensitive to climatic warming in lower latitude regions than in higher latitude regions. Additionally, breakup timing in main streams and large rivers appears to be less sensitive to the warming trend than the headwaters and small tributaries. Elevation and flow regulation are also found to be contributing factors to the changes in breakup timing.

Climate displaces deposition as dominant driver of dissolved organic carbon concentrations in historically acidified lakes	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Climate and atmospheric deposition interact with watershed properties to drive dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in lakes. Because drivers of DOC concentration are inter-related and interact, it is challenging to assign a single dominant driver to changes in lake DOC concentration across spatiotemporal scales. Leveraging forty years of data across sixteen lakes, we used structural equation modeling to show that the impact of climate, as moderated by watershed characteristics, has become more dominant in recent decades, superseding the influence of sulfate deposition that was observed in the 1980s. An increased percentage of winter precipitation falling as rain was associated with elevated spring DOC concentrations, suggesting a mechanistic coupling between climate and DOC increases that will persist in coming decades as northern latitudes continue to warm. Drainage lakes situated in watersheds with fine-textured, deep soils and larger watershed areas exhibit greater variability in lake DOC concentrations compared to both seepage and drainage lakes with coarser, shallower soils, and smaller watershed areas. Capturing the spatial variability in interactions between climatic impacts and localized watershed characteristics is crucial for forecasting lentic carbon and nutrient dynamics, with implications for lake ecology and drinking water quality.					; Varner, Ruth/E-5371-2011; McDowell, William/E-9767-2010	Fazekas, Hannah/0000-0001-5651-6100; Wymore, Adam/0000-0002-6725-916X; Herreid, Allison/0000-0002-5172-5605; MURRAY, DESNEIGES/0000-0003-2422-3287; McDowell, William/0000-0002-8739-9047; Nelson, Sarah/0000-0003-3000-7521; 													0168-2563	1573-515X				DEC	2024	168	1							5	10.1007/s10533-024-01193-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-024-01193-5								39711613					WOS:001388156700001

The Daphnia lumholtzi population peaked with water surface temperature. Since the establishment of D. lumholtzi, the composition of spring peak crustacean zooplankton has shifted from >75% cladocerans to >75% copepod nauplii. There was also a corresponding decrease in crustacean zooplankton length from 0.41 +/- 0.04 in 1992 to 0.18 +/- 0.01 in 1994 during peak abundance. Since D. lumholtzi does not appear until summer, direct competition with native zooplankton would not account for this change in spring zooplankton community structure. We propose two indirect mechanisms by which the presence of D. lumholtzi may lead to a decrease in the numbers of native zooplankton overwintering as adults, thus impacting the spring community. Late summer competition among zooplankton species may reduce native zooplankton populations. Also, selective avoidance of D. lumholtzi by fish predators may increase predation pressure on native zooplankton.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				DEC	1997	12	4					521	530		10.1080/02705060.1997.9663566	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1997.9663566													WOS:A1997YK22400003

For three years the zooplankton and littoral microfauna in three rivers in the Lake Eyre Basin were studied. A diverse assemblage was discovered with a total of 398 identifiable taxa being recorded, consisting of 72 protist, 227 rotifer and 93 microcrustacean taxa. Zooplankton diversity was highest in a boom phase during, or in the summer following, a large flood. The rotifer assemblage dominated during, or soon after, periods of flow. However, during the winter and early summer, there was a decline in rotifer taxon richness and abundance accompanied by an increase in microcrustacean taxon richness and abundance. The winter samples occurred during the recession of a large flood and the early summer samples during periods of no flow. These changes suggested the involvement of a strong annual cycle of ecosystem structure evident within the longer term patterns of boom and bust driven by the timing and size of flood events. Multivariate and regression analyses found that salinity was a significant and independent driver of assemblage composition.

J	Talling, JF; Parker, JE				Talling, JF; Parker, JE			Seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton and phytobenthos, and associated chemical interactions, in a shallow upland lake (Malham Tarn, northern England)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Seasonal changes of phytoplankton were followed over 3 years (1985-87) in a shallow, unstratified and calcareous upland lake. The phytoplankton was of low to moderate abundance and generally dominated by phytoflagellates. Seasonality involved a winter minimum of abundance, a spring maximum of diatoms, and often brief increases in summer that included blue-greens, especially the colonial Gloeotrichia echinulata. Some components were of benthic origin. Seasonal growth of the main component of the phytobenthos, Chara globularis var. virgata, caused a regular summer depletion in lake water of Ca(2+) and HCO(3)(-) (alkalinity) by associated CaCO(3) deposition, and a more extreme (and unusual) depletion of K(+). Chemical analysis of Chara biomass and of underlying sediments indicated a large benthic nutrient stock, much surpassing that represented by the phytoplankton. Growth in this biomass, and the magnitude of water-borne inputs, influenced the removals of Ca(2+), K(+) and inorganic N. The phytoplankton was probably limited by a low-P medium, to which co-precipitation of phosphate with CaCO(3) may have contributed. A vernal depletion of Si was probably limiting to diatom growth, and appeared to be mainly induced by benthic rather than planktonic diatoms. Examples of long-term change in composition of the phytoplankton and phytobenthos are noted and discussed in relation to the interaction of these components, nutrient enrichment, and possible alternative stable states.																			0018-8158					NOV	2002	487	1					167	181		10.1023/A:1022934705359	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1022934705359													WOS:000181732400011

The first WRF ensemble is performed under current land use and land cover, while the second is carried out after introducing a virtual large and shallow surface water reservoir (a lake) in Chott el-Jerid. The most pronounced effects generated by the artificial lake are circumscribed over its surface and slightly spread downwind to the other parts of the Chott. The lake has a clear moderating effect on near-surface air temperatures by increasing (decreasing) the wintertime (summertime) air temperatures. Sensible heat fluxes are remarkably increased in winter and decreased in summer over the lake following the temperature gradient between the lake surface and the overlying atmosphere. Latent heat fluxes, moisture convergence, and water vapor mixing ratio are increased over the lake throughout the year, especially in winter. The lake also induces domain-wide decreased (increased) surface pressures and land (lake) breeze circulation in winter (summer). Simulated rainfall amounts are most increased over the lake in winter likely because of an enhanced atmospheric instability, while they slightly decrease in summer.

Samples were taken monthly during the spring, summer, and autumn months from 3 discrete habitats: citrus groves, improved pastures, and weedy margins of irrigation ditches. The grasshopper species assemblage at the Research Center consisted of 16 species in the family Acrididae, 7 species in the family Tettigoniidae, and 3 species in the family Tetrigidae. Family and species dominance varied among habitats. Grasshopper abundance was highest in citrus groves and ditch margins, and these habitats had proportionally more acridids. Pastures were inhabited by fewer grasshoppers, and were dominated by tettigoniids. The nymphal tettigoniid population was relatively high, and adult population relatively low in pastures. Tetrigids were infrequent in all habitats. The most abundant grasshoppers were Dichromorpha viridis (Scudder) and Conocephalus fasciatus (DeGeer), grass-feeding species that were abundant in all habitats sampled. Collection of Melanoplus bispinosus Scudder is a new state record. Potential effects of grasshoppers and land management on avifauna are discussed.																			0015-4040	1938-5102				JUN	1997	80	2					253	261		10.2307/3495558	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3495558													WOS:A1997XE18000011
J	Morrill, C				Morrill, C			The influence of Asian summer monsoon variability on the water balance of a Tibetan lake	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Past water-balance changes in Tibetan lakes are generally attributed to changes in the strength of the summer monsoon. However, the water balance of a lake reflects many different water fluxes, which are controlled by many climatic and hydrologic processes. In this research, weather data and evaporation models are used to determine the climatic cause of a recent water-balance change in Ahung Co, a lake in central Tibet. Between 1995 and 2001, lake level rose at least 20 cm and the lake began to overflow. Results indicate that an increase in summer monsoon precipitation over the lake and drainage basin is responsible for the rise in lake level. Stronger monsoon conditions between 1995 and 2001 also led to decreased lake evaporation and basin evapotranspiration due to increased clouds and humidity. This contributed to the rise in lake level, but to a much smaller extent than the increase in monsoon precipitation. Lake evaporation during the spring and fall was also reduced between 1995 and 2001 due to longer lasting ice cover. Variations in ice cover play a small role in the overall water balance of Ahung Co, however, because the lake area is small compared to the drainage basin area. If these results hold true for the past, water-balance fluctuations inferred from the geochemistry of sediments from Ahung Co provide a record of variations in monsoon precipitation during the Holocene.

Compared with a spatially distributed set of one-dimensional thermal diffusion lake models, POM better reproduced the observed seasonal evolution of the horizontal distribution of lake surface temperature and the vertical thermal structure. A heat budget analysis confirmed that the lateral heat exchange made significant contributions to the horizontal variability of lake temperature. The model results showed that LNC was thermally stratified in summer, had a weak inverse stratification since mid-December, and was fully turned over during late spring and autumn. During both overturning phases, the modeled "thermal bar" was developed as a result of the density-driven convection in response to the radiative heating (surface cooling) during spring (autumn). The 3-D model results showed that the monthly mean circulation featured a predominant mid-lake cyclonic gyre throughout the ice-free period; upwelling along the western coast and strong coastal currents occurred in all months except in July-August. Model sensitivity experiments confirmed that the lake circulation was primarily driven by the barotropic dynamics of the prevailing southwesterly wind, while the baroclinic process made a secondary contribution. The results pointed out the necessity to resolve lateral processes when modeling large TP lakes. Plain Language Summary The Tibetan Plateau has the highest alpine lake concentration in the world and Lake Nam Co is the third largest lake in the region. This study showed that a three-dimensional (3-D) hydrodynamic model performed better than a spatially distributed set of one-dimensional thermal diffusion lake models in reproducing the observed spatial and temporal variations of the lake temperature, and depicted the existence of lake gyre circulation, coastal currents, and upwelling. Model sensitivity experiments revealed that the lake circulation during the ice-free season was primarily driven by the prevailing southwesterly wind, while the thermal structure made a secondary contribution. The improved simulation of the thermal structure and circulation with 3-D models is important to understand the variations of the ecosystem in large lakes and the impacts of lakes on the regional weather and climate.					; Wu, Yang/HNI-3599-2023; 黄, 安宁/K-7473-2019; Huang, Anning/K-7473-2019	Lu, Youyu/0000-0003-2416-5443; Wu, Yang/0000-0002-3477-7171; Huang, Anning/0000-0001-9872-440X													2169-9275	2169-9291				OCT	2021	126	10							e2021JC017517	10.1029/2021JC017517	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JC017517													WOS:000714344600015

Dinobryon sertularia Ehr. from Chrysophyceae (golden algae) are mixotrophic organisms often make up blooms and colony in pools, lakes and clam reservoirs. This study was carried out in Derbent Dam Lake in the Middle Black Sea Region. Seasonal dynamics and biomass of D. sertularia were investigated at four stations between February 2001 and July 2002. D. sertularia consisted of 47-60% in spring, 61-79% in summer, and 82-88% in autumn of all phytoplankton population. In August 2001, D. sertularia was calculated in the highest amounts numbers (18,740-13,140 cells ml(-1)). This species provided important contributions to phytoplankton biomass. In the present study, it was found that there is an inverse correlation between water depth and phytoplankton biomass production. According to Bray-Curtis Similarity Indice, 88% similarity was determined among Station 3, Station 4 and 4-6 m of Station I. D. sertularia was dominant and common organism in all seasons.

Spring migration of Falconiformes in the southern Baikal migratory corridor: Peculiarities of migration and its relation with landscape-climatic conditions	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												Based on the results of studying the spring migration of Falconiformes in 2011 and 2013, we have found that the southern Baikal migratory corridor, being a zone of migratory soaring bird concentration in eastern Siberia, plays one of the key roles not only in autumn, but also in spring. Outcomes on the abundance, species composition, and features of migratory behavior of birds have been made. In the course of long-term observations of Falconiformes, three patterns of their migratory movement through the southernmost part of Lake Baikal have been determined which are implemented depending on the cloud, wind, and ice situation. A relation between the intensity of spring migration observed and meteorological conditions on the migratory route has been found.

J	Liu, B; Jin, HL; Yang, F				Liu, Bing; Jin, HeLing; Yang, Fan			A late Holocene winter monsoon record inferred from the palaeo-aeolian sand dune in the southeastern Mu Us Desert, northern China	SCIENCES IN COLD AND ARID REGIONS												The variation of the Asian winter monsoonal strength has seriously affected the climate and environmental conditions in the Asian monsoonal region, and even in marginal islands and the ocean in the East Asian region. However, relevant understanding remains unclear due to the lack of suitable geological materials and effective proxies in the key study areas. Here, we present a grain-size record derived from the palaeo-aeolian sand dune in the southeastern Mu Us Desert, together with other proxies and OSL dating, which reflect a relatively detailed history of the winter monsoon and abrupt environmental events during the past 4.2 ka. Our grain-size standard deviation model indicated that >224 mu m content can be considered as an indicator of the intensity of Asian winter monsoon, and it shows declined around 4.2-2.1 ka, enhanced but unstable in 2.1-0.9 ka, and obviously stronger since then. In addition, several typical climate events were also documented, forced by the periodic variation of winter monsoonal intensity. These include the cold intervals of 4.2, 2.8, 1.4 ka, and the Little Ice Age (LIA), and relatively warm sub-phases around 3.0, 2.1, 1.8 ka, and the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), which were roughly accordant with the records of the aeolian materials, peat, stalagmites, ice cores, and sea sediments in various latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. Combined with the previous progresses of the Asian summer monsoon, we preliminarily confirmed a millennial-scale anti-correlation of Asian winter and summer monsoons in the Late Holocene epoch. This study suggests that the evolution of the palaeo-aeolian sand dune has the potential for comprehending the history of Asian monsoon across the desert regions of the modern Asian monsoonal margin in northern China.																			1674-3822					OCT	2016	8	5					388	399		10.3724/SP.J.1226.2016.00388	http://dx.doi.org/10.3724/SP.J.1226.2016.00388													WOS:000391633800004

River discharge during the GLOF increased almost three-fold from 770 m(3)/s to 2200 m(3)/s. This pulse enhanced the gravitational circulation and affected the horizontal advective fluxes of plankton. The maximum backscatter was found both during the GLOF and in late winter to early spring of 2010. The backscatter increase in late winter and spring corresponded to multiple zooplankton species found from in-situ net sampling. In addition, diel vertical migrations were found during this seasonal increase both qualitatively and in spectral analysis. Concurrently with zooplankton increases, wind forcing produced a deepening/shallowing of the pycnocline. Zooplankton abundance was at its peak in the fjord during the pycnocline departures and throughout the entire spring season, indicating that mixing conditions could favor secondary production. Eddy diffusivity (kv = 0.8x10(-4) m(2)/s) was found in a shear layer (20 m depth) with a Richardson number of 0.8, denoting a potential for advective instabilities to occur during spring. Recently collected data (2014) shows a similar fjord response to another GLOF event.					Perez, Ivan/B-9321-2018																978-1-4673-7019-6				2015																								WOS:000412164600048

We identified 103 phytoplankton species belonging to eight phyla, with Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta, and Cyanobacteria being the dominant groups. A total of 45 zooplankton species belonged to three classes, with Rotifera being the dominant class. Phytoplankton density was highest in the autumn, followed by the spring, and the lowest in the summer. Phytoplankton biomass, along with zooplankton density and biomass, exhibited seasonal declines. The average values of the Shannon-Wiener index, Pielou's evenness index, and Margalef richness index were 3.58 +/- 0.50, 0.72 +/- 0.76, and 2.03 +/- 0.31, respectively, indicating the Caowangjing River was mildly polluted based on a water quality evaluation. Redundancy analysis showed that turbidity, water temperature, and ammonia nitrogen are the key factors of phytoplankton community distribution, while water temperature, the permanganate index, and ammonia nitrogen are the key factors of zooplankton community distribution.

Here we report an alkenone-based temperature reconstruction for growing season over the past 1600 years from the varved sediment in Lake Sihailongwan, northeastern China. The most notable cold spells occurred during the periods AD 480-860, AD 1260-1300, AD 1510-1570 and AD 1800-1900 with a temperature decrease of about 1 degrees C compared with the 20th century. Based on the historical evidence such as 'snow or frost in the summertime' and 'no ice during the wintertime', we compile extreme cold summer events and warm winter events over the past 1600 years. The 'Little Ice Age' time period experienced more extreme cold summer/warm winter events, while the 'Medieval Warm Period' had milder winters. Comparatively, the natural proxy data show a general similar pattern with historical documents at decadal time scales, except for between ad 1620 and 1720. Our results show multidecadal to centennial variations in seasonal temperature, possibly caused by interactions of external natural forcing and atmosphere-ocean circulations.

Additonally, we measured delta O-18 and delta C-13 as well as Sr:Ca and Mg:Ca ratios of authigenic calcites that were collected in sequencing sediment traps in order to disentangle environmental and climatic factors controlling these parameters. In particular, our aim was to find out if element ratios and the isotopic composition of calcites reflect changes, in water and air temperatures. Lake water is highly enriched in O-18 (-1.3 to -2.5%. VSMOW) with an evaporative increase of 0.6 parts per thousand during summer. Values are 5-6 parts per thousand more positive than groundwater values and 4-5 parts per thousand more positive than long-term weighted annual means of precipitation. During spring and summer, high amounts of dissolved phosphate cause eutrophic conditions and calcite precipitation in isotopic disequilibrium. Measured values are depleted in 180 by 2 to 10 parts per thousand compared to calculated equilibrium values. Resuspension and partial dissolution of calcite in the water column contribute to this isotopic divergence in summer and autumn as delta O-18(ca) and delta C-13 values increased in the hypolimnion during this time. Mg:Ca and Sr:Ca ratios are altered by dissolution as well. In the hypolimnion these ratios were higher than in the epilimnion. Another reason for the huge deviation between measured and theoretical delta O-18(ca) values during summer is the occurrence of large amounts of Phacotus lenticularis in the carbonate - fraction. High amounts of Phacotus lead to more negative delta O-18(ca) and more positive delta C-13 values. Several characteristics of delta O-18(ca) and delta C-13 are also reflected by Mg:Ca and Sr:Ca ratios and isotopic composition of oxygen and carbon were influenced by the onset and stability of stratification. Especially the earlier onset of stratification it? 2005 caused higher sediment fluxes and more positive carbon and oxygen isotope values of bioinduced carbonates compared to 2004.					; Zolitschka, Bernd/P-1487-2019	Zolitschka, Bernd/0000-0001-8256-0420; Lucke, Andreas/0000-0003-4199-0808; Ohlendorf, Christian/0000-0003-3794-7313; 													1129-5767	1723-8633					2009	68	2					257	273		10.4081/jlimnol.2009.257	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2009.257													WOS:000268778300010
J	Luo, LC; Qin, BQ; Song, YZ; Yang, LY				Luo, Liancong; Qin, Boqiang; Song, Yuzhi; Yang, Longyuan			Seasonal and regional variations in precipitation chemistry in the Lake Taihu Basin, China	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												To evaluate seasonal and regional variations in precipitation chemistry in Lake Taihu Basin, 5 cities around the lake were selected for monthly collection of rainfall samples from July 2002 to June 2003. The analytical parameters included pH, cations (K+, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, NH4+), anions (F-, Cl-, SO42-,NO3-), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus 1 4 3 (TP). In descending order, concentrations (in meq L-1) Of the ions in wet deposition can be ordered as SO42- > Ca2+ > NH4+ > NO3- > Cl- > Na+ > Mg2+ > K+ > F- with concentratin percentages of 48.7%, 19.1%, 11.6%, 8.1%, 5.6%, 2.6%, 1.7%, 1.6% and 1%, respectively. Rainfall was seasonally variable, with high rates in spring and summer but low rates in autumn and winter, while ion concentrations followed the reverse seasonal cycle. To evaluate deposition rates (DR) of different elements, average DR of each ion was calculated from a simple model. Most of the highest DRs of these substances occurred in Suzhou and Wuxi, located cast and north of Lake Taihu, which shows there was considerable variation over the 5 stations. This regional pattern reflects local emissions from industry and agriculture, and suggests that steps need to be taken by local governments for particle emission reductions. The estimated annual inputs of TN and TP over the lake are 4722 and 75 t, respectively, which accounts for around 16.5% and 7.3% of the annual total external inputs of these nutrients. Primary productivity in Lake Taihu associated solely with wet deposition of nitrogen to the lake was estimated to be 7.03 x 10(6) mol C day(-1). These results suggest. that wet deposition can have significant. impacts on the trophic status of Lake Taihu and that attention to nutrients in precipitation should be included in the management of external nutrient loads to the lake.

Four cultivars were tested each year. Winter survival was poor in northern Ontario in both years, and along the north shore of Lake Erie in the first year. Over all sites, mean winter survival was 52%. At sites which did not completely winterkill, plant survival and yield averaged 70% and 2.38 t ha-1. Best winter rapeseed performance in Ontario occurred at well-drained sites with good winter snow cover and an absence of excessive flooding or cold temperatures in the spring. Cultivars did not differ in survival or yield in 1981-1982. The cultivar Jet Neuf had higher yields than the other cultivars in 1982-1983. There were differences in oil and protein content among the cultivars. The results suggest that winter rapeseed could become a viable crop in Ontario.

J	Watts, JM; Swan, BK; Tiffany, MA; Hurlbert, SH				Watts, JM; Swan, BK; Tiffany, MA; Hurlbert, SH			Thermal, mixing, and oxygen regimes of the Salton Sea, California, 1997-1999	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The Salton Sea is a shallow (mean depth = 8 m; maximum depth = 15 m), saline (41-45 g l(-1)), intermittently mixing, 57 km long, 980 km(2) lake located in the arid southwestern United States. The Sea is a wind driven system, with predominant winds paralleling the long axis of the lake, being strongest in spring and weakest in summer and fall. The Sea mixed daily or nearly daily between September and January. During this cooling period, moderate to high levels of dissolved oxygen (3-11 mg l(-1)) were found throughout the water column. Mean water column temperature ranged from a minimum of 13-14 degreesC in early January to a maximum of 30-34 degreesC in July-September. During most of this warming period, the Sea was thermally stratified but subject to periodic wind driven mixing events. Winds were stronger in spring 1998 than in 1997 or 1999, causing more rapid heating of the lake that year and also delaying onset of anoxic conditions in bottom waters. During summer months, mid-lake surface waters were sometimes supersatured with oxygen, and bottom waters were hypoxic or anoxic with sulfide concentrations > 5 mg l(-1). Oxic conditions (> 1 mg O-2 l(-1)) often extended a few meters deeper nearshore than they did well offshore as a consequence of greater mixing nearshore. Mixing events in late summer deoxygenated the entire water column for a period of days. Consumption of oxygen by sulfide oxidation likely was the principal mechanism for these deoxygenation events. Sulfide concentrations in surface waters were 0.5-1 mg l(-1) approximately 3 days after one mixing event in mid-August 1999. These mixing events were associated with population crashes of phytoplankters and zooplankters and with large fish kills. In the southern basin, freshwater inflows tended to move out over the surface of the Sea mixing with saline lake water as a function of wind conditions. Salinity gradients often contributed more to water column stability than did thermal gradients in the southeasternmost portion of the lake.

J	Traut, AH; Hostetler, ME				Traut, AH; Hostetler, ME			Urban lakes and waterbirds: Effects of development on avian behavior	WATERBIRDS												The need to understand how wildlife responds to the broad-ranging impacts of development is becoming increasingly important as human populations around the globe continue to increase and urbanize. We studied waterbird behavioral associations with developed and undeveloped shorelines on four partially developed urban lakes in central Florida. Summer observations revealed that wading birds foraged significantly more along developed shoreline, and that ducks rested and tended young significantly more along developed shoreline. Winter observations revealed that marsh birds foraged significantly more along undeveloped shoreline but displayed active/swimming behavior significantly more along developed shoreline. Summer ducks and winter wading birds showed significantly greater alert/flee behavior along undeveloped shoreline. Ducks in both seasons showed significantly greater alert/flee behavior than other guilds. For all guilds, alert/flee behavior was seen 1.6 times more often in the winter. Winter migrants did not show greater alert/flee behavior than resident birds. Results show that a wide range of waterbirds call use urban lakes during the breeding and non-breeding seasons, and that many birds appear to favor developed shorelines for a variety of behavioral patterns. However, dense stands of tall emergent vegetation along undeveloped shoreline may limit waterbird behavior along this, shoreline. The heightened alert/ flee behavior observed along undeveloped shorelines may warrant the use of buffer zones to protect birds using these shorelines from undue human disturbance.

Characterizing Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter Spatio-Temporal Variability in North Andean Patagonian Lakes Using Remote Sensing Information and Environmental Analysis	REMOTE SENSING												Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is crucial in aquatic ecosystems, influencing light penetration and biogeochemical processes. This study investigates the CDOM variability in seven oligotrophic lakes of North Andean Patagonia using Landsat 8 imagery. An empirical band ratio model was calibrated and validated for the estimation of CDOM concentrations in surface lake water as the absorption coefficient at 440 nm (acdom440, m-1). Of the five atmospheric corrections evaluated, the QUAC (Quick Atmospheric Correction) method demonstrated the highest accuracy for the remote estimation of CDOM. The application of separate models for deep and shallow lakes yielded superior results compared to a combined model, with R2 values of 0.76 and 0.82 and mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) of 14% and 22% for deep and shallow lakes, respectively. The spatio-temporal variability of CDOM was characterized over a five-year period using satellite-derived acdom440 values. CDOM concentrations varied widely, with very low values in deep lakes and moderate values in shallow lakes. Additionally, significant seasonal fluctuations were evident. Lower CDOM concentrations were observed during the summer to early autumn period, while higher concentrations were observed in the winter to spring period. A gradient boosting regression tree analysis revealed that inter-lake differences were primarily influenced by the lake perimeter to lake area ratio, mean lake depth, and watershed area to lake volume ratio. However, seasonal CDOM variation was largely influenced by Lake Nahuel Huapi water storage (a proxy for water level variability at a regional scale), followed by precipitation, air temperature, and wind. This research presents a robust method for estimating low to moderate CDOM concentrations, improving environmental monitoring of North Andean Patagonian Lake ecosystems. The results deepen the understanding of CDOM dynamics in low-impact lakes and its main environmental drivers, enhance the ability to estimate lacustrine carbon stocks on a regional scale, and help to predict the effects of climate change on this important variable.					; Ferral, Anabella/AAS-8507-2021; ferraro, gisela/HHN-6420-2022	Dogliotti, Ana/0000-0001-8834-4374; Ferraro, Gisela/0000-0001-7341-3410; Ferral, Anabella/0000-0002-9383-7728; Perez, Gonzalo Luis/0000-0001-8325-7677														2072-4292				NOV	2024	16	21							4063	10.3390/rs16214063	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs16214063													WOS:001351990200001
J	Barbiero, RP; Tuchman, ML				Barbiero, RP; Tuchman, ML			Long-term dreissenid impacts on water clarity in Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Since shortly after their introduction, dreissenid mussels have been thought to have improved water clarity in Lake Erie, particularly in the western basin. However, long-term monitoring (1982-2004) has found no evidence of persistent, basin-wide increases in water clarity in either the western or the central basin of Lake Erie since the Dreissena invasion. In fact, spring water clarity in both of those basins has exhibited statistically significant declines in the post-dreissenid period. In contrast, chlorophyll a levels in the western basin have declined by about 50% since the Dreissena invasion during both spring and summer. The discrepancy in the responses of water clarity and chlorophyll a is probably a consequence of both the large sediment loads entering the western basin and resuspension of unassimilated non-algal particulates. In the eastern basin, spring transparency has increased substantially and turbidity has decreased since Dreissena colonization, in spite of the much greater depth of this basin. This is probably due to higher mussel densities and the lack of major sources of turbidity in that basin. Summer turbidity, has also decreased markedly in the eastern basin, although thermal stratification during this period would probably preclude direct filtration effects. Instead, we hypothesize that reductions in whiting events due to calcium uptake by dreissenids have contributed to the summer decreases in turbidity, seen in the eastern basin.																			0380-1330						2004	30	4					557	565		10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70371-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70371-8													WOS:000226952000009

Turkey was investigated. Two gyrodactylid helminth species were determined from the host fish specimens: Gyrodactylus scardiniensis was found on gill branches and fins of the host fishes and Gyrodactylus prostae on gill arches of the host fish samples. Gyrodactylus scardiniensis was found only on gills of the host fish duringthe spring (prevalence 19.0%, mean number of parasites and standard deviation 6.6 +/- 4.1), while it was recorded on fins in the spring and winter seasons (40.4%, 11.4 +/- 9.9). The other species, Gyrodactylus prostae was found on gill arches of host fish in spring and summer periods (7.1%, 17.3 +/- 17.2). Gyrodactylus scardiniensis had a maximum infection value on fishes of small size groups (19.5%, 10.2 +/- 10.1), while it was not recorded on the biggest host fish sizes. Gyrodactylus prostae was found on small (7.6%, 12.7 +/- 7.1) and medium host fishes (2.2%, 14.0 +/- 0.0),Gyrodactylus scardiniensis and Gyrodactylus prostae infection values were higher on females fish than males (respectively, 16.0%, 10.4 +/- 9.1 on famale, 15.7%, 9.1 +/- 4.6 on male and 11.6%, 12.7 +/- 8.8 on female. 2.6%. 2.0 +/- 0.0 on male).

Spatiotemporal variations and relationships of phosphorus, phosphomonoesterases, and bacterial communities in sediments from two Chilean rivers	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Rivers are important ecosystem services providers in southern Chile; however, the microbiology of most rivers are understudied. This is particularly true for phosphorus (P) recycling by bacterial activity. Here, we studied the physicochemical properties, P contents, phosphomonoesterase (Pase) activities, and bacterial Pase genes (phoD, phoC, and phoX) in Chilean river sediments (Imperial and Tolten rivers, Chile) collected in sites with less and more degrees of anthropogenic influence during the summer and winter seasons. The richness, diversity, composition, and predicted function of the bacterial communities were addressed, as well as the spatiotemporal relationships among P-associated parameters and bacterial communities. Our results showed spatiotemporal variations, highlighting higher values of the temperature, conductivity, nutrients (C, N, P), Pase activity, and Pase genes in sediments collected in sites more anthropogenized during summer. In contrast, higher richness, diversity, and abundance of total bacteria were found in sediments collected in winter. The phylum Proteobacteria and heterotrophy were the most relatively abundant bacterial taxa and predicted function, respectively. The differentiation among winter and summer sediments was also revealed and the relationships between bacterial community and P-associated parameters were confirmed. Our analysis also highlighted the positive relationship between Pase genes with Gemmataceae, Xanthomonadaceae, and Chitinophagaceae families, and between Pase activity and Po with Chromatiaceae and Desulfobacteraceae families. This study represents an initial investigation aimed to unravel the compositions and relationships of bacterial communities with P recycling in these sedi-ments, which are threatened by anthropogenic activity (e.g., agriculture, industry, cities, etc.). This information may be used in the design of countermeasures to prevent deterioration of Chilean rivers, which are relevant as ecosystem service providers. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Thallium isotope cycling in a ferruginous Precambrian ocean analogue	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Precambrian oceans were overwhelmingly anoxic and rich in dissolved ferrous iron (Fe2+), conditions referred to as 'ferruginous'. Yet, few paleoceanographic tools widely applied to the Precambrian sedimentary record are investigated in detail in the few available ferruginous settings today. We conducted a detailed thallium (Tl) isotope investigation of Deming Lake, a meromictic ferruginous lake in Itasca State Park (Minnesota, USA). Only slight changes were observed in dissolved Tl concentrations (Tldiss) and isotopic compositions (epsilon 205Tldiss) between spring, summer, and winter months. This was despite the development of a winter ice cap, a dramatic shoaling of the oxycline, and large swings in dissolved and particulate Fe concentrations. Isotopic compositions of authigenic Tl (epsilon 205TlA) leached from surface sediments across a shallow-to-deep gradient averaged -2.2 +/- 0.9%00 (2SD) and were at all depths slightly lower than corresponding waters, which averaged 0.0 +/- 1.3%00 (2SD). We estimate that the Tl isotope fractionation process responsible for driving this effect has an associated fractionation factor (alpha) of 0.9998 to 0.9999. Processes behind this fractionation could be preferential 203Tl removal by biomass and organic sulfur. Thallium removal from the uppermost water column during the spring and summer months had an associated alpha up to 1.0005, most likely due to the preferential sorption of 205Tl onto Mn oxide minerals. This process plays little to no role in setting sedimentary epsilon 205TlA values, probably because Mn oxide minerals are unstable in sediments throughout the lake. We find no evidence of strongly coupled Tl and Fe cycling in Deming Lake, and by extension suspect that ferruginous conditions did not play an important direct role in ancient seawater Tl isotope mass-balance. What the lake does tell us, however, is that organic-rich and sulfur-poor sediments can slightly fractionate Tl isotopes. Ancient sediments formed under comparable conditions may be unreliable water column epsilon 205Tl archives. And if these sediment types were widely distributed on the ancient seafloor, they could have exerted a minor effect on global seawater Tl isotope mass-balance. Our results provide novel insights into how Tl and its isotopes are cycled under ferruginous conditions, permitting more accurate application of the Tl isotope paleoredox proxy to the Precambrian sedimentary record.

J	Davis, BAS; Stevenson, AC				Davis, Basil A. S.; Stevenson, Anthony C.			The 8.2 ka event and early-mid holocene forests, fires and flooding in the central Ebro desert, NE Spain	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The impact of the 8.2 ka cooling event during the Early-Mid Holocene has not been widely observed in Southern Europe, which in contrast to Northern Europe, was already experiencing a cooler than present climate at this time. Multi-proxy analysis of sediment cores front two closed-basin saline lakes in the Central Ebro Desert (NE Spain) has allowed us to investigate the impact of climatic changes around the time of this event in more detail. Long-term changes in climate between the Early and Mid Holocene indicate a shift in winter to a more positive NAO. resulting in declining lake levels in one lake sensitive to winter groundwater recharge, and cooler winter temperatures reconstructed from pollen-climate analysis. Reconstructed summer temperatures also declined over this period while annual precipitation and forest cover increased, interpreted Lis a result of enhanced convection-driven summer precipitation association with a northward displacement of the sub-tropical high pressure. Around 8.2 ka, a marked increase in fire frequency is shown between ca 8.8 and 8.0 ka BP. along with an expansion of fire-tolerant evergreen oak and peak in water levels in a second storm run-off fed lake. A maximum in fire intensity Occurred with the deposition of a charcoal layer at both lake sites dated to 8150 +/- 130 and 8285 +/- 135 cal BP, respectively. The increase in fire is largely attributed to a temporary return southward of the summer sub-tropical high pressure over the Mediterranean, which not only increased summer aridity, but also caused a contradictory regional warming before Hemispheric cooling set in.

Gudgeons (Teleostei: Cyprinidae: Gobioninae) often dominate fish assemblages in the upper Yangtze River. However, little research has been conducted on their trophic interactions. In this paper, seasonal diet and feeding strategy variations of four sympatric gudgeon species, Coreius guichenoti, Coreius heterodon, Rhinogobio ventralis, and Rhinogobio cylindricus, were investigated by analysis of intestinal tract contents, aiming to explore whether food resource partitioning occurred among them. Fish specimens were collected during spring (April-May) and autumn (August-October) in 2010 in Hejiang, a free-flowing stretch of the upper Yangtze River. Coreius guichenoti, C. heterodon, and R. cylindricus showed omnivorous feeding habits, while R. ventralis exhibited an obligate carnivore feeding habit. Diet overlap among the four studied species was high, especially in spring. However, changes in feeding strategies were observed in autumn. Specifically, C. guichenoti and R. cylindricus expanded their dietary niche breadth and consumed detritus, Sinopotamidae or Hydropsychidae as important complementary food resources. In contrast, C. heterodon and R. ventralis reduced their dietary niche breadth and became more specialized on mussels (Limnoperna lacustris). These results confirmed that sympatric fish species can coexist with high diet overlap, and food resource partitioning among these species may also fluctuate with the seasons.						liu, fei/0000-0003-4404-0971; Liu, Huanzhang/0000-0002-4604-7686													2045-7758					JUN	2019	9	12					7227	7236		10.1002/ece3.5293	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.5293								31380045					WOS:000478648300037
J	Zhang, JZ; Xu, HM; Ma, J; Deng, JC				Zhang, Jiuzheng; Xu, Haiming; Ma, Jing; Deng, Jiechun			Interannual Variability of Spring Extratropical Cyclones over the Yellow, Bohai, and East China Seas and Possible Causes	ATMOSPHERE												Interannual variability of cyclones that are generated over the eastern Asian continent and passed over the Yellow, Bohai, and East China seas (YBE cyclones) in spring is analyzed using reanalysis datasets for the period of 1979-2017. Possible causes for the variability are also discussed. Results show that the number of YBE cyclones exhibits significant interannual variability with a period of 4-5 years. Developing cyclones are further classified into two types: rapidly developing cyclones and slowly developing cyclones. The number of rapidly developing cyclones is highly related to the underlying sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies (SSTA) and the atmospheric baroclinicity from Lake Baikal to the Japan Sea. The number of slowly developing cyclones, however, is mainly affected by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) in the preceding winter (DJF); it works through the upper-level jet stream over Japan and the memory of ocean responses to the atmosphere. Positive NAO phase in winter is associated with the meridional tripole pattern of SSTA in the North Atlantic Ocean, which persists from winter to the following spring (MAM) due to the thermal inertia of the ocean. The SSTA in the critical mid-latitude Atlantic region in turn act to affect the overlying atmosphere via sensible and latent heat fluxes, leading to an increased frequency of slowly developing cyclones via exciting an anomalous eastward-propagating Rossby wave train. These results are confirmed by several numerical simulations using an atmospheric general circulation model.

Here we present a high-resolution (similar to 30-yr spacing) planktonic foraminiferal delta O-18 record of Neogloboquadrina incompta (dextral form), which reflects sea surface temperature during the winter season, for the last 6000 yrs from marine sediments in the western North Pacific. Stronger winter monsoons indicated by cooler winter SSTs correspond to weaker summer monsoons indicated by the cave oxygen isotopes in centennial-scale variability. The variability also shows good correlation with delta O-18 records in lake sediments and ice cores from the Yukon Territory, Canada, spanning the last 4500 yrs, suggesting east-west climate coupling across the North Pacific. Furthermore, the climate changes across the North Pacific co-vary over widespread regions, such as the eastern tropical Pacific and the northern Red Sea, and the reconstructed solar activity. The cross-spectral and wavelet analyses show that the East Asian winter monsoon shares some cyclicity with the solar variability. Our results suggest that the solar activity is a fundamental forcing producing the centennial-scale EAWM variability mediated by the large-scale climate linkages. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Muskellunge Spatial Ecology in the St. Louis River Estuary and Southwestern Lake Superior	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The St. Louis River estuary is a designated area of concern by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency due to severe environmental degradation. The spatial ecology of Muskellunge Esox masquinongy, an indicator species, is uncertain within the estuary and the large, connected water body, Lake Superior. We collected genetic samples and used passive acoustic telemetry to track 60 adult Muskellunge in the St. Louis River estuary and southwestern Lake Superior for 15 months. Genetic analysis revealed that the river is utilized by two genetic strains-Wisconsin (WI) and Minnesota (MN)-and their hybrids. These genetic strains were previously stocked to restore a nearly extirpated population. Muskellunge tended to move upstream in the spring, downstream and into Lake Superior throughout summer, and to the middle river during fall and winter. Males and females spent significantly more time in the upper and lower portions of the river, respectively. Movements were influenced by strain in that hybrids and the WI strain spent more time in the upper and middle river, and the MN strain spent more time in Lake Superior. A random forest model indicated that Lake Superior use was related to strain (the MN strain made up 80% of individuals using Lake Superior) but not sex or body length, highlighting the importance of understanding strain behavior when stocking different strains. Future research should include investigating Muskellunge habitat use (before, during, and after restoration), tracking juvenile Muskellunge, and connecting telemetry data with mark-recapture and stable isotope data. Our results provide new insight into Muskellunge spatial ecology and genetics that can inform management and restoration efforts within and beyond the Great Lakes.

Thinning river ice and rising river water temperatures may affect the thermal state of permafrost beneath the riverbed, with consequences for delta hydrology, erosion, and sediment transport. In this study, we use optical and radar remote sensing to map ice frozen to the riverbed (bedfast ice) vs. ice, resting on top of the unfrozen water layer (floating or so-called serpentine ice) within the Arctic's largest delta, the Lena River Delta. The optical data is used to differentiate elevated floating ice from bedfast ice, which is flooded ice during the spring melt, while radar data is used to differentiate floating from bedfast ice during the winter months. We use numerical modeling and geophysical field surveys to investigate the temperature field and sediment properties beneath the riverbed. Our results show that the serpentine ice identified with both types of remote sensing spatially coincides with the location of thawed riverbed sediment observed with in situ geoelectrical measurements and as simulated with the thermal model. Besides insight into sub-river thermal properties, our study shows the potential of remote sensing for identifying river channels with active sub-ice flow during winter vs. channels, presumably disconnected for winter water flow. Furthermore, our results provide viable information for the summer navigation for shallow-draught vessels.

Accurate assessment of its modem climate change is conductive to addressing global warming threat. Along with the development of Past Global Changes (PAGES) research, the focus has changed from paleo-climate reconstructions to using paleo-data for assessing the present and predicting the future. Previous studies have been devoted to climate change assessment using modem climate observations and simulations. This paper presents a new assessment approach based on the mid-Holocene, which provides a naturally oriented warming that can be compared to modem human-made global warming. A variety of climatic data, including modem observations, paleo-climate records, CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) and PMIP3 (Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project 3) simulations, as well as lake level models, were applied in this synthesis. Numerical climate classification was introduced to evaluate climate change impacts to Chinese climate zones on various time scales. The results show that winter and summer seasons have different response to the naturally oriented mid-Holocene warming but human-made global warming makes the warming trend appear in all seasons. Temperate and continental dry winter climates expand dramatically during the mid-Holocene warm period; however, the future global warming could have few impacts to Chinese climate zones. Furthermore, the East Asian summer monsoon was strengthened obviously by the mid-Holocene warm climate and strong low-latitude insolation. There is no consistent trend both for the winter and summer monsoon on the background of human-made global warming. In this study, a new benchmark was established based on paleo-climate to evaluate the impacts of human-made global warming.

J	Rosenstock, B; Simon, M				Rosenstock, B; Simon, M			Sources and sinks of dissolved free amino acids and protein in a large and deep mesotrophic lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We studied the microbial cycling of dissolved free amino acids (DFAAs) and protein in mesotrophic Lake Constance, Germany, by examining their release by phytoplankton and various heterotrophic organisms and incorporation by heterotrophic bacterioplankton. Release processes of both substrate classes, measured by an isotope dilution approach, comprised, as an annual mean, 15% of primary production and as much as 64% during the clearwater phase. DFAAs accounted for similar to 70% of total release during the spring bloom, in the early phase predominantly as photosynthetic extracellular products of rapidly growing algae and toward the end as a result of copepod grazing. Thereafter, during the clear-water phase, when daphnids were most abundant, release was dominated by protein. At this time, and again in late summer, lysis of grazing-damaged and senescent algae, including as well the hydrolytic activity of attached bacteria was one of the most important sources of protein. Rotifers, protozoans, and release processes in the fraction <1 <mu>m were minor sources of DFAA + protein. Concentrations of dissolved combined amino acids (DCAAs) and protein ranged between 750-1,900 and 1-280 nM, respectively, and peaked during phytoplankton blooms in spring and summer. As an annual mean, concentrations of labile protein constituted 8% of DCAAs, and the ratio of DFAAs to DCAAs was 0.16. About 50% of the DCAAs occurred in the molecular weight fraction between DFAA and 3 kDa and 30% in that >30 kDa. Concentrations of DCAAs >3 kDa were closely correlated to chlorophyll a, suggesting their phytoplankton origin and thus a ready availability. Protein was the preferred bacterial substrate. As an annual mean, its incorporation supported 45% of bacterial biomass production, compared with 13% by DFAAs. During winter and spring, when DFAA concentrations were highest, DFAA incorporation constituted up to 40% of bacterial production. Annually, the sum of DFAA + protein supported 58% and 80% of the bacterial C and N demand, respectively, indicating that they were the most important bacterial C and N sources.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				MAY	2001	46	3					644	654		10.4319/lo.2001.46.3.0644	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2001.46.3.0644													WOS:000168511500017

Exploring the Influence of Stock-Recruitment Relationships and Environmental Variables on Black Bass and Crappie Recruitment Dynamics in Missouri Reservoirs	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Large reservoirs provide important sport fisheries, but managing these fisheries is difficult because of the multiple biological and environmental variables that interact to shape them. Understanding how sport fish recruitment responds to parental stock and environmental influences would improve our management capabilities. We compiled long-term datasets for 15 Missouri reservoirs and used them to examine the influence of parental stock abundance and a suite of environmental variables on the recruitment of Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides, Spotted Bass M. punctulatus, White Crappie Pomoxis annularis, and Black Crappie P. nigromaculatus. Comparisons of log-linear, Ricker, and Beverton-Holt stock-recruit models revealed that the log-linear model was the most parsimonious for Largemouth Bass, White Crappie, and Black Crappie, but the Ricker model was best for Spotted Bass. However, stock-recruit models alone explained less than 13% of the variation in Largemouth Bass, Spotted Bass, and White Crappie recruitment while explaining about 33% of the variability in recruitment of Black Crappie. Largemouth Bass recruitment was positively related to spring rises in water levels, summer water levels, and average summer air temperatures, whereas Spotted Bass recruitment was positively related to spring air temperatures. White Crappie recruitment was positively related to total phosphorus levels and drops in spring water levels. Black Crappie recruitment was best explained by the model positively relating recruitment to spawning stock abundance, spring water levels, and summer water levels, while negatively relating recruitment to rapid drops in spring water levels. With the exception of models for Black Crappie, the best models did not include spawning stock abundance, and environmental variables appeared more important in explaining variation in recruitment. However, environmental variables in these models explained only a modest amount of variation (27-44%) in recruitment, revealing the complexity of recruitment processes in large reservoirs.

We identify three Winter Lightning Frequent Areas (WLAs): the southwest side of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau (WLA1), the east side of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau (WLA2), and the Poyang Lake Plain (WLA3). The CG lightning flashes most frequently occur at local midnight and have a monthly peak in February. The CG lightning in WLA1 is mostly generated in non-frontal weather; however, the lightning in WLA2 and WLA3 mostly occurs in frontal systems. The frontal circulation situation is divided into four typical types: transversal trough after high pressure, low vortex, confrontational convergence, and asymptotic convergence. In all typical weather patterns, the lightning occurs downstream of a 500 hPa trough and is accompanied by a southwesterly low-level jet. The convective parameters of winter thunderstorms differ greatly from those of summer thunderstorms. The maximum convective available potential energy (MCAPE) and K-index (KI) are more useful metrics than convective available potential energy (CAPE) and Showalter index (SI) during winter. This study further deepens the understanding of the distribution characteristics of winter CG lightning in China, which motivates further research to improve the ability of winter thunderstorm prediction.

At maximum, the lake body consisted of an upper layer with thin ice on top, and a lower layer with slush, hard ice and sediment at the bottom. Sublimation from the upper ice surface averaged to 0.7 mm d(-1), and melting in the ice interior averaged to 9.1 mm d(-1) during summer. Albedo was on average 0.6 and light attenuation coefficient was similar to 1 m(-1). Averaged over December and January, and over 3 different years, we found that the net solar heating was 137 W m(-2), while the losses averaged to 62 W m(-2) for the longwave radiation, 16 Wm(-2) for the sensible heat flux, 24 W m(-2) for the latent heat flux and 3 W m(-2) for the bottom flux. The depth scale is determined by the light attenuation distance and thermal diffusion coefficient, and the net liquid water volume ranged from 0.5 to 1.0 m in different years. The potential winter growth is more than summer melting, and thus the lake freezes up completely in winter in the present climate.

However, little is known about the effect of such UVBR enhancement on the Arctic ecosystem. In spring-summer 1998 and fall 1999, 40 stations were investigated in the North Water Polynya (NOW), High Arctic. In the course of this study, 3 periods (pre-bloom, bloom and post-bloom) were distinguished based on chlorophyll a (chl a) concentrations. The attenuation of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) are reported here. Bio-optical factors, namely particulate organic carbon (POC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and chl a concentrations were related to the attenuation coefficient, K-d(lambda), of both UVR and PAR. During the pre-bloom period (9 April to 12 May 1998), all bio-optical factors except chl a concentrations were unrelated to K-d(lambda). However, the absorption of colored dissolved organic matter might prevail. During the bloom period (15 May to 29 June 1998), both chl a and POC were strongly correlated to K-d(lambda). During the post-bloom period (27 August to 25 September 1999), POC contributed from 57 to 83 % of the K-d(lambda). Under stratification conditions, an inverse relationship was observed in the UVR and PAR ranges, between K-d(lambda) and the depth of the subsurface chlorophyll maximum (SCM). This could be a consequence of cell migration below the penetration depth of UVR where they are protected from UVR-induced physiological damages.

Year-Round Influenza a Virus Surveillance in Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) Reveals Genetic Persistence During the Under-Sampled Spring Season	VIRUSES-BASEL												Active influenza A virus (IAV) surveillance in wild waterfowl in the United States has revolved around convenience-based sampling methods, resulting in gaps in surveillance during the spring season. We conducted active IAV surveillance in mallards continuously from July 2017 to July 2019 in the coastal marshes of Lake Erie near Port Clinton, Ohio. We aimed to understand ecological and evolutionary dynamics of IAV across multiple seasons, including the under-sampled spring season. We collected 2096 cloacal swabs and estimated a 6.1% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.050-0.071) prevalence during the study period. Prevalence was lowest during spring (1.0%, 95% CI: 0.004-0.015). Time-stamped phylogenetic analyses revealed local persistence of genetic lineages of multiple gene segments. The PA segment consists of a lineage detected in multiple seasons with a time to most recent common ancestor of 2.48 years (95% highest posterior density: 2.16-2.74). Analysis of the H3 and H6 segments showed close relation between IAVs detected in spring and the following autumn migration. Though the mechanisms behind viral persistence in a single location are not well understood, we provide evidence that viruses can persist across several seasons. Current surveillance methods should be evaluated to ensure they are capturing the breadth of genetic diversity of IAV in waterfowl and prepare for IAV outbreaks in both animals and humans.

Other factors, like discharged sewage, internal loading and human activities in the watershed are also important. During studies on Brdowskie Lake, water samples were taken twice a year (spring and summer season) from the surface layer and analyses of soluble reactive phosphates, total phosphorus, nitrates, conductivity, five-day biochemical oxygen demand, chlorophyll a, dry mass of seston and Secchi depth were undertaken. Brdowskie Lake is situated in Kujawskie Lakeland and its catchment basin covers about 155.3 km(2). The littoral vegetation is dominated by reed bed with a minor presence of other taxa. The lake is very susceptible to degradation (morphology, agricultural lands, housing) and has several potential sources of pollution, e.g. Notec River, a nameless stream and summer houses. In general, water quality of the lake was better during the spring season, especially in terms of chlorophyll a and dry mass of seston concentrations. In 1997-2006, the level of conductivity was very changeable with the maximum values observed in 1999-2001. Significant correlations between some parameters in certain seasons of the year were found, e.g. between chlorophyll a and Secchi depth during spring and total phosphorus and phosphates in summer. The impact of water level fluctuations on water quality parameters, like total phosphorus and chlorophyll a was observed. According to the results, the quality water in Brdowskie Lake is improving. After a biological wastewater treatment plant in the catchment had opened, the rate of salts flowing into the lake with sewage was reduced.

In this book the author named the autumn camellia as "Sasanqua of Japanese" and described the 25 main cultivars he saw in Japan. The introduction of C. sasanqua plants in Europe dates back to the first half of the XIX century. At that time this species was not very popular as ornamental because of the simple shape and soft colour of the flowers and was often confused with C. oleifera and C. maliflora. This study aimed to investigate the introduction and the assessment of autumn camellias in Italy through a detailed bibliographic research. Few information were found in ancient documents and catalogues kept in public and private archives and a small number of old C. sasanqua cultivars were found in historical gardens. To date, precious collections are located especially in gardens around the Lake Maggiore (Piedmont - Italy). A catalogue field with fifty-six camellia cultivars was then established in Verbania. This valuable botanical heritage needs to be studied and preserved.

J	Islam, D; Berkes, F				Islam, Durdana; Berkes, Fikret			Can small-scale commercial and subsistence fisheries co-exist? Lessons from an indigenous community in northern Manitoba, Canada	MARITIME STUDIES												Subsistence (or food) fisheries are under studied, and the interaction between subsistence and commercial fisheries have not been studied systematically. Addressing this gap is the main contribution of the present paper, which focuses on how to deal with the challenge of overlapping commercial and subsistence fisheries. The study was conducted in Norway House Cree Nation, with qualitative data collection and questionnaire surveys. Commercial fishing in Norway House takes place during spring/summer and fall seasons, whereas subsistence fishing takes place throughout the year. Commercial fishing mostly occurs in the open waters of Lake Winnipeg; subsistence fishing in rivers adjacent to the reserve and in smaller lakes inland. How do fishers and the community deal with overlaps and potential conflicts between the two kinds of fisheries? The main mechanism is the separation of the two temporally and spatially. In the remaining overlap areas, conflict resolution relies on monitoring of net ownership and informal communication. The first mechanism is regulatory but really de facto co management in the way it is implemented. The second is consistent with Cree cultural values of respect, reciprocity and tolerance.

Water samples were collected from the central basin of Lake Suigetsu bimonthly between May 2008 and March 2010 at appropriate depths, including the oxic surface, oxic-anoxic interface, and anoxic bottom layers. Chlorophyll a, related to cyanobacteria and eukaryotic phytoplankton, was detected throughout the water column during the years of the study, whereas bacteriochlorophyll e, related to brown-colored green sulfur bacteria, was detected in the anoxic layers below the chemocline at a maximum concentration of 825 mu g L-1. The concentration of bacteriochlorophyll e was generally maximal at or just below the chemocline of the lake. The cellular content of bacteriochlorophyll e was estimated to be low in the upper part of the chemocline and tended to increase with increasing water depth. Bacteriochlorophyll a, which was presumably related to purple sulfur bacteria, was only detected at the chemocline during summer and autumn at concentrations of 5.4-16.3 mu g L-1. Our analysis of the chloropigment distribution for the two years of the study suggested that brown-colored green sulfur bacteria are the predominant phototroph in the anoxic layers of Lake Suigetsu, and that these play a significant role in the carbon and sulfur cycling of the lake, especially from spring to summer.																			1439-8621	1439-863X				JAN	2014	15	1					77	83		10.1007/s10201-013-0415-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-013-0415-y													WOS:000329834800008

Monitoring at fortnightly to monthly intervals of a very shallow, lowland lake over 24 years has enabled the time course of recovery from nutrient enrichment to be investigated after high external P loading of the lake (> 10 g P m(-2) year(-1)) was reduced between 1977 and 1980. 2. The lake showed a relatively rapid response during the spring and early summer, with a reduction in phytoplankton biomass occurring after 5 years when soluble reactive phosphorus concentration was < 10 mu g L-1. 3. However, during the later summer the response was delayed for 15 years because of sustained remobilisation of phosphorus from the sediment. The greater water clarity in spring and a gradual shift from planktonic to benthic algal growth may be related to the reduction in internal loading after 15 years. 4. Changes in the phytoplankton community composition were also observed. Centric diatoms became less dominant in the spring, and the summer cyanobacteria populations originally dominated by non-heterocystous species (Limnothrix/Planktothrix spp.) almost disappeared. Heterocystous species (Anabaena spp. and Aphanizomenon flos-aquae) were slower to decline, but after 20 years the phytoplankton community was no longer dominated by cyanobacteria. 5. There were no substantial changes in food web structure following re-oligotrophication. Total zooplankton biomass decreased but body size of Daphnia hyalina, the largest zooplankton species in the lake, remained unchanged, suggesting that the fish population remained dominated by planktivorous species. 6. Macrophyte growth was still largely absent after 20 years, although during the spring water clarity may have become sufficient for macrophytes to re-establish.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				OCT	2005	50	10					1628	1638		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2005.01434.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2005.01434.x													WOS:000231860600005

Biodegradation of Aqueous Organic Matter over Seasonal Changes: Bioreactor Experiments with Indigenous Lake Water Bacteria	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING-ASCE												Artificial groundwater recharge for drinking water production involves infiltration of surface water through sandy soil and its capture into a groundwater aquifer. The transformation of aqueous organic matter is one of the central issues in this process. The purpose of this work was to assess the potential of indigenous microorganisms in the source water to contribute in the aqueous organic matter biodegradation. For this purpose, microorganisms were enriched from the source water in a fluidized-bed reactor (FBR) and used for kinetic studies on biodegradation of organic matter at ambient temperature range. Lake water (total organic carbon 5.8 mg L(-1)) was continuously fed to the FBR containing porous carrier material to support biomass retention. In the inlet and outlet water there were on average 21 +/- 6 and 13 +/- 5x10(5) cells mL(-1), respectively. Biofilm accumulation (as volatile solids) reached 13.1 mg g(-1) dw carrier. In the continuous-flow mode and the batch tests, the highest oxygen consumption rate appeared in the summer, followed by the fall, spring, and winter. At low temperatures, the biodegradation of aqueous organic matter was relatively rapid initially for labile fractions followed by a slower phase for refractory fractions. The average temperature coefficient (Q(10)) in the system was 2.3 illustrating a strong temperature dependency of oxygen consumption. The isotopic analysis of dissolved inorganic carbon delta(13)C(DIC) analysis revealed 27 and 69% mineralizations of dissolved organic carbon at 23 and 6 degrees C over 65 and 630 min, respectively. These results can be used to construct additional input parameters in modeling applications of artificial groundwater recharge process. The biological component especially, i.e., the biodegradation, is difficult to predict for on-site applications without experimental proof and thus the interpretation in this study will help formulate design predictions for the process.

J	Paillisson, JM; Marion, L				Paillisson, JM; Marion, L			Can small water level fluctuations affect the biomass of Nymphaea alba in large lakes?	AQUATIC BOTANY												In this study we investigated above-ground biomass and morphological responses of a floating-leaved plant species, Nymphaea alba, to small spring water level manipulations (0.1-0.5 m) in a large, shallow lake over a 9-year period (1995-2003). A year effect was found in mean annual above-ground plant biomass with higher values found in years of low water levels, 275-339 g DW m(-2) in 1995 and 2003 against 143198 g DW m(-2) in 1996-2002 (no data transformation). No significant changes in biomass patterns were observed within each season (one summer peak), except in 1995 when a summer decline in biomass occurred. The amplitude and duration of exposure to high water levels affected the spring and annual above ground biomass of N. alba. The plant responded to high spring water levels by producing longer and thinner petioles to preserve leaves from flooding while no significant changes in leaf surface area (except in May) and leaf/petiole biomass ratio were obtained. The results are interpreted with regard to plant adaptations to changing environments (biomass allocation patterns in the different plant organs and stem density) and the effects of other abiotic factors relevant to the size of the system. We concluded that small deviations in spring water level can be driving forces in a large system in controlling the above-ground biomass of this floating-leaved plant. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Field data of zooplankton density and composition were combined with fish gut content analysis during a spring-summer season. Results showed that Galaxias early stages ingested mostly planktonic preys. A shift was observed in prey electivity: larvae preferred copepod nauplii whereas juveniles preferred cladocerans. Larval predation provokes the failure of the summer cohort of the calanoid copepod Boeckella gracilipes. The effect of juveniles is more undefined, but seems to prevent the reappearance of Ceriodaphnia in the summer plankton.					; Balseiro, Esteban/Y-2743-2019	Balseiro, Esteban/0000-0002-5052-0587; Modenutti, Beatriz/0000-0002-8683-5679													1015-1621						1993	55	1					65	75		10.1007/BF00877259	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00877259													WOS:A1993KZ67000006
J	Robb, JR; Tori, GM; Kroll, RW				Robb, JR; Tori, GM; Kroll, RW			Condition indices of live-trapped American black ducks and mallards	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												We compared condition indices of interacting American black ducks (Anas rubripes) and mallards (A. platyrhynchos) during staging to contrast changes in energy reserves that potentially influence survival or other population parameters. We live-trapped and banded 1,126 black ducks and 1,292 mallards from October through January, during 1990-1993 on Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in Ohio, USA. Ducks were aged, sexed, and weighed; total body length, wing chord, culmen, and tarsus were measured to compute condition indices. The condition indices were used as dependent variables in multiple regression models to measure influences of annual date, species, and ambient temperature for each age-sex class. Adult male black ducks usually had slightly higher (1% to 3%) condition indices than adult male mallards. Initially, in 1990 and 1992,juvenile female mallards had 6% higher condition indices than juvenile female black ducks, but during these 2 years, black duck juvenile females improved condition at higher rates than their mallard counterparts. Temperature effects on condition of live-trapped birds were noted, especially during November 1991, when decreased body weights corresponded with frozen wetland foraging areas. Daily temperature similarly influenced black duck and mallard egress from the Lake Erie marshes. Species differences in breeding chronology and breeding ground productivity could influence the body condition of these birds and the observed seasonal trends. The poor body condition of juvenile black duck females observed during some years could possibly contribute to lower survival and reproductive performance during the following spring if these differences continue through the remainder of the winter.																			0022-541X					OCT	2001	65	4					755	764		10.2307/3803026	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3803026													WOS:000171743200015

Hydrological differentiation and spatial distribution of high altitude wetlands in a semi-arid Andean region derived from satellite data	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												High Altitude Wetlands of the Andes (HAWA) belong to a unique type of wetland within the semi-arid high Andean region. Knowledge about HAWA has been derived mainly from studies at single sites within different parts of the Andes at only small time scales. On the one hand, HAWA depend on water provided by glacier streams, snow melt or precipitation. On the other hand, they are suspected to influence hydrology through water retention and vegetation growth altering stream flow velocity. We derived HAWA land cover from satellite data at regional scale and analysed changes in connection with precipitation over the last decade. Perennial and temporal HAWA subtypes can be distinguished by seasonal changes of photosynthetically active vegetation (PAV) indicating the perennial or temporal availability of water during the year. HAWA have been delineated within a region of 12 800 km(2) situated in the Northwest of Lake Titicaca. The multi-temporal classification method used Normalized Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Differenced Infrared Index (NDII) data derived from two Landsat ETM+ scenes at the end of austral winter (September 2000) and at the end of austral summer (May 2001). The mapping result indicates an unexpected high abundance of HAWA covering about 800 km(2) of the study region (6 %). Annual HAWA mapping was computed using NDVI 16-day composites of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Analyses on the relation between HAWA and precipitation was based on monthly precipitation data of the Tropical Rain Measurement Mission (TRMM 3B43) and MODIS Eight Day Maximum Snow Extent data (MOD10A2) from 2000 to 2010. We found HAWA subtype specific dependencies on precipitation conditions. A strong relation exists between perennial HAWA and snow fall (r(2): 0.82) in dry austral winter months (June to August) and between temporal HAWA and precipitation (r(2): 0.75) during austral summer (March to May). Annual changes in spatial extend of perennial HAWA indicate alterations in annual water supply generated from snow melt.

In both lakes, nanoflagellates and microzooplankton (mainly rotifers) accounted for a large fraction (17-55 and 0-67%, respectively) of total NH4+ regeneration (L. Kizaki, 0.011-0.261 mu mol liter(-1) h(-1); L. Biwa, 0.040-0.163 mu mol liter(-1) h(-1)), suggesting that microbial food webs were primarily important In NH,+ regeneration. Contributions of crustacean mesozooplankton to NH,I regeneration were generally minor (<16%), except on one occasion in early summer when crustaceans accounted for 62% of total NH4+ regeneration in Lake Kizaki. The weight-specific NH4+ regeneration rates (sR) of nanoflagellates and rotifers-ciliates were 20-30-fold greater than the corresponding rates for crustacean mesozooplankton, consistent with the general relationship between sR and body size of grazers. Bacterial contributions to NH4+ regeneration were high (26-51%) in summer but low (<10%) in spring and winter, which was explained in part by the strong dependency of bacterial sR on temperature. Our data demonstrate that rates and major pathways of NH,I regeneration may vary greatly depending on the size structure of planktonic food webs.																			0024-3590					SEP	1995	40	6					1091	1099		10.4319/lo.1995.40.6.1091	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1995.40.6.1091													WOS:A1995RY89500009
J	Pothoven, SA; Vanderploeg, HA				Pothoven, Steven A.; Vanderploeg, Henry A.			Variable changes in zooplankton phenology associated with the disappearance of the spring phytoplankton bloom in Lake Michigan	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Changes in seasonal cycles (i.e., phenology), can cause mismatches throughout aquatic food webs and often are used as the primary indicator of zooplankton response to environmental changes. However, zooplankton phenology has been largely overlooked in Lake Michigan despite the altered phenology of phytoplankton, including the disappearance of the offshore spring phytoplankton bloom following Dreissena mussel invasions. Multiple measures of phenology were evaluated for the major zooplankton groups in offshore southeastern Lake Michigan both before the loss of the spring bloom (1983-2003), and after the spring bloom had disappeared (2007-2019). Water temperatures in spring did not differ between time periods. Standardised biomass declined between time periods for all zooplankton groups in spring and for total zooplankton and the cladoceran Daphnia in the summer. Changes in zooplankton phenology varied across groups and depended on the phenological measures used. Month of peak biomass shifted later for all groups, but the central point of the growing season did not change for any group between time periods. The onset of population development was delayed only for the copepod Limnocalanus. Spring chlorophyll concentrations combined with spring water temperatures provided the best predictions of population onset for Limnocalanus and Daphnia. The central point of the growing season varied with spring chlorophyll concentrations for Limnocalanus, but with spring water temperature for Daphnia. Changes in zooplankton phenology were relatively subtle compared to the large changes observed for spring chlorophyll concentrations. By contrast, there were fairly consistent declines in zooplankton biomass across groups that were associated with the declines in spring chlorophyll either alone or in combination with spring water temperature. This may mean that food limitation has a stronger influence on zooplankton biomass or production than on zooplankton phenology in offshore Lake Michigan. Based on our results from Lake Michigan, alterations such as nutrient reduction or invasive dreissenid mussel filtering that lead to declines in spring phytoplankton blooms in other large freshwater lakes could result in subtle delays in zooplankton phenology for some groups along with stronger declines in zooplankton biomass.

Oligochaetes (46%) and Pontoporeia hoyi (44%) accounted for most of the biomass at depths shallower than 30 m, but P. hoyi was the dominant form (65%) at depths greater than 30 m. Differences in total biomass between years and seasons (spring, summer, fall) were not significant, but year .times. season interaction was significant at depths greater than 30 m.

This study revised existing unified models using empirical data to develop an optimized TSM retrieval model tailored for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) (R2 = 0.69, RMSE = 7.78 mg/L, and MAPE = 0.23). Employing top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance data from Landsat satellites, accessed via Google Earth Engine (GEE), the refined model facilitated the generation of TSM datasets for fishponds across the GBA from 1986 to 2019. Over these 34 years, there was a marked decline in TSM levels in fishponds, with an approximate 50% reduction in annual average TSM. This decline was particularly notable in the northern, western, and eastern GBA regions, leading to a spatial distribution characterized by higher TSM concentrations in the central and southern regions and lower concentrations in the peripheral regions. Seasonally, TSM levels in GBA fishponds are significantly higher during spring and summer compared to autumn and winter. Regarding natural factors, wind speed shows a significant positive correlation with long-term TSM fluctuations in these environments (p < 0.01). Stocking density, regulated artificially, emerges as a pivotal factor affecting TSM fluctuations. Specifically, TSM concentrations are elevated during periods of high stocking density in the rapid growth phase, and decrease during the mature and harvesting phases when stocking densities are reduced. Furthermore, fishponds situated in impervious areas exhibit significantly higher TSM concentrations compared to those in cropland or forested areas. The economic costs associated with aquaculture drive variations in stocking densities across different land uses within the GBA, contributing to the observed spatial variations in TSM levels. Given the status of the GBA as one of China's most advanced aquaculture regions, the insights from this study hold substantial value from both economic and ecological viewpoints.

Thus, a surface temperature analysis at different temporal scales is important, as this parameter influences the physical, chemical, and biological cycles of lakes. Here, we analyze monthly, seasonal, and annual surface temperature trends in south central Chilean lakes during the 2000-2016 period, using MODIS satellite imagery. To this end, 14 lakes with a surface area greater than 10 km(2) were examined. Results show that 12 of the 14 lakes presented a statistically significant increase in surface temperature, with a rate of 0.10 degrees C/decade (0.01 degrees C/year) over the period. Furthermore, some of the lakes in the study present a significant upward trend in surface temperature, especially in spring, summer, and winter. In general, a significant increase in surface water temperature was found in lakes located at higher altitudes, such as Maule, Laja and Galletue lakes. These results contribute to the provision of useful data on Chilean lakes for managers and policymakers.					; Morales-Salinas, Luis/B-5545-2014	Fuentes Jaque, Guillermo Servando/0000-0002-7864-4899; Pedreros, Pablo/0000-0002-9981-8173; Rivera-Ruiz, Daniela/0000-0002-1471-8449; Rodriguez Lopez, Lien/0000-0002-0550-0253; Arumi, Jose Luis/0000-0002-8101-3510														2072-4292				NOV	2021	13	22							4535	10.3390/rs13224535	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13224535													WOS:000725105800001

Spatial patterns of atmospheric deposition of nitrogen and sulfur using ion-exchange resin collectors in Rocky Mountain National Park, USA	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Lakes and streams in Class 1 wilderness areas in the western United States (U.S.) are at risk from atmospheric deposition of nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S), and protection of these resources is mandated under the Federal Clean Air Act and amendments. Assessment of critical loads, which are the maximum exposure to pollution an area can receive without adverse effects on sensitive ecosystems, requires accurate deposition estimates. However, deposition is difficult and expensive to measure in high-elevation wilderness, and spatial patterns in N and S deposition in these areas remain poorly quantified. In this study, ion-exchange resin (IER) collectors were used to measure dissolved inorganic N (DIN) and S deposition during June 2006 September 2007 at approximately 20 alpine/subalpine sites spanning the Continental Divide in Rocky Mountain National Park. Results indicated good agreement between deposition estimated from IER collectors and commonly used wet dry methods during summer, but poor agreement during winter. Snowpack sampling was found to be a more accurate way of quantifying DIN and S deposition during winter. Summer DIN deposition was significantly greater on the east side of the park than on the west side (25-50%; p <= 0.03), consistent with transport of pollutants to the park from urban and agricultural areas to the east. Sources of atmospheric nitrate (NO3-) were examined using N isotopes. The average delta N-15 of NO3- from IER collectors was 3.5 parts per thousand higher during winter than during summer (p < 0.001), indicating a seasonal shift in the relative importance of regional NOx sources, such as coal combustion and vehicular sources of atmospheric NO3-. There were no significant differences in delta N-15 of NO3- between east and west sides of the park during summer or winter (p = 0.83), indicating that the two areas may have similar sources of atmospheric NO3-. Results from this study indicate that a combination of IER collectors and snowpack sampling can be used to characterize spatial variability in DIN and S deposition in high-elevation wilderness areas. These data can improve our ability to model critical loads by filling gaps in geographic coverage of deposition monitoring/modeling programs and thus may enable policy makers to better protect sensitive natural resources in Class 1 Wilderness areas.

L(-1)) on the plankton. The addition of phosphorus, alone or with humic matter, clearly raised the primary production in summer (54-56%), and to a lesser extent in spring (17-23%) and in autumn (17-58%). A significant correlation existed between primary production and bacterial production indicating that bacterial production was controlled primarily by organic substrates released by algae rather than by phosphorus or humic matter. In the control enclosure, bacterial production constituted 23-32% of primary production while with extra phosphorus and humic matter the proportion rose to 59%, indicating that humic matter was used by bacteria as an additional energy and carbon source besides algal exudates. Simultaneous enrichment with phosphorus and humic matter resulted in substantially higher bacterial production than with humic matter alone. In autumn, the addition of humic matter alone increased bacterial production, indicating that humic matter contained more easily utilizable organic material at that point than it did earlier. Some algal taxa responded positively to phosphorus and (or) humic matter enrichment, but the effects on proto- and meta-zooplankton communities were less obvious.

This study aimed to determine the effect of seasonality on water level, behavioural and nutritional status of Black-necked swans inhabit the Budi Lake, Chile. In winter and spring, the water level was recorded using a graduated rod and a time budget of 60 swans/hours was recorded from 8 am to 6 pm using binoculars and the focal method. In order to determine nutritional status a subset of 20 birds were captured and weight, length, wingspan, and tarsal length were measured. Also, blood sample was collected to determine cholesterol, triglycerides, and total proteins plasma concentrations. Budi Lake's water level increase in winter (111 +/- 3 cm vs 54 +/- 0.6 cm, P = 0.04). In addition, winter swan population increased significantly the time allocated to foraging at morning, and the proportion of effortful foraging behaviour (37/222 vs 14/185, P = 0.01), assigning less time to resting activities (7 +/- 4 % vs 11 +/- 2 %, P = 0.05) compared with spring population. Nutritional status was not compromised in swan populations in both seasons. In conclusion, behavioral adjustments allow Black-necked swan populations to maintain an adequate nutritional status despite the increase in water level during winter season.

Predation and stravation rates increased 1.6-9-fold, respectively, in the winter of peak population density. Predation accounted for 58% of the losses during the winter of peak densities while losses were equally divided between predation and starvation in the winter following the peak. Starvation and predation rates were lower on a food-supplemened grid than on control grids in the peak winter. In the following spring and winter, starvation rates emained low on the fooe grid while predation rates increased to equal those on control areas. We conclude that both starvation and predation were the proximate causes of mortality during the hare decline at Kluane Lake.

The role of winter phenology in shaping the ecology of freshwater fish and their sensitivities to climate change	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Thermal preference and performance provide the physiological frame within which fish species seek strategies to cope with the challenges raised by the low temperatures and low levels of oxygen and food that characterize winter. There are two common coping strategies: active utilization of winter conditions or simple toleration of winter conditions. The former is typical of winter specialist species with low preferred temperatures, and the latter is typical of species with higher preferred temperatures. Reproductive strategies are embodied in the phenology of spawning: the approach of winter conditions cues reproductive activity in many coldwater fish species, while the departure of winter conditions cues reproduction in many cool and warmwater fish species. This cuing system promotes temporal partitioning of the food resources available to young-of-year fish and thus supports high diversity in freshwater fish communities. If the zoogeographic distribution of a species covers a broad range of winter conditions, local populations may exhibit differences in their winter survival strategies that reflect adaptation to local conditions. Extreme winter specialists are found in shallow eutrophic lakes where long periods of ice cover cause winter oxygen levels to drop to levels that are lethal to many fish. The fish communities of these lakes are simple and composed of species that exhibit specialized adaptations for extended tolerance of very low temperatures and oxygen levels. Zoogeographic boundaries for some species may be positioned at points on the landscape where the severity of winter overwhelms the species' repertoire of winter survival strategies. Freshwater fish communities are vulnerable to many of the shifts in environmental conditions expected with climate change. Temperate and northern communities are particularly vulnerable since the repertoires of physiological and behavioural strategies that characterize many of their members have been shaped by the adverse environmental conditions (e.g. cool short summers, long cold winters) that climate change is expected to mitigate. The responses of these strategies to the rapid relaxation of the adversities that shaped them will play a significant role in the overall responses of these fish populations and their communities to climate change.

J	FAST, AW				FAST, AW			DISTRIBUTIONS OF RAINBOW-TROUT, LARGEMOUTH BASS AND THREADFIN SHAD IN LAKE CASITAS, CALIFORNIA, WITH ARTIFICIAL AERATION	CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME												Seasonal depth distributions of rainbow trout (Onchorhynchus mykiss), largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), and threadfin shad (Dorosoma petenense) were measured during August 1976 through January 1978 with vertical gill nets. Bass occupied shallow, warm water with mean depths mostly < 5 m during the summer, but migrated into deeper waters > 15 m during the winter when the lake destratified. Trout had the opposite pattern and were found in deep, cold water > 20 m during the summer, and in shallow water < 10 m during the winter. Shad depth distributions did not have a distinctive pattern. Changes in the diffuser during 1977 caused some minor changes in reservoir oxygen and temperature values, but had no apparent effect on fish depth distributions. Fish depths were more readily explained by considering thermal preferences and predation, with depth selection by bass apparently providing the main force effecting depth selection by shad throughout the year, and winter depth selection by trout. Trout and bass typically selected temperatures and depths closest to their fundamental ecological niche temperatures, but shad never did, apparently in response to predation pressures from bass and trout, especially bass.																			0008-1078					WIN	1993	79	1					13	27																WOS:A1993LZ02000002

Genomic identification of the long-chain alkenone producer in freshwater Lake Toyoni, Japan: implications for temperature reconstructions	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Identifying the lacustrine haptophyte species that produce long-chain alkenones (LCAs) is essential prior to down-core temperature reconstructions. Here, we investigated the identity of LCA-producing species from Lake Toyoni, Japan using 18S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and organic geochemical analyses. The rDNA analyses identified eighteen operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of which only one fell within the haptophyte phylotype. This haptophyte belongs to the Group I phylotype, as supported by the LCA distribution found in surface and down-core sediments, and is closely related to a haptophyte found in Lake BrayaSo (Greenland). The inferred temperature using the Greenland calibration is very close to the Lake Toyoni surface temperature recorded during the spring/early summer season, when the LCA-producing haptophyte is likely to bloom. We therefore suggest that the temperature calibration from the Lake BrayaSo, Greenland is a suitable calibration for down-core temperature reconstructions at Lake Toyoni. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

Shallow-water chironomid morphotypes, Dicrotendipes nervosus-type and Polypedilum nubeculosum-type, indicating low lake levels and productive habitats with abundant macrophyte cover, suggest two dry intervals between ca. 1575 and 1670 CE and 1770-1930 CE. These periods fall within the Little Ice Age (LIA), suggesting a link between lower global temperatures and weakened monsoonal activity. Since ca. 1930 CE, Tanytarsus cf. formosanus-type Bazal is dominant, indicating higher lake levels and lower productivity. This is supported by rising Ti/Al values, suggesting enhanced runoff and increased precipitation. A rise in Ceratopogonidae Dasyhelea-type during the last three decades suggests a decrease in lake size, likely reflecting anthropogenic water withdrawal since ca. 1989. Our findings support the notion of a dry LIA, affecting parts of Eastern Africa, southwestern Saudi Arabia, and extending to other latitudes such as the Tibetan Plateau. This points to large-scale weakening of the boreal summer monsoons and latitudinal southwards shifts of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. A pluvial period during the 17th century could be connected to a positive Indian Ocean Dipole event. Reconstructed increasing moisture during the pre-industrial era, which contrasts modern-day precipitation measurements, could be explained by seasonal variability with moisture increase during the early summer and autumn. Overall, our record emphasizes the interplay of climate variability and anthropogenic activities in shaping water resources and their sustainability in extremely dry low-latitude regions such as the Arabian Peninsula.

The main objectives were to determine the role of the hydrologic regime in structuring algal growth and the effects of physical and chemical variables on the coexistence of a dominant species: cyanobacteria, Microcystis aeruginosa (Kutzing) Kutzing and an eukaryotic dinoflagellates, Ceratium hirundinella (O.F. Muller) Dujardin. The results suggest that nutrients (TP, NH4-N and NO3-N), turbidity, and the hydrologic regime play an important role in regulating the occurrence of investigated species. The rainy summer period resulting in a mixing of the water column, and the low level of nitrogen coupled with the internal release of phosphorus from the lake sediment under brief periods of anoxia promote cyanobacterial bloom. During this period, the water column was characterised by high turbidity, which created favourable conditions for developing a huge C. hirundinella biomass and the simultaneous occurrence of M. aeruginosa. This study also demonstrated - that contrary to what was previously known, deep standing waters in the temperate zone are not only dimictic (mixing twice a year during the spring and the fall), but they can also be mixed during the summer period due to continued rainfall, which equalizes the temperature in the whole water column. This can promote the occurrence of cyanobacterial and eukaryote planktonic organisms.					; István, Grigorszky/Q-2245-2019; Csaba, Berta/AES-0541-2022; Udovič, Marija/IZE-0991-2023; Nagy-László PhD, Zsolt/ABF-1526-2021; Ács, Éva/J-3252-2014; Yaqoob, Majd/ABB-9337-2021	Yaqoob, Majd/0000-0003-3192-2609; Gligora Udovic, Marija/0000-0002-1982-2528; Somlyai, Imre/0009-0009-0379-4196; 													0213-8409	1989-1806					2019	38	1					41	53		10.23818/limn.38.11	http://dx.doi.org/10.23818/limn.38.11													WOS:000457181700003
J	Matthews, MA; Reynolds, JD				Matthews, MA; Reynolds, JD			A population study of the white-clawed crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes (Lereboullet) in an Irish reservoir	BIOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT-PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL IRISH ACADEMY												A population of white-clawed crayfish, Austropotamobius pallipes (Lereboullet), was studied by trapping and underwater observation in Blessington Lake, Co. Wicklow, between 1989 and 1993. Results suggest a sparse, patchily distributed population of some 500 adult crayfish (>30cm carapace length) per 100m(2) of rocky shoreline. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) averaged 0.44 adult crayfish per trap-night over summer, dropping to 0.16 during winter, for traps lifted and rebaited every 2-5 days. Approximately 6% of the catch exceeded 9cm in total length. Males dominated the larger size classes. The sex ratio of the entire catch of 1356 crayfish was 1.44 males to 1 female, rising to 1.99 males to 1 female during egg incubation. Berried females formed about 24% of the catch during this period. Mating activity occurred from early to mid-October. Mean pleopodal fecundity in the wild ranged from 55 to 65 eggs per female. Moulting commenced in early June. Growth increments averaged 9% of carapace length for the early summer moult, falling to about 6.5% for a second moult in the laboratory. This population represents one of the few sizeable lentic populations of A. pallipes remaining in Ireland, perhaps the last European stronghold for this species.

J	Huang, YY; Donaldson, DJ				Huang, Yao Yan; Donaldson, D. James			Measurement report: Observations of ground-level ozone concentration gradients perpendicular to the Lake Ontario shoreline	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Ground-level ozone (O 3 ) is a secondary air pollutant that has harmful effects on human and ecosystem health. Close to larger bodies of water, the well-known sea-breeze (or lake-breeze) phenomenon plays a role in regulating ground-level ozone levels. An observed lake-edge removal effect, where ozone concentration decreases within the first 500 m to 1 km perpendicular to the lake, is thought to be related to the lake-breeze circulation as well as several dilution and removal pathways. A field campaign was conducted in summer 2022 and winter 2023 in two locations on the north shore of Lake Ontario: the urban centre of Toronto and suburban Oshawa, some 50 km east, to assess how the local environment and season affect the lake-edge removal effect. Ozone, wind speed, and wind direction were measured on 6-7 different days in each season and city along transects perpendicular to Lake Ontario's shoreline. A consistent negative linear relationship between ozone concentration and distance from shore over the first 500 m (i.e. a lake-edge removal effect) was observed in both cities and both seasons. The ozone gradient changed in Oshawa from - 23.5 +/- 8.5 (1 standard deviation) ppb km - 1 in summer to - 8.1 +/- 5.1 ppb km - 1 in winter. The slope remained consistent in Toronto at - 15.4 +/- 6.7 ppb km - 1 in summer and - 16.7 +/- 7.3 ppb km - 1 in winter. The year-round observation of an ozone gradient and lake-edge removal effect suggests that there is an inherent "baseline" ozone concentration gradient at the lake edge, caused by the dilution effect of the rapid increase of the boundary layer there. This gradient is seen to be enhanced in the summer and dependent on local effects such as lake-breeze circulation and increased deposition to vegetation.					; Donaldson, James/G-7120-2012	Huang, Yao Yan/0009-0000-6378-5966; 													1680-7316	1680-7324				FEB 26	2024	24	4					2387	2398		10.5194/acp-24-2387-2024	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-2387-2024													WOS:001190492300001

Despite this, few studies have addressed the impacts of WWTP effluents on fish communities, especially during the winter-a season seldom studied. Here, we assessed the impacts of wastewater on fish community compositions and various water quality parameters during the summer and winter along two effluent gradients in Hamilton Harbour, an International Joint Commission Area of Concern in Hamilton, Canada. We found that fish abundance, species richness, and species diversity were generally highest in sites closest to the WWTP outfalls, but only significantly so in the winter. Fish community compositions differed greatly along the effluent gradients, with sites closest and farthest from the outfalls being the most dissimilar. Furthermore, the concentrations of numerous contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in the final treated effluent were highest during the winter. Water quality of sites closer to the outfalls was poorer than at sites farther away, especially during the winter. We also demonstrated that WWTPs can significantly alter the thermal profile of effluent-receiving environments, increasing temperature by as much as similar to 9 degrees C during the winter. Our results suggest that wastewater plumes may act as ecological traps in winter, whereby fish are attracted to the favourable temperatures near WWTPs and are thus exposed to higher concentrations of CECs. This study highlights the importance of winter research as a key predictor in further understanding the impacts of wastewater contamination in aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The vast majority of individuals in these populations were annuals, though in one L. peregra and the two L. palustris populations a few rare individuals survived to a second year of life and reproductive effort. Lymnaea palustris populations were completely univoltine, while there was evidence of very limited bivoltinism in one of the L. peregra populations, the other being purely univoltine. Mean generation shell growth rates were the lowest yet reported for either species (.apprxeq. 30-35% of maximal mean shell growth rate reported for other natural populations) and were apparently the result of the low productivity and temperature, and highly variable water levels. In these species, there is a direct correlation between shell growth rates and habitat productivity. The vast majority of interpopulation growth rate variation appears to result from non-genetic ecophenotypic environmental influences. Such plasticity allows both species to grow and reproduce over a wide range of trophic conditions of which the studied turloughs represent the lower extreme. In L. peregra, oviposition was limited to spring and early summer and followed closely by near complete adult mortality. In L. palustris, adults survived through, and oviposition periods extended into late summer or early autumn. This extended adult survival and oviposition is a life history trait adaptation that allows L. palustris to survive in marginal, unstable habitats subject to periodic drying and other catastrophic perturbations. In contrast, the contracted spring oviposition of L. peregra appears to be an adaptation for life in more stable and permanent aquatic habitats as it allows newly recruited generations maximal time for pre-reproductive growth and minimizes competition with adults.

Seventeen elements (Ca, Fe, K, Ti, Ba, Mn, Sr, Cd, Se, Pb, Cu, Zn, As, Ni, Co, Cr, V), water-soluble ions (Na+, NH4+, K+, Mg2+, Ca-2, Cl, NO3, SO42), and organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) were analyzed. The results indicated that the mean concentration of PM2.5 was 178.63 +/- 96.99 mu g/m(3). In winter, the PM2.5 concentration was higher during the day than at night, and the opposite was the case in summer, and the nighttime PM2.5 concentration was 1.3 times higher than during the day. Water-soluble ions were the dominant component of PM2.5 during the study. PMF source analysis revealed six sources in winter, during the day and night: salt lakes, coal combustion, vehicle emissions, secondary aerosols, soil dust, and industrial emissions. In summer, eight sources during the day and night were identified: soil dust, coal combustion, industrial emissions, vehicle emissions, secondary sulfate, salt lakes, secondary aerosols, and biomass burning. Secondary aerosols, coal combustion, and vehicle emissions were the dominant sources of PM2.5. In winter, the proportions of secondary aerosols and soil dust sources were greater during the day than at night, and the opposite was the case in summer. The coal source, industrial emissions source, and motor vehicle emissions source were greater at night than during the day in winter. This work can serve as a case study for further in-depth research on PM2.5 pollution and source apportionment in Lanzhou, China.

Stopover duration of fall-migrating dabbling ducks	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												The amount of time migrating birds spend at stopover sites, or stopover duration, partially determines an individual's access to resources, the environmental conditions encountered, and the exposure to predation, which in turn affect survival and fecundity. As such, migratory behaviors such as stopover duration can have a considerable effect on populations of migrants and plans for their conservation. This is especially true for migrant waterfowl, which are explicitly conserved through Joint Venture (JV) partnerships under the North American Waterfowl Management Plan. Although waterfowl are one of the most heavily studied taxa, little is known about their stopover behavior due to the scope of migration. Consequently, conservation plans of many mid-migration JVs either omit estimates of stopover duration or rely on antiquated data to estimate energetic requirements. We used weather surveillance radar to identify and enumerate ducks emigrating from an important stopover area in central Illinois. By using radar data in combination with data from weekly aerial inventories, we estimated an average stopover duration for fall-migrating dabbling ducks (tribe Anatini) of 28 days (SD?=?12) over 8?years (1996, 1997, 2003, 20052009). Our estimate was similar to the historical estimate of 28 days (19401966), which serves as the primary reference for the Upper Mississippi River Great Lakes Region JV conservation plan. In addition to a corroborative mean, we also found considerable inter-annual variation in stopover duration. Estimated annual stopover duration was correlated positively with an index of annual foraging habitat quality (Spearman's rank correlation; rs?=?0.83), suggesting ducks may have assessed local conditions and adjusted the spatiotemporal course of fall migration. If the stopover behavior of fall-migrating ducks is flexible and forage-dependent, it is possible ducks allocate their time among sites in a somewhat ideal and optimal fashion, which could substantially affect the way resources are allocated within the spatial context of a JV region.

J	Brooks, AS; Zastrow, JC				Brooks, AS; Zastrow, JC			The potential influence of climate change on offshore primary production in Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												This paper examines the potential influence of climate change on the primary productivity of Lake Michigan. Two general circulation models (GCMs) provided physical information on projected regional climate for the years 2030, 2050, and 2090. A 30-year record of meteorological data and limnological observations, from 1961 to through,1990, was used to define present, baseline conditions for the lake. GCM output was used to develop scenarios of future thermal characteristics, mixing patterns, and surface irradiance, which were then used to drive primary production calculations. Mean annual primary production for the base period was 116 g C/m(2). Under base conditions thermal stratification of the lake occurred on 13 June and extended 135 days until 26 October. Conditions projected for 2090 showed the mean date of stratification beginning as early as 5 April and remaining for 225 days until 20 November. Estimated mean annual primary production under these conditions totaled 113 g C/m(2), a decrease of 3% from the mean base value. Under the most extreme conditions of maximum projected cloud cover for 2090, primary production in that year could fall to 101 g C/m(2), a decrease of 13% from the base mean, or down 22% from maximum base production calculated under minimum base cloud cover conditions. The projected decrease may be attributed to physical/chemical constraints imposed on spring primary production by altered climate conditions. Early stratification would shorten the period of winter-spring mixing, during which time nutrients from the sediment are transported to the productive euphotic zone. The spring bloom was projected to diminish if early stratification capped the nutrient supply, and increased cloud cover reduced light input for photosynthesis. To a lesser extent fall production could also be reduced by the extension of the stratified period. Altered physical/chemical conditions influenced by a changing climate will be an important factor to consider in assessing future water quality conditions, primary production and the food web dynamics of the Great Lakes.																			0380-1330						2002	28	4					597	607		10.1016/S0380-1330(02)70608-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(02)70608-4													WOS:000180411100009

Nineteen rotifer species were recorded in routine samples collected in Lake Kinneret (Israel) in 7 offshore (deeper than 5 m), stations, at 12 discrete depths during 1969-2002. Organisms were sorted and counted (including external egg carrying females), biomass was measured and calculated for the entire lake stock (g(w.w) m(-2); mg l(-1)). Rates of grazing, respiration and production were measured experimentally at three different temperature ranges. Results were extrapolated to the lake community for months with similar temperatures. Rotifera comprised 7% of total zooplankton biomass in Lake Kinneret whilst Cladocera and Copepoda 58 and 35% respectively. Rotifers were found to be more abundant during December-June and decline in summer months. Monthly (1969-2001) means indicated total grazing capacity of rotifers as 11%,. respiration as 9% and production as 3.7% of the total zooplankton metabolic activity. Positive relations were indicated between rotifer and small bodied cladoceran numerical concentrations. Population growth models suggest that rotifers are not food limited in Lake Kinneret but that fish predation plays an important role in regulating abundance in spring-summer and fall.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP 1	2005	546						443	450		10.1007/s10750-005-4287-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-005-4287-y													WOS:000233117900047
J	Raborn, SW; Miranda, LE; Driscoll, MT				Raborn, SW; Miranda, LE; Driscoll, MT			Diet overlap and consumption patterns suggest seasonal flux in the likelihood for exploitative competition among piscivorous fishes	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Competition, both intraspecific and interspecific, among piscivorous fishes (predators) may be more pronounced in reservoirs because of the artificial nature of these systems and the continuous anthropogenic influences that may not allow natural processes to regulate their densities. Most studies attempting to measure the extent of competition are based on predator-prey balance indices that are annual snapshots and do not account for seasonal changes. We sought to identify times during the year when intra- and interspecific exploitative competition for prey was most likely among dominant predators in a large reservoir of the south-eastern United States. The possibility of interspecific competition was measured by examining the seasonal extent of diet overlap based on samples of stomach contents. The likelihood or severity of this competition was indexed by how well predators met their energy needs. We found predators were realising less of their energy requirements during spring and autumn, and diet analyses showed predators overlapped substantially in their use of prey during those seasons. Thus, exploitative competition was most likely or severe during spring and autumn; furthermore, this competition had the potential to be interspecific as evidenced by resource overlap.

J	Hautala, A				Hautala, A.			Autumnal shift from diurnal to nocturnal peaking feeding activity of Rutilus rutilus in boreal lake littoral zones	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The possibility that the feeding activity of roach Rutilus rutilus shows an autumnal shift towards hours of lower light intensity in shallow and illuminated habitats in temperate watercourses as a consequence of relatively increasing daytime predation risk was tested in a littoral zone of a large boreal lake using trapping experiments. Autumnal feeding activity of R. rutilus first showed a striking shift from day to twilight when water temperature fell from 20 to 10 degrees C, and a low but steady night activity prevailed in late autumn, when temperature had fallen to 5 degrees C and the length of the night had increased. The size of the captured littoral R. rutilus also increased throughout the autumn. Both shifts may be linked to increasing daytime predation risk and decreasing food demand and availability.

J	Yamamuro, M; Hiratsuka, J; Ishitobi, Y				Yamamuro, M; Hiratsuka, J; Ishitobi, Y			Seasonal change in a filter-feeding bivalve Musculista senhousia population of a eutrophic estuarine lagoon	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Filter-feeding bivalves often predominate the benthic biomass of estuaries, although their population size may drastically fluctuate due to physical and biological disturbances. To examine the recovery of a mussel population after periods of severe predation and anoxia, and to estimate the amount of nutrients removed from the system through mussel production, we surveyed, over 2 years, the Musculista senhousia population in the estuarine lagoon, Lake Nakaumi, Japan. Predation by diving ducks (Aythya fuligula, Aythya ferina and Aythya marila) during winter dramatically reduced the mussel biomass in both years, but recruitment of juvenile mussels sustained the population. Anoxia during the second summer severely reduced the mussel population, resulting in less biomass than in the autumn of the previous year. Potential annual removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from the lagoon water through burial of M. senhousia shells under oxic conditions was estimated to be 7.1 and 5.1 tons, respectively. These are equivalent to 0.7% and 4.9% of the nitrogen and phosphorous annual load entering the lagoon via the main river. Under anoxic conditions, removal would decrease to only 5.6% of the potential amount. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Pre- and post-winter collections over a 3 year period suggested the smallest individuals, <50 mm total length, died during winter under ice. Experiments with wild, age-0 smallmouth bass held in lakes demonstrated a size-dependent survival where smaller individuals had greater survival with an increasing temperature of exposure, but the largest individuals had reduced survival at warmer temperatures. Survivors lost 22-54% of pre-winter energy reserves measured as ash-free dry weight, which was similar to wild individuals captured in spring. Body size at the onset of winter affects survival, but it also appears that temperature interacting with a suite of environmental and biological factors affect changes in energy use and therefore survival of age-0 smallmouth bass under ice in winter.

Best performing algorithms are different in the different regions of the Baltic Sea. Moreover, there is indication that the algorithms have to be seasonal as the optical properties of phytoplankton assemblages dominating in spring and summer are different. We modelled 15,600 reflectance spectra using HydroLight radiative transfer model to test 58 previously published empirical algorithms. 7200 of the spectra were modelled using specific inherent optical properties (SIOPs) of the open parts of the Baltic Sea in summer and 8400 with SIOPs of spring season. Concentration range of chlorophyll-a, coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and suspended matter used in the model simulations were based on the actually measured values available in literature. For each optically active constituent we added one concentration below actually measured minimum and one concentration above the actually measured maximum value in order to test the performance of the algorithms in wider range. 77 in situ reflectance spectra from rocky (Sweden) and sandy (Estonia, Latvia) coastal areas were used to evaluate the performance of the algorithms also in coastal waters. Seasonal differences in the algorithm performance were confirmed but we found also algorithms that can be used in both spring and summer conditions. The algorithms that use bands available on OLCI, launched in February 2016, are highlighted as this sensor will be available for Baltic Sea monitoring for coming decades.

Phytoplankton biomass was characterized by multiple peaks which ranged over three orders of magnitude. Perhaps as a consequence of the three times higher current velocities at the northshore station, phytoplankton biomass ranged from 0.09 to 9.00 g .cntdot. m-3 compared with 0.10 to 2.40 g .cntdot. m-3 for the midlake station. Bacillariophyceae was the dominant group at the northshore station until September when Cyanophya contributed most to be the biomass (83%). Although Bacillariophyceae was the principal component of the spring phytoplankton community at the midlake station, phytoflagellates (49%) and Clorophyceae (25%) were responsible for summer biomass, with the Chlorophyceae expanding to 80% in the fall. The seasonal pattern of epilimnetic chlorophyll a correlated with temperature. While chlorophyll a concentrations were similar to values from 1970 and 1972, algal biomass had declined and a number of eutrophic species (Melosira binderana, Stephanodiscus tenuis, S. hantzschii var. pusilla, and S. alpinus) previously found were absent in 1982.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				DEC	1987	44	12					2155	2163		10.1139/f87-264	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f87-264													WOS:A1987M856600012

Spring and Summer Distribution and Habitat Use by Adult Threatened Spotted Gar in Rondeau Bay, Ontario, Using Radiotelemetry	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The spotted gar Lepisosteus oculatus is designated as threatened in Canada under the federal Species at Risk Act. Identification and protection of critical habitat is an important component of recovering species at risk. To understand the habitat utilization of the adult life stage of the spotted gar in Rondeau Bay, a shallow coastal wetland of Lake Erie, external radio transmitters were surgically attached to 37 specimens in May 2007. These individuals were tracked at 224 discrete locations throughout the spring and summer of 2007. Aquatic macrophytes were present at 201 (90%) of these sites. Habitat and water chemistry data were collected at all tracked locations occupied by spotted gars. On the basis of electivity indices, in spring spotted gars showed a strong preference for shallow (<0.5-m) and deep (>2.5-m) waters with pH values <8.5. In summer, strong preference was shown for areas with mixed macrophyte beds. Spotted gars were found to relate to specific depths and cover rather than to shoreline features in Rondeau Bay. The study results are being used by the spotted gar Recovery Team to identify critical habitat in Rondeau Bay. This critical habitat designation will be used to ensure the protection of habitat needed to preserve the species in Canada, in part by curtailing the removal of aquatic vegetation in Rondeau Bay.																			0002-8487						2012	141	4					1026	1035		10.1080/00028487.2012.675904	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2012.675904													WOS:000306462500014
J	Song, BY				Song, BY			A comparative study on planktonic ciliates in two shallow mesotrophic lakes (China): species composition, distribution and quantitative importance	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The species richness and seasonal development of planktonic ciliates were studied and compared in two shallow mesotrophic lakes, one covered with dense submerged macrophytes, the other macrophyte poor. Considerable differences in ciliate species composition, dominant taxa, abundance and biomass were observed. Ciliates were much more species rich in the macrophyte-rich lake, while they were more abundant numerically in the macrophyte-poor lake. Altogether, 96 species, included in 53 genera, 14 orders were identified. Among them, 80 species (included in 45 genera, 14 orders) observed from the macrophyte-rich lake, against 49 species (36 genera, 12 orders) were from the macrophyte-poor lake. In the macrophyte-rich lake, the mean abundance and biomass were 13.5 cells ml(-1) and 547.10 mu g 1(-1) f.w..; abundance and biomass were higher in spring and winter; naked oligotrichs dominated total ciliate abundance and Peritrichida dominated the biomass. In the macrophyte-poor lake, ciliate mean abundance and biomass were 35.5 cells ml(-1) and 953.39 mu g 1(-1) f.w.; abundances peaked in autumn; Scuticociliates dominated the abundance and Tintinnids dominated the biomass. Possible causes for the observed differences are discussed.																			0018-8158					JUN 1	2000	427	1-3					143	153																WOS:000088580100014
J	Zingel, P				Zingel, P			Vertical and seasonal dynamics of planktonic ciliates in a strongly stratified hypertrophic lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Seasonal population dynamics and the vertical distribution of planktonic ciliates in a hypertrophic and strongly stratified temperate lake were studied from April to October in 2000 and from April to June in 2001. In the epi- and metalimnion the ciliate abundance peaked in spring and late summer, reaching maximum values in the metalimnion (86 cells ml(-1)) on 7th August 2000. In the epilimnion, the highest biomass content (414 mu g C 1(-1)) was observed on 8th May 2000. In the hypolimnion only a late summer peak occurred and the ciliate numbers were always lower than in the epi- and metalimnion. Five groups dominated the community of ciliates: Oligotrichida, Gymnostomatea, Prostomatida, Hymenostomata and Peritrichia, and the community composition varied greatly with depth. In the epilimnion the ciliate numbers were dominated by oligotrichs but small algivorous prostomatids, peritrichs and gymnostomes were also numerous. In the metalimnion these groups were gradually replaced by scuticociliates and mixotrophic Coleps spp. In the hypolimnion scuticociliates and species known as benthic migrants dominated. In the epilimnion and upper metalimnion in spring large herbivores and in summer small bacterivores were more numerous.

J	Roy, R; Majumder, M				Roy, Ritabrata; Majumder, Mrinmoy			Assessment of water quality trends in Rudrasagar Lake, Tripura, India	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Rudrasagar Lake is a one of the vital lakes of Tripura, India and the only Ramsar Site of the state. The lake hosts an ample biodiversity inclusive of few endangered and rare species. This lake provides livelihood to a large number of local people by means of fishing, tourism and collection of aquatic vegetation. The water quality of Rudrasagar Lake is, therefore, important both in ecological and economical aspects. In this study, electrical conductivity, pH, temperature (T), total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, turbidity (Turb) and Total nitrate (N) of Rudrasagar were estimated in every month for 3 consecutive years. Assessment of the lake, conducted with multiple indices, revealed the overall quality of water was fair (NSF WQI 67-85) during study period with some deterioration in summer (NSF WQI 67-78). However, the lake was found turbid (17.3-57.2 NTU), lacked dissolved oxygen (3.92-9.16 ppm) and retained considerable organic load biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 1.18-4.92 ppm). A slight yearly deterioration was observed during winter, spring and summer. Functions of distribution for the selected parameters and indices, used in this study, were developed for mathematical expression of water quality trend.

Inshore bays and neighbouring habitats (riparian shelters, entrance of the bay and shallow riffles) were sampled every three hours from 6:00 to 22:00 h, using DC electrofishing with prepositioned frames. In early summer, chub larvae moved exclusively in between the middle of the bay and riparian shelters inside the bay. Juvenile dace and, later in the season, juvenile chub showed diel dynamics of which the amplitude was dependent on temperature and illumination: they moved into the bay in the morning, gathered in greater numbers at mid-day (up to 586 chub and 387 dace m(-2)), then progressively left the bay and entered neighbouring riffles in the late afternoon or evening. Small fish immigrated earlier into the bay and emigrated later than fish of larger size. By late September, most dace had left the bays, but returned there when water temperatures were < 7 degrees C. During autumn and winter, juvenile dace and chub of all sizes occupied exclusively inshore shelters with submerged riparian macrophytes or fallen tree leaves (corresponding densities of 0.7, 9.5 and 15.8 dace m(-)2, and of 6.8, 20.2 and 94.2 chub m(-)2). These results support the idea that young-of-the-year dace and chub shift from a restricted use of inshore shallow bays to a diel dynamics with alternate inshore-offshore movements at the time when they become juveniles, although the precise timings of these movements are still influenced by fish size and water temperature afterwards. The significance of these dynamics is discussed within a context of trade-off between the use of food resources and avoidance of predators.					; Baras, Etienne/K-1894-2016	Baras, Etienne/0000-0002-3541-6597; 													0378-1909					SEP	1999	56	1-2					183	197		10.1023/A:1007594932734	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1007594932734													WOS:000082467600013
J	Kernan, MR; Allott, TEH				Kernan, MR; Allott, TEH			Spatial variability of nitrate concentration in lakes in Snowdonia, North Wales, UK	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												At a regional scale, high nitrate (NO3-) concentrations in upland surface waters generally occur in tandem with high nitrogen (N) deposition levels. However, significant differences in the patterns of surface water NO3- concentration have been observed within areas of similar N deposition yet relatively few studies have been undertaken which examine within-region variation of NO3- concentrations. A study of 76 lakes in Snowdonia, north Wales, an area of high deposition and sensitive catchments, was undertaken to assess variation in surface water NO3- concentration across a 20 x 20 km grid square and to identify catchments vulnerable to NO3- leaching. Nitrate concentrations vary considerably, particularly during winter when values range from 0.7 to 70 mu eq l(-1). Although retention by vegetation and soil microbes in summer reduces the amount of NO3- reaching the lakes, 37% of sites are characterised by NO3- concentrations greater than 4 mu eq l(-1). The elevated concentrations occurring in summer suggests that N breakthrough has occurred. By examining the ratio of NO3- to total strong acid anions, it is shown that NO3- contributes significantly to freshwater acidity, particularly during the winter. Redundancy analysis shows that NO3- leaching is greatest, both in winter and summer, in catchments with high proportions of bare rock where soil and vegetation cover is limited. Nitrogen cycling in these catchments, generally at higher altitudes, may no longer be governed by seasonal biological controls. They are likely to be saturated with respect to nitrogen (i.e. incapable of further N retention) as a result of the elevated deposition levels in the area. The contribution of NO3- to acidity is also greatest at these sites. In winter, significant positive relationships are also evident between NO3- concentration and soil pH and coniferous woodland. The study demonstrates the importance of catchment factors in modifying the relationship between N deposition and N leaching in upland catchments.

The prevalences of R. campanula and R. fennica in Lake Saravesi, central Finland, during 1987 to 1989 were 1.0 and 33.2 % (n = 1157), respectively. No clear seasonality in prevalence was found in either species, although miracidia of these digeneans are present only in late summer and autumn. The proportion of infected clams in which the gonad was full of sporocyst tubules was on average 90% for R. campanula and 30% for R. fennica. Clams with only few sporocyst tubules in their gonad were observed most frequently in spring. Old, empty sporocyst ribbons of R. fennica first appeared in the clams during August after the beginning of the cercarial emergence and disappeared slowly thereafter. However, in both species viable sporocyst ribbons with early developmental stages of cercariae were found throughout the year. The emergence of R. fennica cercariae began during July and continued throughout September in Lake Saravesi. The duration of cercariae emergence was found to be up to 72 days in the laboratory. R. campanula cerariae in the northern Lake Kuivasjarvi emerged from mid-June until mid-August.

J	Mooney, KL; Webb, RW				Mooney, Kori L.; Webb, Ryan W.			Aspect controls on the spatial redistribution of snow water equivalence through the lateral flow of liquid water in a subalpine catchment	CRYOSPHERE												Quantifying subalpine snowpack parameters as they vary through time with respect to aspect and position on slope is important for estimating the seasonal storage of snow water resources. Snow depth and density are dynamic parameters that change throughout the progression of the accumulation and melt periods, with direct implications on the distribution of snow water equivalence (SWE) across a landscape. Additionally, changes in density can infer physical processes occurring within the snowpack, such as compaction, liquid water ponding, and lateral flow. In this study, we measure snow depth and density throughout the Dry Lake watershed, a 0.25 km2 watershed in northern Colorado, USA, using L-band (1.0 GHz) ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and coincident depth probing. We calibrated these surveys using snow pit observations and a SNOTEL station. A physical snowpack model, SNOWPACK, with inputs from a local remote automated weather station and a SNOTEL station produced simulations of snow depth, snow density, and liquid water content (LWC). The model simulations indicate mid-winter melt events produced LWC on the south aspect that is less present in the north aspect and flat areas. These mid-winter melt events, in combination with observations, are interpreted to result in the lateral flow of LWC downslope and the redistribution of SWE. Further observations show a steady increase in soil moisture in sensors at the SNOTEL station throughout the winter in the flat terrain and ice layer formation on the south aspect snow pits during mid-winter surveys. Other key observations include ponding of liquid water at the base of the north aspect during the later spring season melt phase evidenced by GPR transects. We further develop a perceptual model for the aspect controls on the distribution and movement of SWE during the winter and spring seasons. In summary, for the Dry Lake watershed mid-winter melt events are observed on south aspects and interpreted to cause a redistribution of SWE downslope, while spring melt brings liquid water ponding at the base of north aspects. These differences in snowmelt dynamics are based primarily on aspect, providing important processes to consider for spatially and temporally extensive SWE measurements moving forward.

J	Minor, EC; Brinkley, G				Minor, Elizabeth C.; Brinkley, Gabriella			Alkalinity, pH, and pCO2 in the Laurentian Great Lakes: An initial view of seasonal and inter-annual trends	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Ongoing human perturbations to the global inorganic carbon cycle can cause various changes in the pH and alkalinity of aquatic systems. Here seasonal and inter-annual trends in these variables were investigated in the five Laurentian Great Lakes using data from the U.S. EPA GLENDA database. These observations, along with temperature, were also used to predict the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in surface water (pCO(2)). There are strong seasonal differences in pH in all five lakes, with higher pH levels in summer than in spring. All lakes show significantly higher pCO(2) values in spring than in summer. Michigan and Ontario show higher alkalinity values in spring; Huron shows lower spring values. Inter-annually, open-lake pH shows the highest values in all lakes around 2010, the time frame of lowest lake water levels, though only lakes Superior and Erie show statistically significant inflection points at that time. Inter-annual alkalinity trends differ considerably from those of pH. Superior's alkalinity increases until similar to 2008 and then begins dropping; Ontario's alkalinity decreases until 2004 and then begins increasing, with the decrease coinciding with the introduction and establishment of Dreissenid mussels. The other lakes show much less clear inter-annual alkalinity trends. For pCO(2), inter-annual trends in each lake show either increases from 1992 to 2019 (for Superior, Michigan, and Huron) or shifts from slightly decreasing values to increasing values for the other lakes. The timing of this shift is from 2008 to 2010. (C) 2022 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Across northern Iran, Little Bustard presence was confirmed at 15 of the 84 sites visited during the surveys. Three main wintering regions were identified: the Moghan Plain in the north-west of the country, the Turkmen Sahra Plain at the south-east corner of the Caspian Sea and the Sarakhs Plain in the north-east, close to the Afghan border. Up to 10,050 individuals were counted in winter 2009 in the Moghan Plain, which was recognised as the most important area for wintering Little Bustards in Iran. The species was also found in good numbers in Miankaleh, Gomishan, Soufikam, Shour Lake and Sarakhs. Flocks comprising 51 to 500 individuals were the most commonly observed and represented 32% of occurrences. A marked increase in wintering population size was noted in recent years. The main wintering period in Iran extends from November to February. At a national scale, we estimated the Iranian wintering population of Little Bustards at 5,000-10,000 individuals. This preliminary assessment suggests the need for a nationwide survey, emphasising in particular the western, south-western and central parts of the country that were overlooked in our study. It suggests further that Little Bustards in Iran would greatly benefit from national and regional conservation programmes.

J	Jing, L; Chen, B				Jing, L.; Chen, B.			Field Investigation and Hydrological Modelling of a Subarctic Wetland - the Deer River Watershed	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS												Recently, investigation and conservation of subarctic wetlands has been recognized as an attractive route. To gain insight of the interactions between hydrology and atmosphere of the second largest wetland in Canada - the Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL), the semi-distributed land use-based runoff process (SLURP) hydrological model was applied to a typical subarctic wetland - the Deer River watershed over a 20-year period (1978-1997). Sensitivity analysis, calibration and validation of the model identified a number of distinguishable hydrological features of subarctic wetlands as well as model deficiencies. Snowmelt was the major source of water recharge in subarctic wetlands and constituted approximately half of the average annual runoff in the Deer River watershed. The peaks of the simulated spring runoff were 34% lower than the observed ones in average which could be attributed to the effects of shallow permafrost that impeded the infiltration of melt water. Runoff of rainfall water during the summer season occurred only during storms due to canopy interception, depression storage, soil porosity, impermeable permafrost, and intensive evapotranspiration. A lag of 2-8 days between the peaks of streamflow and rainfall was observed through both field investigation and modeling results. The numerous seasonally connected ponds/lakes stretching over the middle and lower reach of the watershed behaved as buffers and significantly prolonged the concentration time in summer and fall. The findings will help build a scientific basis for advancing the knowledge of the hydrologic cycle and impacts of climatic changes on sub-arctic wetlands.					; Chen, Bing/D-2080-2013	Chen, Bing/0000-0003-1041-4525; Jing, Liang (Liam)/0000-0001-7155-9993													1726-2135	1684-8799				MAR	2011	17	1					36	45		10.3808/jei.201100185	http://dx.doi.org/10.3808/jei.201100185													WOS:000289029800004

The natural reserve "Saline di Trapani e Paceco" is an interesting natural area in Sicily, formed by the remaining strips of land among salt pans near the coastline. From January 2008 to January 2010, pitfall trapping was conducted in five sampling sites inside the study area. The community of terrestrial isopods was assessed using the main diversity indices. Twenty-four species were collected, only one of them endemic to western Sicily: Porcellio siculaccidentalis Viglianisi, Lombardo & Caruso, 1992. Two species are new to Sicily: Armadilloniscus candidus Budde-Lund, 1885 and Armadilloniscus ellipticus (Harger, 1878). This is high species richness for a single reserve in Sicily. The extended sampling period also allowed us to study species phenology. Most of the species exhibited higher activity in spring than in autumn while some species also exhibited lower activity in the summer. The species richness revealed that the study area is in an acceptable conservation status; Shannon and Pielou indices also confirmed a more or less even distribution of individuals belonging to different species.

The lake was supersaturated with CO2 most of the time and was a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere. The stability of stratification and the depth of water column mixing strongly controlled the surface water CO2 concentrations. Surface water concentrations as high as 195 mu mol l(-1) were measured when mixing extended to deep waters during spring ice breakup and autumn turnover. The concentrations were near the level of atmospheric equilibrium, about 15 mu mol l(-1), during periods of high stability.

The objectives of this study are (i) to quantify sub-daily variations of the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from two urban ponds (Silex and Pecheries) in the city of Brussels, (ii) to quantify if the sub-daily variations of GHG emissions were significant compared to their seasonal variations and to inter-pond variations among 20 other ponds in the city of Brussels. The partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2), CH4 concentration, and N2O saturation level (% N2O) were measured hourly from dawn to dusk in the Pecheries turbid-water pond and in the Silex clear-water pond during the four seasons in 2023-2024. pCO2 followed the day-night cycle of photosynthesis in spring and summer but was more erratic in winter and fall. The variations of CH4 concentration and %N2O were on most occasions erratic and difficult to attribute systematically to specific biogeochemical processes. The sub-daily variations of computed GHG emissions were mostly driven by variability in wind speed that usually peaked around mid-day. The comparison with previously acquired seasonal and inter-pond data (n = 22) showed that sub-daily variations of GHG fluxes were lower than seasonal variations, which were in turn lower than inter-pond variations. Consequently, to design sampling strategies to reduce the uncertainty on the estimate of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions a priority should be given to describe inter-system variability, followed by seasonal variability, and lastly sub-daily variability, in the context of the environmental management of inland waters, including urban ponds.

Air temperature ranged from -34.5 degrees C to +8.2 degrees C, water temperature (below frozen layer) from -1.5 degrees to +4.7 degrees C, and pH from 8.10 to 8.77. Dissolved oxygen varied from 8.4 to 12.1 mg l(-1) with higher values during winter months (June-July). The biological parameters - phytoplankton, chlorophyll-alpha and microbenthos - showed a bi-modal pattern of fluctuations with one maxima in austral summer and another in spring (late winter). Fluctuations in the hydrobiological parameters were closely related to meteorological conditions over the area, Biological productivity of the lake was dependent on the availability of ice-free water and increase in atmospheric temperature. An in-depth analysis and comparison of certain lake environmental aspects over a decadal period indicate that the lake environment is in a healthy condition. However, intensive human activities in the catchment area may deteriorate the ecosystem and hence regular monitoring and stringent regulations are needed to maintain its quality.					; Ingole, Baban/GLR-9722-2022	Ingole, Baban/0000-0001-6096-6980; 													0011-3891					MAR 25	1998	74	6					529	534																WOS:000072890700013
J	Kirkegaard, J				Kirkegaard, J			Life history, growth and production of Theodoxus fluviatilis in Lake Esrom, Denmark	LIMNOLOGICA												A population of Theodoxus fluviatilis L in the littoral zone of Lake Esrom was investigated from November 1977 to February 1979. The population was sampled every month in the winter period and twice during the rest of the year. Biomass was estimated as ash-free dry weight (AFDW) of the organic matter both of the soft parts of the animal and the shell itself. The relation between AFDW (c) and shell length (l) was log c = 2.9509 x log (l)- 1.7120. The population comprised more than 1 year-class, which could be separated by shell length, by a narrow band on the shells and the growth of algae on the shell. The life cycle lasted 21 - 3 years. The oldest animals had a shell length of 7.0-7.5 mm. A few individuals who were estimated to be 3 1/2, years had a shell length up to 8.6 mm. Population density varied between 575 and 2115 individuals m(-2) on the stony substratum. The average was 1160 individuals m(-2). Mortality was low during the summer period. In winter many animals died due to the effect of ice and stormy weather on the stony substratum. Growth of the animals was estimated from the shell length. Maximum growth was observed from May to August with no growth during the winter. Egg capsules were found on the stones all year round. New capsules were found from late May to the middle of November. Most freshly laid capsules were observed in May-June and August-September. Capsules from the late summer hatched in spring and capsules laid in the spring hatched in August-September. The average annual net production for the whole population was estimated by three methods. The Allen curve method gave 1.895 AFDW m(-2), the growth-increment method gave 1.784 mg AFDW m(-2) and the Hynes method 2.284 mg AFDW m(-2). Corresponding estimated P/B ratios were 1.29, 1.30 and 1.57. Annual net-production of the four investigated year-classes was 16 mg AFDW m(-2) year(-1) for 1975, 224 mg AFDW m(-2) year(-1) for 1976, 1.258 mg AFDW m(-2) year(-1) for 1977 and 287 mgAFDW m(-2) year(-1) for 1978. P/B ratios for the three oldest year-classes were, respectively, 0.32, 0.50 and 1.67. A comparison with other investigations on gastropod life cycles, reproduction and P/B ratios is made and differences discussed. Variations are correlated to temperature, and food quality and quantity. (C) 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

To understand the impact of the spill on the lake, including the fate of suspended solids, we examine changes in physical water properties over 11 years (2006-2017) using water column profiles, moored timeseries, and satellite imagery. Contaminated waters were initially largely confined to the hypolimnion; however, during autumn 2014 turnover, turbid waters were mixed to the surface, resulting in the clear blue lake turning bright green. Twelve months after the spill, the lake's temperature, conductivity, and turbidity temporarily returned to pre-spill conditions; however, initiation of mine effluent discharge in late 2015 was associated with a subsequent 15 mu S cm(-1) conductivity increase above historic values. Importantly, a post-spill 1-2.5 formazin turbidity unit hypolimnetic turbidity increase was observed during spring and fall turnovers of 2015-2017, which appeared to be due to resuspension of a thin layer of unconsolidated spill-related material from the lake bed driven by large internal seiche motions. This process implies spill contaminants may be seasonally mobilized into the water column, with potentially detrimental impacts on aquatic ecology. Our findings underscore that basin-scale physical processes, including seasonal turnover and internal seiches, must be accounted for, even in deep lakes, to understand the long-term impact of the ever increasing number of tailings spills into aquatic ecosystems. Plain Language Summary The catastrophic failure of the Mount Polley copper and gold mine tailings pond dam in August 2014 was, at the time, the largest mine-related spill ever documented. The turbid torrent of mine waste plunged to the bottom of the near pristine waters of Quesnel Lake, British Columbia, critical habitat for West Coast salmon stocks. Despite the scale of the spill, there was surprisingly little visible evidence of it at the surface of the lake in the months following. But what happened below the surface? Using 11 years of water column measurements we show that as the lake mixed from top to bottom (called turnover) that autumn the contaminated deep water was brought to the surface, abruptly changing the color of the clearblue lake to an abnormal bright green color-a change readily visible from space. Since the spill the turbidity of the lake has increased during spring and autumn turnover, apparently due to resuspension of spill material off the lake bottom driven by basin-scale wave oscillations. This process, and the ongoing discharge of excess mine waste water directly into the lake, raises concerns over the seasonal mobilization of mine contaminants and their impact on aquatic ecosystems.					; Laval, Bernard/J-9861-2012	carmack, eddy/0000-0001-6870-7772; Owens, Philip/0000-0001-8924-7437; Petticrew, Ellen/0000-0001-6203-1599; Hamilton, Andrew/0000-0002-2286-1472; Albers, Sam/0000-0002-9270-7884; Laval, Bernard Edmond/0000-0002-4810-9246													0043-1397	1944-7973				AUG	2020	56	8							e2019WR025790	10.1029/2019WR025790	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019WR025790													WOS:000582701700028
J	Appleton, SN; St George, S				Appleton, Sarah N.; St George, Scott			High-elevation mountain hemlock growth as a surrogate for cool-season precipitation in Crater Lake National Park, USA	DENDROCHRONOLOGIA												Snow dominates the hydrology and climate of the United States' central Pacific Coast, but because local measurements of snowpack and winter precipitation often extend back only a few decades, observations by themselves are not adequate to describe potential amplitude of wintertime conditions. Here we present a set of updated and extended mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana [Bong.] Carr.) tree-ring width records from Crater Lake National Park, Oregon, and use these data to make inferences about snowpack prior to the start of instrumental monitoring. In July and August 2013, we collected cores from 228 trees at seven high-elevation hemlock stands that surround the crater's rim. The oldest tree had an inner ring date of CE 1474, and the longest ring-width chronology maintained a satisfactory common signal back to the middle of the 16th century. The growth of high-elevation mountain hemlock is strongly and inversely related to cool-season precipitation, making these records some of the most southerly examples of a robust inverse cool-season moisture signal in North American tree rings. The growth of these snow-limited forests does not appear to have been affected by the substantial decline in spring snowpack observed in the past two decades across the broader Cascade Range, and we did not find any indication of changing relationships between tree growth and either monthly or seasonal winter precipitation since the early 1990s. The exceptional three-year sequence in Crater Lake tree rings between CE 1809 and 1811, which includes the narrowest ring since CE 1540 and anatomical abnormalities produced by cold weather, leads us to conclude that 1809-1810 was the most snowy and severe winter to affect south-central Oregon during the past four and a half centuries.

J	Palijan, G				Palijan, Goran			Towards deconfounding hydrological and seasonal temperature variability in the determination of selected limnological variables of a temperate floodplain ecosystem	ECOHYDROLOGY												This paper presents a methodological approach that can aid the assessment of variation in limnological variables in response to hydrological phases and seasonal temperature variation. The investigation was conducted in the Danube River floodplain, Kopaki Rit, Croatia. The proposed approach facilitates a more accurate examination of the effects of first factor, while maintaining second factor less variable, and vice versa. Samples were collected in the floodplain channel and lake along a temporal connectivity gradient, and were grouped according to three hydrological phases (isolation, flow pulse and flood pulse) and according to three seasons (spring, summer and autumn). A permutational multivariate analysis of variance was used to analyse the hydrological effects within seasons, as well as seasonal effects within hydrological phases on selected limnological variables: pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, nitrites, nitrates, ammonium, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, total phosphorus, chlorophyll a concentrations and ratio of copiotrophic to oligotrophic bacteria. A multivariate data cloud was structured by hydrological phases during all investigated seasons, but not by all seasons during different hydrological phases. The strongest impact of hydrological phases on limnological variables occurred during summer. Seasonal effects were significant during the isolation and the flood pulse phases. The flow pulse phase somehow obscured the effects of seasonal change, resulting in temporal floodplain homogenization. One possible explanation is that water temperature determines potential limnological conditions, whereas hydrology determines actual conditions. Such results must be taken into account if the accurate effects of hydrology and seasonal change are to be assessed in temperate floodplain ecosystems. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The Chatvd19 floating varve chronology relies on replicate varve counts on overlapping petrographic thin sections with an uncertainty of +/- 5 %. The uppermost non-varved interval was chronologically constrained by Pb-210 and Cs-137 gamma spectrometry and interpolation based on varve thickness measurements of adjacent varved intervals with an assumed maximum uncertainty of 10 %. Six varve types were distinguished, are described in detail, and show a changing predominance of clastic-organic, clastic-calcitic or clastic-aragonitic, calcitic-clastic, organic-clastic, and clastic-diatom varves throughout the Holocene. Variations in varve thickness and the number and composition of seasonal sublayers are attributed to (1) changes in the amount of summer or winter/spring precipitation affecting local runoff and erosion and/or to (2) evaporative conditions during summer. Radiocarbon dating of bulk organic matter, daphnia remains, aquatic plant remains, and Ruppia maritima seeds reveals reservoir ages with a clear decreasing trend up core from similar to 6150 years in the early Holocene, to similar to 3000 years in the mid-Holocene, to similar to 1000 years and less in the late Holocene and modern times. In contrast, two radiocarbon dates from terrestrial plant remains are in good agreement with the varve-based chronology.

J	EFFLER, SW; PERKINS, MG				EFFLER, SW; PERKINS, MG			FAILURE OF SPRING TURNOVER IN ONONDAGA LAKE, NEW-YORK, USA	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Onondaga Lake, N.Y., failed to turnover in the spring of 1986 because of the strong chemical stratification under the ice that developed as a result of ionic discharges from an alkali plant. The stratification had a negative impact on the O2 resources of the lake, as the lower depleted layers of the lake were not replenished with O2. Anoxia and anaerobiesis in the bottom water expanded following "ice-out''. Comparison of characteristics observed for the winter through spring interval of 1986 with historic data indicates Onandaga Lake has failed to experience spring turnover on a number of years (approximately 7 of the last 18 yr) because of the ionic discharges from the alkali plant.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				JUL	1987	34	3					285	291		10.1007/BF00193776	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00193776													WOS:A1987J072900006

Mute swans (Cygnus olor) using the LGL primarily eat plants, are essentially nonmigratory, forage exclusively in aquatic systems, and have increased substantially in number in the last few decades. Therefore, mute swans are an ideal sentinel species for monitoring elemental contaminants available to herbivorous and omnivorous waterfowl that use the LGL. We investigated hepatic concentrations, seasonal dynamics, and correlations of elements in mute swans (n = 50) collected at Long Point, Lake Erie, and Lake St. Clair from 2001 to 2004. Elements detected in liver at levels potentially harmful to waterfowl were copper (Cu) [range 60.3 to 6063.0 mu g g(-1) dry weight (dw)] and selenium (SE; range 1.6 to 37.3 mu g g(-1) dw). Decreases in aluminum, Se, and mercury (Hg) concentrations were detected from spring (nesting) through winter (nonbreeding). Elemental contaminants may be more available to waterfowl during spring than fall and winter, but study of seasonal availability of elements within LGL aquatic systems is necessary. From April to June, 68% of mute swans had Se levels >10 mu g g(-1), whereas only 18% of swans contained these elevated levels of Se from July to March. An increase in the number of mute swans at the LGL despite elevated levels of Cu and Se suggests that these burdens do not substantially limit their reproduction or survival. Se was correlated with Cu (r = 0.85, p < 0.01) and Hg (r = 0.65, p < 0.01), which might indicate interaction between these elements. Some element interactions decrease the toxicity of both elements involved in the interaction. We recommend continued research of elemental contaminant concentrations, including detailed analyses of biological pathways and element forms (e. g., methylmercury) in LGL waterfowl to help determine the role of element interactions on their toxicity in waterfowl.					chen, yuwei/U-9491-2017; Belzile, Nelson/J-4607-2019; Schummer, Michael/FDB-4240-2022														0090-4341	1432-0703				NOV	2011	61	4					677	687		10.1007/s00244-011-9659-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-011-9659-x								21424222					WOS:000298500700014
J	Chattopadhyay, S; Jha, MK				Chattopadhyay, Somsubhra; Jha, Manoj K.			Hydrological response due to projected climate variability in Haw River watershed, North Carolina, USA	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL												Global climate variations are expected to cause serious challenges to water resources planning and management, including an increase in sea level, abrupt changes in rainfall patterns and changes in ecosystems. This study evaluates impacts of mid-century climate variability as projected by climate models in the Haw River watershed, which contributes significantly to Jordan Lake, a major source of drinking water supply in central North Carolina, USA. The watershed-based hydrological model, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), was successfully calibrated with very good to excellent performance. Projected precipitation and temperature information for 2040-2069 from four dynamically downscaled regional climate models (RCMs) was used to force the SWAT modeling set-up of the watershed. On a long-term basis, a 38% decrease in the precipitation in early fall is expected while spring months are expected to receive 30% higher precipitation compared to the baseline condition (1980-2009). Water yield was found to increase in spring months, with a maximum of 74% increase on average. Summer months are expected to have on average 8% higher evapotranspiration (ET) than the baseline. Analysis of the change in average monthly streamflow at the watershed outlet (which leads to Lake Jordan) shows that there might be, on average, an 80% increase in streamflow in spring months (February, March, April and May), with the greatest increase (107%) in May. In general, simulation results indicated that the hydrological response of the watershed is very sensitive to the potential variation in climate (precipitation and temperature), with precipitation being one of the decisive factors in water yield increase.

J	Wildman, RA				Wildman, Richard A.			Mercury and methylmercury in a reservoir during seasonal variation in hydrology and circulation	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												This study explored the effect of seasonally varying inflow hydrology and circulation on total mercury (Hg) and methylmercury (MeHg) in the water column of a warm, temperate reservoir. The study site in Grand Lake, Oklahoma, is >80 km long and usually 36 m deep at its dam. During this study, aside from 2 large, storm-driven springtime events, drought caused low inflows. During maximal summer stratification, the surface mixed layer was 8-11 m thick, water below was anoxic, and inflows entered as an interflow. Total Hg in filtered samples was <4 ng/L with an interquartile range of 0.27-0.96 ng/L. Highest concentrations occurred in spring and summer, and lowest concentrations followed overturn. In filtered samples, MeHg was <= 0.62 ng/L with an interquartile range of 0.01-0.08 ng/L. Highest concentrations of MeHg occurred in some large inflows and in anoxic summertime bottom water in specific locations where total suspended sediment was also elevated. During this study, Hg concentrations in Grand Lake were driven by inflow hydrology when inflows were high. During low inflows, biogeochemistry controlled the enrichment of MeHg in specific locations of the anoxic bottom water and sequestered both Hg species in autumn. This sequestration suggests that Grand Lake decreases watershed-derived Hg pollution downstream. Occurrence of elevated Hg and MeHg concentrations primarily in large inflows and anoxic bottom water suggests that exposure of biota to Hg species is greatest when floods enter the reservoir because Hg enrichment in deep, anoxic water does not coincide with the habitat of most fauna.																			1040-2381	2151-5530					2016	32	1					89	100		10.1080/10402381.2015.1133740	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2015.1133740													WOS:000372472200008

A total of 58 macrobenthos species were collected and identified, including 28 species of annelids, 17 species of molluscs, and 12 species of arthropods. Both the community composition and the dominant species changed temporally and spatially. Correspondingly, the macrobenthos biodiversity differed among regions and seasons. The macrobenthos density decreased with increased sediment depth, which is the first report about the vertical distribution of macrobenthos in Lake Taihu. The majority of benthic animals were located within the sediment depth of 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm, accounting for 39.25% and 24.87% of the total abundance respectively. Redundancy discriminate analysis revealed that the main environmental factors affecting the most contributing macrobenthos species were temperature in summer, transparency, dissolved oxygen and pH in autumn, and water depth and dissolved oxygen in winter. Particularly, salinity and conductivity showed high correlation with the macrobenthos community through the whole sampling period. The investigation reveals the inherent spatiotemporal variation of macrobenthos community, and provides references for the biological assessment of water quality in Lake Taihu.

Here, we conducted magnetic, sedimentological, and geochemical analyses of the palaeosol-aeolian sand sequence from the eastern Horqin dune field in northeastern China, which documented the detailed history of climatic variations during the past 7.0 ka. The results indicate that the climate became more humid around 7.0-5.0 ka and approached an optimal humid condition around 5.0-3.6 cal ka BP. Afterward, the moisture condition clearly declined in 3.6-1.3 cal ka BP and was replaced by dry climate at the end. Additionally, we discovered that 10 periodically dry events that punctuated the overall pattern of climatic variations in the region, with times of more than 7.0, 5.7-5.5, 5.5-5.0, 4.6-4.2, 4.2-3.7, 3.6, 3.5-3.3, and 1.3 cal ka BP. These intervals were not only very consistent with the dry/cold events in the monsoonal boundary zone of northern China, owing to weak summer monsoonal strength forced by solar radiation, but were also accordant with the increased Asian winter monsoon strengths induced by environment variations of the high latitude area. This phenomenon probably implies the antiphase relationship between Asian summer and winter monsoons on the Holocene millennial-scale around the monsoonal boundary zone of northern China.

Correlation between climate, man and debris flow events - A palynological approach	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Debris flows occur frequently in the high-alpine catchment area of lake Lago di Braies (1492 m a.s.l.). The sediments of the lake are used for detecting and dating past debris flow events during the last 4000 years and their driving factors. Comparing palynological and sedimentological data the results suggest, that mainly heavy precipitation in winter and summer as well as snow melt events in spring enhance the release of debris flow events. Therefore especially longer periods with humid and cool climate conditions show a clearly higher debris flow activity. The pollen diagram documents human impact on the catchment area since the late Neolithic, but the anthropogenic activities influenced the event activity only indirectly. Grazing and deforestation reduced the retention of debris by vegetation and results in thicker debris flow layers in the lake sediments. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Intraspecific variation in Potamogeton illinoensis life history and seed germination has implications for restoration in eutrophic lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Potamogeton illinoensis is a North American macrophyte, commonly the focus of management, but limited knowledge of its life history hampers conservation and restoration efforts. We conducted greenhouse and growth chamber experiments and field monitoring to understand intraspecific variation in P. illinoensis reproduction and germination traits, monitoring one restored and three natural populations in Central Florida, USA. We assessed reproductive phenology, seed banks in the fall and spring, and germination across different light, temperature, sediment, and ethylene treatments. Flowering and seeding occurred spring through fall, with the highest seed bank densities in fall and minimal seeds detected in late spring. Seeds germinated at the highest percentages in light from 20 to 25 degrees C, and at higher percentages in highly organic field-collected soil. Seeds treated with ethephon, which emits ethylene (commonly produced by submerged organic sediments), germinated at nearly twice the percentage as those exposed to water alone. While these reproductive and germination patterns were true across populations, there was variation among populations in seed bank densities, the most favorable germination temperatures, and overall germination percentages, indicating population differences contribute to reproductive performance. These results suggest restoration via seeds will be limited in conditions with low light or in unconsolidated sediments where burial is likely.

Larvae abundance of the major forage fish in the rivers are compared with their year-class abundance, as measured by bottom trawl catches of later life stages in Lakes Huron and Erie. Abundance of rainbow smelt, Osmerus mordax, and alewife, Alosa pseudoharengus, larvae in the St. Clair River in adjacent years of the 4-year study was correlated with the abundance of yearlings captured in bottom trawls in lower Lake Huron in the spring of the following years. Abundance of locally produced larval rainbow smelt, alewives, and gizzard shad, Dorosoma cepedianum, in the Detroit River in adjacent years was correlated with the abundance of young-of-the-year captured in bottom trawls in western Lake Erie the following fall. Sampling fish larvae in the main channels of the St. Clair and Detroit rivers thus provided a potential early index of forage fish abundance in the lakes.																			0380-1330						1991	17	1					74	84		10.1016/S0380-1330(91)71343-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(91)71343-9													WOS:A1991FJ25400008

Cylindrospermopsin was detected for the first time in Italy in 2004; in this study, the presence of this toxin in Albano Lake (Central Italy) has been correlated to the cyanobacterial species Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and Aphanizomenon ovalisporum and their population dynamics. In 2004, these two species succeeded in the lake during spring, summer, and early autumn without overlapping, causing superficial blooms. Cylindrospermopsin was detected in lake samples by LC-MS/MS and ELISA immunoassay, showing extracellular superficial values ranging from 2.6 to 126 mu g/L, and water column values ranging from 0.41 to 18.4 mu g/L. Twenty-six of 30 positive water samples (86%) exceeded the recommended limit of 1 mu g/L. Intracellular values up to 42.3 mu g/g were measured. Moreover, cylindrospermopsin was detected in tissues from two Salmo trutta trouts (up to 2.7 ng/g) and in a well for drinking water supply (1.6 mu g/L). For the first time, two cyanobacterial species producing cylindrospermopsin were detected in the same lake in Italy. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J	Van Schie, AMP; De Boer, WF				Van Schie, AMP; De Boer, WF			Population dynamics and spawning of the flatfish solea bleekeri and pseudorhombus arsius in the intertidal area of Inhaca Island, Mocambique	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												The population dynamics of flatfish Solea bleekeri and Pseudorhombus arsius within the intertidal area of Inhaca Island, Mocambique, was investigated using bottom trawl data collected during summer (December 1996-March 1997) and winter (June 1997-August 1997). The endemic S. bleekeri is a small, relatively slow-growing species with low rates of natural mortality. Densities of juveniles were significantly greater in winter (24.7 fish 1000 m(-2)) than in summer (10.8 fish 1000 m(-2)), probably because of intensive spawning during summer. Greater catches of S. bleekeri were taken by night than by day. Densities of P arsius did not differ significantly between day and night or among seasons. Mean density of P. arsius was 53 fish 1000 m(-2) for the survey. Both species preferred the same substrata, significantly greater densities being found on the mudflats and in the tidal channels. Both seem to complete two life cycles within a year.																			0257-7615						2003	25						49	60		10.2989/18142320309504000	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/18142320309504000													WOS:000187197700006

Late Quaternary paleohydrological conditions in the drylands of northern Mexico: a summer precipitation proxy record of the last 80 cal ka BP	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												We present a late Quaternary multi-proxy record from the paleolake Babicora in order to understand the influence of North American Monsoon (NAM) and westerly winter storms on the paleohydrological budget of the drylands of northern Mexico. Stratigraphy, C-14 chronology, mineral magnetism and geochemistry of the 976 cm long sediment core were used to reconstruct the hydrological conditions over the last 80 cal ka BP. The inverse relationship between the proxy records of runoff into Babicora and winter precipitation in southwestern USA indicate the minimal influence of westerly winter storms at 29 degrees N during the Last Glacial period. Westerly winds transported minimally chemically altered sediments from the dry watershed during the cold stadials and the basin received more than average runoff as a result of a stronger NAM during the warm interstadials. The highest pluvial discharge occurred prior to 58 cal ka BP and terrestrial plants became the major contributor to organic matter deposited between 71 and 53 cal ka BP. Over the last 40 cal ka BP, the high amplitude fluctuations in runoff and lake water salinity mirrored an unstable summer rainfall regime. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The protocol was applied to freshwater samples collected during different seasons (spring and summer/autumn) in two lakes whose trophic statuses varied. Because few samples were collected (i.e., two dates per site), the findings are considered preliminary and mainly a "proof of concept" rather than a valid comparison of sites versus seasons. The results from the proposed protocol indicate higher diversity of infected host and parasite communities than in previous studies. Chytrid epidemics were omnipresent, infecting diverse phytoplankton host communities, primarily diatoms, chlorophytes, and colonial and filamentous cyanobacteria. The diversity and numerical abundance of sporangia and of hosts, and the prevalence of infection (range, < 1 to 24% of total host cells) as well, increased from the oligotrophic Lake Pavin to the eutrophic Lake Aydat, while the temporal changes in parasites were apparently more influenced by the host community composition. We conclude that the proposed protocol offers a valid method for the quantitative ecology of chytrid epidemics in aquatic ecosystems and food web dynamics.					; Sime-Ngando, Télesphore/M-4134-2019	Rasconi, Serena/0000-0001-6667-8904; Sime-Ngando, Telesphore/0000-0002-7240-5803													0099-2240	1098-5336				APR	2009	75	8					2545	2553		10.1128/AEM.02211-08	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02211-08								19233954					WOS:000264936800035

This study reports lower catches and it is suggested that fewer carpione are now in this lake. Opercula and scales have been used for aging fish and determining the growth rates. Life expectancy does not exceed five winters. Males became sexually active at 2 years (= winters) of age and females at 3 years of age, however, full spawning capability is achieved only in the following year. Our data confirm that carpione have two spawning seasons; winter (a long period) and summer (a shorter one). Carpione are not exclusively planktivorous but adapt their feeding habits to the environment and change the manner and time of their feeding.																				1095-8649				NOV	1990	37	5					687	698		10.1111/j.1095-8649.1990.tb02533.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1990.tb02533.x													WOS:A1990EJ07000003

Water in both lakes is from the Na-Cl type, depicting alkaline pH values and low EC (63-90 mu S cm- 1). The total CO2 flux (calculated using sequential Gaussian simulation) range between 2.5 t km- 2 d- 1 and 6.5 t km- 2 d-1, values closer to the mean value for lakes in the Azores with depth lower than 5 m. Values of total methane flux values are much lower, ranging from 31 to 38 kg km- 2 d- 1 falling in the lower range of worldwide datasets. Those emissions depict a seasonal effect, as total GHG emissions (CO2 plus CH4) range from 0.66 to 1.1 t CO2-eq d- 1 in warmer conditions, about twice the values during colder periods. The microbial characterization also depicts seasonal variations, showing a close relation with the diffusive CO2 and CH4 fluxes. During winter, anaerobic and sulfate-reducing bacteria are abundant, when microbial respiration intensifies, while in summer an enrichment in fermentative bacteria, including Clostridiaceae and Enterobacteriaceae is observed. High CH4 production in summer results is expected from the presence of methanogenic archaea, instead methane oxidation is more relevant in winter, as shown by the higher abundance of methanotrophs, such as Methylomonadaceae and Methylococcaceae. Results show that small volcanic lakes are significative natural sources of C-based greenhouse gases, being CO2 and CH4 emissions enhanced by the trophic state of lake ecosystems.

Community vulnerability to changes in the winter road viability and longevity in the western James Bay region of Ontario's Far North	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE												A network of winter roads that consists of snow-ice roads over land, muskeg, and frozen lakes and rivers has been and continues to be a critical seasonal lifeline in remote-northern First Nation (FN) communities in Ontario's Far North. This study examines current vulnerability of the Fort Albany community to physical, social, and economic impacts associated with the changing of the viability and longevity of winter roads and its seasons, as well as the river ice regimes. Semi-directive interviews with key informants (n = 8) and structured surveys with winter road users (n = 54) were conducted to gather local knowledge about the evolution of winter roads and climatic and environmental changes in winter road conditions and seasons. Trends in the river ice breakup and flood events for the Moose River, Albany River, and Attawapiskat River were also examined. The results of this study indicate that climatic factors, particularly air temperature and snowfall, have directly affected the construction and maintenance of the James Bay Winter Road. Trend analyses of spring flooding for the three rivers exhibit statistically significant increases (p <= 0.01) over the past few decades; thus, flooding in nearby communities has become a more significant threat in recent years. A few short- and medium-term adaptation strategies have been initiated in response to the impacts of climate change on winter roads; however, developing long-term planning and feasible adaptation for remote-northern communities in Ontario's Far North is necessary.					; Gough, William/L-5231-2013	Hori, Yukari/0000-0002-6929-9931; Tam, Benita/0000-0001-6319-7515; 													1436-3798	1436-378X				AUG	2018	18	6			SI		1753	1763		10.1007/s10113-018-1310-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-018-1310-1													WOS:000440041500016
J	Yun, XY; Yang, YY; Liu, MX; Wang, J				Yun, Xiaoyan; Yang, Yuyi; Liu, Minxia; Wang, Jun			Distribution and ecological risk assessment of organochlorine pesticides in surface sediments from the East Lake, China	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) are ubiquitous pollutants, and their presence in urban lakes is a concern for human and ecological health. Surface sediments in the East Lake, China, were collected in winter 2012 and summer 2013 to investigate concentrations, distribution patterns, possible sources, and potential ecological risks of OCPs in this area. The total concentrations of 14 OCPs ranged from 6.3 to 400 ng g(-1) dry weight (dw) with an average concentration of 79 ng g(-1) dw. The mean values of hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) (alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-HCH) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) (p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDD, and p,p'-DDT) were 36 and 7.6 ng g(-1) dw, accounting for 45 and 10 % of the total OCPs, respectively. The concentrations of OCPs in sediment samples collected in winter were significantly higher than those in summer, especially the HCHs, of which in winter were two times greater than summer. Composition analyses indicated that DDTs and endosulfan were mainly from historical contribution. Historical use of technical HCH and new input of lindane were probably the source of HCHs in the East Lake. Most sampling sites of HCHs and DDTs were found to have the potential ecological risk based on levels specified in the sediment quality standards.					; Yang, Yuyi/N-5428-2015; Wang, Jun/H-5837-2015; Yang, Yuyi/H-6600-2015; Wang, Jun/AAN-4446-2021	Yun, Xiaoyan/0000-0001-9987-6982; Yang, Yuyi/0000-0001-9807-6844; Wang, Jun/0000-0002-7574-9468													0944-1344	1614-7499				SEP	2014	21	17					10368	10376		10.1007/s11356-014-2893-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-014-2893-9								24756687					WOS:000340620400033
J	Wang, HC; Qi, TC; Chen, F; Li, J; Wei, JC; Cao, HH				Wang, Hechuan; Qi, Tianci; Chen, Feng; Li, Jing; Wei, Jiachang; Cao, Honghua			Satellites unveil long-term phenological shifts and environmental drivers of algal blooms in plateau lakes of southwestern China	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												In recent years, the ecosystems of plateau lakes have encountered notable challenges characterized by a surge in the frequency of algal blooms (ABs), thereby presenting a substantial threat to both human well-being and ecosystem integrity. While the existing satellite-based monitoring of ABs, there still remains a scarcity of systematic analysis of AB phenology. This study focuses on five representative plateau lakes in Yunnan Province, China, namely Dianchi, Erhai, Xingyun, Qilu, and Chenghai, all of which have encountered occurrences of ABs. By integrating high-spatial-resolution Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellite data from 1987 to 2023, we derived the long-term sequences and phenological patterns of AB areas in these lakes using the Floating Algae Index (FAI) and the threshold segmentation method. The findings demonstrated a notable upward trend in the monthly average percentage of bloom areas across these studied lakes, except for Lake Dianchi. Particularly noteworthy were the substantial increases observed in Lake Xingyun (slope = 0.94, p < 0.01) and Qilu (slope = 0.46, p < 0.01). Additionally, the annual frequency of ABs across these lakes demonstrated an initial increase followed by a subsequent decline from 1987 to 2023, with the highest frequency observed during the summer and autumn months. Correlation analysis revealed that the magnitude of the four-year cycle monthly average percentage of bloom area was primarily linked to water quality parameters related to lake pollution (r = 0.35, p < 0.01) and eutrophication (r = 0.34, p < 0.01). Conversely, the frequency of AB on a four-year cycle correlated with meteorological factors, including mean spring air temperature (r = 0.35, p < 0.05) and winter wind speed (r = 0.31, p < 0.05). Furthermore, the termination time of ABs was influenced by mean winter precipitation (r = 0.3, p < 0.05) and four-year cycle surface water temperature (r = 0.36, p < 0.05). This study elucidated the persistent phenological patterns of ABs in plateau lakes and explored the underlying mechanisms driven by multiple environmental factors. These findings would enhance comprehension regarding the evolution and mitigation of ABs, thereby facilitating the prediction and control of ABs in the context of more complex climate changes and anthropogenic impacts.

J	Zhou, YY; Li, JQ; Zhang, M				Zhou, YY; Li, JQ; Zhang, M			Temporal and spatial variations in kinetics of alkaline phosphatase in sediments of a shallow Chinese eutrophic lake (Lake Donghu)	WATER RESEARCH												Monthly sediment and interstitial water samples were collected in a shallow Chinese freshwater lake (Lake Donghu) from three areas to determine if alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) plays an important role in phosphorus cycling in sediment. The seasonal variability in the kinetics of APA and other relevant parameters were investigated from 1995-1996. The phosphatase hydrolyzable phosphorus (PHP) fluctuated seasonally in interstitial water, peaking in the spring. A synchronous pattern was observed in chlorophyll a contents in surface water in general. The orthophosphate (o-P) concentrations in the interstitial water increased during the spring. An expected negative relationship between PHP and V-max of APA is not evident in interstitial water. The most striking feature of the two variables is their co-occurring, which can be explained in terms of an induction mechanism. It is argued that phosphatase activity mainly contributes to the driving force of o-P regeneration from PHP in interstitial water, supporting the development of phytoplankton biomass in spring. The V-max values in sediment increased during the summer, in Conjunction with lower K-m values in interstitial water that suggest a higher affinity for the substrate. The accumulation of organic matter in the sediment could be traced back to the breakdown of the algal spring bloom, which may stimulate APA with higher kinetic efficiency, by a combination of the higher V-max in sediments plus lower K-m values in interstitial water, in Summer. In summary, a focus On phosphatase and its substrate in annual scale may provide a useful framework for the development of novel P cycling, possible explanations for the absence of a clear relationship between PHP and APA were PHP released from the sediment which induced APA, and the presence of kinetically higher APA both in sediment and interstitial water which permitted summer mineralization of organic matter derived from the spring bloom to occur. The study highlighted the need for distinguishing functionally distinct extracellular enzymes between the sediment and interstitial water of lakes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Langgut, D; Cheddadi, R; Sharon, G				Langgut, Dafna; Cheddadi, Rachid; Sharon, Gonen			Climate and environmental reconstruction of the Epipaleolithic Mediterranean Levant (22.0-11.9 ka cal. BP)	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												This study presents, for the first time, an environmental reconstruction of a sequence spanning nearly the entire Mediterranean Epipaleolithic (similar to 22.0-11.9 ka cal. BP). The study is based on a well-dated, high-resolution pollen record recovered from the waterlogged archaeological site Jordan River Dureijat (JRD), located on the banks of Paleolake Hula. JRD's continuous sequence enabled us to build a pollen-based paleoclimate model providing a solid background for the dramatic cultural changes that occurred in the region during this period. Taxonomic identification of the waterlogged wood assemblage collected from JRD was used to fine-tune the paleoenvironmental reconstruction. The chronological framework is based on radiocarbon dating and the typology of archaeological findings. The LGM (similar to 22-19 ka cal. BP) was found to be the coldest period of the sequence, marked by a distinct decrease in the reconstructed January temperatures of up to 5 degrees C lower than today, while mean annual precipitation was only slightly lower than the present-day average (similar to 450 vs. 515 mm, respectively). The wettest and warmest period of the record was identified between similar to 14.9 and 13.0 ka cal. BP, with maximum values of 545 mm mean annual precipitation reached at similar to 14.5 ka cal. BP. This time interval is synchronized with the global warm and moist Bolling-Allerod interstadial as well as with the onset of the Natufian culture and the emergence of sedentism in the Levant. The Younger Dryas began around 12.9 ka cal. BP and was identified as an exceptional period by the JRD sequence with low temperatures and minimal climatic seasonality contrast: an increase in rain contribution during spring, summer, and autumn was documented concurrently with a significant decrease in winter precipitation. The detailed vegetation and climato-logical reconstruction presented in this study serves as backdrop to seminal events in human history: the transition from small nomadic groups of hunter-gatherers to the sedentary villages of the Natufian, eventually transitioning to the agricultural, complex communities of the Neolithic.

The quantitative climate reconstruction uses multiple methods to provide an improved assessment of the uncertainties involved in palaeoclimate reconstructions. The multimethod approach comprises Partial Least Squares regression, Weighted Average Partial Least Squares regression, the Modern Analogues Technique, and the Non-Metric-Multidimensional Scaling/Generalized Additive Model method. We find two distinct climate intervals during the Holocene. The first is a moist period from 9500 to 7800 cal. BP characterised by wet winters and dry summers, resulting in a strongly seasonal hydrological contrast (stronger than today) that is interrupted by a short-lived event around 8200 cal. BP. This event is characterised by wet winters and summers at Accesa whereas at Tenaghi Philippon the signal is stronger, reversing the established seasonal pattern, with dry winters and wet summers. The second interval represents a later aridification phase, with a reduced seasonal contrast and lower overall precipitation, lasting from 7800 to 5000 cal. BP. Present-day Mediterranean conditions were established between 2500 and 2000 cal. BP. Many studies show the Holocene to have a complex pattern of climatic change across the Mediterranean regions. Our results confirm the traditional understanding of an evolution from wetter (early Holocene) to drier climatic conditions (late Holocene), but highlight the role of changing seasonality during this time. Our data yield new insights into the aspect of seasonality changes, and explain the apparent discrepancies between the previously available climate information based on pollen, lake-levels and isotopes by invoking changes in precipitation seasonality.

J	Nohara, S; Kimura, M				Nohara, S; Kimura, M			Growth characteristics of Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn in response to water depth and flooding	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Three experiments on the effects of water depth and flooding on Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn. were made in the artificial environment of concrete ponds. First, plants were harvested in autumn after growing under seven different water levels ranging from 0.2-3 m The number of floating leaves, the total number of leaves and the leaf area index of emergent leaves were greatest in the tanks at 0.5 m depth. The petiole dry weight per unit length of emergent leaves and the ratio of aboveground to belowground biomass rose with increasing water depth up to 2 m. In cont rast, that of floating leaves was constant at about 10 mg dry weight cm(-1) The proportion of biomass in tubers fell from 20% at 0.2 m to 6% at 2 m. Second, petiole elongation responses to the amplitude of flooding were investigated in early summer. The maximum rate of petiole elongation was 25 cm per day at 2.4 m water depth. This was the maximum depth at which N. nucifera could grow. No petioles could elongate from 3 m to 5 m depth. Finally, the effects of timing of flooding on growth were investigated. At the end of growing season, the belowground biomass of plants in the flooding treatment in late summer was smallest among the flooding treatment plants (P < 0.05), and was most severe when flooding occurred in this season. Based on the results of these experiments, the growth characteristics of N. nucifera in relation to petiole elongation, biomass allocation, and flooding tolerance were discussed.																			0912-3814					APR	1997	12	1					11	20		10.1007/BF02523605	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02523605													WOS:A1997WZ55800002
J	Plank, C; Shuman, B				Plank, Colin; Shuman, Bryan			Drought-Driven Changes in Lake Areas and Their Effects on the Surface Energy Balance of Minnesota's Lake-Dotted Landscape	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Open water within Minnesota constitutes 11 830 km(2) and represents a significant proportion of the moisture available on the landscape. Because lakes absorb and store heat in the spring and summer, and release heat in the autumn and winter, they also play a significant role in surface energy budgets. Lake areas fluctuate significantly over time, and thus alter surface albedo and energy partitioning in the expanding and contracting lake margin. Observations of lake areas from the 1930s "Dust Bowl" drought were used to approximate the impact of changes in lake area and volume on surface energy budgets. A statewide map of lake area change constructed from historical aerial photos of 620 lakes shows trends in percent area changes that mimic trends in moisture balance. Based on the aerial photos and an analysis of lake bathymetries, the water volume removed from the land exposed around the lakes during the drought was 9.1 +/- 3.0 x 10(9) m(3). The total area of exposed land was 3300 6 800 km(2). Based on a balanced energy budget estimate, the transition from standing water to exposed land at lake margins accounted for 1.12 +/- 0.31 x 10(11) W of energy storage across the state. The decreased heat storage resulted in a statewide average storage flux anomaly of 0.50 +/- 0.14 W m(-2) with localized anomalies as high as 33.9 +/- 7.1 W m(-2). Large uncertainties exist, however, regarding the partitioning of the energy because of the wide range of potential albedo values for both land and water. As conditions warmed during the twentieth century, lake volumes have increased. Therefore, the assessment herein of the change in heat storage is relevant to comparisons of high regional temperatures in the 1930s and 2000s.

Assessment of Groundwater in Karst System of Kashmir Himalayas, India	GROUNDWATER OF SOUTH ASIA	Springer Hydrogeology											In Kashmir Valley, the carbonate rocks cover an area of about 1100 km(2), of which 58% lie towards the southern part. Carbonate lithology in the form of Triassic Limestone constitutes significant karst geomorphologic imprints including solution features, swallow holes, conduits, shafts, caves and large springs. Hydrochemical data of major springs of Kashmir Valley indicate that the spring water chemistry is dominantly contributed from weathering of carbonate rocks. The karst spring waters are undersaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite, and PCO2 of the spring water is more than atmosphere, suggesting the groundwater in karst system is highly aggressive and capable of dissolving the host rock in most of the seasons. During winters, when there is negligible recharge, the spring waters are not aggressive as the carbonic acid is consumed and not replenished, leaving the waters saturated with respect to calcite and dolomite. The observed large fluctuations of spring discharges from daily or seasonal to annual scales reflect the quick flushing of groundwater and the extent of development of subsurface karstification in the region. The karst springs were found to respond immediately to ambient temperature, which causes snow/ice melting, and rainfall, which increases the recharge. Given the high relief of the Kashmir Valley and strong isotopic variability, the vertical isotopic gradients were estimated in different mountainous catchments. Keeping in view the high permeability, short transit times and multifaceted importance of karst springs in the region, effective approaches are required for the management and protection of these vital groundwater resources.

Lower-latitude lakes have high light availability in winter and less pronounced seasonal variations in fish predation on zooplankton. We might therefore expect higher phytoplankton crops in winter and much more predation on zooplankton by fish than in colder lakes. This might lead to less grazing in summer and relatively higher phytoplankton crops. We compared data on phytoplankton biovolume, zooplankton biomass and body size from 18 German and 6 Greek lakes to test these hypotheses.					; Michaloudi, Evangelia/AAS-4574-2021	Moustaka-Gouni, Maria/0000-0002-0845-1928; Michaloudi, Evangelia/0000-0001-8194-2865; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				JUN	2014	59	6					1136	1144		10.1111/fwb.12335	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12335													WOS:000333964700003

Multiple regression analysis was used to estimate the impact of selected meteorological conditions on atmospheric concentrations of hexachlorocyclohexanes and to identify the potential source regions. Overall, alpha- and gamma-hexachlorocyclohexanes were mainly associated with the gas phase, with an annual mean gas-phase concentration of 36 +/- 30 and 10 +/- 9.8 pg m(-3) respectively. On the other hand, mean particle (PM10) associated concentrations throughout the year were 1.9 +/- 2.4 and 0.46 +/- 0.43 pg m(-3) respectively. Gas-phase concentration of alpha- and gamma-hexachlorocyclohexanes peaked in the autumn season whereas highest concentrations in the particle phase were measured in spring. Ratio of alpha-/gamma-isomer ranged from 3.7 to 7.4 in the gas phase which was close to the ratio in technical hexachlorocyclohexanes (5-7). In the particle-associated phase this ratio ranged from 1.2 to 3.8, with the exception of daytime samples in spring (up to 16) and summer seasons (up to 14) and this exception could be due to the isomerization from gamma- to alpha- in ambient air, at least partly resulted from the impact of sunlight. Regression analysis showed that, at the sampling site, concentrations of alpha- and gamma-hexachlorocyclohexanes in the gas phase were both elevated with increasing temperature and wind speed, whereas in the particleassociated phase their concentrations tended to remain stable.

J	Schultz, J; Svajda, J				Schultz, Jeremy; Svajda, Juraj			Examining crowding among winter recreationists in Rocky Mountain National Park	TOURISM RECREATION RESEARCH												Crowding in America's national parks is a severe problem. Places like Arches National Park are witnessing such an influx of tourism that they are considering new management techniques. Understanding the social science of the situation through crowding studies assists park management in developing strategies for resource protection, recreation management, conflict prevention, and user satisfaction. The purpose of this research was to explore feelings and perceptions of crowding at the Bear Lake trailhead in Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP). The main goals of the study were to obtain information about visitors of RMNP during the winter season while examining the type(s) of activities they were engaging in along with exploring any feelings of crowding they might have felt. There were 428 completed questionnaires for this study. Results showed fewer conditions of crowding compared to summer users at the park. However, the results of this study also show that some individuals did experience crowding and even conflict during their visit. Such results are valuable as a complementary source of information to the summer studies that have already been concluded. Photo elicitation methods also supported normative standards of low user encounters on the trail in order to deter greater feelings of crowding.

Reconstructing the seasonal dynamics and relative contribution of the major processes sustaining CO2 emissions in northern lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Lake CO2 emissions are an important component of the carbon balance of northern landscapes, yet the temporal dynamics of the underlying mechanisms sustaining CO2 emissions are less understood. Here, we reconstruct the major biotic and abiotic processes influencing CO2 dynamics over an annual cycle in three limnologically different lakes, using a combination of empirical measurements and process-based modeling. Our results suggest that the relative importance of each process sustaining CO2 emissions is not only variable among lakes, but also highly variable among seasons within one lake. Spring CO2 emissions were largely sustained by the release of under ice accumulation (between about 50-100%), although photo-chemical DOC mineralization and hydrologic CO2 loading were also relatively important. In summer, due to warmer temperature, pelagic and benthic metabolism were the main sources of CO2 emissions. In the fall, lake CO2 emissions were generally sustained by hydrologic CO2 inputs, while hypolimnetic CO2 accumulation and release also contributed to fall CO2 emission in the deepest lake. On an annual basis, lake CO2 emissions ranged between 21.4 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and 55.5 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Our results confirm that the major processes all contributed significantly to CO2 emissions, but their relative contributions were modulated by the seasonal patterns in climate and hydrology, and by differences in morphology and organic carbon inputs among lakes. These lake- and season-specific features need to be considered both in the upscaling of lake processes at regional scales, and in predicting lake CO2 emissions under scenarios of climate and environmental change.					; del Giorgio, Paul/AAD-1315-2019; Solomon, Christopher/E-6284-2014	Vachon, Dominic/0000-0003-1157-5240; del Giorgio, Paul/0000-0003-1866-8159; Solomon, Christopher/0000-0002-2850-4257													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	2017	62	2					706	722		10.1002/lno.10454	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10454													WOS:000397875700020
J	Szlauer-Lukaszewska, A				Szlauer-Lukaszewska, Agnieszka			The dynamics of seasonal ostracod density in groyne fields of the Oder River (Poland)	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The study investigated seasonal dynamics of the ostracod population in the Oder River (Poland), in the area of groyne fields. Groyne fields were lenitic areas in that river system, providing favourable conditions for ostracod development. The main aims of the study were to find information on seasonal differences in ostracod occurrence, determine models of density dynamics and become acquainted with the effect of environmental factors on seasonal changes of ostracod assemblages. Samples were collected from 15 research stations in the littoral. The respective zones of the groyne fields abounded in various microhabitats. Average density, frequency coefficient, dominance, Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H), and Pielou's evenness index (J) were calculated for Ostracoda assemblages in order to point out differences between seasons. In total, 237 samples were collected; forty-seven species were identified, and the average density was 658 indiv. was studied during the vegetation season. The highest average density of the ostracods was discovered in spring (1160 indiv. m(-2)) with maximum of 9472 indiv. m(-2).); in the subsequent seasons it dropped by about half. The density dynamics of particular Ostracoda species was often different from their overall density. Significant differences between seasons were discovered with regard to the number of taxa, density and evenness index. The species that dominated throughout the year included Limnocythere inopinata and Physocypria kraepelini. Furthermore, juvenile Candoninae dominated in spring, Cypridopsis vidua dominated in summer, and Candona neglecta, C. vidua and juvenile Pseudocandona dominated in autumn. It turned out that the dynamics of occurrence of certain species observed in the present study contradicted data from literature related to the following species: Darwinula stevensoni, Cypria ophtalmica, Physocypria kraepelini, Limnocythere inopinata. All obtained models of density dynamics pointed out maximum density in spring, indicating that during that period the conditions in the river were optimal for ostracod development, as confirmed by the results of studying environmental factors. Ecological condition of the Oder was also good in the other seasons. Temperature, visibility, and dissolved oxygen content were among factors which most strongly affected ostracod assemblages. Availability of organic matter could result in decreasing their density.																			1129-5767	1723-8633					2014	73	2					298	311		10.4081/jlimnol.2014.865	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2014.865													WOS:000342807000009
J	Jones, J; Francis, CM				Jones, J; Francis, CM			The effects of light characteristics on avian mortality at lighthouses	JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY												The generation of artificial light by human activity can have far-reaching detrimental impacts upon a wide variety of organisms. A great deal of attention has been paid to well-lit buildings, television towers, and communication towers as sources of mortality for nocturnally migrating songbirds. However, despite being among the first human structures known to generate migratory bird kills, little is known about the current impact of lighthouses on birds, or the impact of light design. We examined the impact of a lighthouse on nocturnal avian migrants at Long Point, Lake Erie, Ontario, Canada. From 1960-1989, mean annual kills were 200 birds in spring, and 393 in autumn, with kills of up to 2000 birds in a single night. In 1989, the Long Point lighthouse was automated, with a simultaneous change in beam characteristics - the new beam is narrower and less powerful. This change brought about a drastic reduction in avian mortality at the lighthouse to a mean of only 18.5 birds per year in spring, and 9.6 in autumn from 1990-2002. Our results highlight the effectiveness of simple changes in light signatures in reducing avian light attraction and mortality during migration.																			0908-8857					DEC	2003	34	4					328	333		10.1111/j.0908-8857.2003.03183.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0908-8857.2003.03183.x													WOS:000187792000003

Population dynamics of the 19 most abundant spp. of chydorids had changes similar to other populations studied in north-temperate lakes. All species had either spring or fall maxima, or both, a mid-summer low in numbers. Population trends were the same for vegetative and mud habitats. In a comparison of Chara vs. mud habitat Chydorus piger, Leydigia leydigi, Alona quadrangularis, Pleuroxus aduncus and Alona circumfibriata live mainly in littoral mud. Kruzia latissima, Camptocercus rectirostris and C. faviformis were most restricted to the vegetative habitat, while other species were more unbiquitous. Pielou''s (1974) terms describing pattern, phase, mosaic, grain and intensity were discussed. Intensity was redefined as describing the visual effect of density. The changes of intensity accompanying changes in density typified 1974 patterns, while no changes in the other parameters were evident. Preliminary experiments exploring the behavior of chydorids suggest that visual stimuli are very important in directing movements, followed by tactile and chemical clues.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1978	59	6					1177	1188		10.2307/1938231	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1938231													WOS:A1978GS76200007

In two lakes in which pH changes have been very large ( 4.5 to similar to 6.0), pH explained most of the temporal variation in DOC concentrations. In the remaining lakes, long- term average previous temperature ( on the scale of a decade or more) was usually the best explanatory variable for DOC concentrations. Lake- specific multiple regression models constructed from long- term and short- term attributes of weather ( long- term average previous temperature and precipitation, winter- spring precipitation, summer precipitation, summer sunshine) and pH explained between 41% and 96% of the temporal variation in DOC concentrations during the entire monitoring period for these lakes ( n = 16-26 years). Multiple regression models considering only the period common to all lakes, 1987 to 2003 ( n = 1617 years), explained 35%- 96% of the variation in DOC concentrations. The importance of long- term and short- term attributes of weather in explaining temporal variations in DOC concentrations suggests that changes in climate will have large effects on lake clarity; however, the interactions between weather- related effects may be very complex.

J	Li, CY; Huang, W; Wu, RH; Sheremet, A				Li Chun-yan; Huang Wei; Wu Ren-hao; Sheremet, Alex			Weather Induced Quasi-Periodic Motions in Estuaries and Bays: Meteorological Tide	CHINA OCEAN ENGINEERING												Influenced by weather, the estuaries and bays often exhibit recurring oscillations in flow and water level similar to astronomical tides. The weather impact however is less regular than tides and more difficult to predict. The spectrum of weather induced motions in estuaries and bays is mostly at the low-frequency end with time scales longer than those of diurnal tides. The repeated weather impact produces meteorological tide: the recurring flood and ebb and flushing of the estuaries and bays but at lower frequencies than those of tides. The variation in weather conditions is quasi-periodic and of large scale nature (approximate to 1000-3000 km) because of the alternating low- and high- atmospheric pressure systems of extra-tropical cyclones and anti-cyclones and associated fronts. By examining 40 years of data between Jan. 1, 1977 and Dec. 31, 2016, we identified 1648 frontal events (averaging approximate to 41.2 +/- 4.7 per year) influencing the northern Gulf of Mexico for time periods in the spring, fall and winter. The late spring and summer months (May, Jun, July, and August) were not included in the calculation because of much weaker activities involving synoptic weather systems with fronts during these months. It is found that the number of frontal events reached the maximum in Jan. and Dec. while the minimum occurred in April and Sept. It is found that there is an increasing trend of number of fronts over the 40-year period. Our data show that the low pass filtered water level, velocity, and vorticity (velocity shear) all vary in response to the weather and appear as the meteorological tide. The particle excursions of meteorological tides are much larger than those from the astronomical tides. In addition, the irregular nature of the meteorological tide makes the inward flux and outward flux asymmetric in general and thus it has a significant implication to dispersion and transport of waterborne materials. A scaling analysis shows that the meteorological tide generally reaches quasi-steady state; and as a result, a regression model is established which can be very useful for predicting the weather produced quasi-periodic motions.					; Li, Chenzhong/F-5087-2016; Huang, Wei/Z-2557-2019	Li, Chunyan/0000-0003-2180-9784; 													0890-5487	2191-8945				JUN	2020	34	3					299	313		10.1007/s13344-020-0028-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13344-020-0028-2													WOS:000538701400001

Two surveys have been made in each lake (Capitao, Caiado, Rosada, Peixinho, Paul and Seca), in the winter and summer periods. These water bodies show small surface areas and are rather shallow, with depths ranging from 1.8 to 8.6 m. Water samples are cold, both in winter and summer periods, not presenting variations along the water column, with acid to neutral pH (5.26-7.06). The electrical conductivity values point out to very diluted waters (mean range between 27 and 33.4 mu S cm(-1)), of the Na-Cl type, corresponding to meteoric waters influenced by marine salts. To measure the CO2 flux at the lakes surface the modified accumulation chamber method was used, and a total of 1632 measurements were accomplished (711 in winter surveys and 921 in summer). Two statistical analysis (GSA and sGs) were applied to the results of diffuse CO2 flux measurements, showing that the CO2 flux values measured in theses lakes are relatively low (0.60-20.47 gm(-2) d(-1)), what seems to indicate a single source for CO2 (biogenic source), also suggested by the water delta C-13 isotopic signature. CO2 emissions range between 0.04 t d(-1) (Rosada_1) and 0.25 t d(-1) (Caiado_1) during the winter surveys, being in general similar to the values recorded during the summer surveys that vary between 0.03 t d(-1) (Peixinho_2 and Seca_1) and 0.30 t d(-1) (Caiado_2). Taken into account the surface area of the lakes, the highest values were estimated for both surveys made in Seca Lake ((similar to)13 t km(-2) d(-1)). The occurrence of a dense macrophyte mass in a few of the studied lakes, such as Caiado and Seca, seems to enhance the CO2 flux from these water bodies.					; Andrade, Cesar/O-4915-2018; Viveiros, Fátima/GSN-9406-2022; Andrade, César/O-4915-2018; Coutinho, Rui/N-1883-2013; Cruz, José/AHA-2232-2022	Viveiros, Fatima/0000-0002-0442-7955; Andrade, Cesar/0000-0002-5793-1987; Andrade, Cesar/0000-0002-9495-5988; Cruz, Jose/0000-0002-6475-3824; Coutinho, Rui/0000-0002-4774-394X; 													0075-9511	1873-5851				MAY	2019	76						72	81		10.1016/j.limno.2019.04.001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2019.04.001													WOS:000468883700009

We compared the hydrogen isotope composition of individual n-alkanes in the surface sediments of a series of lakes and puddles in Tibet with local meteorological and hydrological data. The results show that the oD of short-chain and long-chain n-alkanes is sensitive to hydroclimatic conditions, with oDp being the predominant control. oD becomes less depleted where precipitation amount and humidity are lower or evaporation is stronger. In addition, temperature is a significant factor affecting oD of mid-chain n-alkanes, with a significant negative correlation, and the temperature in spring, autumn and winter is an important influence on it. We believe that the oD of long-chain n-alkanes is still a good paleohydrological index in the arid/semi-arid region; oD indices of mid-chain and short-chain n-alkanes are also useful, and more mechanism research is needed.					zhang, chengjun/HHC-4054-2022														1040-6182	1873-4553				NOV 10	2022	637						44	56		10.1016/j.quaint.2022.08.014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2022.08.014		SEP 2022											WOS:000863038400001

Species introduction forces sympatric species to coexist within the same ecosystem by niche segregation. Japanese smelt Hypomesus nipponensis and sharpbelly Hemiculter leucisculus are ecologically similar species and were introduced to Lake Bosten, the largest inland lake in Northwest China, accounting for more than 60% of the total production. We predicted that the coexistence of the two invasive species is mediated by habitat segregation. We analyzed spatiotemporal patterns of Japanese smelt and sharpbelly abundance in Lake Bosten to determine the patterns of spatial segregation between the two dominant fish species. Our results showed that, in Lake Bosten, sharpbelly are typically littoral dwellers when the surface temperature increases in spring and summer, while Japanese smelt often prefer pelagic waters, especially during summer and autumn when the surface temperature rises. Japanese smelt showed an affinity for deeper waters, using median depths 1.7 m deeper than those of sharpbelly, irrespective of the sampling season. Water temperature was the main underlying driver of such spatial segregation and coexistence of these two closely related species in Lake Bosten. Spawning, food resources, and fishing were also important possible factors affecting spatial segregation between the two species. Our results provide new information on niche partitioning patterns as strategies for the coexistence of the two dominant non-native fish in Lake Bosten, supporting the idea that ecologically similar species can avoid resource competition through spatial habitat segregation.					; Zhang, Yinzhe/HKN-8253-2023; LI, Junfeng/GSE-0020-2022; Liu, Shengbo/JAZ-9733-2023	Ye, Shaowen/0000-0003-3932-8401; Song, Dan/0000-0003-3101-4344; Zhang, Yinzhe/0000-0002-6510-157X; /0000-0002-1258-2410														2071-1050				MAY 5	2023	15	9							7592	10.3390/su15097592	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15097592													WOS:000988245700001

The timing and vertical location of their spring peak coincided with that of the heterotrophic flagellates (HNF). A second maximum of the relative proportions of Actinobacteria occurred during an autumn bloom of the diatom Asterionella formosa. Betaproteobacteria were negatively related to HNF abundances and formed maximal numbers and biomass during the summer stratification in the increasingly oxygen-depleted hypolimnion. Members of the Cytophaga-Flavobacteria subclade (CF) of Bacteroidetes preferably inhabited the completely anoxic zone of the hypolimnion. The numerically dominant Actinobacteria contributed only little to total bacterial biomass, whereas Betaproteobacteria and the comparatively rare (albeit large) CF represented the bulk of the bacterial carbon pool. Amino acid incorporation was mainly observed in Actinobacteria and Betaproteobacteria. Actinobacteria showed a clear preference for amino acids other than leucine. These bacteria represented the most active biomass (with respect to amino acid uptake), whereas the opposite was the case for CF. The contrasting vertical and seasonal patterns suggest that the three phylogenetic groups to some extent represent different functional compartments of the bacterioplankton.					; Salcher, Michaela/A-1141-2013; Pernthaler, Jakob/A-2257-2008	Posch, Thomas/0000-0001-5145-3761; Salcher, Michaela/0000-0003-1063-6523; Pernthaler, Jakob/0000-0001-7558-909X													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	2010	55	2					846	856		10.4319/lo.2009.55.2.0846	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2009.55.2.0846													WOS:000276440000032

We combined PARAFAC modeling of fluorescence excitation-emission spectroscopy and biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) incubations to investigate seasonal changes in the lability of DOM along a soil-stream continuum in three soil types: bog, forested wetland and upland forest. The percent BDOC ranged from 7 to 38% across all sites, and was significantly greater in soil compared to streamwater in the bog and forested wetland, but not in the upland forest. The percent BDOC also varied significantly over the entire sampling period in soil and streamwater for the bog and forested wetland, as BDOC peaked during the spring runoff and was lowest during the summer months. Moreover, the chemical quality of DOM in wetland soil and streamwater was similar during the spring runoff and fall wet season, as demonstrated by the similar contribution of protein-like fluorescence (sum of tyrosine and tryptophan fluorescence) in soil water and in streams. These findings suggest that the tight coupling between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems is responsible for the delivery of labile DOM from wetland soils to streams. The contribution of protein-like fluorescence was significantly correlated with BDOC (p < 0.001) over the entire sampling period indicating DOM is an important source of C and N for heterotrophic microbes. Taken together, our findings suggest that the production of protein-rich, labile DOM and subsequent loss in stream runoff might be an important loss of labile C and N from coastal temperate watersheds.																			0168-2563	1573-515X				SEP	2009	95	2-3					277	293		10.1007/s10533-009-9336-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-009-9336-6													WOS:000269837900007

Here we evaluate the effects of prescribed fall burning on a wetland plant community that is managed primarily for spring-migrating geese. During late fall in 2 consecutive years, we burned vegetation in 4 replicate blocks (2.3 ha each) that traversed a natural moisture and associated vegetation gradient. We used ordination, gradient analysis, and contingency table analysis to evaluate how annual changes in relative abundance of plants were affected by burning as well as other important ecological factors. Burning increased species diversity of plants, especially in the 2 Nvetter vegetation zones, but had no effect on species richness or on the proportion of native plant species. Wetland plant species responded to prescribed burning independently, and their response often differed by vegetation zone and with annual variation in flooding. Burning enhanced the abundance of i native foxtail barley (Hordeum jubatum) and reduced the abundance of introduced swamp timothy (Crypsis shoenoides). Saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), a native plant species, was usually less abundant following burning, although the level of response was different for each of the 3 vegetation zones. Two other introduced plant species, quackgrass (Elytrigia repens) and reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinaceae), were less abundant after fall burning, especially when spring flooding was more extensive. Wild geese using the experimental blocks for feeding clearly preferred burned sites, suggesting that fall burning can enhance wetland use by geese during spring. Given that simple manipulations such as burning and flooding of a wetland system may often produce complex results, we suggest that on-going management schemes be regularly evaluated with field experiments such as those conducted in this study.

This study investigated the spatial and seasonal variation of conventional water quality parameters and 10 selected antibiotics in rivers inflowing into Taihu Lake. The results showed that total nitrogen, as a pollution driver factor, varied with the seasons, and higher concentrations of pollutants were generally found in the dry season compared with the wet season. For antibiotics, seven of them were detected in surface waters (n = 66) with detection frequencies (DFs) of 1.52-100% and eight antibiotics with DFs of 2.56-100% in sediments (n = 39). Sulfamethoxazole (SMZ, median: 1.47 ng/L), trimethoprim (TMP, median: 0.35 ng/L), and roxithromycin (ROX, median: 0.47 ng/L) with 100% DFs followed by erythromycin (ERY, median: 0.56 ng/L) with a DF of 90.91% accounted for a median percentage of 44.54%, 9.08%, 20.42%, and 13.16% of the sigma ABs concentrations in surface waters. In contrast, enrofloxacin (ENR, median: 0.54 ng/g) and ROX (median: 0.29 ng/g) with 100% DFs accounted for a median percentage of 58.21% and 31.71% of the sigma ABs concentrations in sediments. Anti-biotics in surface waters were mainly related to T, DO, TN and NH3-N, but were mainly related to T, pH and TN for antibiotics in sediments. Furthermore, most of the detected antibiotics showed higher concentrations and more species of antibiotics in winter than in summer or autumn. Similarly, the ecological risk values of anti-biotics showed higher in winter than in the other two seasons, whereas the overall risk levels were considered acceptable.

About 111 x 10(6) m3/year of agricultural drainage water is collected by 1641 km of earthen drainage network and during winter it is mostly discharged into two evaporation lakes located outside the project area. Landsat data were used to map the monthly and seasonal changes in the boundaries of the lakes and the drainage canals in the sand dune areas. Landsat images for Al-Hassa Oasis during summer and winter months between 1972 and 1987 were produced from Landsat Multispectral Scanner and Thematic Mapper data. The images show that the drainage water has formed large water courses in the sand dunes and is being wasted by flowing into the Arabian Gulf during winter season. They also show that the water ceases to flow into the Gulf, and that the water courses dry up during the summer, This information is new, and has changed the previous concept that used to indicate that the drainage water remains in the lakes for the purpose of aquifer recharge and cattle drinking. These findings are very important and valuable in developing new plans for drainage water management and utilization in the oasis. It was found feasible to store 75% of the drainage water in two large semiburied surface reservoirs in the sites of the two lakes lined and covered with flexible membrane material. The stored drainage water can be used to satisfy the water shortages and to irrigate new areas during summer.																			0034-4257					DEC	1992	42	3					239	246		10.1016/0034-4257(92)90104-R	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0034-4257(92)90104-R													WOS:A1992KF59200005

Comparison of shipboard and satellite measurements of surface water temperature and chlorophyll a in Lake Ontario	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												The binational Lake Ontario Lower Aquatic Foodweb Assessment program (LOLA) intensively sampled Lake Ontario in the Spring (April 28-May 3), Summer (August 10-11 and August 19-21) and Fall (September 21-25) of 2003. However, the timing of shipboard surveys often misses critical periods in biological productivity. We directly compared surface water temperature and chlorophyll a (chl a) measurements made during these cruises to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite images for May 3, August 18, and September 21, 2003. Satellite measurements were strongly correlated to shipboard measurements for surface water temperature (r(2) = 0.98) and chl a (r(2) = 0.62, offshore sites only). The OC4 algorithm for chl a greatly overestimated nearshore sites because of the probable presence of color producing agents other than chl a. However, its relative reliability for offshore sites adds confidence in using the imagery to fill the gaps between sampling cruises.																			1463-4988	1539-4077					2009	12	3					271	280		10.1080/14634980903136180	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634980903136180													WOS:000270156100007

Phytoplankton succession and the formation of a deep chlorophyll maximum in a hypertrophic volcanic lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Deep chlorophyll maxima (DCM) are a common feature of poorly mixed, low-productivity lakes, but are less commonly observed in eutrophic systems. This study investigates the transition from a late-spring surface chlorophyll maximum (SCM) to an early summer DCM in a hypertrophic lake, identifying the phenology and mechanisms responsible for the transition and how the DCM was maintained in this hypertrophic system. Data and samples were collected weekly during summer and monthly in winter at five sampling stations in monomictic Lake AOEkaro, North Island, New Zealand. Additional samples were collected on two occasions at c. 3-5 h intervals over 24 h at a single station, corresponding to periods with a SCM and DCM, respectively. The mean DCM depth was correlated with mean thermocline depth, and euphotic depth (z (eu)) continuously exceeded the depths of both the DCM and thermocline. The decline in the SCM and the transition to a DCM population were coincident with a gradual depletion of dissolved inorganic nutrients in surface waters and increased light penetration into the nutrient-rich hypolimnion. This study demonstrated that there are similarities between DCMs in lakes of high and low productivity, relating to the interplay between light, nutrients and thermal stratification.

In this paper, we present the preliminary results of an investigation concerning the dissolved gas and nutrient dynamics within a bed of Egeria densa Planch. in a bay of Lacanau Lake (southwestern France). Two 24-h cycles were carried out during summer and autumn 2013, for the measurement of dissolved oxygen (O-2), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN). Our results show that Egeria densa seasonal dynamics might strongly influence the colonized area: during summer, steady levels of O-2 (O-2 > 0.15 mM) were coupled to the macrophyte photosynthetic activity, while during autumn respiration processes were mostly pronounced (0.02 mM < O-2 < 0.25 mM). High concentrations of CH4 (0.6-53.9 mu M) and CO2 (0.03-0.83 mM) were measured within the bed during both sampling campaigns, that indicating a potential contribution to greenhouse gas emissions towards the atmosphere. This study suggests that a shallow environment colonized by an elevated biomass of submerged aquatic weeds is most likely subjected to water hypoxia and nutrient mobilization.					; Ribaudo, Cristina/LVS-4250-2024	RIBAUDO, CRISTINA/0000-0001-8992-221X; 													1253-8078	2166-3408					2014	161	3			SI		233	241		10.1080/12538078.2014.932703	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/12538078.2014.932703													WOS:000348288100002

Within lakes, the planktonic bacterial community (PBC) and sediment bacterial community (SBC) are both significant participants in biogeochemical processes of lake ecosystems. However, how the assembly patterns of bacterial communities vary seasonally along a trophic gradient in freshwater lakes is poorly understood. Here, we collected and analysed water and sediment samples from 13 shallow lakes located in an urban region of China during summer and winter, the trophic states of which ranged from mesotrophic to middle eutrophic in summer and oligo-mesotrophic to light eutrophic in winter. High-throughput sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA genes was used to determine the diversity and composition of bacterial communities. Our results indicated that bacterial communities derived from different habitats and seasons did not exhibit a uniform response to lake trophic states. Linear and nonlinear mixed effect models suggested that the alpha-diversity of PBC and SBC, respectively, showed a unimodal and monotonically decreasing trend with increasing eutrophication in summer, whereas that of PBC and SBC, respectively, exhibited no obvious trend or an increased pattern along the trophic gradient in winter. In addition, the taxonomic compositional dissimilarity of the PBC was most significantly related to lake trophic differences in summer. Phylogenetic structure analysis revealed that mostly environmental selection regulated the SBC and PBC in both seasons. Moreover, dispersal limitation and homogenising dispersal contributed more to the assembly of SBC and PBC in both seasons, respectively. Water temperature, associated with seasonal variability, was the most important variable driving the PBC assembly, while sediment pH overwhelmed nutrients in regulating the seasonal patterns of SBC assemblages. Overall, we highlighted that the water and sediments, as well as the seasons, differentiated the diversity patterns and assembly processes of bacterial communities along a trophic gradient of freshwater lakes. Our findings provide novel information for understanding the ecological responses of lacustrine bacterial communities to trophic gradients and seasonal variations. This study also contributes an important reference for predicting the changes of microbial community biodiversity under future scenarios of eutrophication.					; Jiao, Congcong/AAQ-8264-2020	Jiao, Congcong/0000-0002-9096-8431; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				AUG	2021	66	8					1515	1529		10.1111/fwb.13735	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13735		MAY 2021											WOS:000654537300001

DIEL STUDIES ON APHANIZOMENON AND ANABAENA BLOOMS	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Day and night measurements of N2 fixation (as acetylene reduction) were made during spring blooms of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and 2 autumn blooms of Anabaena spp. From 9 to 23% of the 24 h fixation occurred between 1100 and 1300 h. N fixation in spring showed complex, physically shallow but optically deep and mobile subsurface peaks of nitrogenase activity, which were totally unrelated to Aphanizomenon biomass but may have been due to diel changes in light penetrating the relatively clear water. Nocturnal fixation was uniformly distributed with depth and accounted for 1/5 to 1/3 of daylight fixation. In more turbid autumn waters, the pattern of N2 fixation for Anabaena blooms was simpler, with a surface (or near-surface) peak decreasing with depth. Nocturnal fixation was more uniformly distributed with depth. The difference in fixation patterns between the 2 species is attributable to the interactions of O2 with the nitrogenase enzyme system. The diel changes in nitrogenase activity suggest a need to establish whether the precursors of nitrogenase accumulate in an O2-stable form.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1979	24	2					329	341		10.4319/lo.1979.24.2.0329	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1979.24.2.0329													WOS:A1979GS84700010

However, its effect on the P fractions of lake sediments and the development of lake ecosystems are poorly understood, especially for P-limited lakes. This study investigates this issue via analyzing trap and core sediments of Dalongwan Maar Lake (DML), a P-limited lake in Northeast China. The provenance analysis indicates that the sediments in DML are mainly derived from the aeolian input from northern China deserts, which brings P-containing particles. Then, the relationships between atmospheric P deposition and the P fractions of the DML lake sediment and its ecosystems over the past 180 years were explored. The results show that: 1) The P fractions in trap sediments exhibit significant seasonal variation, with calcium-bound P (HCl-P-i) being the predominant fractions during spring and winter, while aluminum-bound P (NaOH-P-i) and iron and manganese (hydroxide)oxy-bound P (NaBD-P-i) are more prevalent in summer and autumn. The ranking order of P fractions in the core sediments was HCl-P-i > NaOH-P-i > NaBD-P-i > Res.-P (residual P). 2) The HCl-P-i content in the sediments of DML appears to be influenced by variations in northern China dust activity, while the Fe/Al-P-i (the sum of NaOH-P-i and NaBD-P-i contents) is associated with industrial and residential emission activities. 3) A gradual increase in atmospheric P deposition activity in northern China over the past century was observed. It may hinder the development of primary productivity in DML by increasing the water hardness, which is conducive to the formation of HCl-P-i. Furthermore, deeper water depth limits nutrient recycling from the lakebed, impeding algal growth. These findings enhance our understanding of how atmospheric P deposition influences lake sediment P fractions and ecosystems and provide guidance for the long-term health of DML.					chen, yiyan/JEF-0230-2023; Ji, ming/NDS-9964-2025; Zhou, Xin/AIE-7442-2022														0031-0182	1872-616X				FEB 15	2025	660								112679	10.1016/j.palaeo.2024.112679	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2024.112679		JAN 2025											WOS:001412538400001

The results indicated that sediment P fluxes, P mobile fractions, and P supply kinetics showed dynamic changes from the overwinter to the algal recruitment period. P flux and the concentration of the diffusive gradient in thin film (DGT)-measured labile P increased from winter to summer. However, the highest P supply ability was found in spring sediments, as indicated by the ratios of DGT-P to porewater P, suggesting that spring sediments can supply more P for the growth of overwinter algae. Laboratory incubation experiments show that sediment with a higher mobile P content could release more soluble P under suitable conditions, thereby increasing the chlorophyll a (Chla) concentration. The growth of overwinter algae appeared to be more correlated with porewater P concentrations and the ratios of nitrogen to phosphorus than with the solid-phase mobile P fractions, as indicated by the Pearson correlation analysis. This study strengthens our understanding of the relationship between the availability of sediment P and algal recruitment from sediments.

The spring biomass of herbivorous cladocerans and cyclopoid copepods differs between years, associated with an "early" or "late" onset of stratification and algal development. The increased biomass of herbivorous cladocerans, usually recorded in May, is most probably caused by the direct effect of temperature on cladoceran growth, rather than its indirect effect on food supply or predation intensity. Multivariate regression analysis suggests that a reduction in nutrient loading by a factor of three did not affect the temporal course of zooplankton spring development.

The function, which is based on the Johnson S(U) probability distribution, successfully reproduces the major features of the observed annual surface temperature cycle including gradual warming from winter minimum to the onset of spring stratification, rapid warming to mid-summer peak, and slow cooling to winter minimum. Best fit parameters describing the observed average annual temperature cycles vary in a reasonable way with latitude and water depth. Although year-to-year variations in the temperature cycles can be large, the root-mean-squared differences between the fitted functions and the averaged buoy observations are on the order of a few tenths of a degree C. While no trend in lake surface temperatures is evident over the past 10 years, the effects of climatologically abnormal years can be seen in the observed data. The functional representations of lake surface temperature will be useful for computer simulations of bio-geochemical processes in the Great Lakes and for evaluations of climatological departures from typical conditions.

The effect of selected physical and chemical water parameters on ciliates community was also analysed. Psammon samples were collected during three seasons: spring, summer and autumn of 2010. In each lake, in the psammolittoral, samples were collected in the euarenal, higroarenal, and hydroarenal zones. A total of 53 ciliate taxa were recorded. The highest value of the Shannon-Weaver index was recorded in summer in eutrophic lake (2.79). At the same time in mesotrophic lake, a lower value of the index was determined (0.79). The mean numbers of ciliates ranged from 516 ind.cm(-3) in the eutrophic lake to 191 ind. cm(-3) in the mesotrophic lake. In eutrophic lake, the highest number of ciliates was recorded in the euarenal (649 ind. cm-3), and the lowest in the higroarenal (425 ind. cm-3). In the mesotrophic lake, the highest average numbers were determined in the higroarenal (235 ind. cm-3), and the lowest in the hydroarenal (155 ind. cm(-3)). Irrespective of the lake trophy, Hymenostomata (Paramecium sp., Glaucoma sp., Uronema nigricans) occurred in the highest numbers (from 13 to 95%). The results demonstrated that N-NH4, P-PO4 and TOC can strongly regulate the abundance and taxonomic composition of ciliates. The strongest correlations between numbers of ciliates and physical and chemical water parameters were observed in the higro- and hydroarenal zones of the eutrophic lake.

J	ARGYLE, RL				ARGYLE, RL			ALEWIVES AND RAINBOW SMELT IN LAKE HURON - MIDWATER AND BOTTOM AGGREGATIONS AND ESTIMATES OF STANDING STOCKS	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The continued availability of adequate amounts of forage fish, primarily alewives A. pseudoharengus and rainbow smelt O. mordax, is critical to the success of ongoing programs aimed at rebuilding lake trout Salvelinus namaycush populations and maintaining other salmonid stocks in Lake Huron. These forage species are distributed at middepths as well as on or near the bottom. Acoustic methods were integrated with midwater and bottom trawling to characterize the population and estimate the biomass of the forage stocks. The average sizes of alewives and rainbow smelt caught at middepths were smaller than those caught in bottom trawls; most size ranges in the bottom trawl catches were also present in the midwater catches. Subadult and adult fish (both species) were rarely caught concurrently in midwater and when they were caught together the fish were invariably large subadults and small adults. Biomass estimates for the pelagic component were determined from trawl catches and echogram counts. The regression of echogram counts (X) on trawl catches (Y) was Y = -2.69 + 0.983X (r2 = 0.766) at the fish densities investigated. The pelagic biomasses of alewives and rainbow smelt in USA waters of Lake Huron were estimated at 17,200 tons in July, 1974, 22,000 tons in July, 1975 and 19,000 tons in Aug., 1976. Biomass estimates of the stocks in midwater were usually larger in spring than in fall, probably due to seasonal differences in distribution rather than in abundance. Estimates for the demersal component of the combined alewife-rainbow smelt forage stock, calculated from stratified random sampling of the spring bottom trawl catches for 1973 through 1980 went from 35,000 tons in 1973, to a high of 83,000 tons in 1975 and to 72,000 tons in 1980; the estimates in fall went from 31,000 tons in 1973, to a high of 56,000 tons in 1977 and to 43,000 tons in 1980. Biomass estimates calculated from spring catch data were usually larger than those calculated from fall data. Estimates of the midwater stocks, coinciding with the spring and fall bottom trawl surveys indicated that between 20 and 30% of the total biomass was in midwater.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1982	111	3					267	285		10.1577/1548-8659(1982)111<267:AARSIL>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1982)111<267:AARSIL>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1982NW04000002
J	Wang, CY; Yang, YY; Yang, B; Lin, H; Miller, TR; Newton, RJ; Guo, LD				Wang, Changyou; Yang, Yangyang; Yang, Bin; Lin, Hui; Miller, Todd R.; Newton, Ryan J.; Guo, Laodong			Causal relationship between alkaline phosphatase activities and phosphorus dynamics in a eutrophic coastal lagoon in Lake Michigan	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Alkaline phosphatase plays an important role in regulating nutrient dynamics and algal blooms in aquatic environments, but the causal relationship between alkaline phosphatase (AP), nutrient status, and chemical speciation of phosphorus (P) in the water column remains elusive. A year-long time series (weekly to biweekly) sampling was conducted to investigate the causality between alkaline phosphatase dynamics, transformation of P species, and phytoplankton biomass in Veterans Park Lagoon, a closed lagoon with intense seasonal cyanobacterial blooms. As water temperature increased from spring to summer, depletion of dissolved inorganic P (DIP) drove increases in cell-associated AP (APcell, in nmol L-1). The elevated cell-associated alkaline phosphatase activities (APAcell, in nmol L-1 h(-1)) resulted in the transformation of particulate organic P (POP) into DIP, which enhanced the algal blooms. Not driven by DIP depletion, dissolved AP (APdiss) was spontaneously released during cyanobacterial blooms and the elevated dissolved APA (APAdiss) resulted in increase of DIP during the growing stage. This explains the concurrent high potential APA and high DIP concentrations in the water column observed here and other previous studies. The low-molecular-weight dissolved organic P (LMW-DOP) was found to be independent of both APAcell and APAdiss, consistent with previous results derived from isotope tracers. During the transition stage between fall and winter with lower water temperatures, APAdissincreased as a result of DIP depletion, while DOP was depleted and APAcell increased, and vice versa. The increase in bot(h) APAcell and APAdiss further resulted in the increase in concentration of particulate inorganic P through promoting the release of DIP from carbon-phosphate bonds and the adsorption of DIP onto particle surfaces especially under lower water temperature. Our results provide improved understanding of the concurrently high APA and DIP in the water column and provide new insights into the causal relationship between AP and P species in aquatic environments.

J	Németh, K; Martin, U; Harangi, S				Németh, K; Martin, U; Harangi, S			Miocene phreatomagmatic volcanism at Tihany (Pannonian Basin, Hungary)	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												A late Miocene (7.56 Ma) maar volcanic complex (Tihany Maar Volcanic Complex - TMVC) is preserved in the Pannonian Basin and is part of the Bakony-Balaton Highland Volcanic Field. Base surge and fallout deposits were formed around maars by phreatomagmatic explosions, caused by interactions between water-saturated sediments and alkali basalt magma carrying peridotite Iherzolite xenoliths as well as pyroxene and olivine megacrysts. Subsequently, nested maars functioned as a sediment trap where deposition built up Gilbert-type delta sequences. At the onset of eruption, magma began to interact with a moderate amount of groundwater in the water-saturated sand. As eruption continued phreatomagmatic blasts excavated downward into limestones, providing access to abundant karst water and deeper to sandstones and schist both providing large amount of fracture-filling water, At the surface, this 'wet' eruption led to the emplacement of massive tuff breccias by fall, surge, mudflow and gravity flow deposition. The nature of the TMVC maar eruptions and their deposits appears to depend on the hydrological condition of the karst and/or fracture-filling aquifer, which varies seasonally with rainfall and spring runoff. The West and East Maar volcanoes of TMVC are interpreted to represent low water input from the karst and/or fracture-filling aquifer ('summer vent'), whereas the East Maar is interpreted to have formed when abundant karst and/or fracture-filling water was available ('spring vent').

J	Smith, K; Norriss, J; Brown, J				Smith, Kimberley; Norriss, Jeff; Brown, Joshua			Population growth and mass mortality of an estuarine fish, Acanthopagrus butcheri, unlawfully introduced into an inland lake	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												1. In 2006, two periods of hypoxia resulted in the death of approximately 35 tonnes of black bream (Acanthopagrus butcheri) in Lake Indoon, a small inland lake in Western Australia. 2. Acanthopagrus butcheri was the first fish species to be recorded in this lake, along with the mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) which was also observed during sampling in 2006. Acanthopagrus butcheri appears to have been introduced to Lake Indoon between 1998 and 2003 and formed a self-sustaining population. It is believed to have been deliberately introduced for the purpose of creating a recreational fishery, despite the existence of substantial penalties for illegal translocation of fish in Western Australia. 3. Recent human-induced environmental changes, including rising groundwater and salinization, have probably aided the establishment of both species in Lake Indoon. The importance of salinity to recruitment success by A. butcheri was indicated by the presence of only two age classes in 2006, with estimated recruitment dates coinciding with the years of highest recorded salinity in the lake. 4. The 'fish kills' provided an opportunity to examine aspects of A. butcheri biology in a relatively low salinity environment which is atypical for this estuarine species. In particular, the recruitment period in Lake Indoon was delayed until autumn/winter, rather than spring/summer as seen in other populations. Biological responses in Lake Indoon have implications for natural populations living in estuarites with modified salinity regimes. 5. The ecological, social and economic impacts potentially arising from the introduction of fish to Lake Indoon, which is an important migratory bird habitat and a recreational amenity for local residents and tourists, illustrate the complexities of fish translocation and the need for rigorous assessment before stocking to identify potential costs and benefits.

J	Cheddadi, R; Khater, C				Cheddadi, R.; Khater, C.			Climate change since the last glacial period in Lebanon and the persistence of Mediterranean species	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												In this study, we quantified the mean January temperature (Tjan) and both winter (Pw) and summer (Ps) precipitation from three fossil pollen records from Lebanon. Tjan showed a strong correlation with the global temperature changes retrieved in the NGRIP Greenland ice core. The amplitude of ca. 8 degrees C between the Younger Dryas (YD) period and the Holocene is coherent with climate reconstructions from the Eastern Mediterranean. The overall amount of precipitation was also lower during the YD than during the Holocene but the contrast between Pw and Ps was much more reduced (less than 2 times) during the YD than during the Holocene (up to 8 times). Such different seasonal contrast compare to the present day is coherent with some climate proxies from the Levant that tend to indicate the presence of moisture during the last glacial period. In effect, the low Pw during the YD reflects the replacement of the forest ecosystem by a more shrubby or herbaceous vegetation. Concomitantly, the occurrence of an amount of precipitation higher than the current one during the summer season, along with a reduced evaporation, due to lower temperature, may have contributed to some local observed high lake levels in the area. During the last glacial period, Lebanon was not under a typical Mediterranean climate such as the one we know today, i.e. with a strong precipitation and temperature contrast between summer and winter seasons, but rather under a less contrasted climate. Mediterranean species persisted in this area due to the low amplitude of temperature change between the last glacial period and the Holocene as well as to an availability of moisture throughout the year instead of an occurrence mainly during the winter season as is the case today.

Part I. Sediments	JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY												Sediment cores were collected at an upstream site (Jintang) and a downstream site (Neijiang) in summer and winter in the Tuohe River, which is one of the five largest tributaries of the Changjiang (Yangtze) River in China. A sequential leaching procedure was applied to determine the concentrations of the different forms of solid phosphorus, including exchangeable phosphorus (Exc-P) as well as phosphorus associated with iron oxides (Fe-P), with aluminum oxides (Al-P), with apatite (Ca-P) and with the residual fraction (Res-P), as correlated with water content and total organic carbon. The seasonal variations and the vertical distributions of phosphorus species in sediments at both sampling sites demonstrated that: 1) total phosphorus (TP) in summer and winter were ranged between 1 313-2 330, 1 491-2 228 mg/kg in Jintang and 543-2 128, 603-1 175 mg/kg in Neijiang, respectively. It can predicated the pollution of TP in Jintang is serious than that in Neijiang both in summer and winter; 2) total inorganic phosphorus (TIP) was the dominant form of TP; 3) Ca-P was the main chemical forms of TIP in the sediments. Based on the profiles in sediments and bio-available phosphorus data, it revealed that bio-available phosphorus (BAP) represented only a minor portion (0.61%-3.59%) of TP, and the vertical distribution of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) in corresponding porewaters was more abundant in the upper layer of the sediment, which suggests that BAP may be converted to non-bioavailable phosphorus in deeper layer of the sediment of this dynamic system.					陈, 雨薇/HKF-1175-2023; Belzile, Nelson/J-4607-2019; xiaoping, yu/IAN-1982-2023; Deng, Tianlong/AAJ-1587-2020	Deng, Tianlong/0000-0002-1728-2943; GUO, Yafei/0000-0003-0698-3565; 													2096-5508					NOV	2018	36	6			SI		1950	1961		10.1007/s00343-018-7315-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-018-7315-2													WOS:000454629000006

Some Pintails tagged in the MRGV continued movements into Mexico. Poor winter survival or PTT failure reduced sample size to 15 for PLR Pintails, 5 for Gulf Coast Pintails, and I I for MRGV Pintails. Apparent winter survival was 66% lower for Texas Gulf Coast PTT-tagged Pintails than for those from the PLR and MRGV. Pintails from each area used different routes to their respective breeding grounds. PTT-tagged Pintails from the MRGV followed the Rio Grande Valley north to southern Colorado, before traveling on to the Dakotas and Canada or traveled northeast and joined the migration of PLR Pintails in Texas or Kansas. The latter made initial stops in Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, or the Dakotas. Gulf Coast Pintails traveled through north-central Oklahoma or central Kansas. Pintails that had stopped first in Kansas or Nebraska tended to settle to nest in the United States. Wetland availability in the Prairie Pothole Region of the Northern Great Plains influenced nesting destinations of PTT-tagged Pintails, but individuals settled across a wide swath of northern North America. We did not detect any consistently-used spring staging areas. Therefore, negative impacts to any. of the marked populations, or their wetland habitats, may have continental implications.						casazza, Mike/0000-0002-5636-735X													1524-4695					JUN	2006	29	2					127	136		10.1675/1524-4695(2006)29[127:SMONPF]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/1524-4695(2006)29[127:SMONPF]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000238788400001
J	Roos, JC; Pieterse, AJH				Roos, JC; Pieterse, AJH			Seasonal variation of phytoplankton biomass in the Middle Vaal River, South Africa	WATER SA												The chlorophyll-a concentration in the Vaal River (at Balkfontein; 1985 to 1989) was high (av. = 67 mu g . l(-1)) and displayed great variation (8 to 360 mu g . l(-1)). An increasing concentration trend of 20 mu g . l(-1) a(-1) was shown. The hydrology, particularly episodic floods through inputs from summer rain, plays an important role not only in the chemistry, but also in the biology of the Vaal River. The chl-a concentration was usually the lowest after the summer rain period. It stayed low for about two months and was then followed by a maximum concentration (bloom) in late winter to spring. The early bloom was dominated by diatoms, followed by a bloom usually dominated by green algae. The bloom was followed subsequently by a population crash. The enrichment of the river during floods by nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), usually leads to large phytoplankton blooms that occur approximately two to four months after floods. The average chl-a concentration in the Vaal River was statistically significant, correlated with the average total phosphorus (TP) concentration. Approximntely 1 mg . l(-1) increase in the average TP concentration will probably be associated by about 225 mu g . l(-1) increase in the average chl-a concentration. This aspect could make it fairly simple to predict and possibly control the standing crop in the Vaal River.																			0378-4738					JAN	1996	22	1					33	42																WOS:A1996TV58300005

Influences of these two factors on phytoplankton are still poorly understood. Here, the relative effects of spatio-temporal variations on the structuring and community of phytoplankton were examined in eight sites along Ismailia canal during wet winter and dry summer seasons, 2018. A total of 58 taxa were identified, belonging to five taxonomical groups, phytoplankton had an abundance ranging from 56,906 ind. L-1 in winter to 122,418 ind. L-1 in summer. Bacillariophyta was the leading and most dominant phyla representing about 45% of the total number of individuals owing to the great flourishing of Synedra ulna, Cyclotella kutzingiana, Cyclotella meneghiniana throughout the year. Spatially, sites 1, 2 and 7 showed the highest phytoplankton abundance, whereas site 6 showed the lowest community. Pearson correlation and Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that nitrate had a positive correlation with the phytoplankton community, however TDS showed a negative correlation with the algal community and silicate showed a positive correlation with Bacillariophyta. High relative Palmer's Index scores were recorded in most of the sampling sites ranged from 13 to 21 particularly during summer, that coincides with Shannon-Weiner index results which indicating Ismailia canal suffers from organic pollution in most of the sampling sites.					; Qi, Xianghui/M-5188-2019; salem, zenhom/AFS-7393-2022; Attiah, Abdullah/S-4840-2018; Elshobary, Mostafa/AAW-2427-2020; essa, dorya/MIT-0923-2025	Elshobary, Mostafa/0000-0002-2131-0679; salem, zenhom/0000-0002-1749-5359; Qi, Xianghui/0000-0002-5817-1609; Attiah, Abdullah/0000-0003-1892-4829; 													1436-3240	1436-3259				JUL	2020	34	7					1089	1103		10.1007/s00477-020-01809-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-020-01809-w		MAY 2020											WOS:000530780300002
J	Koue, J				Koue, Jinichi			Assessing the impact of climate change on dissolved oxygen using a flow field ecosystem model that takes into account the anaerobic and aerobic environment of bottom sediments	ACTA GEOCHIMICA												This study examines the potential impacts of climate change on Lake Biwa, Japan's largest freshwater lake, with a focus on temperature, wind speed, and precipitation variations. Leveraging data from the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, including CCP scenarios, projecting a significant temperature rise of 3.3-5.7 degrees C in the case of very high GHG emission power, the research investigates how these shifts may influence dissolved oxygen levels in Lake Biwa. Through a one-dimensional model incorporating sediment redox reactions, various scenarios where air temperature and wind speed are changed are simulated. It is revealed that a 5 degrees C increase in air temperature leads to decreasing 1-2 mg/L of dissolved oxygen concentrations from the surface layer to the bottom layer, while a decrease in air temperature tends to elevate 1-3 mg/L of oxygen levels. Moreover, doubling wind speed enhances surface layer oxygen but diminishes it in deeper layers due to increased mixing. Seasonal variations in wind effects are noted, with significant surface layer oxygen increases from 0.4 to 0.8 mg/L during summer to autumn, increases from 0.4 to 0.8 mg/L in autumn to winter due to intensified vertical mixing. This phenomenon impacts the lake's oxygen cycle year-round. In contrast, precipitation changes show limited impact on oxygen levels, suggesting minor influence compared to other meteorological factors. The study suggests the necessity of comprehensive three-dimensional models that account for lake-specific and geographical factors for accurate predictions of future water conditions. A holistic approach integrating nutrient levels, water temperature, and river inflow is deemed essential for sustainable management of Lake Biwa's water resources, particularly in addressing precipitation variations.

We estimated the respiration rate in nine shallow, eutrophic lakes (macrophyte-dominated and phytoplankton-dominated) from north-eastern Poland. Respiratory carbon loss (RCL) through bottom microbial communities, macrophytes, plankton and macrozoobenthos was estimated by measuring the Electron Transport System activity. The shares of the particular ecosystem components in respiration processes differed among the lake types and seasons. The bottom microbial communities contributed most to the RCL (from 50% in the macrophyte-dominated lakes to 90% in the shallower phytoplankton-dominated lakes) except in macrophytes-dominated lakes in summer, where the macrophyte contribution prevailed (80%). The contribution of plankton was considerable only in the deeper phytoplankton-dominated lakes (20%). Macrozoobenthos was important (20%) only in the macrophyte-dominated lakes in spring and autumn. The RCL through bottom microbial communities was substantially higher in the shallow lakes (especially phytoplankton-dominated) than in deep, stratified eutrophic lakes. Shallow eutrophic lakes can be highly productive due to intensive organic matter mineralization at the bottom and rapid flow and cycling of carbon and nutrients resulting from their polymictic character.					; Poznańska, Małgorzata/H-6261-2014; Żbikowski, Janusz/F-2498-2016; Kobak, Jaroslaw/F-2796-2013; Zbikowski, Janusz/F-2498-2016	Simcic, Tatjana/0000-0001-6540-926X; Poznanska-Kakareko, Malgorzata/0000-0001-7224-3093; Kobak, Jaroslaw/0000-0001-7660-9240; Zbikowski, Janusz/0000-0002-1190-9821													0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2019	828	1					117	136		10.1007/s10750-018-3807-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-018-3807-5													WOS:000452863700009

Our data reveal a non-uniform pattern of late-summer ice speedup that, in places, extends over 100 km inland. We show that the degree of late-summer speedup is positively correlated with modelled runoff within the 10 glacier catchments of our survey, and that the pattern of late-summer speedup follows that of water routed at the ice sheet surface. In late-summer, ice within the largest catchment flows on average 48% faster than during winter, whereas changes in smaller catchments are less pronounced. Our observations show that the routing of seasonal runoff at the ice sheet surface plays an important role in shaping the magnitude and extent of seasonal ice sheet speedup. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

To determine if the variability in basin morphometry can be the primary factor causing interbasin differences, we examined the thermal structure of Trout Lake, Wisconsin, during summer and winter stratification and quantitatively explained the observed differences in temperature among basins. Differences in hypolimnetic temperature during summer stratification and differences in the temperature of the entire water column in the winter were primarily due to the morphometric differences among basins. During winter, variations in the temperature among basins were also influenced by interbasin exchange and differences in groundwater inputs. Therefore, this multibasin lake can provide the opportunity to test for morphometric affects without the confounding inter-lake dissimilarities encountered when examining different lakes.

This study aimed to analyze the relationship between the vegetation cover in the Mockes dam area, and the area covered by surface water in the summer and winter seasons over a 3 year period (2017-2019). The Mockes dam is located along the middle of the Modder River catchment. The methodology involves the analysis of satellite images of the Mockes dam area obtained on the Earth Observation Satellite (EOS). The results from the study show that the surface area covered by water around the Mockes dam increased in the winter season whilst the vegetation cover in the winter season was extremely sparse. On the other hand, the water surface area in the Mockes dam area was very low in summer with moderate vegetation. It is important for environmentalists and water managers to critically monitor the variations and trends that the climate has on vegetation in relation to important water sources such as dams, lakes and rivers.

Increased sediment-water interface bacterial [3H]-L-serine uptake and biomass production in a eutrophic reservoir during summer stratification	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Bacterial consortia at sediment-water interfaces (SWIs) conduct metabolic processes that affect lake and reservoir organic matter cycling and nutrient composition. Seasonal reservoir dynamics such as stratification and overturn influence SWI bacterial activity and bacterial biomass production. We measured SWI bacterial uptake rates of tritium-labeled L-serine (Ser) to assess SWI bacterial activity and production in a monomictic, eutrophic reservoir. Total microbial Ser uptake (Ser(tot)) and uptake in the protein fraction (Ser(pro)) were measured seasonally. Ser(pro) was approximately 40 percent of Ser(tot) which demonstrated that Ser was incorporated into cellular material other than protein. Highest bacterial Sertot and Ser(pro) occurred during the onset of summer stratification (Jun 2005) followed by late-season stratification (Oct 2005). Lower Ser(tot) and Ser(pro), were observed after the onset of autumnal overturn (Oct 2004) and during winter mixing (Feb 2005). Higher SWI temperature, lower dissolved oxygen, and decreasing redox potential, which are a function of summer stratification, were associated with higher Ser(tot) and Ser(pro). Estimates of SWI bacterial production and growth rates indicated that highest production and fastest community generation times also occurred at onset of summer stratification and during late-season stratification. These data suggest summer stratification, and not autumnal overturn and winter mixing, is responsible for higher SWI bacterial metabolism, even under anoxic conditions during which bacteria utilize less energetically favored electron acceptors. We conclude that stratification is an important event that increases SWI bacterial metabolism, which results in increased carbon mineralization and nutrient cycling from sediments to the water column that affects water quality and reservoir trophic status.

J	Milburn, D; Prowse, TD				Milburn, D; Prowse, TD			Sediment bound contaminants in a remote northern Delta	NORDIC HYDROLOGY												Deltas of major rivers are among the most productive and environmentally sensitive components of riverine systems in cold regions, and are of great hydrological and ecological importance. Much of their productivity stems from the supply of nutrient-rich sediments that rejuvenate in-channel, perched and riparian habitats. Such sediments, however, can also be a source of organic contaminants, and deltas, because of their natural tendency to accumulate sediments, may become retention zones or sinks of these. The objective of this research was to determine the nature of sediment-related organic contaminant deposition in the Slave River Delta, Canada - a remote area that is now experiencing the effects of rapid upstream development. A special focus was placed on the protracted low-flow period that characterizes the winter period during which there should be a significant deposition of fine-grained sediment - size fractions with an affinity to adsorb organic contaminants. Results of an exploratory field program conducted during the 1997 pre-breakup and pre-freeze-up periods support the concept that the under-ice period is a time of significant fine-grained sediment deposition. Moreover, the contaminant load was found to be higher at the end of the winter flow recession rather than in late autumn following the major summer flow events. Comparisons of the observed contaminant levels measured in the delta are also made with those recorded by others in the upstream river that feeds the Slave Delta and in Great Slave Lake downstream of the delta.																			0029-1277						1998	29	4-5					397	414																WOS:000078138800011

Occupies an ideal position to investigate the seasonal hydroclimatic variations and related surface processes during the Holocene. We re-investigated the lake and analysed a new sediment core from the deepest part of the lake. Grain size measurements and related endmember modelling analyses (EMMA) in combination with ostracod associations together with geochemical parameters and mineral compo-sitions from core sediments were used as relevant proxies for hydro-climatic reconstruction.A compar-ison of 818O/8D from various waters on the NETP indicates a clear depleted isotopic signature of non -monsoon moisture supply in comparison to summer rainfalls, highlighting the summer evaporation for 818O enrichment, as a reference for interpreting 818O values from lake sediments for various situa-tions of hydrological balance. Based on the individual core chronology the multi-proxy data indicate a very low sedimentation rate over the entire period in accordance with the catchment topography and the absence of well-developed and constant river systems, limiting the flux of sediment supply to the lake. Thus, Koucha Lake remains almost a closed system since the Lateglacial, except for the early mid -Holocene part of the sequence. The coarser particle components and their representative endmembers for spring flood and permafrost thaw between 11.9 and 10.1 cal Ka BP and from 4.5 to ca. 1.0 cal Ka BP point to lower lake levels, influenced by long winter duration with dry summer interruptions, and lighter oxygen isotopes were preserved at low evaporations. Fine-grained sediments supplied by permafrost thaw associated with activating summer surface erosion led to lake level rise between 10.1 and 4.5 cal Ka BP and during the last 1000 years, with a maximum during 7.6-7.1 cal Ka BP. Their enriched 818O values indicate extended summer duration and concomitant evaporation enhancement, albeit a positive hy-drological balance. We suggest that the interannual latitudinal shifts of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and westerly Jet and attendant varying monsoon rain belt locations are responsible tracers for the variation of the hydrological budget of the lake and the variable spatio-temporal precipitation patterns in humid and (semi) arid regions in China.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Beniston, M; Stoffel, M; Hill, M				Beniston, Martin; Stoffel, Markus; Hill, Margot			Impacts of climatic change on water and natural hazards in the Alps: Can current water governance cope with future challenges? Examples from the European "ACQWA" project	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY												This paper reviews the possible future situation of the Rhone River in the Swiss part of its catchment. Physical processes in the Alps govern the behaviour of the Rhone from its source (Rhone Glacier) to the Lake of Geneva, and substantial changes are expected to occur in the amount and seasonality of precipitation, and in the response of snow and glaciers to a warming climate. As a result, discharge in the alpine part of the Rhone River is likely to undergo an increase in winter and early spring, but strongly decreases from late spring to late autumn. These changes in water regimes will certainly be accompanied by more frequent geomorphic hazards, related to increases in heavy precipitation events and the melting of permanently frozen grounds. The direct and indirect impacts of a warming climate will affect key economic sectors such as tourism, hydropower, and agriculture, while shifts in extreme events will have an impact on the vulnerability of infrastructure and a range of economic sectors and services. Projections of the future course of events can help in advance planning and decision making in order to alleviate some of the more negative consequences of climate and hydrological impacts on key economic sectors in the region. This paper will thus discuss issues related to current and future water governance in the region, whether water-related policies are sufficiently robust today to cope with what may be rapid changes in water availability and water use in coming decades, and to resolve possible rivalries between economic sectors that may be increasingly confronted with problems of water availability at critical times of the year.

J	Tsai, HP; Southworth, J; Waylen, P				Tsai, HuiPing; Southworth, Jane; Waylen, Peter			Spatial persistence and temporal patterns in vegetation cover across Florida, 1982-2006	PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												The study analyzes the spatial persistence and temporal patterns in vegetation cover across Florida by utilizing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series data derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer from 1982 to 2006. Specifically, mean-variance analysis and persistence metrics are used to discern the significance of vegetation patterns, the significance of land cover and land-use change, and the relevance of climate variability across time and space. Results demonstrate a consistent, increasing pattern in the mean NDVI and its variance, especially during the late fall and winter season. A possible explanation of this increasing pattern is based on the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, which switched from cold to warm phase after 1995 and is associated with increased winter precipitation. Additionally, the impacts of the El Nino Southern Oscillation can be detected through the decreased spatial variances of NDVI in warm-phase events, compared to cold-phase events, and the more pronounced nature of the pattern in fall/winter. This study proposes a novel set of techniques applied to satellite-derived vegetation data, which effectively discerns fine, statewide vegetation dynamics at appropriate spatial and temporal scales.					; Tsai, HuiPing/AAC-2802-2022	Southworth, Jane/0000-0002-7246-7879; TSAI, HUI PING/0000-0002-4915-1075; 													0272-3646	1930-0557				MAR 4	2014	35	2			SI		151	180		10.1080/02723646.2014.898126	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02723646.2014.898126													WOS:000333878300006
J	DICKMAN, M; DORAIS, M				DICKMAN, M; DORAIS, M			IMPACT OF HUMAN TRAMPLING ON PHOSPHORUS LOADING TO A SMALL LAKE IN GATINEAU PARK, QUEBEC, CANADA	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												A 10-fold increase in the annual number of visitors to Pinks Lake, Quebec, has occurred over the last 2 decades and the subsequent increase in trampling within its steep-sided basin has resulted in a significant reduction in plant cover. This plant cover destruction has aggravated the erosion problem in the lake''s basin, resulting in abnormally high P loading to the lake (854 mg/m2 of lake suface). Thirty-eight samples of recently eroded material taken from randomized sites along the lake shore contained 16.1 g leachable P/m2. The majority of the P was present as either Ca10F2(PO4)6 or Ca10(OH)2(PO4)6 apatite. Secchi transparency in Pinks Lake decreased from an estimated 5.8 m in 1956 to 3.6 m in 1976. During the same period, visitor density at Pinks Lake increased by an order of magnitude from roughly 400 visitors/yr in 1956 to over 4000/yr in 1976. Changes in summer phytoplankton species composition have also occurred. At present, diatoms and small phyto-flagellates dominate in spring, while blue-green algae and dinoflagellates become abundant in fall. Average summer chloropyll a was 3.9 mg/l for the last 4 yr while total dissolved P concentrations average 25 mg/m3 in the surface waters of the lake under homeothermal conditions in early spring. A P loading of 854 mg/m2 of lake surface places Pinks Lake among the more eutrophic lakes of North America. This is unusual as the lake receives no municipal, agricultural or rural effluent discharge due to its location in a semi-wilderness area within Canada''s National Capital Region. The impact of human trampling is of overriding significance to the management of this sensitive area.																			0301-4797	1095-8630					1977	5	4					335	+																WOS:A1977EC51600003
J	STEVENS, RJJ; NEILSON, MA				STEVENS, RJJ; NEILSON, MA			RESPONSE OF LAKE-ONTARIO TO REDUCTIONS IN PHOSPHORUS LOAD, 1967-82	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Total phosphorus (TP) loading to Lake Ontario has declined from 14 600 t .cntdot. yr-1 in 1969 to 8900 t .cntdot. yr-1 in 1982. Midlake spring TP has responded rapidly to these reductions, decreasing at the rate of 1.09 .mu.g .cntdot. L-1 .cntdot. yr-1 from a maximum of 30.6 .mu.g .cntdot. L-1 in 1973 to 12.8 .mu.g .cntdot. L-1 in 1982. Spring soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) exhibited a proportionally larger decrease than TP such that 1982 SRP was 33% of 1973 levels, compared with 42% for TP. A multiple regression equation indicated an 80% response time of spring TP within 2 yr and a 90% response time within 4 yr. Spring nitrate plus nitrite has increased since 1969 at the rate of 9.5 .mu.g .cntdot. L-1 .cntdot. yr-1 causing N:P ratios to increase from 10 to 32. Mean summer epilimnetic TP declined at the rate of only 0.3 .mu.g .cntdot. L-1 .cntdot. yr-1 from 1977 to 1982 so that mean summer TP levels now exceed spring TP by 1-2 .mu.g .cntdot. L-1. This suggests that loading to the lake during the stratified period has not shown a similar decline and may be responsible for the lack of a trend in algal biomass indicators during this period.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				DEC	1987	44	12					2059	2068		10.1139/f87-255	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f87-255													WOS:A1987M856600003
J	Woo, MK; Thorne, R				Woo, Ming-Ko; Thorne, Robin			Winter Flows in the Mackenzie Drainage System	ARCTIC												Winter low flow of northern rivers refers to the diminished discharge between the time of rapid flow reduction in the freeze-up period and the arrival of spring freshet, when the flow makes a quick rise. For the Mackenzie River in Canada, the duration of the winter low-flow season so defined varies considerably within the river's large basin (1.8 million km(2)); therefore, to give a common time frame that enables between-basin comparison we consider 1 November to 31 March as the winter flow season. Several hydroclimatic conditions influence winter flows to varying degrees. Lengthy periods of sub-freezing temperatures inhibit rain events and prevent snowmelt, while the formation of river ice increases channel storage at the expense of discharge. Groundwater sustains baseflow, and the flow amount at most stations is related to autumnal discharge, which reflects groundwater storage status in the pre-winter season. Large reservoirs and lakes provide substantially higher winter flows than their neighboring non-lake areas. Winter flow increases downstream as more water is gathered from the expanded drainage network, but flow contribution varies: larger baseflow is delivered from uplands than from lowlands, and discharge from the Williston Lake reservoir, regulated for hydropower production, provides about half of the total winter flow of the Mackenzie. Monotonic linear trends in winter flow are detected statistically for some tributaries, but the effect of short-term flow variability and the confounding influence of managed flow should be evaluated when considering long-term tendencies and their causative factors.																			0004-0843	1923-1245				JUN	2014	67	2					238	256		10.14430/arctic4384	http://dx.doi.org/10.14430/arctic4384													WOS:000338269600011

Based on measurements at 46 sampling points in the study's coastal area in May, August, and October 2011, the seasonal and spatial characteristics of the chemical indicators and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) were analyzed. The chemical indicators for pH, chemical oxygen demand (COD), and reactive silicate (SiO3-Si) showed higher concentrations in the summer than in the spring and fall, whereas the nutrients of reactive phosphate (PO4-P) and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) presented complex seasonal characteristics under the combined influence of abundant nutrients from rivers and nutrient consumption by large algal bloom in August. Subsequently, two methods a fuzzy, integrated assessment and an organic pollution index were used to characterize the organic pollution. The trophic status of most coastal waters were oligotrophic and mesotrophic, and most coastal waters were clean in spring and summer, except in the vicinity of the harbor and estuaries, where the organic pollution index was generally high. Finally, Pearson correlation coefficients of various variables were analyzed, which demonstrated that, commonly, there was a significant positive correlation between COD and Chl-a. Because algal blooms in August changed the nutrients structure of the coastal waters, Chl-a, in a remarkably high concentration, had significant correlation with NO2-N, the atomic N/P ratio, and the atomic N/Si ratio. The algal bloom aggravated the current P limitation, and the atomic N/P ratio, the PO4-P concentration, and the COD can be selected as the three most-sensitive indicators of algal bloom in Qinhuangdao coastal water. These findings have provided scientific supports for local authorities who are taking measures to control pollution emissions and to prevent the recurrence of algal blooms.					; Zhang, Yongfeng/HMW-1599-2023	Kolditz, Olaf/0000-0002-8098-4905; 													0749-0208	1551-5036				MAR	2017	33	2					396	407		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-16-00023.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-16-00023.1													WOS:000397355700015

J	Jude, DJ; Wang, Y; Hensler, SR; Janssen, J				Jude, David J.; Wang, Yu; Hensler, Stephen R.; Janssen, John			Burbot Early Life History Strategies in the Great Lakes	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Burbot Lota lota exhibit four previously known reproductive strategies in the Great Lakes region. In this paper we review those strategies and provide evidence for a fifth onedelayed deepwater spawning. The four known, shallow-water strategies are as follows: (1) spawning by self-sustaining, landlocked populations, (2) spawning in tributaries in winter and the exit of larvae to a Great Lake, (3) spawning by residents in a spawning stream with access to a Great Lake, and (4) spawning on unconsolidated and rocky areas in shallow water in winter in the lake proper. Resident, landlocked populations exist in some Michigan and Wisconsin rivers (e.g., the Muskegon River in Michigan). The evidence for winter tributary spawning is the appearance of newly hatched Burbot in the St. Marys and Bark rivers during April-June. Evidence for Burbot juveniles leaving spawning streams is U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service tributory mouth trap data. The evidence for winter nearshore spawning comes from power plant monthly entrainment studies (Mansfield etal. 1983). Our proposed fifth strategy is spring and summer spawning at deep reefs, where there is probably cobble or boulder habitat. Our evidence comes from midlake reefs in Lake Michigan and offshore areas of Lake Huron: (1) we collected adult Burbot at midlake reefs in Lake Michigan, (2) we collected many Burbot larvae (many of which were newly hatched) from Lakes Michigan and Huron in June-August, and (3) we collected a Burbot egg in a PONAR grab in mid-July from 73m in southern Lake Huron. An important question remains, namely, which life history strategy provides the highest recruitment success for this species. It may be that adaptability ensures the survival of this important, top-predator fish during periods of crisis (e.g., encounters with dams, Sea Lamprey Petromyzon marinus predation).																			0002-8487	1548-8659				NOV 1	2013	142	6					1733	1745		10.1080/00028487.2013.795192	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2013.795192													WOS:000327469700024

Catches of each species varied substantially from year to year at each location. Strong year classes of walleye and sauger were produced at both locations in 1991 and 1994, and weak year classes were produced in 1990. In other years, relative year-class strengths were only partially concordant between species and locations. Overall, growth of YOY walleye and YOY sauger was fast at both locations, and varied less than abundance. However, annual growth fluctuations were not correlated between species or between locations. Abundance and growth of YOY walleye and YOY sauger were correlated to only a limited extent with water levels during the spring (April-May), with air temperatures during the spring, or with air temperatures during the summer-fall (June-October). No single environmental factor could explain substantial amounts of the variation in abundance or growth for both species from both locations.																			0270-5060					MAR	1996	11	1					39	50		10.1080/02705060.1996.9663492	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1996.9663492													WOS:A1996TX21900005
J	SACKS, LA; LEE, TM; RADELL, MJ				SACKS, LA; LEE, TM; RADELL, MJ			COMPARISON OF ENERGY-BUDGET EVAPORATION LOSSES FROM 2 MORPHOMETRICALLY DIFFERENT FLORIDA SEEPAGE LAKES	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Evaporation was computed by the energy-budget method for two north Florida lakes with similar surface areas but different depths, for the period May 1989 to December 1990. Lake Barco, in north-central Florida, is shallow, with an average depth of 3 m; Lake Five-0, in the Florida panhandle, is considerably deeper, with an average depth of 9.5 m. As a result, the thermal regime and seasonal evaporation rates of the lakes are different. Evaporation from the shallower lake was higher than that from the deeper lake in the winter and spring. In the late summer and autumn, however, the situation is reversed. Evaporation from the shallow lake is directly related to the amount of incoming shortwave radiation because of its limited ability to store energy. The lag in evaporation at the deeper lake is a function of the greater amount of heat that it seasonally stores and releases. The difference in annual evaporation between Lake Barco (151 cm year-1) and Lake Five-O (128 cm year-1) is related to differences in regional climatic conditions between the two sites. Additionally, higher than normal evaporation rates at the two lakes are probably related to drought conditions experienced in north Florida during 1990, which resulted in higher temperatures and more incoming radiation. Monthly evaporation at Lake Barco could usually be estimated within 10% of the energy-budget evaporation using a constant pan coefficient. This lake may be representative of other shallow lakes that do not store considerable heat. Monthly evaporation at Lake Five-O, however, could not be estimated accurately by using an annual pan coefficient because of the large seasonal influence of change in stored heat. Monthly mass-transfer evaporation compared well with energy-budget evaporation at Lake Barco, but did not compare well at Lake Five-O. These errors may also be associated with changes in heat storage. Thus, the thermal regime of the lake must be considered to estimate accurately the seasonal evaporation rates from a deep lake.																			0022-1694					APR	1994	156	1-4					311	334		10.1016/0022-1694(94)90083-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-1694(94)90083-3													WOS:A1994NF77000016
J	Jehl, JR				Jehl, Joseph R., Jr.			Why do Eared Grebes leave hypersaline lakes in autumn?	WATERBIRDS												Jehl (1988) observed that the departure of Eared Grebes Podiceps nigricollis from Mono Lake, California, a major fall staging area, did not occur in relation to time of year or weather but was initiated after the density of brine shrimp (Artemia monica)-the major prey-fell below a predictable threshold. Although Caudell and Conover (2006) found no such relationship at Great Salt Lake, the other major staging area, reevaluation of their data indicates that the threshold concept applies there as well. Substantial differences in the staging ecology of Eared Grebes at the two lakes remain to be demonstrated.																			1524-4695	1938-5390				MAR	2007	30	1					112	115		10.1675/1524-4695(2007)030[0112:WDEGLH]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/1524-4695(2007)030[0112:WDEGLH]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000246093100015

Yearly harvests of agriculture, and animal husbandry, are controlled partially by spring precipitation. Based on the observations at 104 stations in IM, the spring precipitation during 1961-2010 was investigated and analysed. The results show that the amount of spring precipitation displays a trend associated with an increasing frequency of effective spring precipitation events (ESPE, with more than 10 stations among all observatories with over 10 mm daily precipitation). In addition, the synoptic conditions of the 141 ESPEs were studied through analysis of the sea level pressure (SLP), and 850, 700 and 500 hPa charts. They were classified into five types and named for the source positions of the frontal cyclones over the Eurasian continent on the SLP chart. Most of the Hetao, Mongolian and Huanghe cyclones in spring time, in general, bring strong wind, decreasing temperature or dust storms to IM. Sometimes they may also cause effective precipitation when the moisture transportation is favourable along the cyclone paths. The Northeast China cyclone mainly influences Northeast China and can lead to rainfall with adequate moisture supplies. In most cases, cold air from Siberia forms a frontal cyclone or a trough around Lake Baikal, and then heads eastward or southeastward, producing precipitation over large areas in IM in spring. Typical features of the synoptic evolutions of those five types are summarized and presented through analysis of representative ESPEs.

A first (1961-1986) and second (1987-2010) period are the basis for a dynamical analysis of changing drought and wetness extremes which are closely related to cyclonic activity over the European continent and circulation anomalies in the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes. Wave train, cyclone tracks, water flux and potential vorticity (PV) front analysis of the wet and dry months show the following result: (1) The extreme wet and dry cases in winter and summer are characterized by distinguished wave train patterns upstream of the Tarim River Basin. All wave trains originate in the Atlantic-European sector pointing towards wave train dynamics as one possible mechanism underlying the connection patterns observed. (2) The selected extreme cases show that exceptional precipitation events can be connected to characteristic cyclone tracks and a PV front in the upper troposphere even if cyclone tracks never cross the Tarim Basin. Extremely wet winters are characterized by cyclone tracks close to the western and northern boundary of the Tarim Basin whereas, during extremely dry winters, such cyclone tracks are absent. Wet summers are characterized by long-lived cyclonic anomalies at the north western corner of the Tarim River Basin [see also (3)]. During dry summers such anomalies are absent. (3) On a more local level the hydrological extreme events are linked to special dynamical structures of the upper tropospheric PV front. In winter strong (extreme) precipitation is connected to a strong non-linear wave development or a wave-breaking event over the Tarim River Basin. Together with non-linear wave development moisture and precipitation areas are advected towards the Tarim River Basin. In dry winters the upper tropospheric PV front is much more zonally oriented and wave-breaking is less frequent. Strong precipitation events are connected to strong breaking events and to the formation of long-lived nearly stationary cyclones over or north of the Tarim River Basin during extremely wet summer months.

J	Zhou, ST; L'Heureux, M; Weaver, S; Kumar, A				Zhou, Shuntai; L'Heureux, Michelle; Weaver, Scott; Kumar, Arun			A composite study of the MJO influence on the surface air temperature and precipitation over the Continental United States	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												The influence of the MJO on the continental United States (CONUS) surface air temperature (SAT) and precipitation is examined based on 30 years of daily data from 1979-2008. Composites are constructed for each of the eight phases of the Wheeler-Hendon MJO index over 12 overlapping three-month seasons. To ensure that the MJO signal is distinguished from other patterns of climate variability, several steps are taken: (a) only days classified as "MJO events" are used in the composites, (b) statistical significance of associated composites is assessed using a Monte Carlo procedure, and (c) intraseasonal frequencies are matched to the unfiltered data. Composites of other fields are also shown in order to examine how the SAT and precipitation anomalies are associated with large-scale circulations providing a link between the tropics and extratropics. The strongest and most significant MJO effects on SAT are found during the northern winter seasons. When enhanced convection is located over the equatorial Indian Ocean, below-average SAT tends to occur in New England and the Great Lakes region. As enhanced tropical convection shifts over the Maritime continent, above-average SAT appears in the eastern states of the US from Maine to Florida. The MJO influence on precipitation is also significant during northern winter seasons. When enhanced convection is located over the Maritime continent, more precipitation is observed in the central plains of the US. Enhanced precipitation also occurs over the west coast of the US when convective activity is stronger over the Indian Ocean. During the northern summer and fall, the MJO impact on precipitation is mainly significant at lower latitudes, over Mexico and southeastern US.

Here, we present a composite Holocene winter temperature index record derived from East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) reconstructions. This new temperature index record documents a thermal maximum occurring during the mid-Holocene, followed by a cooling trend. Along with other Holocene winter temperature reconstructions, these findings collectively indicate a cooling trend during the late-Holocene, consistent with global annual average temperature reconstructions. Notably, our composite dust records and dust sensitivity simulations identified enhanced global aeolian dust, which has been overlooked in previous model simulations, as a likely driver of the cooling trend throughout the mid- to late-Holocene. Our new evidence does not support the current seasonal bias explanation of the Holocene temperature controversy, but instead suggests potential mechanisms that could help explain the differences between temperatures inferred from models and paleo-reconstructions in the past.

Occurrence of agricultural pesticides in Mississippi Delta Bayou sediments and their effects on the amphipod: Hyalella azteca	CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY												Agricultural activity enhances topsoil erosion and facilitates the transport of pesticides that alter watershed sediment quality. Agricultural stream (bayou) sediment quality in Mississippi, USA, was evaluated across three bayous, habitats (upstream, midstream, downstream), and seasonally from 2011 to 2014 for pesticide contamination, effects, and bioavailability to Hyalella azteca. Four-week (28-day) H. azteca sediment bioassays were conducted to assess survival and growth and tissue residues. Fourteen pesticides were detected in at least one sediment sample and nine pesticides were detected in H. azteca tissues. Sediment pesticides p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE were greatest in Cow Oak Bayou and heptachlor and bifenthrin were greatest in Howden Lake Bayou. Seasonally, lambda-cyhalothrin and p,p'-DDT were greatest in winter while trifluralin, atrazine, and clomazone were greatest in the fall. H. azteca survival and growth ranged from 0 to 100% and 0.8-4.1 mg, respectively, with Cow Oak, downstream habitats, and spring samples having the greatest survival and growth. Greatest tissue pesticide residues were atrazine (1271 mu g/kg), p,p'-DDT (1,093 mu g/kg), and beta-cyfluthrin (1003 mu g/kg). Tissue pesticide residues were influenced primarily by p,p'-DDT with Cow Oak and fall tissue samples having the lowest residues. H. azteca tissue p,p'-DDT residues contributed to biological impairment. Although banned in the USA for 40 years, p,p'-DDT continues to impact sediment quality.																			0275-7540	1029-0370				APR 21	2021	37	4					305	322		10.1080/02757540.2021.1886281	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02757540.2021.1886281		FEB 2021											WOS:000619089500001
J	Roy, P; Gachon, P; Laprise, R				Roy, Philippe; Gachon, Philippe; Laprise, Rene			Sensitivity of seasonal precipitation extremes to model configuration of the Canadian Regional Climate Model over eastern Canada using historical simulations	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												This study analyzes the uncertainty of seasonal (winter and summer) precipitation extremes as simulated by a recent version of the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM) using 16 simulations (1961-1990), considering four sources of uncertainty from: (a) the domain size, (b) the driving Atmosphere-Ocean Global Climate Models (AOGCM), (c) the ensemble member for a given AOGCM and (d) the internal variability of the CRCM. These 16 simulations are driven by 2 AOGCMs (i.e. CGCM3, members 4 and 5, and ECHAM5, members 1 and 2), and one set of reanalysis products (i.e. ERA40), using two domain sizes (AMNO, covering all North America and QC, a smaller domain centred over the Province of Quebec). In addition to the mean seasonal precipitation, three seasonal indices are used to characterize different types of variability and extremes of precipitation: the number of wet days, the maximum number of consecutive dry days, and the 95th percentile of daily precipitation. Results show that largest source of uncertainty in summer comes from the AOGCM selection and the choice of domain size, followed by the choice of the member for a given AOGCM. In winter, the choice of the member becomes more important than the choice of the domain size. Simulated variance sensitivity is greater in winter than in summer, highlighting the importance of the large-scale circulation from the boundary conditions. The study confirms a higher uncertainty in the simulated heavy rainfall than the one in the mean precipitation, with some regions along the Great Lakes-St-Lawrence Valley exhibiting a systematic higher uncertainty value.

Lake Tahoe is a deep, subalpine lake in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California and Nevada. Although the lake is considered to be oligotrophic, the productivity of the eulittora (0-2 m) epilithic periphyton is very high, reaching a peak biomass at one site of 58 g carbon .cntdot. m2 in spring of 1985. More typical annual maxima were in the range of 15-25 g carbon .cntdot. m-2 at more productive sites. The epilithon shows great temporal and spatial variation in biomass. To quantify his variability, total particulate carbon was measured monthly or biweekly at 8 sites between 1983 and 1985. Annual regrowth of the eulittoral epilithon began during late winter, and reached maximal biomass during the spring and early summer months. Following this peak, most of the algal mat sloughed, leaving only a small understory. In addition, significant and consistant differences in epilithon biomass were found between sites adjacent to land-based development and disturbance, and sites far from disturbance. Several sites adjacent to disturbed areas had up to 20 times greater biomass than sites far removed from disturbance.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				JUN	1988	4	3					401	410		10.1080/02705060.1988.9665189	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1988.9665189													WOS:A1988N559000015

Factors affecting recruitment of young Colorado pikeminnow: Synthesis of predation experiments, field studies, and individual-based modeling	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Predation experiments, field studies, and individual-based-model (IBM) simulations revealed factors that affected the survival and recruitment of early life stages of endangered Colorado pikeminnow Ptychocheilus lucius in the Green River basin, Utah and Colorado. Small-bodied. normative red shiners Cyprinella lutrensis attacked Colorado pikerninnow larvae an average of once per minute, and predation success approached 30% in laboratory aquaria. Attack rate was also high in mesocosm experiments; turbidity and alternative prey reduced predation success. Distributions of hatching dates derived from otolith daily increment analysis showed that large cohorts of Colorado pikerninnow larvae that hatched in the Green River in early summer had low survival to autumn and that the few survivors were fast growing. Larvae hatched in midsummer or later had higher survival. Autumn juveniles grew 12-73% faster than summer juveniles, which suggested differential mortality of slow-growing fish. The IBM simulations integrated size-dependent predator-prey relationships, Colorado pikeminnow life history information, temperature-dependent pikeminnow growth, Green River predator size-structure dynamics, seasonally variable Green River water temperatures, and turbidity and alternative prey availability effects; the simulations showed that red shiner predation interacting with environmental variables may significantly reduce age-0 pikeminnow recruitment in autumn. Recruitment and growth patterns from simulations and field observations were consistent and suggested that the IBM is useful in evaluating management scenarios. Experiments, field studies, and predictive modeling provided consistent evidence that interacting effects of predation and environmental variables, including flow fluctuations, may structure intra-annual growth and recruitment patterns of age-0 Colorado pikeminnow. Flow management to benefit growth and survival of young pikeminnow, particularly early hatching ones, and reduced normative predator abundance in Green River backwaters may enhance the Colorado pikerninnow populations.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				NOV	2006	135	6					1722	1742		10.1577/T05-171.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T05-171.1													WOS:000243345500024

Spatial and seasonal variability of nitrous oxide in a large freshwater lake in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Aquatic ecosystems are recognized as a source of N2O in accordance with the flux estimations of rivers and estuaries; however, limited research has been conducted on large lakes. In this study, we report the annual N2O dynamics of a large eutrophic freshwater lake located in the subtropical zone of East China. The dissolved N2O concentrations in Lake Chaohu were observed to be between 8.5 and 92.3 nmol L-1 with emission rates between 0.3 and 53.6 mu mol m(-2) d(-1), exhibiting considerable spatiotemporal variability. The average seasonal N2O concentrations were obtained, with the highest value of 23.4 nmol L-1 found in winter and the lowest value of 12.7 nmol L-1 found in summer. In contrast to the N2O concentrations observed, the highest N2O emission rates occurred during summer, while the lowest emission rates occurred in autumn. The emissions of N2O were substantially high in the western part of the lake, which suffers from serious eutrophication. In addition, the hotspots of N2O emissions have been found around the inflowing mouth of the Nanfei River, which transports large amounts of nutrients into the lake. The results suggest that anthropogenically enhanced nutrient inputsmay have a significant role in the production and emission of N2O. However, the negative relationship between the surface water temperature and the N2O concentration suggests that, N2O fluxes might be influenced by other inconspicuous mechanisms. In the future the nitrogen dynamics of water and sediment in the lake should be collated to reveal mechanisms controlling N2O emissions. In summary, Lake Chaohu acts as a source of N2O with its most eutrophic part contributing 54.9% of the total N2O emissions of the whole lake. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Restoration of naturally reproducing and resident riverine lake sturgeon populations through capture and transfer	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												The Winnebago System, Wisconsin, is home to one of the largest Lake Sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens populations in North America. Although there are >50 known spawning sites utilized by Lake Sturgeon in the 200 km of the lower Wolf River upstream of Lake Winnebago, the construction of two dams >90 years ago eliminated the ability of Lake Sturgeon to access 18.5 km of river up to their ancestral spawning grounds below Keshena Falls. Given the cultural importance of sturgeon to the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin, expanded efforts aimed at restoring Lake Sturgeon spawning and a resident population to the upper Wolf River commenced in 2011. To meet these objectives, 100 or more Lake Sturgeon per year were captured below the dams, and transferred upstream to the Wolf River within the Menominee Reservation. All transferred fish were PIT tagged and 245 fish were surgically implanted with 10 year acoustic transmitters to determine spawning locations and monitor post-release movement. The first five transfer cohorts contained 621 Lake Sturgeon, with spawning activity observed below Keshena Falls each spring following release. Gravid fish transferred within 3 weeks of spawning exhibited higher spawning rates above the upstream dam (70.2% females; 73.9% males) than gravid fish transferred in late fall (41.8% females; 41.2% males). Spawning documented below Keshena Falls and within the Red River represent the first spawning activity at these locations in >100 years. Lake Sturgeon transferred in early fall displayed higher retention rates, 2-5 years post-tagging, in the pool upstream of both dams (10.4%) compared to the late fall (3.1%) and spring transfers (7.4%). Natural reproduction was documented through capture of larval Lake Sturgeon immediately below Keshena Falls in 2013. These results demonstrate that capture and transfer can be utilized as a cost-effective and biologically-effective tool for Lake Sturgeon spawning stock and population restoration.																			0175-8659	1439-0426				FEB	2019	35	1					160	168		10.1111/jai.13605	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jai.13605													WOS:000459917600020

In 2005, we measured bulk density and surface soil strength in recent clearcuts of predominantly aspen stands (Populus grandidentata Michx. and Populus tremuloides Michx.) in the Chippewa National Forest in northern Minnesota. We stratified these clearcuts by the season harvested, soil texture, and topographic position. In nearly all cases, we observed higher bulk density and surface soil strength following harvesting compared with adjacent and similar but unharvested stands. Within harvested sites, fine-textured soils generally had higher surface soil strength (more compaction) than coarse-textured soils when harvested in the summer, and fine-textured sites harvested in the summer had higher surface soil strength than those harvested in the winter. Landscape position was an important factor only in fine-textured soils. Both summit and toeslope positions had higher surface soil strength following summer harvesting compared with winter harvesting. Overall, our results indicate that fine-textured soils located on both lower and upper slope positions and harvested during unfrozen soil conditions are most susceptible to compaction during logging.

J	Miess, S; Chrisekos, A; Strand, M				Miess, Sam; Chrisekos, Alissa; Strand, Mac			An Ecological Profile of Hydropsyche alternans (Trichoptera: Hydropsychidae) in Lake Superior, the Last Stronghold of a Once-Dominant Great Lakes Surf Zone Caddisfly	INSECTS												Simple Summary Prior to the invasion and spread of Dreissena mussels in the late 1980s, the nearshore waters of the Laurentian Great Lakes were home to diverse assemblages of native aquatic insects, including the net-spinning caddisfly Hydropsyche alternans, which occurred in rocky surf-exposed habitat throughout the system from Lake Superior downstream to Lake Ontario. These surf zone caddisflies are still abundant in the largely Dreissena-free waters of Lake Superior where the present study was conducted. They have not been reported in the lakes below Lake Superior for decades, and are presumed to have been extirpated from Dreissena-infested habitats. The ecological profile presented here documents the life history of H. alternans in Lake Superior, and reveals details of its feeding biology that shed light on the roles that surf zone net-spinners play in the native nearshore food webs of the Great Lakes. The H. alternans life history in Lake Superior begins in mid-summer shortly after oviposition, which features females swimming to surf-exposed lake bottom substrates. Larval development takes approximately 10 months, but most of it occurs during their first 100 days. Adult emergence is broadly synchronous, with large numbers present from the summer solstice through mid-July. Gut content analyses showed that larvae opportunistically feed on algal, animal, and detrital material of aquatic and terrestrial origin. delta C-13 and delta N-15 stable isotope data indicate that they function as omnivores that link coastal, nearshore, and pelagic food webs. These energetic links, and the very existence of surf zone insect assemblages in the Great Lakes, depend on the Dreissena populations in Lake Superior remaining relatively small and isolated. We studied the life history, diet, and trophic ecology of Hydropsyche alternans in four rocky sites located along the south-central coast of Lake Superior. The H. alternans life history and broad trophic niche space were similar to those of its riverine relatives. Quantitative sampling over the course of one ice-free season revealed that most individuals lived univoltine life histories that featured early to mid-summer mating, and oviposition and rapid growth and development through summer into fall. Most individuals overwintered as ultimate or penultimate larval instars. Pupation followed ice-out in the spring. Gut content sampling and delta C-13 and delta N-15 stable isotope analyses indicated that the typical larval diet is a mix of benthic, pelagic, and terrestrial food resources, including diatoms, small arthropods, sloughed periphyton, and in one site, fugal hyphae apparently of foredune origin. As a suspension-feeding omnivore that relies on waves and currents to deliver food to its nets, H. alternans larvae form energetic links between coastal, nearshore, and offshore food webs. These connections have been lost throughout the lower Laurentian Great Lakes as a consequence of the invasion and spread of Dreissena mussels.																				2075-4450				JUL	2022	13	7							659	10.3390/insects13070659	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects13070659								35886835					WOS:000832145000001

F.			Impacts of climate change on nutrient losses from the Pike River watershed of southern Quebec	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												The impacts of climate change on water quality in the Pike River watershed, an important contributor of nutrient loads into the northern arm of Lake Champlain, were simulated for the time horizon 2041-2070. Four water quality scenarios were simulated using a calibrated version of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) customized to Quebec agroclimatic conditions. Three of the scenarios were generated using climate data simulated with the Fourth-generation Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM4). The fourth scenario was generated using the climate simulated with the Arpege Regional Climate Model. Potential mean climate-induced changes in sediment, phosphorus, and nitrogen yield projected by these scenarios were then analyzed for the 2050 horizon. In addition, the impacts of the different sources of climate projection uncertainty were assessed by comparing climate model initial conditions, and climate model physical structure effects on the hydrochemical projections. Only one climate scenario projected a significant increase in mean annual total phosphorus [10 metrics tons (t) yr(-1) or 14%] and total nitrogen (260 t yr(-1) or 17%) loads. However, when shorter time spans (seasonal and monthly scales) were considered, several significant changes were detected, especially in winter. Sediment and nutrient loadings, in winter, were predicted to become three to four times higher than current levels. These increases were attributed to a greater vulnerability of soils to erosion in winter due to the decrease in the snowpack, early onset of spring snowmelt, a greater number of rainfall events, and snowmelt episodes caused by higher winter and spring temperatures.

J	Li, X; Liu, XL; Huang, Y; Zhang, YL; Li, J				Li, Xiao; Liu, Xinlin; Huang, Yang; Zhang, Yulong; Li, Jian			Seasonal impact of constructed wetlands on nitrogen and phosphorus in sediments of flood control lakes with pollution assessment	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												The primary drivers of eutrophication in lakes following the reduction of external nutrient inputs are the release of N and P from sediments. Constructed wetlands play a pivotal role in ameliorating N, P, and other biogenic element levels. However, the presence of large vegetation in these wetlands also substantially contributes to nutrient accumulation in sediments, a phenomenon influenced by seasonal variations. In this study, a typical constructed wetland was selected as the research site. The research aimed to analyze the forms of N and P in sediments during both summer and winter. Simultaneously, a comprehensive pollution assessment and analysis were conducted within the study area. The findings indicate that elevated summer temperatures, together with the presence of wetland vegetation, promote the release of N through the nitrification process. Additionally, seasonal variations exert a significant impact on the distribution of P storage. Furthermore, the role of constructed wetlands in the absorption and release of N and P is primarily controlled by the influence of organic matter on nitrate-nitrogen, nitrite-nitrogen, and available phosphorus, and is also subject to seasonal fluctuations. In summary, under the comprehensive influence of constructed wetlands, vegetation types, and seasons, sediments within the lake generally exhibit a state of mild or moderate pollution. Therefore, targeted measures should be adopted to optimally adjust vegetation types, and human intervention is necessary, involving timely sediment harvesting during the summer to reduce N and P loads, and enhancing sediment adsorption and retention capacity for N and P during the winter. High temperatures and wetland plants promote nitrification, thereby enhancing the release of N from the sediment. The uptake and release of N and P are controlled by the effects of organic matter (OM) on nitrate-nitrogen, nitrite-nitrogen, and available phosphorus. The control of OM by wetlands is subject to seasonal cycles. The primary drivers of eutrophication in constructed wetlands following the reduction of external nutrient inputs are release of N and P from sediments. A constructed wetland was selected to analyze the forms of N and P in sediments during summer and winter, and a pollution assessment was conducted. We find that elevated summer temperatures, together with vegetation, promote release of N through nitrification process. Furthermore, the role of constructed wetlands in absorption and release of N and P is primarily controlled by the influence of organic matter on nitrate-nitrogen, nitrite-nitrogen, and available phosphorus, and is also subject to seasonal fluctuations.

At present most studies have focused solely on a single site. Using a more integrated approach that covers the complete scope of the plateau is needed to better understand the expansion logic of prehistoric humans moving towards the plateau. Here, we conducted accelerator mass spectrometry C-14 dating of two microlithic sites. Canxiongashuo (CXGS) and Shalongka (SLK), which are located at the inner and marginal areas of the QTP, respectively. By using geographic information system, literature, and natural environmental factors, we constructed a model for the relationship between traveling distance and time, and we also used these factors to construct a plateau environmental index. The results indicated that the ages of the CXGS and SLK sites are 8.4-7.5 cal. ka BP and 8.4-6.2 cal. ka BP, respectively. Combining the archaeological evidence and literature, hunter-gatherers may have seasonal migration activities at low altitude in winter and high altitude in summer in order to make full use of natural resources. Our model of relationship between traveling distance and time shows that hunter-gatherers in CXGS site was active on the plateau all year-round at approximately 8.3 cal. ka BP. According to EI and archaeological remains, we propose that SLK site was a winter camp of prehistoric hunter-gatherers. Taken together, we determined 8.4-6.0 cal. ka BP as a transitional period from the Paleolithic to Neolithic Ages, and winter camps of hunter-gatherers evolved into settlements in the Neolithic Age.

J	Aguilar, C; Nealson, KH				Aguilar, C; Nealson, KH			Biogeochemical cycling of manganese in Oneida Lake, New York: Whole lake studies of manganese	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Oneida Lake, New York is a eutrophic freshwater lake known for its abundant manganese nodules and a dynamic manganese cycle. Temporal and spatial distribution of soluble and particulate manganese in the water column of the lake were analyzed over a S-year period and correlated with other variables such as oxygen, pH, and temperature. Only data from 1988 are shown. Manganese is removed from the water column in the spring via conversion to particulate form and deposited in the bottom sediments. This removal is due to biological factors, as the lake Eh/pH conditions alone can not account for the oxidation of the soluble manganese Mn(II). During the summer months the manganese from microbial reduction moves from the sediments to the water column. In periods of stratification the soluble Mn(II) builds rep to concentrations of 20 mu M or more in the bottom waters. When mixing occurs, the soluble Mn(II) is rapidly removed via oxidation. This cycle occurs more than once during the summer, with each manganese atom probably being used several times for the oxidation of organic carbon. At the end of the fall, whole lake concentrations of manganese stabilize, and remain at about 1 mu M until the following summer when the cycle begins again. Inputs and outflows from the lake indicate that the active Mn cycle is primarily internal, with a small accumulation each year into ferromanganese nodules located in the oxic zones of the lake.

In recent years, the decrease in dissolved oxygen has been observed at the bottom of the northern part of Lake Biwa, Japan. In recent years, eutrophication and global warming caused the decrease in the dissolved oxygen in the deep layer. Under these circumstances, in order to preserve the ecosystem of Lake Biwa and to provide water resources, the environmental changes in Lake Biwa should be accurately grasped. In our present study, a water quality model considering the flow field from hydrodynamic model was developed in order to grasp the concentration of phytoplankton, zooplankton, nitrogen, phosphorus, dissolved oxygen and chemical oxygen demand in Lake Biwa. Numerical simulation was carried out for 3 years from 2007 to 2009. Comparisons of the simulations with the observations showed that the seasonal and interannual change of dissolved oxygen was well reproduced. The dissolved oxygen decreased during decomposing the organic matter by bacteria in the bottom layer with little oxygen supply from the atmosphere and the photosynthesis from the phytoplankton under the thermocline from spring to autumn. The simulation confirmed that in each year, the dissolved oxygen was supplied in all layers by the overturning in winter.

Dust transporting wind systems in the lower Lake Eyre Basin, Australia: A preliminary study	AEOLIAN RESEARCH												Australia does not have named dust transporting winds, like most other global dust source regions. Previous studies indicate that Australian dust is transported offshore via two dust paths to the southeast and northwest and that these dust paths are fed by three wind systems associated with the west-east passage of frontal weather systems across the southern half of the continent. This preliminary study uses 2 years of meteorological observations and mean sea level synoptic analyses to quantify the main weather systems and resultant wind systems responsible for dust entrainment and transport in the lower Lake Eyre. Of the 160 dust event days recorded in 2005 and 2006, 51% were associated with fronts and pre-frontal troughs; which generate pre-frontal northerlies, frontal westerlies and post-frontal southerlies that feed dust into the two dust paths. Heat troughs accounted for 24% of dust event days; with pre-trough northerlies and post-trough southerlies and westerlies from thunderstorms feeding the two dust paths. High pressure systems accounted for 22% of dust event days; with southeasterlies entraining most of the dust and low pressure systems account for only 3% of dust event days associated with variable winds. There is a distinct seasonality of dust entrainment; during late (austral) spring to mid summer in the north and extending to summer further south, driven by heating of the southern hemisphere in summer resulting in a poleward shift of fronts, troughs and pressure systems as spring and summer progress.

The rates of microbial enzymatic activities (leucine aminopeptidase, LAP, beta-glucosidase, beta-GLU; alkaline phosphatase, AP) and heterotrophic prokaryotic production (HPP), as well as the amount of total prokaryotic biomass (PB) were estimated during two seasonal periods, together with the physical and chemical parameters. Variations in environmental and microbial parameters were more significant in seasonal scale than those in spatial one. All the microbial activities increased from autumn to spring, however only the GLU activity was statistically significant. HPP and PB did not exhibit significant temporal changes throughout the study period. In spring, the decomposition data were not significantly related to the trophic parameters in spatial scale. Conversely, in autumn, high decomposition processes were associated to high production of new biomass (both phytoplanktonic and prokaryotic) at the station located in the eutrophic Meiliang Bay, showing a tight coupling among polymer degradation, monomer uptake and efficient incorporation of the carbon released by enzymatic hydrolysis into new biomass. Thus, it is suggested that distinct regulation pathways of microbial metabolism existed in different seasons in large shallow lakes.

Heavy metals and metalloid contamination in Louisiana Lake Pontchartrain Estuary along I-10 Bridge	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT												In this study, HMs concentration in sediments and water from the Lake Pontchartrain estuary along the I-10 Bridge were investigated in two seasons to evaluate the level of contamination and to assess the effect of vehicular traffic. Vehicular traffic has led to HMs such as As, Cd, Cr, Pb, Zn, Ni, and Cu accumulation in sediments along the bridge. The HMs content in water especially in summer increased due to high temperature which led to release of HMs from the sediments. The level of pollution attributed to anthropogenic activities was evaluated using several pollution indicators. The overall HMs bioavailability and EFs Was mostly high in summer and the concentration of the HMs in both sediments and water was highly influenced by the season and the distance from the highways. The content of As and Cd in lake sediments were higher than the background values (BGV) for both seasons (spring and summer), and Cr and Pb in sediments were higher than the BGV in most sampling points in the spring. According to Sediments Quality Guidelines (SQGs), heavy metals except for As have low biotoxicity, and As could potentially result in harmful effects on the aquatic organisms. The relationship between As and vehicular traffic is less studied so our finding stress the need for further study on source of As in Lake Pontchartrain sediments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Data used were collected over 1-4 yr for 16 lakes in central New York State [USA] characterized by a wide variety of morphometries, hydrologies and P loadings. The regressions describing the dependence of summer phytoplankton standing crop and winter total P concentration on loading and of standing crop on total P were linear. Those characterizing water transparency as a function of standing crop and winter total P were parabolic. All regressions showed high correlation coefficients. The overall model composed of these regressions establishes a quantitative basis for the concept that P supplied to lakes exerts a uniquely controlling role on phytoplankton standing crop. The regressions may be used for trophic state description and in the development of management strategies for lakes.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1978	23	1					135	145		10.4319/lo.1978.23.1.0135	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1978.23.1.0135													WOS:A1978EW90700013
J	Ren, W; Yao, TD; Xie, SY				Ren, Wei; Yao, Tandong; Xie, Shiyou			Water stable isotopes in the Yarlungzangbo headwater region and its vicinity of the southwestern Tibetan Plateau	TELLUS SERIES B-CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL METEOROLOGY												Various types of water samples across the Yarlungzangbo headwater region and its vicinity of the southwestern Tibetan Plateau were collected in summer 2012 for isotopic analysis to augment our specific understanding of regional hydroclimate. In the upper Yarlungzangbo system, contribution of more isotopically depleted tributary influx rather than evaporation is identified as the major hydrological process, and this causes generally progressive depletion in main flow isotopes downstream/eastward. On the regional scale (from the middle Yarlungzangbo basin to the western vicinity of the Yarlungzangbo headwaters), one of the clearest findings is the synchronous increases in river/stream delta O-18 and d-excess (d-excess = delta D-8 delta O-18) from east to west. From a geographical and climatological perspective, these can be explained by increasing contributions of summer-time continental/local recycled vs. monsoonal moisture or winter-spring vs. summer monsoon precipitation in the surface runoff generation westward. The Yarlungzangbo headwaters are at a critical transition between the Indian monsoon system in the east and the westerly one in the west as revealed by the intermediate d-excess and delta O-18 values, while the Himalaya region farther west (i.e. Pulan region) is predominated by the continental recycled moisture as revealed by the highest d-excess and delta O-18 values. Furthermore, based upon existing isotopic and meteorological data, a predicted local evaporation line for the Yarlungzangbo headwater region and its vicinity is proposed, which can further help to assess how local hydroclimate affect water stable isotopes. Results of this study provide a baseline for isotopic hydroclimate research in the southwestern Tibetan Plateau.																			1600-0889						2016	68								30397	10.3402/tellusb.v68.30397	http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/tellusb.v68.30397													WOS:000379918500001

The seasonal reproductive cycle includes six cohorts (6 to 10 months lifetime) with essentially autumnal (beginning of cycle) and winter cohorts breeding spring cohorts which generate the first again. This reproduction cycle depending on temperature and rainfall differs from O. gammarellus european cycle and from those of different moroccan crustacean cycles, specially Orchestia mediterranea by a long pause in summer (short in winter) associated with an important adult mortality; it shows also an original group of biodemographic features: short life, rapid growth average of 1,39 mm/month, precocious sexual maturity, semi-annual and multivoltine reproduction. The average fecundity of 15 eggs/brood, lower in this population is partly balanced by the sex-ratio of 1:1 (57% of females) and provides a reproductive potential similar to those of numerous european populations but nevertheless not leading to high densities. A ''r (dominant)-K'' continuum is observed in this population but here in lack of a real transition from r to K strategy, the O. gammarellus population shows essentially an adaptation to the environment crises subordinated to thermic and humidity seasonal factors in favouring a cryptozoic habitat (desiccation split) and an important reproductive potential during ecological propitious periods.																			1146-609X						1994	15	5					633	659																WOS:A1994QF73500008

In this study, FLake, a one-dimensional freshwater lake model, is optimized to simulate the LSWTs of 94 large lakes with surface areas greater than 100 km(2) in China. While most of these lakes are seasonally ice-covered over the Tibetan Plateau, FLake with default parameters significantly underestimated LSWT in spring and winter and slightly overestimated LSWT in summer and autumn in seasonally ice-covered lakes. We performed sensitivity experiments and calibration in the trial lake (Qinghai Lake). Then, parameter calibrations of three lake-specific properties (albedo, lake mean depth and light extinction coefficient) were performed in all the studied lakes. The optimized FLake substantially improved the simulations of seasonal and interannual variations in LSWT. The root mean square error decreased from 3.64 +/- 1.54 degrees C to 1.97 +/- 0.72 degrees C, and the mean bias of 96% of the lakes decreased to less than 1 degrees C. Our study showed that the optimized FLake can reproduce the temporal variations in LSWT across China with optimized parameters, providing the possibility to simulate and project the response of LSWT to rapid climate change. Plain Language Summary Lake surface water temperature (LSWT), one of the key physical properties of lake water, directly or indirectly impacts physical and biological processes within lakes. LSWT also controls the exchanges of water and heat at the lake-air interface. Therefore, it is necessary to accurately simulate and predict changes in LSWT. This study evaluated the simulation capabilities of the freshwater lake model (FLake) for LSWTs in 94 large lakes across China. FLake has better LSWT simulation skills for non-ice-covered lakes than for seasonally ice-covered lakes. Through a series of experiments in Qinghai Lake, three dominant parameters for model simulation were identified, and the observation-based calibration greatly improved the performance of the FLake model. This study demonstrates the potential of FLake in simulating and predicting LSWT changes and provides a reference for future lake simulations in China.					; Yang, Hui/IVV-5690-2023; OTTLE, Catherine/K-3895-2012; Tang, Shuchang/IAM-7154-2023; chengyang, wang/ABD-3619-2021; Wang, Xuhui/H-8605-2019	Huang, Ling/0000-0002-3262-151X; Tang, Shuchang/0000-0001-9979-9358; Wang, Xuhui/0000-0003-0818-9816; Bernus, Anthony/0000-0001-7672-5807														2333-5084				AUG	2021	8	8							e2021EA001737	10.1029/2021EA001737	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021EA001737													WOS:000691103000007

A total of 75 taxa, dominated by rotifers, was observed. Zooplankton densities increased from the damsite towards the headwaters of the reservoir; they peaked in spring and at the end of summer. Despite quantitative differences, the same species succession was observed during the three years and at all the lake sampling stations. Thus the zooplankton community shifted from rotifers in early spring to small-bodied cladocerans (Bosmina spp.), and, finally, to larger cladocerans (Daphnia spp.) in early summer. Shifts in zooplankton composition have also frequently been observed in midsummer, when the cladoceran assemblage of Daphnia-Bosmina was generally replaced by a combination of Ceriodaphnia-Diaphanosoma. These species successions are discussed in relation to size-selective predation, resource limitation and interspecific competition.																			0777-6276					JUN	1995	125	1					109	123																WOS:A1995RH79600009

Three distinct population maxima were distinguished, one in June, one in July, and one in September. C. hirundinella dominated the spring and summer populations. C. furcoides was rare in June, but it continuously increased and composed ca. 18% of the Ceratium-cells in the autumn. The size of a C. hirundinella decreased during the investigation period and a form with a long horn disappeared in June. Ceratium was most numerous during the warmer periods in summer when a distinct thermocline appeared and before the turnover period in September. The alga preferred depths down to 3 m where the blue tight dominated and the following parametric magnitudes could be measured: oxygen contents >5 mg l-1, pH >7, HCO3, >1.7 meq..l-1 and a specific conductivity of ca. 250 mS.cm-1. The algal growth periods displayed doubling times of 2.63 and 4.04 days at surface temperatures of 19-degrees-C and 15-degrees-C, respectively. The water transparency decreased 3.8 m when Ceratium reached cell densities of 13 individuals.ml-1 (0-10 m depth). Its vertical migration demonstrated a dial rhythm with accumulation of cells in the surface waters during the day. Complicated patterns of surface avoidance occurred in clear weather and under wind stress.																			0107-055X						1992	12	5					541	556		10.1111/j.1756-1051.1992.tb01833.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1756-1051.1992.tb01833.x													WOS:A1992KD98600007
J	Noges, T				Noges, T			Phytoplankton pigments and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in Lake Peipsi-Pihkva	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The material for pigment analysis was collected 1-3 times a year from Lake Peipsi-Pihkva in 1983, 1987, 1988, 1991 and 1992-1995. Concentrations of chlorophyll a, b and c (Chla, Chlb, Chic), pheopigment (Pheo) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were measured biweekly in 1985-1986. The mean of all Chla values was 20.2 mg m(-1) (median 13.3 mg m(-1)) indicating the eutrophic state of the lake. Average Chlb, Chic, Pheo and carotenoid (Car) contents were 3.7 mg m(-3), 4.1 mg m(-3), 3.0 mg m(-3) and 4.8 mg m(-3), respectively. The average Chlb/Chla ratio was 22.9 %, Chlc/Chla 23.4%, Pheo/Chla 38%, Car/Chla 37% and ATP/Chla 3%, the medians being 14.3, 13.6, 17.5, 39.4 and 1.9%, respectively. The proportion of Chla in phytoplankton biomass was 0.41%, median 0.32%. There were no significant differences in temperature, oxygen concentration, Chla, and ATP between the surface and bottom water; the lake was polymictic during the vegetation period. The Chla concentration had its first peak in May followed by a decrease in June and July. In late summer Chla increased again achieving its seasonal maximum in late autumn. The ATP concentration was the highest during spring and early summer, decreasing drastically in autumn together with the decline of primary production. ATP/Chla was the highest during the ''clear water period'' in June and early July, which coincided also with the high proportion of Chla in phytoplankton biomass. The highest Chla occurred in November (average 37.2 mg m(-3)) when Secchi transparency was the lowest (1.05 m). Concentrations of Chlb, Chic and carotenoids were the highest in August, that of Pheo in June. Concentrations of Chla and other pigments were the lowest in the northern part of Lake Peipsi (mean 14.7 mg m(-3), median 12.5 mg m(-3)) and the highest in the southern part of Lake Pihkva (mean 47.9 mg m(-3), median 16.3 mg m(-3)). An increase of Chla and decrease of Secchi depth could be noticed in 1983-1988, while in 1988-1994 the tendency was opposite.

Backwater immigration by fishes through a water control structure: Implications for connectivity and restoration	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Recent efforts to reduce sediment loading in large-river backwaters have relied on inexpensive low-maintenance structures that promote river-backwater connectivity. How these structures influence ichthyofauna is not understood. We quantified the distribution of fishes through a stop-log structure installed during the Swan Lake habitat restoration project on the lower Illinois River. Modified hoop nets were systematically fished simultaneously in a two-dimensional 3 vertical X 3 horizontal grid of net locations to capture fish as they immigrated into the lake through the structure. Catches were dominated by gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum and freshwater drum Aplodinotus grunniens. Adult freshwater drum, adult common carp Cyprinus carpio, and juvenile silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix exhibited an affinity for the lower two-thirds of the water column. Lengths of freshwater drum increased with depth, particularly during the spring. Common carp catch rates were highest during spring, whereas those for silver carp were highest during fall and winter. Closure of the bottom two-thirds of the lower Swan Lake water control structure could reduce immigration of exotic and undesirable species into the backwater; their recruitment associated with the lake could be affected accordingly. The water control structure does not appear to have negatively affected lateral fish movement. However, habitat quality and availability probably determine seasonal patterns in backwater use. In systems where exotic species are abundant, lateral connectivity may need to be assessed from a cost-benefit perspective, specifically as it pertains to maintaining habitat availability for indigenous fishes versus limiting habitat availability for introduced species.

This study aimed to explore the seasonal dynamics of water clarity and to analyze how water level, wind velocity and total precipitation influence this dynamics in Lake Dahuchi, China. The Secchi disk depths recorded in the field and derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images together demonstrated a seasonal pattern of water clarity, which was lower in winter and spring, increased in April or May to reach the highest values in summer, upon which it gradually declined from September onward. Piecewise linear regression analysis between water clarity and water level showed that water level could explain 70% of the variation of the logarithm of Secchi disk depth. The water clarity of Lake Dahuchi was primarily controlled by suspended sediment, while the seasonal variation of water level induced different sediment resuspension, thus we concluded that the water clarity seasonal dynamics of Lake Dahuchi was mainly regulated by seasonal variation of water level.					邬国锋/B-8735-2018; Chen, Lili/HJY-7871-2023	de Leeuw, Jan/0000-0001-7020-2503													0920-4741	1573-1650				JUL	2009	23	9					1849	1861		10.1007/s11269-008-9356-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-008-9356-3													WOS:000267300100011

Unusually high precipitation during the spring and summer of 2014 caused extended hypoxia above the bottom in the autumn. Nauplii, copepodites, Oithona nana and appendicularians strictly avoided the layers of reduced DO. Copepods Oithona similis, Mesaiokeras hurei, oncaeids, and polychaeta trochophore comprised a community adapted to the hypoxic bottom layer (10%-14% dissolved oxygen). Oncaeids were the most abundant and were presented by two small species: Oncaea zernovi and the more numerous Monothula subtilis. Polychaeta larvae were extraordinary numerous, too. Proliferation of ocaeids and polychaeta larvae in hypoxic zone could be related to their ability to feed on detrital matter and associated microbial community. Contrary, low abundance of other copepod developmental stages were found in the whole water column suggesting that the high load of organic material and hypoxic events inhabited their reproduction. Our study has documented the dramatic impact of local environmental changes on the planktonic community, providing additional evidence that low oxygen has an effect on the distribution and abundance of zooplankton.

J	Jankowski, T; Straile, D				Jankowski, T; Straile, D			Allochronic differentiation among Daphnia species, hybrids and backcrosses:: the importance of sexual reproduction for population dynamics and genetic architecture	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Seasonal dynamics of the abundance, sexual reproduction and genetic architecture in a Daphnia hyalina-galeata hybrid complex were studied in the large and deep Lake Constance. We found evidence for the occurrence of first and second order hybridization. Our study revealed strong differences between the parental species not only regarding their seasonal dynamics, genetic architecture and diversity, but also their sexual reproductive behaviour. The overwintering D. hyalina showed low genetic diversity, no genetic differentiation during the season, and reproduced sexually in autumn, whereas D. galeata reached higher levels of genetic diversity, reproduced sexually in early summer, and exhibited changes in genetic structure during the season, but was only present from spring to autumn. However, in both species sexual reproduction was a rare event, and daphnids, including hybrids, reproduced predominantly asexually. This allows long-term persistence of hybrids as well without continuing hybridization events. Within all variables studied, F1 and F2 hybrids showed an intermediate pattern, whereas proposed backcross hybrids were more similar to their respective parentals. These differences in phenotype as well as significant differences in pairwise F-st values between parentals suggest that gene flow seems to be relatively low in the Lake Constance hybrid system. We found evidence for unidirectional introgression by backcrossing from D. galeata to D. hyalina and found a decrease in at least one of the proposed introgressed alleles in the hyalina-backcross while the season progressed. Our findings suggest allochronic differentiation within this hybrid population and different microevolutionary trajectories of the parental species, which will be discussed in the light of the ongoing reoligotrophication process of Lake Constance.

In the first choice experiment, larvae were released into a central area and their upstream or downstream crawling or drifting was monitored. A second experiment used the same design; however, fifth instars collected during spring and fall were divided into two, nonoverlapping, relative size-classes (large and small) to determine how these factors influenced movement parameters. In both experiments, larvae always drifted more frequently than they crawled, but in experiment 2, drifting tendency declined with increasing weight in spring. In both experiments, there was no statistically detectable directional bias to crawling nor change in relative crawling direction with season or size-class. In experiment 2, drifting larvae were lighter than nondrifting larvae in the large size-class, but equal in weight in the small size-class. This result was unrelated to absolute weight, as large size-class larvae in fall were similar in weight to small size-class larvae in spring. It is possible that the relative weight differential of drifting and nondrifting larvae in one size-class but not the other may be related to sexual rather than body size differences.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				FEB	1992	49	2					259	265		10.1139/f92-030	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f92-030													WOS:A1992HE01600007

The study period of 12 months duration from April 2009 to March 2010 revealed the presence of 30 diatom species. A limited number of these were recorded throughout the year, while others were distributed in different seasons mainly in winter and summer. These taxa belong to 19 genera viz. Stephanodiscus, Coscinodiscus, Cyclotella, Gomphonema, Melosira, Navicula, Hantzschia, Eunotia, Rhopalopodia, Cocconeis, Amphora, Synedra, Diatoma, Surirella, Fragillaria, Anomoeneis, Nitzschia, Diadesmis and Pinnularia. The deposited sediment samples of lake were found to be rich in sand (60%), silt (15%), clay (22%) and other soil nutrients as compared to control soil. Total diatom density showed significant positive correlation with electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids (p<0.01) and significant positive correlation with chemical oxygen demand (p<0.05). Shannon-Weiner diversity index (H') value (1.372) and Evenness (J') value (0.903) were found to be highest during winter while Berger-Parker index of dominance (0.147) was highest in monsoon. This study concludes that the diatom species attain maximum growth in post monsoon and winter months and gradually declines in summer to reach its minimum during monsoon.																			2250-0480					OCT-DEC	2011	1	1					L29	L37																WOS:000215371800003

Physico-chemical forms of copper in water and sediments of Lake Pontchartrain basin, USA	CHEMOSPHERE												In this study, one of the largest estuaries in the Gulf Coast of USA was investigated for Cu forms and fractionations. Both the water and sediment samples in subsegments of the Lake Pontchartrain basin were collected and Cu forms in dissolved phase and sediment phase were analyzed. The BCR sequential extraction procedure was used to extract Cu in exchangeable, reducible, oxidizable and residual fractions in sediments. The results showed that the residual fraction of Cu was a major contributor in Tangipahoa River and I-10 Bridge sediments, while the residual and oxidizable fractions in the case of oil refinery sediments. Cu partitioning in Lake Pontchartrain basin water showed the decreasing trend of inert>labile> organic in both spring and summer. The release of Cu from the sediments into the water column was greater in summer as compared to spring and vice versa. Lower temperature helps in the adsorption of Cu on the surface of sediments in early spring due to low disturbance and temperature. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The lake is fed by runoff from rain, snow melt and ice melt from a few small glaciers, as well as by water collected in a neighbouring valley. Study focus: Water resources in the Alps are projected to undergo substantial changes in the coming decades. It is therefore essential to explore climate change impacts in catchments with hydropower facilities. We present a multi-dataset calibration (MDC) using discharge, snowcover data and glacier mass balances for an ensemble of hydrological simulations performed using the Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV)-light model. The objective is to predict the future changes in hydrological processes in the catchment and to assess the benefits of a MDC compared to a traditional calibration to discharge only. New hydrological insights for the region: We found that the annual runoff dynamics will undergo significant changes with more runoff in winter and less in summer by shifting parts of the summer melt runoff to an earlier peak in spring. We furthermore found that the MDC reduces the uncertainty in the projections of glacial runoff and leads to a different distribution of runoff throughout the year than if calibrated to discharge only. We therefore argue that MDC leads to more consistent model results by representing the runoff generation processes more realistically.

JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake Erie algal bloom discussions have historically focused on cyanobacteria, with foundational "blooms like it hot" and "high nutrient" paradigms considered as primary drivers behind cyanobacterial bloom success. Yet, recent surveys have rediscovered winter-spring diatom blooms, introducing another key player in the Lake Erie eutrophication and algal bloom story which has been historically overlooked. These blooms (summer vs. winter) have been treated as solitary events separated by spatial and temporal gradients. However, new evidence suggests they may not be so isolated, linked in a manner that manifests as an algal bloom cycle. Equally notable are the emerging reports of cyanobacterial blooms in cold and/or oligotrophic freshwaters, which have been interpreted by some as shifts in classical bloom paradigms. These emerging bloom reports have led many to ask "what is a bloom?". Furthermore, questioning classic paradigms has caused others to wonder if we are overlooking additional factors which constrain bloom success. In light of emerging data and ideas, we revisited foundational concepts within the context of Lake Erie algal blooms and derived five key take-aways: 1) Additional bloom-formers (diatoms) need to be included in Lake Erie algal discussions, 2) The term "bloom" must be reinforced with a clear definition and quantitative metrics for each event, 3) Algal blooms should not be studied solitarily, 4) Shifts in physiochemical conditions serve as an alternative interpretation to potential shifts in ecological paradigms, 5) Additional factors which constrain bloom success and succession ( i.e. , pH and light) require consideration.

Recent studies suggest AL is also abundant in freshwater environments, but much less research has been conducted in freshwaters relative to oceans. The Adopt-a-BeachTM (MB) program, administered by the Alliance for the Great Lakes, organizes volunteers to act as citizen scientists by collecting and maintaining data on AL abundance on Great Lakes beaches. Initial assessments of the AAB records quantified sources and abundance of AL on Lake Michigan beaches, and showed that plastic AL was >75% of AL on beaches across all five Great Lakes. However, AAB records have not yet been used to examine patterns of AL density and composition among beaches of all different substrate types (e.g., parks, rocky, sandy), across land-use categories (e.g., rural, suburban, urban), or among seasons (i.e., spring, summer, and fall). We found that most AL on beaches are consumer goods that most likely originate from beach visitors and nearby urban environments, rather than activities such as shipping, fishing, or illegal dumping. We also demonstrated that urban beaches and those with sand rather than rocks had higher AL density relative to other sites. Finally, we found that AL abundance is lowest during the summer, between the US holidays of Memorial Day (last Monday in May) and Labor Day (first Monday in September) at the urban beaches, while other beaches showed no seasonality. This research is a model for utilizing datasets collected by volunteers involved in citizen science programs, and will contribute to AL management by offering priorities for AL types and locations to maximize AL reduction.

A strong stratospheric polar vortex is typically associated with dry conditions across Southeastern China and wet conditions across Korea and Japan in spring. Seasonal forecast models have a decent skill of forecasting the stratospheric polar vortex strength in March. However, they show a wide spread in the predictability of East Asian spring rainfall, possibly due to the underrepresentation of the linkage between the stratospheric polar vortex and East Asian rainfall. The dry impact of strong polar vortex on Southeastern China is forecasted, but the wet impact on Korea and Japan is missing. Tropospheric positive height anomalies over Lake Baikal extend farther equatorward in East Asia during a strong vortex, corresponding to an anomalous anticyclone and less rainfall across Southeastern China. In contrast, the observed anomalous cyclonic shear at 200 hPa and the observed anomalous cyclone at 850 hPa in spring are not realistically forecasted over Northeast Asia, explaining the low skill of producing the wet anomalies in Korea and Japan by models. All models can forecast the wet pattern in East Asia during the El Nino spring. The observed southwesterly anomalies along the coastal China, Korea, and Japan following El Nino are also forecasted by models. Compared with the remote impact of El Nino, the downward impact of the stratosphere on East Asian spring rainfall is still a challenge for most models.					; Luo, Jing-Jia/T-9612-2019; Rao, Jian/O-3392-2019; garfinkel, chaim/AAA-1134-2020	Chu, Min/0000-0001-8126-3950; Lu, Yixiong/0000-0001-9823-9367; Rao, Jian/0000-0001-5030-0288													0930-7575	1432-0894				JUN	2023	60	11-12					4111	4131		10.1007/s00382-022-06551-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-022-06551-3		NOV 2022											WOS:000879155000002

Checking the pulse of Lake Ontario's microbial-planktonic communities: A trophic transfer hypothesis	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												The structure and function of the microbial food web of Lake Ontario was assessed at 15 stations distributed across 4 transects during the spring and summer of 2003. This was the first major binational study of Lake Ontario since the Lake Ontario Trophic Transfer initiative of 1990. The microbial loop (bacteria, autotrophic picoplankton, heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) and ciliates) and phytoplankton, were enumerated microscopically in addition to measurements of chlorophyll a, size fractionated primary productivity (14C) and bacterial growth (3H). HNF dominated the total biomass in spring (approximate to 300mg m-3) and summer (approximate to 1250 mg m-3). The size of the organic carbon pool increased from approximate to 90 mg C m-3 in spring to approximate to 270 mg C m-3 with HNF contributing 36% of the total organic carbon in the spring and 52% in the summer; however the net balance of the organic carbon pool shifted from autotrophic in the spring to heterotrophic in the summer. The available evidence suggests that HNF are a poor quality food resource for zooplankton and it is likely that the carbon sequestered by HNF is not available to higher trophic levels resulting in dietary stress for planktivores. The implications of high HNF for both organic carbon cycling and maintaining healthy fisheries needs further research. Independent observations show that oligotrophic conditions prevail as evidenced by low phosphorus, low chlorophyll a, low plankton and high water clarity. Such conditions have been generally regarded as the gold standard for managing healthy lakes. Lake Ontario is oligotrophic and healthy from a water quality perspective, but from a food web dynamics point of view, Lake Ontario appears to be unhealthy due to the dominance of HNF, low zooplankton and poor quality of food available to higher trophic levels. We hypothesize that the lake's poor health is attributable to inefficient energy transfer from lower to higher trophic levels. The traditional understanding of trophic state based mainly on water quality criteria needs to be broadened by the inclusion of food web and fisheries based metrics.

Comparison of ALOS PALSAR interferometry and field geodetic leveling for marshy soil thaw/freeze monitoring, case study from the Baikal lake region, Russia	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												Estimation of vertical ground displacements due to seasonal periods of freezing and thawing was carried out on the Selenga river mouth using differential radar interferometry. The results of seasonal radar interferometry measurements from 2008 to 2010 have been compared with the survey data for 2011, under the assumption that the seasonal deformation is comparable for different years and lies within the limits of geodetic leveling error. The difference between the interferometric and geodetic measurements is <1 cm in winter months, whereas in summer, as the upper soil moisture content varies, the difference reaches 2 to 2.7 cm. It has been concluded that the moisture content and its profile should be taken into consideration in summer or when choosing the radar interferometry in winter.

Results showed that (1) the average As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn concentrations were 3.75, 0.50, 2.25, 3.33, 1.30 and 21.92 mu g/L in the winter samples and 3.62, 0.40, 1.91, 2.72, 1.23 and 30.76 mu g/L in the summer samples, respectively. The concentrations of these elements were within the concentration ranges of published data on rivers or lakes in China. (2) ANOVA revealed obvious spatial, not seasonal, variations in the overlying water in this research area, except for Cd and Zn. (3) The single-factor and Nemerow pollution index values were below 0.7 in all sites in the winter and summer samples, indicating that the water body had not been affected by As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn yet; the water quality was relatively good and free from the influence of these pollutants. (4) A significant correlation was found amongst As, Cd, Cr, Cu and Pb (P < 0.01). No significant positive or negative correlations were obtained between Zn and other heavy metals (P > 0.05), except for Zn and Cu (P < 0.05) in the winter samples. Principal component analysis (PCA) verified that As, Cd, Cr, Cu and Pb had similar distribution patterns. The correlations and PCA results indicated that the possible source of As, Cd, Cr, Cu and Pb was geochemical role, whereas complex original sources caused by human activities may have affected Zn concentrations in this research region.

J	Salmi, P; Lehmijoki, A; Salonen, K				Salmi, Pauliina; Lehmijoki, Anne; Salonen, Kalevi			Development of picoplankton during natural and enhanced mixing under late-winter ice	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												We studied the development of autotrophic picophytoplankton and heterotrophic bacterioplankton during the transition from winter ice cover to open water under natural and manipulated mixing conditions in eutrophic Lake Vesijarvi. During the melting of the snow and ice cover, a convection layer developed which eventually met the chemocline at the interface between the oxic and anoxic water masses. However, in the years with mechanically enhanced mixing, the whole water column remained well oxygenated and the deepening of penetrative convection was facilitated. Stochastic variations in weather, primarily the thickness of the snow cover, likely determined the timing of picophytoplankton growth. Mechanical mixing slightly increased the biomass of picophytoplankton, especially the eukaryotic fraction, probably because eukaryotic picophytoplankton coped well with changing light conditions. Bacterial biomass was not notably affected, although their mean cell size was significantly smaller in the oxic deep water than in anoxic conditions during the natural mixing regime. Our results show that, when snow melts and solar radiation increasingly penetrates into lake water, picophytoplankton biomass and numbers already start to increase weeks before ice-break and may reach abundances typical of early summer under the ice. A similar development of bacterioplankton suggests a trophic relationship between heterotrophic and autotrophic producers.

J	Slusarczyk, M				Slusarczyk, Miroslaw			Extended lifespan traded for diapause in Daphnia	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												P> Most freshwater crustaceans of the genus Daphnia are cyclically parthenogenetic organisms that are well adapted to unstable habitats due to their short life cycle, wide phenotypic plasticity, and the ability to produce protective diapausing eggs in anticipation of environmental deterioration. Short lifespan and heterogonic reproduction are typical features of Daphnia in a broad spectrum of freshwater habitats, from small temporary pools to large permanent lakes. However, in some locations, departures may be observed from this typical life history pattern to obligate asexuality or extended lifespan. A 3-year field study in a deep ultraoligotrophic fish-free alpine-type lake (Czarny Staw in the Tatra mountains in southern Poland) revealed the coexistence of two closely related asexual lineages of Daphnia of the pulex complex, which differ in body colour (transparent versus orange) and in their strategies for surviving long winters. The 'transparent' clone of European origin exhibits an ephemeral lifestyle. It completes its life cycle within a single season, forming two generations of active specimens during the short summer and producing diapausing eggs late in the season. Transparent individuals live no longer than 5-6 months in this cold lake and survive winter exclusively in the form of diapausing eggs. Individuals of the 'orange' lineage, which are closely related to eastern Nearctic Daphnia pulicaria, exhibit a biennial lifestyle unique to this genus. They do not form diapausing eggs or produce them only occasionally. Instead, they are active throughout the year and live for up to 13-14 months. Reproduction is postponed until the second year of life when food conditions have improved. Rich lipid reserves accumulated in the first season fuel them during the long winter and permit early reproduction the following spring. Possible reasons for the evolution of obligatory parthenogenesis and long lifespan in Daphnia are discussed.

Hydrologic, land cover, and seasonal patterns of waterborne pathogens in Great Lakes tributaries	WATER RESEARCH												Great Lakes tributaries are known to deliver waterborne pathogens from a host of sources. To examine the hydrologic, land cover, and seasonal patterns of waterborne pathogens (i.e. protozoa (2), pathogenic bacteria (4) human viruses, (8) and bovine viruses (8)) eight rivers were monitored in the Great Lakes Basin over 29 months from February 2011 to June 2013. Sampling locations represented a wide variety of land cover classes from urban to agriculture to forest. A custom automated pathogen sampler was deployed at eight sampling locations which provided unattended, flow-weighted, large-volume (120 1630 L) sampling. Human and bovine viruses and pathogenic bacteria were detected by real-time qPCR in 16%, 14%, and 1.4% of 290 samples collected while protozoa were never detected. The most frequently detected pathogens were: bovine polyomavirus (11%), and human adenovirus C, D, F (9%). Human and bovine viruses were present in 16.9% and 14.8% of runoff-event samples (n = 189) resulting from precipitation and snowmelt, and 13.9% and 12.9% of low-flow samples (n = 101), respectively, indicating multiple delivery mechanisms could be influential. Data indicated human and bovine virus prevalence was different depending on land cover within the watershed. Occurrence, concentration, and flux of human viruses were greatest in samples from the three sampling locations with greater than 25% urban influence than those with less than 25% urban influence. Similarly, occurrence, concentration, and flux of bovine viruses were greatest in samples from the two sampling locations with greater than 50 cattle/km(2) than those with less than 50 cattle/km2. In seasonal analysis, human and bovine viruses occurred more frequently in spring and winter seasons than during the fall and summer. Concentration, occurrence, and flux in the context of hydrologic condition, seasonality, and land use must be considered for each watershed individually to develop effective watershed management strategies for pathogen reduction.

J	Jing, YY; Zhang, YC; Hu, MQ; Chu, Q; Ma, RH				Jing, Yuanyuan; Zhang, Yuchao; Hu, Minqi; Chu, Qiao; Ma, Ronghua			MODIS-Satellite-Based Analysis of Long-Term Temporal-Spatial Dynamics and Drivers of Algal Blooms in a Plateau Lake Dianchi, China	REMOTE SENSING												Algal blooms in eutrophic lakes have been a global issue to environmental ecology. Although great progress on prevention and control of algae have been made in many lakes, systematic research on long-term temporal-spatial dynamics and drivers of algal blooms in a plateau Lake Dianchi is so far insufficient. Therefore, the algae pixel-growing algorithm (APA) was used to accurately identify algal bloom areas at the sub-pixel level on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data from 2000 to 2018. The results showed that algal blooms were observed all year round, with a reduced frequency in winter-spring and an increased frequency in summer-autumn, which lasted a long time for about 310-350 days. The outbreak areas were concentrated in 20-80 km(2) and the top three largest areas were observed in 2002, 2008, and 2017, reaching 168.80 km(2), 126.51 km(2), and 156.34 km(2), respectively. After deriving the temporal-spatial distribution of algal blooms, principal component analysis (PCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA) were applied to explore the effects of meteorological, water quality and human activities. Of the variables analyzed, mean temperature (T-mean) and wind speed (WS) were the main drivers of daily algal bloom areas and spatial distribution. The precipitation (P), pH, and water temperature (WT) had a strong positive correlation, while WS and sunshine hours (SH) had a negative correlation with monthly maximum algal bloom areas and frequency. Total nitrogen (TN) and dissolved oxygen (DO) were the main influencing factors of annual frequency, initiation, and duration of algal blooms. Also, the discharge of wastewater and the southwest and southeast monsoons may contribute to the distribution of algal blooms mainly in the north of the lake. However, different regions of the lake show substantial variations, so further zoning and quantitative joint studies of influencing factors are required to more accurately understand the true mechanisms of algae in Lake Dianchi.					ma, rong/GVU-3096-2022; Hu, Minqi/MSZ-3308-2025															2072-4292				NOV	2019	11	21							2582	10.3390/rs11212582	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11212582													WOS:000504716700123

The increased concentration of total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP) affects high concentrations of chlorophyll (Chl-a) in freshwater ecosystems, which causes the process of eutrophication of the waters of shallow lakes. Eutrophication, as an alarming threat to the global quality of surface waters, affects environmental degradation. This research assesses the risk of eutrophication caused by chemical oxygen demand (COD), TN, TP, Secchi disk (SD), and Chl-a using the trophic level index (TLI) in Palic and Ludas lakes. Both lakes have been nominated as potential Natura 2000 areas in 2021 because they belong to important bird areas, and Ludas Lake has the status of Ramsar site 3YU002. In the research period from 2011 to 2021, the results showed that the lake is in an extremely eutrophic state. Laboratory analyses indicate an increased concentration of Chl-a during autumn. In the paper, the normalized difference chlorophyll index (NDCI) was calculated using the Google Earth Engine platform, and the result indicates the loading of the lake throughout the year, with an emphasis on winter, summer, and autumn. By using satellite images and remote sensing, it is possible to determine the most degraded spots, which is a help to the researchers in choosing the places where the samples will be taken and thus act more efficiently on the most endangered parts, as well as reduce the costs of standard in situ methods.

We found that k decreased with increasing lake depth. Adjusting k to the lake depth (k(adj)), we observed that k(adj) was positively related to spring NO3-N concentrations, but this relationship became insignificant at mean lake depths exceeding 12.5 m. A relationship between k(adj) and spring NO3- N concentrations in lakes shallower than 12.5 m implies that changes in spring NO3-N concentrations influence the NO3- N loss rate and thereby summer NO3- N concentrations. Time series from one Estonian, one German, and 14 Swedish lakes shallower than 12.5 m since 1988 revealed that May to August NO3-N concentrations have decreased over time everywhere, and the number of time periods exhibiting a NO3-N depleted condition, i.e., NO3-N levels below 10 mu g L-1, in these lakes has tripled since 1988. We explained the decreasing NO3-N concentrations by a reduction in external nitrogen loading including atmospheric deposition, and by changes in climate. The observed prolongation of NO3- N depleted conditions might be one possible explanation for the increasing occurrence of nitrogen- fixing cyanobacteria in a variety of lake ecosystems.

J	POMEROY, PP				POMEROY, PP			ZOOPLANKTON IN LOCH-LOMOND - PERSPECTIVES, PREDATION AND POWAN	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Published and unpublished accounts of the zooplankton community of Loch Lomond are reviewed. Loch Lomond's zooplankton community is unique amongst those of Scotland's other large lochs. Holopedium gibberum appeared in Loch Lomond in the years between the studies of Slack & Hamilton in the 1950s and zooplankton surveys in the late 1970s. The annual cycles of Eudiaptomus gracilis, Cyclops strenuus abyssorum and Mesocyclops leuckarti are described for the mid basin of Loch Lomond. E. gracilis overwinter mainly as adults with variable egg production during their lifespan of 5-8 months. The cyclopoid copepods have variable life history characteristics. C. str. abyssorum produce a single generation per year, overwinter by means of resting eggs and a small population of planktonic adults, while M. leuckarti is present in the plankton throughout the year, but in low numbers during winter. Zooplankton populations in Loch Lomond are predated by the diverse fish community which includes a facultative planktivore in the powan, Coregonus lavaretus. Powan feed heavily on zooplankton from late spring until late autumn. Powan display selectivity in the prey species taken, in the size distribution and morph types taken within prey species. Zooplankton species, morphs and forms in Loch Lomond tend to reflect this predation.					pomeroy, patrick/C-1597-2010														0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP 30	1994	290	1-3					75	90		10.1007/BF00008955	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008955													WOS:A1994PN96700012

The 28-day volume weighted mean concentrations of several pesticides, including gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), endosulfan, hexachlorobenzene, chlordane, and DOE, showed significant seasonal trends. For current-use pesticides (enclosulfan and gamma-HCH), their concentrations peaked in late spring to summer just after their agricultural application. For the banned pesticides, higher concentrations were observed in the winter due to their enhanced partitioning to particles and scavenging by snow. Long-term decreasing trends were observed for several pesticides such as gamma-HCH and DOE. On the other hand, beta-HCH showed significant increasing concentrations as a function of time at Brule River, Eagle Harbor, and Sleeping Bear Dunes. Generally, Chicago had the highest concentration of chlordanes, dieldrin, and DDT, indicating that urban areas could be a source for these compounds to precipitation. For gamma-HCH and endosulfans, Point Petre had the highest concentrations due to the application of these pesticides in the surrounding areas.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				APR 1	2006	40	7					2135	2141		10.1021/es051861g	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es051861g								16646444					WOS:000236691600024

CO2 content was measured by degasing the CO2 from water. The CO2 level is a very sensitive indicator for a low pollution in oxygen saturated waters. Clean running waters have a CO2 content close to the air saturation of 0.1-0.3 mg C l(-1). Ground water and springs are rich in CO2. Polluted waters are characterised by higher CO2 contents, also organic pollution can result in high values of CO2. Carbon dioxide concentration of streams and brooks is limited by re-aeration. The headwater region (softwater) of the River Ilm is unsaturated, the hard water in the middle- and underflow is oversaturated. In summer and autumn high saturation could be found, but without autochthonous calcite precipitation like in hard water lakes.																			0075-9511					DEC	2003	33	4					359	372		10.1016/S0075-9511(03)80030-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0075-9511(03)80030-0													WOS:000188696500013

The model integrates the effects of lake morphometry, total phosphorus concentration (TP), and initial O2 concentrations at spring turnover to predict mean end-of-summer O2 concentration within individual hypolimnetic strata. Lake morphometry exerts a large influence on O2 profiles and this influence is particularly evident in shallow (<20 m -maximum depth) oligotrophic lakes. Predictions of O2 profiles are sensitive to changes in TP concentrations, with all study lakes predicted to have severely O2-depleted hypolimnions by the end of summer at an epilimnetic TP of only 15 mug.L-1.

The spatial and temporal characters of NO2 over the North-South Transect of Northeast Asia (NSTNA) was analyzed using monthly averaged tropospheric NO2 column densities from GOME and SCIAMACHY measurements taken from April 1996 to December 2010. In addition to NO2 (1996-2010) column densities data, land-cover data and characters of NO2 concentration over different ecosystem have been analyzed over the NSTNA. The results indicated that the tropospheric NO2 column densities over the region show distinct regional and seasonal variation characteristics for between 1996 and 2009. The highest concentration was in winter and lowest in autumn. The data also presents zonal distribution and decreasing from northern to southern. Under the influence of the urbanization process, the highest NO2 column densities appeared at cities and metropolitan areas which are located in the north plain of China and the southern areas of the NSTNA. Moreover the lowest column densities appeared at the northern areas of the NSTNA. The tropospheric NO2 column densities have shown significant differences over other ecosystems. In addition, the higher NO2 column density was found over forest and grass land while lower values over lake, tundra and semi-desert. There are different characteristics in five land use types along with the NO2 column densities increasing year by year. The highest values appeared in winter over the forest, grass, lake and tundra while in summer over the semi-desert.

UNUSUAL WINTERING DISTRIBUTION AND MIGRATORY BEHAVIOR OF THE WHOOPING CRANE (GRUS AMERICANA) IN 2011-2012	WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												The last, self-sustaining population of Whooping Cranes (Grus americana), the Aransas-Wood Buffalo population, has overwintered almost exclusively along the Gulf Coast of Texas, USA, in and around the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge during recent decades. In late autumn and winter 2011-2012, Whooping Cranes were observed several hundred kilometers from coastal wintering grounds, with at least 13 Whooping Cranes in central Texas, south-central Kansas, and central Nebraska from November 2011 to early March 2012. Notably, family groups of Whooping Cranes were observed around a Texas reservoir, Granger Lake, over a 3-month period. An extreme drought, coupled with record warm temperatures in the southern and central United States, may have interacted to influence behaviors and distributions of Whooping Cranes during winter 2011-2012. Such observations suggest that Whooping Cranes may be more opportunistic in use of wintering habitat and/or more likely to re-colonize inland historical sites than previously thought. Continued documentation of Whooping Cranes overwintering in areas other than the Texas coast and/or altering timing of migration will be important for protection and management of additional winter habitat as well as for informing population estimates for the Aransas-Wood Buffalo Population of Whooping Cranes.																			1559-4491	1938-5447				MAR	2014	126	1					115	120		10.1676/13-071.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1676/13-071.1													WOS:000333573100015
J	LARRIVEE, L; BLOKPOEL, H				LARRIVEE, L; BLOKPOEL, H			SEASONAL DISTRIBUTION AND SITE FIDELITY IN GREAT-LAKES CASPIAN TERNS	COLONIAL WATERBIRDS												We analysed 1,126 recoveries of Caspain Terns (Sterna caspia) from 1 January 1962 to 30 June 1986. Birds had been banded in their hatching year at colonies in the Great Lakes from 1959 to 1982. Adults (age .gtoreq. 2.5 years) summer on the Great Lakes in June and July, winter in the southern Atlantic and Gulf Coast states and the Caribbean Basin from November to March, and migrate, between their summer and winter ranges in April-May and August-October. Juveniles (age 0-6 months) use the same migration routes as adults i.e. the American Atlantic Coast and possibly the Mississippi Flyway, and winter in the same areas as adults. Immatures (age 6-18 months) apparently spend all four seasons on the adult winter range. Recoveries of sub-adults (age 18-30 months) during June and July included both the Great Lakes and the adult winter range while recoveries in other seasons were similar to those of adults but also included areas not normally associated with Great Lakes'' Caspian Terns. We suggest that sub-adults have a greater tendency to wander than the three other age groups. We analysed interchanges of adults among the Great Lakes region and the two other major banding regions (> 5000 chicks banded) in North America as well as interchanges as adults among individual lakes of the Great Lakes and among 10'' X 10'' blocks were birds had been banded. Great Lakes'' birds showed a high degree of site fidelity. However, there was some exchange of adults between colonies in Washington and California.

Microcystin diversity in a Planktothrix rubescens population from Lake Albano (Central Italy)	TOXICON												The cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens Anagnostidis & Komarek (previously Oscillatoria rubescens DC ex Gomont) is present in several Italian lakes and it is known to produce cyanotoxins. The dynamics and toxin production of P. rubescens population in Lake Albano, a volcanic crater lake in Central Italy, has been studied for 5 years (January 2001-April 2005). Winter-spring superficial blooms with frequent scums were observed every year. Total microcystin (MC) levels were measured from April 2004 to October 2005 by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. MC levels up to 14.2 mu g/l were measured, with high concentrations found in summer at a 20-25 in depth. The intracellular toxin content varied between 1.5 (surface, January 2004) and 0.21 pg/cell (surface, May 2004). Six different MCs were detected, the most abundant being two desmethyl-MC-RR isomers. Of the 13 water wells monitored in the Lake Albano area, two of them showed MC contamination during winter, confirming the ability of these toxins to migrate through groundwater towards public water sources. These results highlight the need for further studies on the mobility and fate of these pervasive cyanobacterial toxins. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Feeding patterns and population structure of an invasive cyprinid, the rudd Scardinius erythrophthalmus (Cypriniformes, Cyprinidae), in Buffalo Harbor (Lake Erie) and the upper Niagara River	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Feeding patterns and population structure of the non-native rudd Scardinius erythrophthalmus (Linnaeus) were examined to understand their ecology in Buffalo Harbor and the Niagara River. We hypothesized that (1) the diet of rudds would be omnivorous, but contain greater proportions of macrophytes in summer months, (2) feeding intensity would increase with water temperature, and (3) condition and growth would be similar to other populations. We collected rudds with a variety of gears in 2009 to test these hypotheses, and used data from 2007 to 2010 seining surveys to determine if the relative abundance of young-of-the-year rudd differed among sites with different flow conditions. Rudds were mostly herbivorous; they consumed aquatic macrophytes in summer and supplemented their diet with algae and fish in spring and fall. Feeding intensity was positively correlated with water temperature, but significantly reduced during spawning. Rudd condition and growth were greater than estimates from other populations, suggesting increases in abundance and range expansion are possible. Furthermore, reproduction was successful at lotic sites but very poor at sites without measureable flow, contrary to the paradigm of optimal rudd habitat. Research is needed to understand how herbivory by abundant rudd populations affects native aquatic communities.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2012	693	1					169	181		10.1007/s10750-012-1106-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-012-1106-0													WOS:000306066400013
J	Albrecht, A; Goudsmit, G; Zeh, M				Albrecht, A; Goudsmit, G; Zeh, M			Importance of lacustrine physical factors for the distribution of anthropogenic 60Co in Lake Biel	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The fate of particle reactive substances in a surface aquatic system is controlled by both geochemical and physical parameters. Scavenging processes in Lake Biel (Switzerland) have been studied using the anthropogenic tracer (60)Co. This isotope originates mostly in dissolved form from the Muhleberg nuclear power plant and is transported 18 km down by the River Aare to the lake. Radionuclide data from sediments, combined with inventory calculations, indicate that between 30% and 55% of the discharged (60)Co is transferred to sediments. Scavenging efficiency is higher during the winter period than during summer, in spite of higher particle fluxes during the summer. An intrusion model, based on buoyancy calculations, predicts that Aare water, including its radionuclide load, remains in the epilimnion during the warm period; thus, mixing is restricted to only a fraction of the lake volume and the residence time is reduced to 1 week. Buoyancy in the summer is controlled mostly by temperature. During winter, when the lake and Aare waters are close to 4 degrees C, the higher dissolved load of Aare watts increases its density and forces it to intrude into deeper sections of the lake, increasing the residence time and thus the time available for adsorption and particle settling. The predictive capability of the model was tested for the summer period using a fluorescent dye (uranin) to track Aare water from the inflow to the outflow of the lake. Higher fluxes of both particles and associated radionuclides in deep sediment traps confirm the results of the intrusion model for the winter period. Comparison between modeled and measured (60)Co activities in lake water at the end of the winter validates the credibility of the intrusion model further. This combined geochemical and physical approach may be applied to transport modeling of radionuclides and of any particle reactive substance, inorganic or organic.																			0024-3590					JAN	1999	44	1					196	206		10.4319/lo.1999.44.1.0196	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1999.44.1.0196													WOS:000078378300018

The water transfer to downstream in a catchment is often carried out during the non-growing season, due to the competitive water use between the upper and middle reaches and lower reaches of rivers. However, the impacts and mechanism of artificial water transfer on vegetation and wetland ecosystem restoration have not been thoroughly investigated, especially in northwest China. Taking the Qingtu Lake wetland system in the lower reaches of the Shiyang River Catchment as the study area, this study analyzed the spatial and temporal distribution surface area of Qingtu Lake and the surrounding vegetation coverage before and after water transfer, by interpreting remote sensing data, the variation of water content in the vadose zone, and the groundwater level by obtaining field monitoring data, as well as the correlation between the water body area of Qingtu Lake and the highest vegetation coverage area in the following year. The conclusion is that there is a positive correlation between the water body area of Qingtu Lake in autumn and the vegetation coverage in each fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) interval in the next summer, especially in terms of the FVC of 30-50%. The groundwater level and soil water content increase after water transfer and remain relatively high for the following months, which suggests that transferred water from upstream can be stored as groundwater or soil water in the subsurface through surface water and subsurface water interaction. These water sources can provide water for the vegetation growth the next spring, or support plants in the summer.																				2072-4292				AUG	2020	12	16							2516	10.3390/rs12162516	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12162516													WOS:000565441500001

Waterbird response indicates floodplain wetland restoration	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Despite extensive anthropogenic degradation of most wetlands and other aquatic habitats associated with large rivers in the Midwest, the region still supports continentally important numbers of waterbirds during autumn and spring migration; however, few data exist to evaluate wetland restoration success and identify thresholds where changes in management may be necessary to meet conservation targets. We tracked waterbird response to restoration of a historical floodplain wetland complex along the Illinois River during 2007-2013 relative to waterbird use of other wetlands and floodplain lakes in the region. Dabbling ducks and other waterbirds showed dramatic responses to restoration, each accumulating more than 3 million use-days/year and comprising more than 30% of the total waterbird use-days in the Illinois River Valley during autumn and spring migrations. We identified use that was strongly disproportionate to availability within the region for several waterbird taxa and documented nesting by several species of conservation concern. Many species and foraging guilds of waterbirds [e.g., American coot (Fulica americana), dabbling ducks (Anatini)] responded rapidly to wetland restoration, continued to use Emiquon Preserve regardless of changing conditions at reference sites, and showed relatively limited temporal variation, thereby demonstrating their utility as indicators of habitat conditions and restoration trajectory.

J	ARVOLA, L				ARVOLA, L			VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION OF PRIMARY PRODUCTION AND PHYTOPLANKTON IN 2 SMALL LAKES WITH DIFFERENT HUMUS CONCENTRATION IN SOUTHERN FINLAND	HOLARCTIC ECOLOGY												Vertical distribution of primary production and phytoplankton was studied in a polyhumic brownwater lake and in an oligo-mesohumic lake. During summer both lakes were thermally, chemically and biologically stratified. In the brownwater lake primary production was restricted to the uppermost layer of 1-1.5 m of epilimnion. In the oligo-mesohumic lake noticeable primary production was detected down to depths of 2-3 m. The ice-free period primary production was about 20% higher in the oligo-mesohumic lake, though occasionally the surface production was 2-3 times higher in the brownwater lake. Epilimnetic total P and total N concentrations were higher in the brownwater lake, while nitrate-nitrite, ammonium and phosphate concentrations were very low in both lakes. Phytoplankton was confined to the uppermost productive layer in the brownwater lake. In the oligo-mesohumic lake phytoplankton was distributed more evenly, though the mean maximum biomass was at the depth of 3-4 m. Below the oxic water layer biomass decreased abruptly in both lakes. In the oligo-mesohumic lake chlorophyll [chl] concentration was extremely high (max. 320 mg chl a m-3) in the anoxic hypolimnion, due to green sulfur bacteria. Flagellated chlorophytes and chrysophytes dominated in the brownwater lake; in spring Chlamydomonas species, followed by Mallomonas caudata. In the oligo-mesohumic lake small coccal green algae, such as Oocystis, Scenedesmus and Westella-like species, dominated in mid-summer, and chrysophytes and cryptomonads in autumn.

Summer and Migrational Movements of Satellite-Marked Double-crested Cormorants from a Breeding Colony Managed by Egg-Oiling in Lake Ontario, USA	WATERBIRDS												A two-year satellite telemetry study was initiated in May 2000 at a Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) breeding colony on Little Galloo Island (LGI) in eastern Lake Ontario, New York, USA, which is managed by egg-oiling. The objective was to describe cormorant (N = 26/year) movements, specifically during the period of reproductive management by egg-oiling and seasonally (breeding, migration and wintering). Egg-oiling at two-week intervals resulted in a hatch success on LGI of 5.7% for 2000 and 2001, combined. The majority (97%) of core use areas of marked cormorants contained LGI throughout three egg-oiling treatments (six weeks), and 71% still contained LGI by the end of the final (fourth) treatment (eight weeks). Of cormorants that moved during or after control activities, three remained in the vicinity of active breeding colonies for over three months. Cormorants initiated fall migration over a 16-week period ranging from 12 July to 29 October, with a mean departure date of 6 September (N = 24, SE = 8 days) over both years. Mean duration of fall migration was 34 days (N = 19, SE = 7 days, range = 108 days). Most (75%) cormorants captured at LGI migrated east of the Appalachian Mountains, and their winter range extended from southeastern Louisiana, along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, to the southern portion of the Atlantic coast. Although three (13%) cormorants over both years relocated to other active colonies for long enough periods (over three months) to potentially raise young, this study indicates that control efforts did not result in complete abandonment of LGI. Egg-oiling was successful in reducing recruitment within breeding seasons, and within-breeding-season renesting attempts by cormorants in this study were limited and likely unsuccessful. Further evaluation and refinement of egg-oiling as a management tool will require multiyear monitoring of the LGI cormorant breeding colony.

N2O production at the sediment surface was the most important source in this lake and led to an accumulation in the hypolimnion during summer stratification. Highest rates of N2O emission to the atmosphere (24 mu mol m(-2) d(-1)) were observed after the onset of winter overturn, when hypolimnetic water enriched in N2O came in contact with the atmosphere. During summer stratification N2O emissions to the atmosphere decreased to similar to 4 mu mol m(-2) d(-1). The winter fluxes are close to the highest reported N2O emissions from marine systems.					; Wehrli, Bernhard/A-4406-2013	Gachter, Rene/0000-0002-7186-8574; Wehrli, Bernhard/0000-0001-7029-1972													0024-3590					MAY	1996	41	3					548	553		10.4319/lo.1996.41.3.0548	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1996.41.3.0548													WOS:A1996UW65700018

At Douglas Point, Lake Huron, 1975, mean density varied less, range 108-671/10,000 m3. At both sites fish densities were generally greatest in the shallowest, 3-5 m, depths. At Nanticoke, where the nearshore has low relief, there were no distinguishable communities. At Douglas Point, where depth increases rapidly offshore, there was evidence of benthic and pelagic communities. There was no evidence of altered fish distribution in relation to temperature. At Nanticoke there was no vertical variation in temperature and no vertical response was expected. At Douglas Point there was thermal stratification present in the summer and there was no apparent response. The influence of incidence radiation was uncertain because of the effects of diurnal migrations. At both locations fish were clustered horizontally to varying degrees in the spring and fall; in the summer fish were distributed more evenly. Densest clusters were usually in the vicinity of the turbulent discharge at both locations. The lack of temperature response and the similarity of Nanticoke with situations at nearby streams on Lake Erie suggest that the fish are responding to currents and perhaps topography.

The seasonal diversity and composition of photosynthetic picoeukaryotes (PPEs) in Lake Poyang were investigated from flow-cytometry-sorted samples using MiSeq high-throughput sequencing. Flow cytometric counting indicated that PPEs accounted for 97% of the total picophytoplankton abundance in spring, reaching a maximum value of 6.30 x 10(4) cells mL(-1). PPEs in Lake Poyang showed lower diversity than those in other investigated lakes in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and were dominated by one OTU (66.29%) affiliated with Mychonastes (Chlorophyceae). Other minor classes of PPEs were found to be sporadically abundant in specific seasons, i.e. Chrysophyceae prevailed in spring and summer, while Eustigmatophyceae was mainly present in winter. This study reports coccal green algae of Mychonastes in Lake Poyang; additionally, these algae are reportedly representative of the prominent plankton in this river-connected lake ecosystem but are often overlooked due to their lack of morphological features. Finally, the sequencing results from the sorted samples of Lake Poyang revealed that the proportion of PPEs was quite low, with an average of 36% of total reads. Many OTUs belonging to heterotrophic picoeukaryotes were also identified in the sorted samples, most of which were affiliated with terrestrial fungi, including Basidiomycota and Ascomycota. The spores of these fungi can disperse in the aquatic environment during the flood seasons, yet their effect on PPEs is still unclear.

Gizzard shad, inland silversides, river carpsuckers, and five minnow species were all caught in significantly different numbers in shoreline seining samples taken in day as opposed to night.

The experiment began on June 17, 1980 and ended on Oct. 27, 1981. Total bacteria and respiring bacteria were measured using the INT-formazan reduction technique and aerobic heterotrophic bacteria were measured by the plate count procedure. Throughout the experiment there were no significant differences in any of these counts when the aerated and control enclosures were compared. In the deep (8, 12 and 14 m) samples, total and percent respiring bacteria were not related to O2 concentrations, but both changed with season. Despite these results, hypolimnetic O2 demand was much greater (0.5-0.9 mg l-1 .cntdot. day-1) in the aerated enclosure than in the control which contained almost no O2. Aerator designs apparently must include substantial allowances for induced O2 demand. INT-formazan reduction technique might be unable to detect the increased bacterial activity caused by the addition of O2 to hypolimnetic water. The enclosures did not receive any air during the winter and the enclosure that received summer aeration suffered from winter kill; however, the control showed a normal O2 profile. This suggests that summer aeration creates an abnormally high winter O2 demand so that winter aeration may also be necessary.																			0003-9136						1984	99	4					498	514																WOS:A1984SL44500008

Na (range, 0.8-2.7% dry wt.) and K (range, 1.4-3.3% dry wt.) were the dominant elements in the submersed stem. The dominant element in the floral spike was Ca (range, 2.4-4.1% dry wt.) and in the roots was Fe (range, 2.8-8.0% dry wt.). Na concentrations were greater in the submersed stem (range, 0.8-2.7% dry wt.), relative to the roots (range, 0.5-0.9% dry wt.) and floral stem (range, 0.3-1.1% dry wt). Pb concentrated in the roots significantly more (range, 0.0040-0.0115% dry wt.), than in other plant parts (range, 0-0.0037% dry wt.). The submersed stem had spring or summer peaks in ash, P, Na, K, Ca, Mg and Zn content, whereas Fe and Mn exhibited late winter to early spring peaks.

Particularly, suspended solids input and intrusion dynamics in downstream lakes are affected by dam operations. In a case study, size-dependent particle budgets for peri-alpine Lake Brienz ( Switzerland), downstream of major hydropower installations, were determined for a recent 8-year period ( 1997-2004) and compared to hypothetical no-dam scenarios based on numerical simulations. For this purpose, current tributary particle loads, as well as lake-internal sedimentation and turbidity dynamics, were assessed with in situ measurements. The analysis shows that hydropower damming drastically diminishes particle fluxes and minimizes ( short-term) peak discharges. Reductions of high-flow events substantially cut the number of deep intrusions increasing particle supply to the lake surface layer. Furthermore, these hydropower operations shift particle inputs from summer to winter. As a consequence, such peri-alpine lakes become more turbid during winter and less turbid during summer, influencing the seasonal light regime and subsequently the dynamics of phytoplankton growth.

However, the trophic role of abundant small ciliates (<20 <mu>m) is not clearly understood. To unveil their trophic linkages, we conducted two experiments manipulating both top-down and bottom-up controlling factors, thus modulating the trophic cascading and bacterial prey availability for protists during contrasting spring and summer seasons with samples collected from a freshwater meso-eutrophic reservoir. Water samples were size fractionated to modify food web complexity, i.e., 10 mu m, 20 mu m, and unfiltered control and amended with bacterial prey additions. The samples were analyzed by morphological and sequencing techniques. The bacterial amendments triggered strong ciliate growth following the peaks of HNFs in the 10 and 20 mu m treatments, reflecting a trophic cascading from HNFs to raptorial prostome ciliates (Balanion planctonicum and Urotricha spp.) in spring. In summer, HNFs and ciliates peaked simultaneously, suggesting the important trophic cascade also from bacteria to bacterivorous scuticociliates (Cyclidium glaucoma and Cinetochilum margaritaceum) and HNFs. In spring, unfiltered treatments showed stronger ciliate top-down control by zooplankton than in summer. The sequence analysis revealed season-specific manipulation-induced shifts in ciliate communities and their large cryptic diversity. However, morphological and molecular analyses also revealed considerable discrepancies in the abundance of major ciliate taxa. The ciliate communities responded to our experimental manipulations in season-specific fashions, thereby highlighting the different roles of ciliates as an intermediate trophic link between prokaryotes and higher trophic levels.

Each year, the Yellow River carries a significant amount of sediment into the semi-enclosed Bohai Sea, results in a prolonged high concentration of total suspended matter in the offshore areas of the Yellow River Estuary. This study focuses on the offshore region of the Yellow River Estuary in China. Utilizing Sentinel-2 satellite imagery data from 2020 to 2023 and in-situ measured data from August 2020 to August 2022, to address the lack of physical mechanisms currently studied in machine learning retrieval methods, a model that integrates the physics-driven Quasi-Analytical Algorithm (QAA) and data-driven Random Forest (RF) is employed for the retrieval of total suspended matter concentration in the study area. The fused model (QAA-RF) is compared and analysed against regression models and standalone machine learning models. The results indicate that the accuracy of machine learning retrieval models is consistently higher than that regression models. The QAA-RF model demonstrates the highest accuracy (R2 = 0.87, MAE = 5.01 mg L-1, RMSE = 6.39 mg L-1). Based on the QAA-RF model and the imagery data, monthly total suspended matter concentration is conducted in the study area. The retrieval results indicates that: (1) the total suspended matter concentrations is primarily concentrated in the near estuary region, with concentrations decreasing as distance from the estuary increases. (2) the total suspended matter concentration exhibits a distribution pattern with higher values in spring and winter, and lower values in summer and autumn. (3) the concentration of total suspended matter shows relatively small fluctuations at the annual scale from 2020 to 2023.

J	Webb, A; Wilson, KA; Lasley-Rasher, R				Webb, Amy; Wilson, Karen A.; Lasley-Rasher, Rachel			Juvenile Alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) Movement and Residency in a Northern Temperate Estuary	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Information on juvenile alewife use of estuaries is limited on the east coast of North America. In this study, we collected juvenile alewife from the Penobscot River estuary, Maine, and measured stable isotope values from their muscle and liver tissues, which have a low and high turnover rate (respectively). These values were compared to the stable isotope values of preferred prey taxa collected from three distinctly different isotopic habitats within the Penobscot River watershed to estimate the amount of time fish had spent in the estuary. Fish were collected in spring, summer, and autumn in 2013 and 2014 at seven fixed collection sites in the estuary, from four freshwater lakes, and from five bay locations. Based on the delta C-13 values of muscle and liver tissue, estuarine caught juvenile alewife were assigned to one of the following distinctly different isotopic habitat groups: freshwater transient (recently from freshwater), bay transient (recently from the bay), or estuarine occupant (spent extended time in the estuary). Stable isotope ratios of nitrogen (for all samples) and sulfur (in muscle tissues of a subset of 17 samples) were analyzed to confirm habitat group designations. Bay transients had 37% and 15% higher sulfur and nitrogen isotope ratio values than estuarine occupants and five times more sulfur and almost two times more nitrogen isotope ratio values than freshwater transients. Of 88 juvenile alewife analyzed for carbon isotopes, 32% were identified as estuarine occupants that had spent extended time periods in the estuary, whereas 68% of juvenile alewife had recently moved from bay or freshwater habitats. Mean number of days that juvenile alewife spent in the estuary was highest in spring and declined over time, with more movement occurring in autumn. This result suggests that movement of juvenile alewife between bay and estuary occurs frequently from May to October. Juvenile alewife may use estuarine and nearshore habitats for extended time periods, and migration between estuarine and bay habitats may not follow typical life history strategies.																			1559-2723	1559-2731				MAY	2024	47	3					851	864		10.1007/s12237-024-01333-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-024-01333-y		FEB 2024											WOS:001169167700001

It covers a region that is highly diverse, ranging from almost virgin mountain zones to densely urbanized areas and mining zones. These contrasts have a strong impact on rivers and their ecosystems. Based on two sampling campaigns (summer 2014, spring 2015), we investigated the longitudinal water quality pattern along the Selenga and its tributaries in Mongolia. While headwater regions typically had a very good water quality status, wastewater from urban areas and impacts from mining were found to be main pollution sources in the tributaries. The highest nutrient concentrations in the catchment were found in Tuul River, and severely elevated concentrations of trace elements (As, Cd, Cu, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn), nutrients (NH4+, NO2-, NO3-, PO43-), and selected major ions (SO42-) were found in main tributaries of Selenga River. Moreover, trace element concentrations during spring 2015 (a time when many mines had not yet started operation) were markedly lower than in summer 2014, indicating that the additional metal loads measured in summer 2014 were related to mining activities. Nevertheless, all taken water samples in 2014 and 2015 from the main channel of the Mongolian Selenga River complied with the Mongolian standard (MNS 1998) for the investigated parameters.					; Kappas, Martin/B-2597-2017; von Tümpling, Wolf/H-9032-2013; Karthe, Daniel/AAS-5562-2020; Pfeiffer, Martin/GXV-7101-2022	von Tumpling, Wolf/0000-0003-1815-4764; Kappas, Martin/0000-0002-3173-4870; Karthe, Daniel/0000-0003-0288-0593; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				AUG	2017	189	8							420	10.1007/s10661-017-6123-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-017-6123-z								28755155					WOS:000411359000001

However, the effect of submerged plants on phytoplankton communities and their photosynthetic activity in situ are still poorly understood. Here, we studied the response of phytoplankton community structure and fluorescence parameters to different submerged plants coverage, the relationship of phytoplankton community and fluorescence parameters with submerged plants coverage and water physicochemical parameters were analysed in sampling area of Hangzhou West Lakes. The results showed that the coverage and biomass of sub-merged plants were negatively correlated with nitrogen and phosphorus contents in water body but positively correlated with total phenol content. The ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus in the study site changed greatly (32.25-124.54). In spring and summer, Oscillatoria and Leptolyngbya (Cyanophyta) were the dominant species, while in autumn and winter, the dominant species were Cyclotella (Chlorophyta), and Melosira and Cymbella (Bacillariophyta). Compared with Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta, fluorescence parameters of Cyanophyta were more sensitive to total phosphorus, N:P ratio, total phenols, pH, and electric conductivity. Fluorescence pa-rameters of Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta were only affected by underwater light. Total phosphorus (TP) and N:P had a negative effect on the maximum photochemical electron yield of Cyanophyta. Furthermore, Cyano-phyta was inhibited by total phenols from submerged plants. When phytoplankton were under stress, photo-chemical electron yield decreased significantly, whereas non-photochemical quenching increased. The structural equation model showed that the coverage of submerged plants might indirectly affect the fluorescence param-eters of Cyanophyta by affecting nitrogen, phosphorus, and total phenol contents in the water body. These findings contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the impact of submerged plant resto-ration on phytoplankton community dynamics in subtropical eutrophic shallow lakes and provide a theoretical basis for the management of lakes.

J	Morgan, DKJ; Hicks, BJ				Morgan, Dai K. J.; Hicks, Brendan J.			A metabolic theory of ecology applied to temperature and mass dependence of N and P excretion by common carp	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Our study used a metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) to explore scaling of metabolic rates by body size and temperature, and to predict nutrient excretion by common carp (Cyprinus carpio). At high biomasses, common carp have negative impacts on water quality, and one mechanism is excretion of the nutrients N and P. We measured whole-body and mass-specific excretion rates during summer and winter for fish of different sizes (wet mass range 28-1,196 g) to produce an allometric scaling model capable of predicting excretion at different temperatures. We found positive relationships between both dissolved and total nutrient concentrations and fish wet mass in summer and winter, with greater excretion rates in summer (mean water temperature 24.2A degrees C) than in winter (mean water temperature 9.2A degrees C). Mass-specific excretion rates decreased with increasing fish size, consistent with the MTE, and the temperature-adjusted model explained more variation for N excretion than for P. The proportion of dissolved nutrients (NH4 and PO4) to total nutrients increased with increasing fish size. The significance of these models is that they can be used to predict population-based nutrient excretion by common carp when thermal history, fish density and size distribution in a water body are known.

J	Grover, JP; Chrzanowski, TH				Grover, JP; Chrzanowski, TH			Limiting resources, disturbance, and diversity in phytoplankton communities	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												Phytoplankton diversity, limiting resources, and disturbance were studied in two reservoirs, Eagle Mountain Lake (EML) and Joe Pool Lake (JPL), in north Texas, USA, for three summer growing seasons and two winters. Availabilities of phosphorus, nitrogen, and silicon were measured as chemical concentrations, and availability of light was measured as irradiance during the photoperiod, averaged over the depth of the surface mixed layer. A resource was defined as limiting whenever its availability fell below a threshold, treated as a parameter to be fitted. Depth of the surface mixed layer and wind speed were taken as indices of disturbance associated with episodic mixing. Hydrological disturbance was gauged by rainfall, inflow, and the variation of lake level. We found that diversity was strongly and significantly correlated with the number of limiting resources in one lake (JPL), but not the other (EML). The onset of nitrogen and phosphorus limitation during the summer growing season is associated with increased phytoplankton diversity in JPL. Regression modeling detected decreasing relationships between diversity and disturbance indices in one lake (JPL), but concave-down relationships in the other (EML), though the peaks of these relationships did not lie within the usual range of disturbance. Predictive regressions for diversity incorporating both limiting resources and disturbance were partitioned into unique and shared effects of these factors. There was a large unique effect of the number of limiting resources in JPL, but otherwise the shared effects were large relative to unique effects.

Particularly susceptible to S-scab are those parts of the shoot which resprout again later in the year after having formed the terminal bud (''summer shoots''). In general, an increased number of attacks towards the top of the shoots could be observed. The rate of germination of conidia found on S-scab in spring was normally around 12%, however, 50 and 60% were measured with conidia originating from ''summer shoots''. Observations of trichomes give rise to the supposition that V. inaequalis can live and overwinter on and inside the trichoms. All important apple cultivars of the area of Lake Constance as well as of other apple growing areas with different climatic conditions (Altes Land and South Tirolia) regularly show infections with S-scab. Trees with S-scab showed a significantly higher rate of leaf scab shortly after bud burst.																			0340-8159					APR	1995	102	2					171	183																WOS:A1995RB06200009
J	Spence, C; Rausch, J				Spence, C; Rausch, J			Autumn synoptic conditions and rainfall in the subarctic Canadian Shield of the Northwest Territories, Canada	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Autumn precipitation is important to the annual water budget and spring streamflow magnitude in the subarctic Canadian Shield portion of the Mackenzie Basin in northwestern Canada. The objective of this study is to improve understanding of the synoptic mechanisms generating this autumn precipitation by investigating a wet (1998) and a dry (1999) autumn over a portion of this region north of Great Slave Lake. Seven synoptic map patterns were identified using a hybrid manual-revised Kirchhofer correlation methodology. Cyclones were found to be the most important map pattern providing autumn rainfall. These cyclones tend to occur 2 to 3 days following the presence of a low in the Gulf of Alaska near the Aleutian Islands. The results of this study corroborate past research that shows Pacific atmospheric moisture transported inland provides the source for much of the cyclonic rainfall in the Mackenzie Basin. Aleutian lows, which encourage this transportation, were as common in 1998 as in 1999, but the mechanisms necessary to transfer moisture to the North Great Slave region were more entrenched in 1998 than in 1999. Winds along storm tracks through the region were weaker and more dispersed in 1999. In addition, conditions for cyclogenesis in the region were less favourable in 1999.

J	COMITA, GW; ANDERSON, GC				COMITA, GW; ANDERSON, GC			THE SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT OF A POPULATION OF DIAPTOMUS-ASHLANDI MARSH, AND RELATED PHYTOPLANKTON CYCLES IN LAKE WASHINGTON	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The development of a Diaptomus ashlandi population and the simultaneous phytoplankton cycles in Lake Washington, Seattle, were studied in samples taken from Oct. 1949 to Oct. 1950. The lake is 8762 ha in area and 65.2 m deep in its deepest part. Temperature measurements showed that stratification began late in March, and the surface maximum of 22.2[degree] occurred late in Aug. Typically the epilimnion was 10 m deep, the thermocline 10 m, and hypolimnion 40 m. Chemical determinations showed the lake to be slightly alkaline usually, but during the summer months the pH was above 8.0. Alkalinity ranged from 0.246 to 0.524 mev/l. Phosphate determinations showed a winter maximum and summer minimum in the surface and 15 m water, with an accumulation in the bottom waters as summer progressed. Dissolved O2 was abundant, but in the hypolimnion was depleted at the rate of 2.0 mg/cm2/month during the summer. Cell volume and chlorophyll measurements showed that a phytoplankton bloom occurred in spring and another in lake August. The taxonomic composition of these is presented. The Diaptomus ashlandi population was found to be monocyclic. The period of greatest sexual activity was noted by counting the number of females carrying spermatophores. By this measure transfer of spermatophores lasted for approximately 6 months starting in Jan. and continuing through July with the peak occurring in April, but egg production occurred from Oct. to the following Aug., with the largest pulse occurring from mid-Jan. to mid-March. These eggs developed into the nauplius stages which lasted until mid-June. Development through the copepodid stages was traced to Oct. 28 at which time the single annual cycle was complete. Six nauplius and 6 copepodid stages were noted in the life cycle. The approximate time required for all the nauplii to undergo their development was 75 days. For the copepodids, I and II together required 65 days; III, 40 days; IV, 84 days; V, 90 days; and VI, 5 to 6 months. Study of separate hauls from the epilimnion and hypolimnion showed that the epilmnion was the site of most of the activity of D. ashlandi during the period of growth and metamorphosis in the summer. A coefficient of correlation was computed for chlorophyll concentration and mean number of eggs/sac in the epilimnion. This was 0.598, which was significantly different from zero at the 1% level. Metasome measurements were made on all the copepodids. These showed that the period of maximal size for the adult females occurred from June to Sept. 1950. This increase in size began just as the peak of phytoplankton had passed. The summer females were found to be significantly larger than the winter females at the 1% level. Study of the sex ratios showed that females were in excess for much of the year, although males were in excess for as long as 3 months (April, May, June).																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1959	4	1					37	52		10.4319/lo.1959.4.1.0037	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1959.4.1.0037													WOS:A1959WY36200003
J	Frisch, D				Frisch, D			Dormancy, dispersal and the survival of cyclopoid copepods (Cyclopoida, Copepoda) in a lowland floodplain	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The survival of cyclopoid copepods was investigated in a floodplain for 2 years where flooding occurred during the cold season. The cyclopoid community was studied in three waterbodies with distinct hydroperiods: a permanent pond connected to the flooded area during inundation, a temporary pool that is part of the flooded area and an isolated temporary pool. 2. Field studies, including data obtained from samples of water, sediment and soil, showed the overall predominance of species with a summer diapause over those with a winter diapause or without diapause. Emergence of cyclopoid copepods at the onset of flooding, examined using emergence traps and data from recently filled or still isolated temporary pools, showed that some species can survive several months of drying. 3. The ability of the diapausing fourth copepodid stages of Cyclops strenuus and C. insignis , the two cyclopoids most abundant during winter and spring flooding, to survive terrestrial conditions was tested in laboratory experiments. Both species survived for several months, but rates differed among the species. A higher percentage of C. strenuus survived for a longer period, possibly explaining why this species was relatively more abundant in more temporary habitats. 4. Both dormancy and dispersal facilitated survival of cyclopoid copepods in transient habitats connected to each other during flood periods. Dormancy was the most important survival strategy, whereas dispersal could be more important following prolonged periods without flooding.					; Frisch, Dagmar/F-6363-2012	Frisch, Dagmar/0000-0001-9310-2230; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				JUL	2002	47	7					1269	1281		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00865.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00865.x													WOS:000176171000006

The two ends of the oxbow lake are bordered by settlements, and near them there are open water areas where fishing is the major utilization form. Between the two open water areas we find a protected area with a large aquatic plant coverage and two transition zones towards the open water areas. The oxbow lake receives periodic water replenishment only at one end from one of the open water areas. During summer-due to the lack of rain-the water of the oxbow lake is used for irrigation in the surrounding arable land, so the water level fluctuation can be significant in the riverbed. Our study was performed within a vegetation period of spring, early summer, mid-summer, and fall. In connection with the ecological classification of a smaller water body, studies on the physical and chemical properties of the water and the composition of the algal plankton are usually carried out in few places and relatively infrequently. The characteristics of a water body are also influenced by seasonal changes, which can be the changes in the extent of vegetation coverage, the way land is used and the possibility of water replenishment, to which the algal community usually responds with changes.

J	PROKES, M				PROKES, M			GROWTH OF PIKE (ESOX-LUCIUS) LARVAE AND JUVENILES IN THE MUSOV-RESERVOIR	FOLIA ZOOLOGICA												The results of research are presented dealing with the dynamics and seasonality of the growth of young pike (Esox lucius L.) in the upper Musov Reservoir (Nove Mlyny man-made lake system, Southern Moravia, Czech Republic) during 1981, 1982 and 1985. The growth was expressed and mutually compared by means of polynomic curves. The relationships between different types of measured lengths and the length-weight relationship were analysed by means of linear and geometric regressions. A high growth intensity was found in pike fry during the spring and summer periods and the mean relative increments of total length fluctuated in successive months from 1.43 to 1.85 mm . d-1. During the autumn period the growth rate slowed down and reached only 0.33 mm . d-1 in October. The mean total length reached 257.3 mm at the end of October. An evident mutual relation was found between the degree of morphological development, ecology and ethology of the fry during two periods with distinct changes of the growth rate, occurring at total lengths of 20 and 45-50 mm. The growth patterns of the pike fry, compared with other species studied on the same locality (pike-perch, perch, roach, rudd), was characterized by a much higher growth rate and longer growth season.

J	Demars, BOL; Edwards, AC				Demars, B. O. L.; Edwards, A. C.			A seasonal survey of surface water habitats within the River Spey basin, Scotland: major nutrient properties	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												1. Current monitoring strategies of governmental organizations tend to be focused on relatively large flowing and standing waters, and until recently those polluted by point sources. Consequently areas of high conservation interest tend to be understudied, and defining reference conditions, as required by current legislation, is difficult to achieve. 2. In order to address this imbalance, water samples have been collected and analysed once in each of four seasons during 2003 from 72 locations within a 100 km(2) area of the oligotrophic River Spey catchment in NE Scotland. The sampling design included examples of running water (headwater streams and the main rivers) and standing water (lochs, lochans, pools, ditches, backwaters, bogs). Attitude ranged from 220 to 980 in and incorporated a climatic regime from cool temperate to subalpine. Each sampling campaign targeted low-flow conditions to evaluate steady-state nutrient concentrations. 3. Concentrations of the major soluble nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus demonstrated high spatial and temporal variability, with soluble organic and molybdate unreactive forms generally being dominant. Concentrations of ammonium-N, nitrate-N and soluble reactive phosphorus were extremely small, with 50% of samples falling below 8, 5 and 1 mu g L-1, respectively, during spring and summer. 4. Sampling sites were grouped either by water-body type or by the properties of their immediate biophysical zone. Together these two groupings explained 33-38% of the variance in water chemistry. Certain changes were detectable across most habitats and biophysical zones. 5. A decline in the concentration of nitrate that occurred in reaches downstream from certain headwater streams draining the mountain areas indicated the potential for its within-stream utilization. Inorganic N dynamics differed between small streams and large rivers. 6. Landscape scale patterns were recorded in spring and summer nutrient availability with inorganic N and P thresholds (arbitrarily defined) of 10 and 1 mu g L-1, respectively.

J	Yokoyama, A; Park, HD				Yokoyama, A; Park, HD			Depuration kinetics and persistence of the cyanobacterial toxin microcystin-LR in the freshwater bivalve Unio douglasiae	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY												We carried out uptake and depuration experiments in the laboratory to investigate the effects of temperature (15degreesC and 25degreesC) on the depuration kinetics and persistence of a cyanobacterial toxin, microcystin-LR (MCYST-LR), in a freshwater bivalve, Unio douglasiae. Bivalves were fed toxic Microcystis cells in the 15-day uptake experiment and nontoxic diatoms in the following 15-day depuration experiment. Each bivalve's hepatopancreas was lyophilized and extracted with a butanol:methanol:water solution for analysis of MCYST-LR by high-performance liquid chromatography. The toxin in the organ accumulated rapidly after the beginning of the uptake experiment and reached approximately steady-state conditions on day 5 at concentrations of 130 +/- 11 mug g(-1) dry weight at 15degreesC and 250 +/- 40 mug g(-1) at 25degreesC. In the depuration experiments MCYST-LR was eliminated asymptotically from the tissue. The values of the depuration rate constant (k(d)), calculated with a first-order one-compartment model, were found to be 0.142 +/- 0.044 day(-1) at 15degreesC and 0.226 +/- 0.046 day(-1) at 25degreesC. The depuration Q(10) value from 15degreesC to 25degreesC equaled 1.6. This study was the first to reveal the kinetics of depuration for MCYST-LR in a bivalve. The results show that MCYST-LR may be eliminated slowly in autumn and winter and persist in the tissue until spring. Thus, in terms of toxicokinetics, the risk to people of being poisoned by bivalves would increase if toxic blooms occur in autumn.

J	Cui, BL; Li, XY				Cui, Bu-Li; Li, Xiao-Yan			Stable isotopes reveal sources of precipitation in the Qinghai Lake Basin of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The use of isotopic tracers is an effective approach for characterizing the moisture sources of precipitation in cold and arid regions, especially in the Tibetan Plateau (TP), an area of sparse human habitation with few weather and hydrological stations. This study investigated stable isotope characteristics of precipitation in the Qinghai Lake Basin, analyzed moisture sources using data sets from NCEP-NCAR, and calculated vapor contributions from lake evaporation to the precipitation in the basin using a two-component mixing model. Results showed that the Local Meteoric Water Line (LMWL) was defined as delta H-2=7.86 delta O-18 + 15.01, with a slope of less than 8, indicating that some non-equilibrium evaporation processes occurred when the drops fell below the cloud base. Temperature effects controlled delta O-18 and delta H-2 in precipitation in the basin, with high values in summer season and low values in winter season. Moisture in the basin was derived predominantly from the Southeast Asian Monsoon (SEAM) from June to August and theWesterly Circulation (WC) from September through May. Mean while, the transition in atmospheric circulation took place in June and September. The SEAM strengthened gradually, while the WC weakened gradually in June, and inversely in September. However, the Southwest Asian Monsoon (SWAM) did not reach the Qinghai Lake Basin due to the barrier posed by Tanggula Mountain. High d-excess (>10 parts per thousand) and significant altitude and lake effects of delta O-18 in precipitation suggested that the vapor evaporated from Qinghai Lake, strongly influenced annual precipitation, and affected the regional water cycle in the basin distinctly. The monthly contribution of lake evaporation to basin precipitation ranged from 3.03% to 37.93%, with an annual contribution of 23.42% or 90.54 mm, the majority of which occurred in the summer season. The findings demonstrate that the contribution of evaporation from lakes to atmospheric vapor is fundamental to water cycling on the TP. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, seasonally persistent chemoclines have never been documented. We collected seasonal profiles of temperature and specific conductance and placed temperature sensor chains in two lakes for similar to 1 year to explore whether these lakes remain stratified through seasonal mixing events and what factors contribute to their stability. The results indicate that all lakes are predominantly thermally stratified and are prone to mixing in isothermal periods during spring and fall. Despite brief, semi-annual erosion of thermal stratification, Deming Lake showed no signs of complete mixing from 2006-2009 and 2019-2022 and is likely meromictic. However, the other lakes are not convincingly meromictic. Geochemical data indicate that water in Budd Lake, which contains the most water, is predominantly sourced from precipitation. The water in the other three lakes is of the calcium-magnesium-bicarbonate type, reflecting a source of water that has interacted with the deglaciated landscape. delta 18 O H 2 O and delta 2 H H 2 O measurements indicate the lakes are supplied by precipitation modified by evaporation. Josephine, Arco, and Deming lakes sit in a valley with likely permeable sediments and may be hydrologically connected through wetlands and recharged with shallow groundwater, as no streams are present. The water residence time in meromictic Deming Lake is short (100 d), yet it maintains a large reservoir of dissolved iron, indicating that shallow groundwater may be an additional source of water and dissolved ions. All four lakes develop subsurface chlorophyll maxima layers during the summer. All lakes also develop subsurface oxygen maxima that may result from oxygen trapping in the spring by rapidly developed summer thermoclines. Documenting the mixing status and general chemistry of these lakes enhances their utility and accessibility for future biogeochemical studies, which is important as lake stratification and anoxia are becoming more prevalent due to changes in climate and land use.

The coupling to weather conditions and potentially influencing factors, such as water temperature, light conditions, and stratification were evaluated. During the warm period the ice cover period was considerably shorter and the ice breakup about one month earlier than in the cold period. The decrease in thickness and duration of snow cover resulted in considerably better light conditions during winter, favouring phytoplankton growth under the ice. The nitrate concentrations were much lower in late winter during the warm period. There were elevated phosphate and ammonium concentrations in the hypolimnion during August. Significantly higher phosphate and chlorophyll a levels were noticed in autumn during the warm period, compared to the cold period.					; Weyhenmeyer, Gesa/Y-6135-2019	Blenckner, Thorsten/0000-0002-6991-7680; 													0018-8158					NOV 15	2003	506	1-3					75	81		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008582.61851.76	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008582.61851.76													WOS:000188455600011

A phenomenological approach shows a high coherence of warming patterns in dimictic aquatic systems across latitude	MARINE BIOLOGY												To predict the coherence in local responses to large-scale climatic forcing among aquatic systems, we developed a generalized approach to compare long-term data of dimictic water bodies based on phenomenologically defined hydrographic events. These climate-sensitive phases (inverse stratification, spring overturn, early thermal stratification, summer stagnation) were classified in a dual code (cold/warm) based on threshold temperatures. Accounting for a latitudinal gradient in seasonal timing of phases derived from gradients in cumulative irradiation (2.2 days per degree latitude), we found a high spatial and temporal coherence in warm-cold patterns for six lakes (84 %) and the Baltic Sea (78 %), even when using the same thresholds for all sites. Similarity to CW-codes for the North Sea still was up to 72 %. The approach allows prediction of phase-specific warming trends and resulting instantaneous or time-delayed ecological responses. Exemplarily, we show that warming during early thermal stratification controls food-web-mediated effects on key species during summer.					; Petzoldt, Thomas/C-6198-2009; Hülsmann, Stephan/N-3889-2018; Paul, Rüdiger/ABG-3698-2020; Hulsmann, Stephan/K-9146-2015	Berendonk, Thomas/0000-0002-9301-1803; Petzoldt, Thomas/0000-0002-4951-6468; Wagner, Annekatrin/0000-0003-2159-9609; Sachse, Rene/0009-0000-8889-0551; Hulsmann, Stephan/0000-0002-9569-7626													0025-3162	1432-1793				NOV	2012	159	11			SI		2543	2559		10.1007/s00227-012-1934-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-012-1934-5								24391280					WOS:000310586900015

Surface sediments hosted 10(3)10(5) akinetes mL(1) and 10(2)10(4) Microcystis colonies mL(1). Sediments from deeper areas close to dam accumulated 2-fold (Microcystis) and 11-fold (akinetes) greater concentrations than those at the shallower upstream areas. Anabaena spp. and Microcystis aeruginosa dominated the sediment pool, with minor amounts of akinetes of Aphanizomenon (Aph. flos-aquae, Aph. gracile) and benthic Nostocales (Cylindrospermum, Nostoc and Trichormus). Our study confirms the dual benthic-pelagic overwintering of Anabaena, Aphanizomenon and Microcystis, found in the pelagial at 7.59.8C. This study also provides an insight into the little known annual cycle of potential cyanotoxin-producers Aph. gracile and Anabaena circinalis. Our estimates show that: (i) only a small fraction (1) of the sediment pool of akinetes and Microcystis was resupended in the bottom water during winter which, however, may be sufficient inocula to build up the summer maxima under realistic in situ growth rates; and (ii) the time required for the development of summer populations is mainly driven by growth rates, and therefore by the environmental conditions faced by the inoculum, with a lower influence (although greater for Microcystis than for Nostocales) of the inoculum size.

More particularly, seasonal patterns of rodent abundance and infestation rate with I. ricinus ticks as well as the prevalence of B. burgdorferi s.l. and the two species B. garinii and B. afzelii were determined. The studies were carried out in woodlands at Urwitalt near Mikolajki on the Mazury Lakes in 2001. A total of 196 rodents were trapped and 1349 I. ricinus ticks were collected. There was an increase of rodents in the autumn, with a maximum density of C. glareolus in October and in of A. flavicollis in September. The infestation rate of the investigated animals was above 87% and was dependent on the developmental stage of ticks and host species. Only two stages of I. ricinus were found on trapped rodents: larvae 80% and 84.5%, and nymphs 7.5% and 15.5% for C. glareolus and for A. flavicollis, respectively. The average level of infestation with ticks on rodents appears to be seasonally dependent, and decreases from spring to autumn. Both methods of B. burgdorferi s.l. detection, PCR and IFA, showed that larvae collected from both species of infested rodents were infected by these spirochetes. An increase in the infection rates with B. burgdorferi s.l. was observed from spring to autumn from 12.5% to 15.6% for larval ticks collected from C. glareolus, and from 5.6% to 8.8% for ticks collected from A. flavicollis. The infection rates of larvae examined by PCR were 5% in the spring and 8% in the autumn for ticks collected from C. glareolus, and 10% and 5% for ticks collected from A. flavicollis. A total number of 329 ticks were analysed for the detection of genospecies (184 for B. garinii and 145 for B. afzelii). In larvae collected from C. glareolus, B. garinii were found in 3% and B. afzelii in 1.1% of assessed ticks. Conversely, in larvae collected from A. flavicollis the percentage of infected ticks was 1.5% for B. garinii and 1.7% for B. afzelii. The examined ear biopsies were Borrelia positive in 2.5% and 4.3% of the 44 bank voles and 80 yellow-necked mice, respectively. Both species of rodents, highly abounded in the Mazury Lakes district od North-Eastern Poland, may represent significant, seasonally dependent, zoonotic reservoirs of B. burgdorferi s.l.

However, the composition and metabolic capabilities of winter microbial communities are still largely uncharacterized. Here, we sampled the winter under-ice microbiome of the Great Whale River (Nunavik, Canada) and its discharge plume into Hudson Bay. We used a combination of 16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicon analysis and metagenomic sequencing to evaluate the size-fractionated composition and functional potential of the microbial plankton. These under-ice communities were diverse in taxonomic composition and metabolically versatile in terms of energy and carbon acquisition, including the capacity to carry out phototrophic processes and degrade aromatic organic matter. Limnological properties, community composition, and metabolic potential differed between shallow and deeper sites in the river, and between fresh and brackish water in the vertical profile of the plume. Community composition also varied by size fraction, with a greater richness of prokaryotes in the larger size fraction (>3 mu m) and of microbial eukaryotes in the smaller size fraction (0.22-3 mu m). The freshwater communities included cosmopolitan bacterial genera that were previously detected in the summer, indicating their persistence over time in a wide range of physico-chemical conditions. These observations imply that the microbial communities of subarctic rivers and their associated discharge plumes retain a broad taxonomic and functional diversity throughout the year and that microbial processing of complex terrestrial materials persists beneath the ice during the long winter season. IMPORTANCE Microbiomes vary over multiple timescales, with short- and long-term changes in the physico-chemical environment. However, there is a scarcity of data and understanding about the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems during winter relative to summer. This is especially the case for seasonally ice-covered rivers, limiting our understanding of these ecosystems that are common throughout the boreal, subpolar, and polar regions. Here, we examined the winter under-ice microbiome of a Canadian subarctic river and its entry to the sea to characterize the taxonomic and functional features of the microbial community. We found substantial diversity in both composition and functional capabilities, including the capacity to degrade complex terrestrial compounds, despite the constraints imposed by a prolonged seasonal ice-cover and near-freezing water temperatures. This study indicates the ecological complexity and importance of winter microbiomes in ice-covered rivers and the coastal marine environment that they discharge into.

Seasonal and Multiyear Changes in CO2 Degassing at Mammoth Mountain Explained by Solid-Earth-Driven Fault Valving	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Changes in CO2 emissions from volcanoes may evidence volcanic unrest. We use a multiyear time series of CO2 flux collected at the Horseshoe Lake Tree Kill area on Mammoth Mountain, CA, to understand processes that cause variations in flux from this system. Seasonal variations are systematically lowest during the winter months and reach maximum values during the summer season. A persistent similar to 20% reduction in CO2 flux occurred during the Spring of 2017, coincident with the emergence of the area from drought and earthquake swarms in Long Valley Caldera. We used continuous GNSS measurements to calculate seasonal strains and stresses across the Mammoth Mountain area, and resolved resultant stresses onto the Mammoth Mountain Fault, which appears to facilitate gas transport to the surface. The normal stress changes are consistent with seasonal and multiyear changes in CO2 flux, suggesting that fault valving by solid earth processes can alter surface gas fluxes.

Two different invertebrate predators, cyclopoid copepods and Leptodora kindtii, co-existed with Bosmina in the lake. A pattern of seasonal succession of the two species was apparent, with B. fatalis dominant in summer and B. longirostris in spring and fall. The two species also showed different seasonal changes in morphology. During summer, when the density of the invertebrate predator Leptodora was high, B. fatalis changed its morphology and maintained long features, with elongation of the antennules and mucrones. This species also maintained the protruding shape of the antennules by increasing the angles between the antennules and the body, and between two antennules, during the same period. The seasonal differences and magnitude of changes in morphology were more marked for larger individuals. However, such marked development of protruding structures was not observed in B. longirostris, which showed only slight changes in the antennule and mucrone lengths related to the density of copepods. The results suggest that the morphological traits of B. fatalis are a morphological defence against Leptodora, while those of B. longirostris are a response to copepods. In Lake Suwa, the predators show different patterns of seasonal changes in density. Different morphological traits and the resulting interactions with invertebrate predators seem to be important in determining the reciprocal succession of the two Bosmina species.						chang, Kwang-Hyeon/0000-0002-7952-4047													0142-7873					FEB	2003	25	2					141	150		10.1093/plankt/25.2.141	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/25.2.141													WOS:000181403800002

Magnetic susceptibility of loess and paleosols has been used as a proxy indicator for summer monsoon intensity, while the median diameter of quartz isolated from the loess and paleosols has been regarded as a proxy index of the strength of winter monsoon winds that were responsible for most of the dust transport. The eolian quartz flux to Lake Biwa of central Japan during the last 130,000 yr provides direct information on variations of the East Asian winter monsoon; whereas the fluvial quartz flux reflects significant changes in paleoprecipitation over the lake area. The intervals of high eolian quartz flux values during marine oxygen isotope substages 5d and 5b, and stages 4 and 2 correspond to the periods of large quartz median diameter values of the Chinese loess and paleosols, indicating strengthened winter monsoon winds; whereas the intervals of high fluvial quartz flux values during isotope substages 5e, 5c, and 5a, and stages 3 and 1 correlate to the periods of high magnetic susceptibility values of the Chinese loess and paleosols, suggesting increased summer monsoon intensity. Variations in winter monsoon strength indicated by the eolian quartz flux and quartz median diameter proxies bear a general inverse relation to those in summer monsoon intensity inferred from the fluvial quartz flux and magnetic susceptibility proxies.

Contrasting levels of sympatric divergence within lacustrine Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus forms flock: high differentiation between size forms, low differentiation between seasonal races	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The formation of reproductive isolation barriers is fundamental to sympatric speciation. In teleost fishes, an important mechanism for the reduction of gene flow between emerging species and intraspecific forms is the divergence in reproductive strategies, in particular in spawning time. Large time difference between spawning periods of sympatric forms typically provides strong pre-zygotic isolation and rapid genetic and morphological divergence between them. However, our results indicate that it may not always be the case. We investigated genetic divergence between recently discovered autumn-spawning and spring-spawning subpopulations of the small planktivorous Arctic charr form in one of the Transbaikalian lakes using 14 microsatellite loci and found that it was very low (Fst = 0.0028) as compared with their differentiation from a sympatric large piscivorous form (Fst = 0.284-0.301). Charr of these subpopulations manifested subtle differences in morphology and life history and had similar diets. We consider that low genetic, phenotypic and ecological differentiation between autumn and spring spawners of the small form is the result of their incomplete reproductive isolation due to the transformation between them (change of spawning time) in successive generations.

Development of chemical index as a measure of in-stream water quality in response to land-use and land cover changes	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Water pollution in response to accelerated land-use/land cover changes has drawn concerns because of public health and environmental impacts. The study was conducted to evaluate the impact of land use/land cover changes, seasonal, and location on water quality of streams within the Wheeler Lake Basin in northern Alabama. Temporal water samples from 18 streams were randomly collected in 2000 and 2001, processed and analyzed for pH, and total nitrogen (TN), dissolved (Dp), particulate (Pp) and total phosphorus (Tp), dissolved oxygen (DO) and soluble lead (Pb) concentration, employing standard methods of analysis. The data were normalized and integrated into a simple index (WQC(Index)) to evaluate stream water quality. Results showed that the urban proportion of the total watershed basin had increased from 2.9 to 14.7% with an associated loss of agricultural (8.9%) and wetland (4.8%) covers from 1992 to 2000. A change in land-use/land covers in association with seasonal and location variation significantly affected stream water quality. Total nitrogen concentration in stream water had a peak during the summer at 34% above the annual mean. While both Pp and Tp concentrations peaking during the summer at 24% above the annual mean and about 25% below the annual mean during spring, the DO concentrations were 46% above the annual mean during the fall and 18 to 26% below annual mean during summer. The WQC(Index) had responded very seasonal and showed significant identical trends, with 21% degradation in water quality during the summer above the annual mean and improvement during the spring at 20% above the annual mean. Upstream water had a significantly greater Pp and Tp (21 to 28%) concentration than at down- and middle streams water. Location and seasonal variations had significant interactive effects on Pp, Tp and DO concentration of stream water. Total amount of seasonal rainfall significantly accounted 99.6% of the variations in WQC(Index). Increasing seasonal mean relative humidity, air and soil temperature, evaporation and solar radiation had positive relationship with the variations in WQC(Index). Among the water quality parameters, both Pp and Tp were correlated (r(2) = 0.998***) to each other, and accounted for more than 80% variability of the WQC(Index). Highly significant positive linear relationship between Pp and Tp concentration suggested that 99.8% of the P in stream water is in Pp form which probably transported with sediments in surface runoff. In other words, Pp is the main pollutant responsible for degradation of stream water quality in the Wheeler Lake Basin. Routine measurement of either Pp or Tp concentration could be used as sensitive and early indicator of temporal changes in stream water quality even when the other parameters changed negligibly or remain unchanged.

Most of the data were collected during regular surveys of the lake in 1988 and 1989, but considerable use was made of earlier data collected by the author and of information from local farmers. The main emphasis is on the waterbirds, but landbirds occurring regularly in the area are also discussed. The distribution and estimated numbers of the various species of waterbirds are given as well as their seasonal variation in numbers. The numbers of breeding waterbirds are rather small, but numbers increase considerably in autumn due to an influx of migrating birds, with total numbers reaching a few hundred in autumn and early winter. In particular, 50 or more great northern divers stay on the lake in October-December as well as 200-400 red-breasted mergansers. The changes in the avifauna of the area are discussed and possible causes mentioned.																			0030-1299					MAY-JUN	1992	64	1-2					381	395		10.2307/3545060	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3545060													WOS:A1992JG50900023

However, recent studies challenge this convention, suggesting that the winter period is more dynamic than previously thought. In this review, we synthesize the current understanding of under-ice carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) dynamics, highlighting the annual importance of CO2 and CH4 emissions from lakes at ice-melt. We compiled data from 25 studies that showed that the ice-melt period represents 17% and 27% of the annual CO2 and CH4 emissions, respectively. We also found evidence that the magnitude and type of emission (i.e., CO2 and CH4) varies with characteristics of lakes including geographic location, lake morphometry, and physicochemical conditions. The scarcity of winter and spring carbon data from northern lakes represents a major gap in our understanding of annual budgets in these lakes and calls for future research during this key period.					; Baulch, Helen/I-9529-2012; del Giorgio, Paul/AAD-1315-2019	Karlsson, Jan/0000-0001-5730-0694; del Giorgio, Paul/0000-0003-1866-8159; Hampton, Stephanie/0000-0003-2389-4249; Baulch, Helen/0000-0001-9018-4998														2378-2242				JUN	2018	3	3			SI		117	131		10.1002/lol2.10079	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lol2.10079													WOS:000456696200009

A novel oligonucleotide probe, ACIDO228, was designed that covered most sequences of Acidobacteria subdivision 1. The hybridization conditions were optimized using the type strain Acidobacterium capsulatum. The depth distribution and seasonal dynamics of Acidobacteria in the lake and the enclosure were assessed by whole cell hybridization. Sequence analyses and in situ quantification indicated that Acidobacteria accounted for a substantial part of bacterioplankton communities in both compartments. During the summer stratification distinct maxima of acidobacterial abundance were detected in the hypolimnion (up to 13% of total cell numbers), whereas during spring and autumn circulations no clear depth-dependent differences were visible. These data suggest that Acidobacteria thrive best in the hypolimnion, which is characterized by lower temperatures and higher availability of organic substrates. The application of probe ACIDO228 provided quantitative information on the seasonal and depth distribution of Acidobacteria in a lake environment and in particular in a rather extreme habitat, an acidic mining lake.

Benefits of stocking fewer but larger individuals with implications for native fish recovery	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Artificial propagation is commonly used to reduce extinction risk for native, imperiled fish species. Thus, identifying stocking strategies that most effectively augment adult abundance is a critical aspect of successful adaptive management. The threatened June sucker (Chasmistes liorus), endemic to Utah Lake, UT, USA, experienced major declines in abundance following extensive ecosystem degredation. Over 800 000 June sucker were stocked from hatcheries, grow-out ponds, and refuge populations from 1990-2019 across a range of sizes and seasons. Here, we evaluated post-stocking survival of June sucker using a Cormack-Jolly-Seber model with three covariates: size at stocking, origin, and season. Survival was positively correlated with size at stocking, with evidence of a possible size-selective predation threshold between 200 and 300 mm, and spring stocking appeared to produce higher survival rates than summer or fall. We also compared cost and benefit for stocking hatchery-origin June sucker at different sizes, finding that stocking fewer but larger (age-2) individuals was more cost-effective than stocking more but smaller (age-1) individuals. Our results highlight operational changes that can help maximize the efficacy of native fish hatchery programs.

J	KERFOOT, WC				KERFOOT, WC			LONG-TERM REPLACEMENT CYCLES IN CLADOCERAN COMMUNITIES - A HISTORY OF PREDATION	ECOLOGY												Populations of the waterflea Bosmina undergo temporal replacement cycles (seasonal successions of clones or closely-related sibling species) in many modern lakes, where long-featured winter clones are subsequently replaced by short-featured summer clones. Inspection of lake sediment reveals that populations have also undergone long-term replacement. Remarkably well-preserved remains, heavily biased towards summer morphology by production dynamics, document a progressive shift from late-glacial long-featured phenotypes to recent short-featured phenotypes. Several lines of evidence suggest that these long-term substitutions reflect a changing balance between planktivorous fishes and predatory copepods.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1981	62	1					216	233		10.2307/1936683	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1936683													WOS:A1981LM55900024
J	Krause, TR; Whitlock, C				Krause, Teresa R.; Whitlock, Cathy			Climate and vegetation change during the late-glacial/early-Holocene transition inferred from multiple proxy records from Blacktail Pond, Yellowstone National Park, USA	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												A series of environmental changes from late-glacial ice recession through the early Holocene are revealed in a 7000-yr-long record of pollen, charcoal, geochemistry, and stable isotopes from Blacktail Pond, a closed-basin lake in Yellowstone National Park. Prior to 11,500 cal yr BP, cool conditions dominated, fire activity was low, and alpine tundra and Picea parkland grew on the landscape. A step-like climate change to warm summer conditions occurred at 11,500 cal yr BP. In response, fire activity increased facilitating a transition from Picea parkland to closed Pious forest. From 11,500 to 8280 cal yr BP, warm summers and abundant moisture mostly likely from high winter snowfall supported closed Pinus contorta forests. Cooler drier summer conditions prevailed beginning 8280 cal yr BP due to decreased summer insolation and winter snowpack, and lower parkland developed. The timing of vegetation change in the Blacktail Pond record is similar to other low- and middle-elevation sites in the northern Rocky Mountains during the late-glacial period, suggesting local plant communities responded to regional-scale climate change; however, the timing of vegetation changes was spatially variable during the early and middle Holocene due to the varying influences of strengthened summer monsoons and subtropical high on regional precipitation patterns.

Moreover, a heavy metal pollution index (HPI), potential ecological risk index (PERI) and health risk index (HRI) were estimated to assess overall water quality status and associated risk in the study area. In summer, Fe and Cr were above BIS permissible limits whereas, in winter all the metals are within the limits. Highest concentration was observed for Fe and Mn, followed by Zn, Cu, Ni and Cr. Calculated HPI values are below critical index limit of 100. But its value being >30 lies under high class category of HPI in Lost (W1), Damdama (W3) and Basai (W4) wetland, indicating high deterioration, and low-medium HPI in Sultanpur wetland (W2) indicating low deterioration. HI >1 indicates possibility of non-carcinogenic risk to children and adults in W1 and W4, in both summer and winter and in W3 and W4 in summer only, through both ingestion and dermal route. Cancer risk was observed for adults in W1 (2.06), W3 (1.52) and W4 (2.51) in summer only. PERI results suggest low ecological risk based on both degree of contamination and risk index. This study suggests, high HPI and non-carcinogenic risk from certain metals warrants immediate attention towards proper management of these wetlands specially W4.

During that time ponds went from ice-free to > 80 cm thick ice, near-freshwater to hypersaline, well-lit to near darkness and temperatures fell to below zero. Here we examine shifts in biological activity that accompanied these changes. During February, freeze-concentration and ongoing photosynthesis increased dissolved oxygen concentration to up to 100 mg l(-1), with a near-equivalent decrease in dissolved inorganic carbon and a pH rise. Benthic photosynthesis was responsible for 99% of estimated biological oxygen production. Net oxygen accumulation ceased in late February, pH began to fall and inorganic carbon to increase, but the pool of dissolved oxygen was depleted only slowly. Anoxia had been attained in only one pond by April and there was little accumulation of indicators of anaerobic activity. The nitrogen and phosphorus balances of the ponds were dominated by organic forms, which, like DOC and CDOM, behaved conservatively. Conversely, inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus uptake was evident throughout the study period, at a molar ratio of 16N:1P in two of three ponds, consistent with uptake into biological material. We found no coupling between N and P uptake and photosynthesis.					; Sorrell, Brian/L-1351-2013	Safi, Karl/0000-0002-7785-1909; Webster-Brown, Jenny/0000-0001-9665-871X; Arscott, David/0000-0001-5689-2587; Hawes, Ian/0000-0003-2471-6903; Sorrell, Brian/0000-0002-2460-8438													0954-1020					JUN	2011	23	3					243	254		10.1017/S0954102011000058	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954102011000058													WOS:000291050900005

As a consequence, epilimnion P concentrations remain low and water clarity high, resulting in a positive feedback. When perennial charophytes, retaining P all year round, are replaced by vascular macrophytes, P is retained only during summer but rapidly released during decomposition in the autumn and winter. Epilimnion P thus becomes available to phytoplankton in the following growing season, reducing lake water clarity and further shifting plant dominance from bottom-dwelling charophytes to taller vascular species. We tested the hypothesis that changes in lake P concentrations may be partly related to changes in the structure of submerged macrophytes in a deep hardwater lake that experienced a dramatic increase in total P (TP) concentrations over a decade with no evidence of changes in external P loading. We repeatedly measured water transparency, macrophyte maximum colonisation depth (MCD) and abundance between 2008 and 2022 and determined macrophyte tissue P content in 2020 to test whether changes in submerged vegetation could explain gaps in the lake's P budget and shifts in P sink/source functions of littoral areas. In 2008, charophyte communities were dominated by wintergreen Nitellopsis obtusa. The subsequent decline of the species was negatively correlated with the spring TP concentration in the upper water layer (0-20 m) of the lake and positively correlated with Secchi depth and macrophyte MCD, which decreased from 13.5 to 9.5 m. In contrast, the cover of annual vascular macrophytes (mainly rootless hornwort, Ceratophyllum demersum) increased and was positively correlated with P losses from the upper water layer in summer and negatively correlated with Secchi depth and MCD. Budget calculations showed that the littoral zone was a P source during the period when N. obtusa declined. Despite the relatively low contribution of P directly released from lost charophyte biomass, declines of N. obtusa partly explained the temporary P source function of the littoral zone and the increasing P concentrations in the upper water layer at the beginning of May. This was most probably due to the positive effects of charophytes on particle retention and the negative effects on sediment resuspension. Conversely, the growth of C. demersum can explain P losses from the upper water layer, turning the littoral zone into a temporal P sink during summer. However, most of this P is likely to return to the upper water layer during the decomposition of plant biomass after the growing season. In conclusion, our data indicate that replacement of charophytes by submerged vascular plants can facilitate rapid lake eutrophication due to changes in the feedback loop between submerged vegetation, benthic P retention, epilimnion P availability, water transparency, and MCD.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				MAY	2025	70	5							e70051	10.1111/fwb.70051	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.70051													WOS:001498266600009

Information on distribution, foraging patterns, and exposure routes of loons are needed for understanding the physical and ecological factors that contribute to avian botulism outbreaks. Aerial surveys were conducted to document the spatiotemporal distribution of common loons on Lake Michigan during falls 2011-2013. In addition, satellite telemetry and archival geolocator tags were used to determine the distribution and foraging patterns of individual common loons while using Lake Michigan during fall migration. Common loon distribution observed during aerial surveys and movements of individual radiomarked and/or geotagged loons suggest a seasonal pattern of use, with early fall use of Green Bay and northern Lake Michigan followed by a shift in distribution to southern Lake Michigan before moving on to wintering areas. Common loons tended to occupy offshore areas of Lake Michigan and, on average, spent the majority of daylight hours foraging. Dive depths were as deep as 60 m and dive characteristics suggested that loons were primarily foraging on benthic prey. A recent study concluded that round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus) are an important prey item of common loons and may be involved in transmission of botulinum neurotoxin type E. Loon distribution coincides with the distribution of dreissenid mussel biomass, an important food resource for round gobies. Our observations support speculation that energy transfer to higher trophic levels via gobies may occur in deep-water habitats, along with transfer of botulinum neurotoxin.

Of particular concern is the methylated form of mercury, monomethylmercury (MMHg), known for its adverse effects on Human health. Microbial communities play a pivotal role in the formation of MMHg by facilitating Hg methylation and in the demethylation of MMHg, slowing the crossing of toxic threshold concentration in the environment. However, the specific microbes involved still need to be understood. This study aimed to identify the microbial drivers behind changes in Hg speciation (MMHg and Hg) in permafrost thaw lakes and assess the significance of the biotic component in Hg biogeochemistry. Sediment samples from two thermokarst lakes in the Canadian sub-Arctic were collected during the winter and summer of 2022. Gene-centric metagenomics using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was employed to identify key genes involved in mercury methylation (hgcA and hgcB) and demethylation (merA and merB), supported by qPCR analyses. A seasonal decline in microbial diversity, involved in the Hg methylation, and hgcA gene coverage was observed from winter to summer, mirroring patterns in mercury methylation rates. Notably, hgcA sequences were significantly more abundant than merAB sequences, with contrasting seasonal trends. These results indicate a seasonal shift in the microbial community, transitioning from a dominance of mercury methylation in winter to a predominance of mercury demethylation in summer. Environmental drivers of these dynamics were integrated into a conceptual model. This study provide new insights on the microbial processes influencing the Hg cycle in Arctic permafrost undergoing degradation.

J	Hong, XJ; Guo, SL; Xiong, LH; Liu, ZJ				Hong, Xingjun; Guo, Shenglian; Xiong, Lihua; Liu, Zhangjun			Spatial and temporal analysis of drought using entropy-based standardized precipitation index: a case study in Poyang Lake basin, China	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												Drought is a frequent and worldwide disaster causing huge losses in agriculture and damages in natural ecosystems every year. Precise assessment and prediction of droughts are important for regional water resources planning and management. An alternative distribution, based on the entropy theory, was used to derive a unified probability distribution function (PDF) for different cumulative precipitation series to calculate the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). Thirteen meteorological stations located within the Poyang Lake basin with daily precipitation records from 1958 to 2011 were selected for spatial and temporal analysis of basin-scale droughts. The entropy-based distribution is proved to be flexible enough for modeling aggregated precipitation at different time scales by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test. Most severely and extremely dry months were recorded in spring and winter in the Poyang Lake basin over the study period. Negative trends of the short-term entropy-based SPIs and corresponding aggregated numbers of rainy days in spring and autumn are detected based on the Mann-Kendall test, which implies an upgrade in difficulties to mitigate the agricultural droughts in the Poyang Lake basin. Once droughts occurred, regions with less frequent drought would face severer drought degree. The lower Ganjiang River, lower and middle Fuhe River, as well as the Xinjiang River are identified to be the most vulnerable regions with highest drought intensities. Droughts could occur at any periods and move from region to region in the Poyang Lake basin; thus, well preparation for potential droughts is needed.

As an initial step towards understanding the adaptation of Carex growth strategies to seasonal fluctuations in wetland habitats, we investigated the density and composition of C. brevicuspis rhizome populations immediately after flooding (November), in winter (January), in spring (March), and before flooding (May) in the Dongting Lake wetlands, China. The total rhizome density peaked in winter and was lowest before flooding. A large rhizome population in winter may enable C. brevicuspis to survive the seasonal cold weather and recruit a shoot population in the spring. A small rhizome population before flooding may optimize reproductive allocations and be a strategy for enduring the long flooding season. Regardless of date, short rhizomes comprised the majority of the rhizome population (73.0% in March to 98.2% in May). This indicates that C. brevicuspis primarily uses a phalanx growth strategy to utilize locally abundant resources in wetlands. The percentage of long rhizomes in the rhizome population varies significantly between seasons (1.8% in May to 27.0% in March), indicating that growth form also changes with seasonal fluctuation of wetland habitats. The results show that C. brevicuspis may adapt to seasonal changes in wetland habitats through changes in demography of rhizome populations.					; LI, feng/HIR-1703-2022	, Xinsheng/0000-0002-3720-247X; Chen, Xin-sheng/0009-0009-6601-8725; 													0107-055X	1756-1051				APR	2014	32	2					251	256		10.1111/j.1756-1051.2013.00094.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1756-1051.2013.00094.x													WOS:000334799300020

Samples were studied in the fourth of the four interconnected natural lagooning basins of a constructed treatment wetland, developed as an integrated pilot system for the treatment of leachates in a domestic landfill site at Etueffont (Territoire de Belfort, France). The efficiency of the lagooning system was evaluated through physical and chemical parameter measurements over a period of three seasons. Anion/cation and heavy metal concentrations were sampled and analyzed in water flowing into and out of the lagooning basin. Simultaneously, reed and cattail biomass samples (roots/rhizomes, shoots) were collected at both inflow and outflow, and the biomass characteristics were determined. The average above-ground biomass of T. latifolia and P. australis varied, respectively, from 0.41 to 1.81 kg DW m(-2) in the fall, 0.31 to 1.34 kg DW m(-2) in winter, and 0.38 to 1.68 kg DW m(-2) in spring, with significant seasonal variations. The greatest mean concentrations of heavy metals were found in the below-ground plant parts of the two species during the spring season. The average standing stock of heavy metals was higher in the below-ground than in the above-ground phytomass, whatever the season. With the exception of nickel, heavy metal concentrations in the inflow were correlated to the plant content of both species.

J	REIMER, G				REIMER, G			CONTRIBUTIONS ON THE FEEDING-HABITS OF ARCTIC CHAR (SALVELINUS-ALPINUS) IN AUSTRIA	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Chars from seven Austrian lakes (three above the timber line, four in the Austrian lake district Salzhammergut) have been studied. The digestive tract filling in percent of body weight is higher among the dwarfed forms in high-mountain lakes than among better growing populations in lower-laying areas. This is an argument against the theory that dwarfed chars suffer starvation. In Mittlerer Plenderlesse, surface food predominates during the ice-free period; under the ice cover chars feed mainly on aquatic insect larvae. In Oberer Plenderlesee the (summer) food is similar. In Drachensee in summer, more chironomid pupae than surface food are taken up, in winter mainly aquatic insect larvae. In the lakes studied in Salzhammergut, chars tend to feed in summer nearly entirely on crustacean-plankton and chironomid pupae; in winter they take more benthic food. In Hallstattersee, however, they seem to be forced out of the plankton zone by coregonids. Fish are only rarely found in the digestive tract.																			0003-9136						1985	105	2					229	238																WOS:A1985AWV3900007
J	MOORE, JW				MOORE, JW			SEASONAL DISTRIBUTION OF PHYTOPLANKTON IN YELLOWKNIFE BAY, GREAT SLAVE LAKE	INTERNATIONALE REVUE DER GESAMTEN HYDROBIOLOGIE												The factors influencing the seasonal distribution of phytoplankton were determined between July 1975 and Dec. 1977, in Yellowknife Bay, Great Slave Lake. The initiation of the spring bloom occurred during April of each year in response to changing light conditions and despite the 0.degree. C water temperatures. Although the plankton showed some fluctuations in density (100-400 mg/m3) during the summer, there was no vernal decrease in the size of the populations. The end of the growing season was characterized by a sharp drop in numbers near the end of Oct. Multiple regression analysis indicated that changes in the standing crop of the plankton during the summer were primarily related to temperature (r = 0.60) and the concentrations of NO3-N (r = -0.74) and SiO2 (r = -0.82). Changing light conditions probably had little effect on the population during the growing season. Chlamydomonas lapponica was dominant during April of each year. While the growth of this species caused a reduction in the concentrations of total P and NO3-N, the level of SiO2 remained constant and consequently diatoms (Asterionella formosa, Stephanodiscus astraea, Diatoma tenue var. elongatum and Melosira islandica) waved rapidly during May. By June 1st, nutrient concentrations were low, permitting the development of Dinobryon bavaricum and Dinobryon cylindricum. The extremely rapid decrease in the densities of common species during the fall was probably due to the rapid decline in temperature and light levels and the formation of ice on the bay.																			0020-9309						1980	65	2					283	293		10.1002/iroh.19800650214	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19800650214													WOS:A1980KD54700007

Lakes located in regions with average annual negative air temperature are of particular interest because of the presence of two periods with intensive and dynamic processes: the so-called biological summer and the long ice season with the biological spring. Soda Lake Doroninskoe is located in Eastern Transbaikalia (51A degrees 14'N, 112A degrees 14'E) in the permafrost zone in an extreme continental climate, and is covered by ice for seven months per year. The structure and diversity of the microbial communities throughout the water column of the lake was studied by 16S rRNA gene amplicon metasequencing. Different species with specific functions were found to dominate at different depths. Metabolically flexible bacteria with a capacity to switch between anoxygenic photosynthesis and aerobic chemotrophic metabolism dominate in soda Lake Doroninskoe.

However, knowledge about the MC concentrations in plateau lakes experiencing high solar radiation is scarce. This study investigated the spatial-temporal distribution of MCs in eight Yunnan Plateau lakes in China, focusing on their relationships with environmental factors. Water samples (n = 63) were collected during summer and winter seasons and analyzed for MC concentrations along with a suite of environmental variables. Results revealed significant seasonal and spatial variations in MC concentrations, with higher levels in eutrophic lakes Dianchi, Erhai, and Xingyunhu. Notably, mean MC concentrations in Lake Dianchi during summer and Erhai during winter exceeded the World Health Organization's provisional guideline of 1 mu g/L for drinking water. Seasonal analyses revealed distinct regulatory mechanisms: MC concentrations in summer were positively correlated with total phosphorus, total nitrogen, turbidity, and chlorophyll a, reflecting the influence of eutrophication on cyanobacterial growth. While solar radiation intensity (SRI) exhibited a dual role: moderate SRI in winter was associated with higher MC levels, whereas higher SRI in summer suppressed MC production, likely due to photoinhibition or MC degradation. Strikingly, water temperature showed no significant correlation with MC concentrations, suggesting that high solar radiation in the Yunnan Plateau may override temperature-dependent effects on cyanobacterial growth. These findings highlight the importance of nutrient management and the regulatory role of solar radiation in regulating MC production in high-altitude lakes. The study underscores the need for region-specific strategies to mitigate cyanobacterial risks, particularly in drinking water source lakes, by integrating nutrient control and the unique light regime of plateau ecosystems.					; Paerl, Hans/ABE-7384-2020; Yang, Wenyu/AGT-4256-2022; Sun, Yanfeng/GWV-0549-2022; macisaac, hugh/AAE-3742-2020; Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019	Wood, Susanna/0000-0003-1976-8266; 													2833-8278					2025 JUL 10	2025										10.1021/envhealth.5c00123	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/envhealth.5c00123		JUL 2025											WOS:001526048600001
J	KAWAGUCHI, H				KAWAGUCHI, H			PHOTOCHEMICAL FORMATION OF SINGLET OXYGEN IN LAKE WATERS	NIPPON KAGAKU KAISHI												Steady-state concentrations of singlet oxygen ([1O2]ss) in two Japanes lake waters were determined by using 2,5-dimethylfuran as a trapping agent. Under solar-simulated irradiation (300 W xenon lamp + pyrex 7740 glass), surface values of [1O2]ss were (2.1-6.3) x 10(-14) mol.dm-3 in the Kitagata lake waters (eutrophic lake) and (2.1-4.0) x 10(-14) mol.dm-3 in the Bushu lake waters (origotrophic lake). In both lakes [1O2]ss increased with increasing COD measured by permanganate method during spring and summer, and decreased with decreasing COD during fall and winter (Tables 1, 2). The correlation coefficients between [1O2]ss and COD were 0.87 for the Kitagata lake, 0.75 for the Bushu lake and 0.90 for the whole data (Fig. 1). In the Kitagata lake waters, the fractions in the molecular weight range 500-10000 and lower than 500 exhibited large contributions (> 40%). On the other hand, the fractions in the molecular weight range higher than 10000 exhibited a large contribution in the Bushu lake waters (> 40%). The values of [1O2]ss of all fractions of both lake waters in July were larger than those in February but the percentage contribution of each fraction did not appreciably change in both months (Tables 3, 4). Quantum yields for formation of singlet oxygen (phi-1O2) in both lake waters showed a decrease with increasing wavelength. phi-1O2 ranged from 0.009 to 0.018 in the Kitagata lake waters and from 0.002 to 0.010 in the Bushu lake waters, respectively (Fig. 3). Half-lives (t1/2) of chlorophenols by singlet oxygen induced decomposition in the top meter of the Kitagata lake were estimated (Table 6).																			0369-4577					MAY	1991		5					520	525		10.1246/nikkashi.1991.520	http://dx.doi.org/10.1246/nikkashi.1991.520													WOS:A1991FQ08800032

Seasonal and inter-annual variations in methyl mercury concentrations in zooplankton from boreal lakes impacted by deforestation or natural forest fires	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												We compared the effects of natural and anthropogenic watershed disturbances on methyl mercury (MeHg) concentration in bulk zooplankton from boreal Shield lakes. MeHg in zooplankton was monitored for three years in nine lakes impacted by deforestation, in nine lakes impacted by wildfire, and in twenty lakes with undisturbed catchments. Lakes were sampled during spring, mid- and late summer. MeHg in zooplankton showed a seasonal trend: concentrations were the lowest in spring, then peaked in mid-summer and decreased in late summer. Over the three study years, MeHg concentrations observed in mid-summer in zooplankton from forest harvested lakes were significantly higher than in reference and fire-impacted lakes, whereas differences between these two groups of lakes were not significant. The pattern of distribution of MeHg in zooplankton during the different seasons paralleled that of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which is known as a vector of Hg from watershed soils to lake water. Besides DOC, MeHg in zooplankton also showed a positive significant correlation with epilimnetic temperature and sulfate concentrations. An inter-annual decreasing trend in MeHg was observed in zooplankton from reference and fire-impacted lakes. In forest harvested lakes, however, MeHg concentrations remained higher and nearly constant over three years following the impact. Overall these results indicate that the MeHg pulse observed in zooplankton following deforestation by harvesting is relatively long-lived, and may have repercussions to the accumulation of MeHg along the food chain. Therefore, potential effects of deforestation on the Hg contamination of fish should be taken into account in forest management practices.

D.; Seppa, Heikki; Sonninen, Eloni			Sediment isotope tracers from Lake Saarikko, Finland, and implications for Holocene hydroclimatology	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Multi-component isotopic analyses on a sediment core from Lake Saarikko, Finland, give insight into Holocene climate changes in northern Europe. Oxygen isotopic records from aquatic cellulose and authigenic carbonate reflect consistent, similar trends in hydrological balance, and are employed jointly to infer relative changes in lake water temperature. Other geochemical and isotopic tracers shed light on fluctuations in lake level and nutrient cycling, facilitating the interpretation of the oxygen isotopic archives. In the early Holocene (similar to 10 000-9000 cal yr BP), the lake level was low and dry conditions prevailed despite low temperatures. Higher lake levels and depleted oxygen isotopic values similar to 9000-7500 cal yr BP were probably caused by several factors: higher effective humidity, an isotopically depleted precipitation source, a cold event around 8300 cal yr BP, and increased spring snowmelt. In contrast, higher summer temperatures, lower effective humidity, lower lake levels and enriched oxygen isotopic values were experienced during the mid-Holocene similar to 7500-3300 cal yr BP. The occurrence of the warmest inferred lake water and the most enriched cellulose oxygen-isotope values similar to 6000-5000 cal yr BP is consistent with a summer temperature maximum inferred from other proxy sources from the region. The late Holocene was characterized by higher effective humidity and higher lake levels. Increase in spring snowmelt and colder temperatures, most likely related to the Little Ice Age, induced a drastic change in the lake hydrology and probably caused the formation of its present outlet similar to 800 cal yr BR Changes in the lake hydrological balance and climate variables inferred from oxygen isotopic records can be related to atmospheric circulation, most clearly to changes in the dominance and strength of westerly air-flow as well as summertime anticyclonic circulation.

The aim of the present study was to investigate metal concentrations in sediments and plants, sources of metal origin, and contamination level in Uchalli Wetland Complex. Sediment samples were collected from 15 randomly selected sites. Metal concentrations (Cd, Pb, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cr, As, Mn) in sediments and macrophytes were determined during summer and winter seasons using the inductively coupled plasma technique. Metal concentrations in sediments during summer and winter seasons were in the order as follows: As > Mn > Zn > Cr > Ni > Cd > Pb > Cu and As > Mn > Zn > Cr > Ni > Pb > Cd >Cu respectively. All analyzed metals were within European Union (EU) limits. In macrophytes, these metals were in the order as follows: Mn > As > Ni > Zn > Cr > Cd > Cu > Pb and As > Mn > Zn > Ni > Cr > Cd > Pb during summer and winter seasons respectively. Contamination degree (C-d) (1.023-5.309) for these lakes showed low contamination during both seasons; mC(d) values (below 1.5) showed very little contamination degree, while the pollution load index (0.012 to 0.0386) indicated no metal pollution in these lakes. PCA applied on sediment showed that Pb, Zn, Cr, Cu, and Cd had anthropogenic sources of origin. As and Mn were due to natural processes while Ni could be resultant of both anthropogenic and natural sources.

Metal concentrations in the water were higher in summer, whereas in sediment they were higher in autumn, except for lead. In fish tissues, the trend in the mean metal concentrations was: Zn > Fe > Sr > Mn > Cu > Cr > Cd approximate to Pb approximate to Ni for gills and muscle. Gills and liver showed greater accumulation than muscle and bones, while bones were subjected to concentrations of metals known to interact with calcium such as Mn, Sr and Zn. The tissues accumulated essential metals such as Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn and Sr, which are also found in high concentrations in both sediment and water. However, roach tissues are less suitable for Cd, Pb and Ni exposure, as high levels were measured in both sediment and water but not detected at all in fish tissues. Thus, a combination of physico-chemical and biological analysis is a goodway to screen overall environmental circumstances. The roach may therefore be useful as a bioindicator for assessment of metal pollution, though this issue requires further study. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Afanasyeva, EL				Afanasyeva, EL			Life cycle of Epischura baicalensis Sars (Copepoda, Calanoida) in Lake Baikal	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS					6th International Conference on Copepoda	JUL 29-AUG 03, 1996	OLDENBURG, GERMANY					Epischura baicalensis Sars is a dominant pelagic species of Lake Baikal zooplankton. This is endemic to Lake Baikal and inhabits the entire water column. It produces two generations per year: the winter-spring and the summer. These copepods develop under different ecological conditions and vary in the duration of life stages, reproduction time, maturation of sex products and adult males and females lifespan. The total life period of the animals from each generation is one year. One female can produce 10 egg sacks every 10-20 days during its life time. The ratio of males and females is 1:1. One of the most essential features of the ecology of E. baicalensis is the alteration of its mass inhabited areas during a year, as well as in day time. This is due to the need for various conditions for gonad maturation, reproduction, nourishing and protection from being consumed by planktivors. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Although the direct influence of eutrophication on biogeochemical processes of HOCs in waters has been well addressed, the indirect influence of eutrophication on biogeochemical processes of HOCs remains largely unknown. Here we take the large shallow eutrophic Lake Taihu in China and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as examples to provide novel knowledge on the indirect influence of eutrophication on air - water exchange fluxes, sinking fluxes, and occurrence of HOCs. The air - water exchange fluxes of individual PAHs varied dramatically at different sites in all studied seasons. The sinking flux of Sigma PAH(16) was 14 855.3 +/- 1579.9, 3548.9 +/- 650.6, and 5588.4 +/- 530.7 ng m(-2) d(-1) in spring, summer, and winter. The corresponding concentration of Sigma PAH(16) in surface sediments was 713.1 +/- 78.6, 339.7 +/- 36.6, and 293.0 +/- 35.2 ng g(-1) d.w. Our study for the first time suggested that recruitment of cyanobacteria from surface sediments to water column in spring reduced the concentrations of PAHs in surface sediments, but enhanced their concentrations in the bulk water column, and overwintering of cyanobacteria in winter enhanced the concentrations of PAHs in surface sediments. High pH induced indirectly by eutrophication decreased seasonal air - water exchange fluxes (enhanced net volatilization) of PAHs, reduced the aromaticity of surface sediments and the hydrophobicity of phytoplankton cell surface, and reduced the accumulation of PAHs in surface sediments and phytoplankton consequently. Sinking fluxes and daily loss of PAHs from the water column decreased with phytoplankton biomass because the fraction of organic matter sinking from the water column decreased with phytoplankton biomass. Our study provides novel complementary knowledge for the biological pump for HOCs, and has important implications for understanding the coupling between eutrophication and biogeochemical processes of HOCs in subtropical shallow eutrophic waters.

J	LANDIN, J				LANDIN, J			HABITATS, LIFE HISTORIES, MIGRATION AND DISPERSAL BY FLIGHT OF 2 WATER-BEETLES HELOPHORUS-BREVIPALPIS AND H HELOPHORUS-STRIGIFRONS (HYDROPHILIDAE)	HOLARCTIC ECOLOGY												Populations of 2 Helophorus spp. from a Swedish lake were sampled during the ice-free periods of 2 yr. Dispersing beetles were trapped in light-reflecting glass traps. Both species were univoltine and breed in the spring. The populations of adult H. brevipalpis were largest during the summer when great numbers emerge and migrate. Very few H. strigifrons adults emerged before spring. Its adult populations were largest in the spring, and small numbers of mature individuals fly with mature H. brevipalpis specimens. This was discussed in relation to their habitat utilization: H. strigifrons inhabits permanent waters only and is dimorphic for flight musculature; H. brevipalpis inhabits both permanent and ephemeral waters and is always equipped with a functioning flight apparatus. H. brevipalpis is an effective colonizer of ephemeral waters due to its large dispersal capacity and to the fact that the habitat of juveniles differs from that of adults. Age, sexual maturation and feeding in flying and non-flying groups are compared. Food is seldom found in the gut of fliers of either species. In the spring flying H. brevipalpis females have larger oocytes than non-flying ones; flying H. strigifrons females have smaller oocytes than non-fliers. The summer migrations of H. brevipalpis may favor outbreeding since fliers are sexually immature; spring fliers, being sexually mature, are more efficient as colonizers.																			0105-9327						1980	3	3					190	201																WOS:A1980KL16500006

Measurements taken on bursae, ovaries and oviducts were related to age class and scapular color. Bursae were significantly deeper in juveniles than in adults, and the adult females with gray scapulars had significantly deeper bursae than adult females with brown scapulars. Juvenile female ovaries were smaller than adult ovaries throughout the winter and spring and did not enlarge significantly in the spring as did the adult female ovaries. Oviduct weights were significantly different in immature females, gray-scapulared adult females and brown-scapulared adult females. The data support behavioral evidence that oldsquaws do not reach sexual maturity their 1st yr. Gray scapulars in adults are indicative of a nonbreeding subadult cohort.																				1938-4254					1978	95	1					115	121		10.2307/4085501	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4085501													WOS:A1978EL69900012

However, the effects of climate change on such ecosystems have rarely been quantitatively addressed. We propose a methodology to evaluate the thermal response of small, shallow lakes to long-term changes in the meteorological conditions through model simulations. To do so, a 3D thermal-hydrodynamic model is forced with meteorological data and used to hindcast the evolution of an urban lake in the Paris region between 1960 and 2017. Its thermal response is assessed through a series of indices describing its thermal regime in terms of water temperature, thermal stratification, and potential cyanobacteria production. These indices and the meteorological forcing are first analysed over time to test the presence of long-term monotonic trends. 3D simulations are then exploited to highlight the presence of spatial heterogeneity. The analyses show that climate change has strongly impacted the thermal regime of the study site. Its response is highly correlated with three meteorological variables: air temperature, solar radiation, and wind speed. Mean annual water temperature shows a considerable warming trend of 0.6 degrees C per decade, accompanied by longer stratification and by an increase in thermal energy favourable to cyanobacteria proliferation. The strengthening of thermal conditions favourable for cyanobacteria is particularly strong during spring and summer, while stratification increases especially during spring and autumn. The 3D analysis allows us to detect a sharp separation between deeper and shallower portions of the basin in terms of stratification dynamics and potential cyanobacteria production. This induces highly dynamic patterns in space and time within the study site that are particularly favourable to cyanobacteria growth and bloom initiation.					; Le+Moigne, Patrick/AAU-9622-2020; Vinçon-Leite, Brigitte/Y-1396-2019	Le Moigne, Patrick/0000-0001-7993-0056; Vincon Leite, Brigitte/0000-0002-0190-0209													2190-4979	2190-4987				APR 30	2021	12	2					439	456		10.5194/esd-12-439-2021	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-439-2021													WOS:000646697800001
J	Jurvelius, J; Marjomäki, TJ				Jurvelius, Juha; Marjomaki, Timo J.			Night, day, sunrise, sunset: do fish under snow and ice recognize the difference?	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Although boreal lakes are ice-covered for several months annually, little is known about the behaviour of fish under ice. To consider the reasons for diel vertical migrations (DVM) it is important to compare periods under ice as opposed to under open water. Echosounding provides a tool for non-intrusive continuous monitoring of fish, even in winter. 2. Changes in the vertical distribution of fish through six 48-h periods were monitored using a stationary, mounted echosounder that beamed vertically either from the bottom up or from the surface down from February to April, 2003. The up-beaming and down-beaming transducers were run alternately for 24 h each over the 48-h period. Standard echo analysis software was used to detect fish traces and estimate the vertical and temporal distribution of fish abundance. Fish were sampled with a winter seine. 3. Prominent diel vertical migration in response to changing light level was detected throughout the study period (late winter to spring). Fish were highest in the water column at sunset and sunrise. In daylight, most detected fish were well below 10-m depth. The number of fish detected was greatest during the night when they occurred throughout almost the whole water column, sometimes with a considerable number very close to the ice. Fish were mostly vendace and whitefish. 4. It became evident from data from the up-beaming transducer that at night fish may occupy the layer closest to the surface. These fish would not have been detected if we had only used the down-beaming transducer. The overall pattern of DVM in winter was very similar to that in summer. The results support the suggestion that DVM is a genetically fixed behavioural trait responding to the contemporary level of illumination.																			0046-5070					NOV	2008	53	11					2287	2294		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.02055.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.02055.x													WOS:000262283200014

Landing females were collected by using human bait and mechanical aspirators along the southwestern coast of Mar Chiquita Lake (in northeastern Cordoba Province) from February to November 2000. Collected females were kept in captivity under natural weather conditions, fed on a sugar solution (10%), and provided blood via a human host by different methods (treatment A: 1 bloodfeeding/gonotrophic cycle and treatment B: 2 or 3 bloodfeedings/gonotrophic cycle). A maximum of 5 gonotrophic cycles (average 2.24 +/- 1.11) were determined by dissecting ovarioles. The gonotrophic cycles were longer in females of treatment B (11.23 +/- 4.06 days) than those of treatment A (9.02 +/- 5 days). Females that completed the highest number of cycles were collected in winter and during the beginning of spring. The average number of eggs laid in each cycle was 90 (SD = 37.85) for treatment B females and 80 (SD = 29.99) for those of treatment A, with significant differences between treatments. Considering both treatments, the number of eggs laid was significantly higher after 3 blood meals than with 1 or 2 feedings. These results suggest that an increase in the number of feedings would lengthen the cycle and increase the production of eggs. No correlation was found relating to temperature and the length of the cycles, which suggests that the number of blood meals may be the determining factor in seasonal variations in egg production.

Rudd consumed the native charophytes Chara globularis Thuill., Chara fibrosa Ag. ex Bruz., and Nitella spp., the native macrophytes Potamogeton ochreatus Raoul. and Myriophyllum propinquum A. Cunn., and the introduced macrophytes Elodea canadensis Michx., Egeria densa Planch., Lagarosiphon major L., and Ceratophyllum demersum L. Rudd consistently consumed the Nitella spp. and Potamogeton ochreatus before Ceratophyllum demersum. From the results of experiments in tanks and in the field, we found the order of highest to lowest palatability was: Nitella spp. > Potamogeton ochreatus > Elodea canadensis> Chara globularis = Chara fibrosa> Egeria densa = Lagarosiphon major > Myriophyllum propinquum > Ceratophyllum demersum. The order of consumption was subject to some variation with season, especially for Egeria densa, Lagarosiphon major, and Myriophyllum propinquum. Rudd consumed up to 20% of their body weight per day of Egeria densa in spring, and 22% of their body weight per day of Nitella spp. in summer. Consumption rates were considerably lower in winter than in summer. The results of our field trial suggested that the order of consumption also applies in the field and that rudd are having a profound impact on vulnerable native aquatic plant communities in New Zealand. Nitella spp. and Potamogeton ochreatus are likely to be selectively eaten, and herbivory by rudd might prevent the re-establishment of these species in restoration efforts.

Temporal variability of phosphorus flux from Pike River watershed to the Missisquoi Bay of Quebec	CURRENT SCIENCE												Phosphorus (P) has been identified as the main cause of eutrophication in the Missisquoi Bay of Lake Champlain, of waterbody shared by the Province of Quebec (Canada) and State of Vermont (United States). The Pike River is one of the main watercourses contributing P to the bay, frequently at levels exceeding a bilaterally-imposed water quality standard (25 mu g P/l), designed to address multiple-use issues such as fishing, recreation, aquatic biodiversification and aesthetic value of the bay. The overall annual P flux contributed to the bay by the Pike River watershed (28 Mg per year) exceeds target levels by 3.5-fold. Consequently, daily and seasonal variability in P flux from the Pike River watershed were monitored and analysed to provide a sound basis for the holistic development of a P reduction and management plan. Mean daily P flux at the watershed outlet ranged from 130 kg/day in spring to 22 kg/day in summer. Spring snowmelt and rainfall-generated runoff, along with that arising from rainfall on bare land after fall harvest, contributed 82% of the watershed's annual P discharge. Thus, roughly three-fifths of the P contributed to the bay was discharged over only one-fifth of the hydrological year. This clearly indicates that a more stringent and targeted P pollution reduction plan must be devised and implemented to achieve the water quality goals set for the bay.

J	Li, MY; Shui, TT; Shi, LP; Cao, RX				Li, Mengyuan; Shui, Taotao; Shi, Linpo; Cao, Ruxue			Investigation on Thermal Environment of Urban Slow Lane Based on Mobile Measurement Method-A Case Study of Swan Lake Area in Hefei, China	BUILDINGS												Numerous issues with the urban thermal environment have been brought on by the rapid development of urbanization. The thermal climate of the slow lane, a major urban activity area, is directly tied to the well-being and comfort of city dwellers. The Swan Lake area in Hefei was chosen as the research site for this paper. The mobile measurement method was used to determine the heat island intensity distribution of the slow lane in each season of the year. The effects of building density, the percentage of permeable underlying surface, and shading on the slow lane's thermal environment were then thoroughly examined. According to the study, the distribution of heat island intensities along the mobile measurement route varies significantly depending on season, as well as time of year. Summer and winter have the most notable variations in the distribution of heat island intensities along the mobile measurement route; the summer values range from 0.1 to 4, while the winter values range from -0.3 to 3. The results showed a maximum difference of 30.2 degrees C in surface temperature (Ts) readings and 11.9 degrees C in air temperature (Ta) readings between the identical sites with and without shading, according to tests conducted at four typical mobile measurement locations along the mobile measuring route. The shading factor has a greater effect on the slow lane's thermal environment than permeable underlying surface and building density, as seen by the standardized coefficient of shading being significantly higher than both of these factors. With a standardized coefficient of shading of -0.493 in the winter and a standardized coefficient of shading of -0.517 in the summer, the effect of the shading factor on the thermal environment is more noticeable in the summer.					shi, linpo/KGK-5671-2024															2075-5309				FEB	2025	15	3							388	10.3390/buildings15030388	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/buildings15030388													WOS:001419192200001

Since this is a deep, terminal lake, concern over nutrient build up and change in trophic status exists. On the basis of lake chemistry which shows consistently high concentrations of total reactive-P (mean = 55 mug P l-1) relative to dissolved inorganic-N (DIN) (mean = 15 mug N l-1), it has been hypothesized that Pyramid is N-limited. However, no systematic study of nutrient limitation had been undertaken. Nutrient enrichment bioassays conducted throughout an entire year clearly showed that additions of DIN resulted in a 350-600% stimulation of chlorophyll production. Phosphate, when added singly or in combination with DIN, had no effect. This positive response to N-addition was significant at all times of the year except, (1) immediately after complete lake mixing in February when a large pool of hypolimnetic nitrate was injected into the euphotic zone, and (2) during a fall bloom of the nitrogen fixing species Nodularia spumigena. The positive response to N-addition in the bioassay experiments was strong between March and November. However, the seston exhibited only a gradual depletion of nitrogen relative to carbon over this same period. PN:PC ratios suggested no N-deficiency in phytoplankton biomass in February, March and April, moderate N-deficiency in May, June and July and, severe N-deficiency from August until winter turnover. The appearance of nitrogen fixing blue-green algae in September supports the hypothesis of N-limitation in the summer-autumn. In evaluating the nutrient status of a lake, the concepts of nutrient stimulation versus nutrient deficiency versus nutrient limitation must clearly be defined.																			0018-8158					SEP 10	1993	267	1-3					179	189		10.1007/BF00018800	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00018800													WOS:A1993MB13700014

The feeding of 0+ perch was studied during summer and autumn in littoral habitats of seven lakes with different environmental conditions - four Latvian (Auciema, Riebinu, Varzgunes, Laukezers) and three Estonian (Kaiavere, Prossa and Akste) lakes. Simultaneously, the abundance, biomass and structure of zooplankton communities were examined. We focused on the littoral areas because many studies in lakes suggest that littoral habitats are particularly important for 0+ fish growth and survival. We were interested in the question: can the diet and growth of 0+ perch be explained by zooplankton community structure? We also presumed that if the amount of zooplankton is low, more benthic invertebrates will be consumed by 0+ perch. Opposite to expectations, we found that zooplankton always counted for over 90% of diet biomass in perch. There were also clear correlations between the zooplankton biomass in a given lake, the zooplankton biomass in 0+ perch stomachs, and the fish growth rate. The study also suggested that nutrient enrichment can positively impact the 0+ perch feeding conditions in lakes.					; Zingel, Priit/H-8822-2016; Agasild, Helen/AGG-7498-2022; Karus, Katrit/I-1176-2016	Agasild, Helen/0000-0002-4926-9807; Zagars, Matiss/0000-0001-8948-2269; Zingel, Priit/0000-0003-1629-2063; 													0906-6691	1600-0633				JAN	2023	32	1					37	52		10.1111/eff.12667	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12667		JUN 2022											WOS:000808311800001

Winter pastures were chosen on river valleys or near lakes, mountain hollows or between sand dunes protected from the wind with sufficient pasture places. The size of winter pastures depended on the number of livestock and farm size. The places where the winter houses stood were passed through inheritance. The Kazakhs used to live in nomad tents in winter. The first winter buildings of the Kazakhs were built at the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century. Many Kazakh villages engaged in nomadic pastoralism did not have permanent winter places and continued their nomadic lifestyle even in winter. Wintering materials were connected with the local natural landscape features: brick, reed, clay, wood. The construction of winter houses grew rapidly in the second half of the 19th century. This was because of the dwindling of summer and winter pastures, the loss of cattle due to scarcity of nutrition and Kazakh's transition from nomadic to sedentary life. Together with the adoption of sedentary life at the beginning of the 20th century, winter houses became Kazakhs' permanent place of residence.

J	MUNRO, JA				MUNRO, JA			THE BIRDS AND MAMMALS OF THE VANDERHOOF REGION, BRITISH-COLUMBIA	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												The bird and mammal fauna of the Vanderhoof region, hitherto unreported, was studied during the summers of 1945 and 1946. Forests of aspen and Engelmann spruce, lodgepole pine forests, willow and alder bottoms, grassland and tillage, constitute terrestrial faunal habitats. Three large, shallow lakes, streams, marshy sloughs and forest ponds constitute aquatic faunal habitats. In 1945 one large slough, important as a nesting and feeding place for waterfowl, deteriorated in value because of drought; another dried out completely. This condition was not corrected in 1946. Larger nesting areas, on the lakes, remained stable. The total of 186 spp. and subspp. of birds constitutes an avifauna in which elements originating east of the Rocky Mts. are prominent. The numbers of Zonotrichia albicollis and Spizella pallida observed exceeded the totals of these spp. hitherto recorded from Brit. Columbia west of the Rocky Mts. The former nests commonly. The nesting of Colymbus nigricollis, Anas discors, Aythya americana, Erismatura jamaicensis, Steganopus tricolor, Telmatodytes palustris and Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus mark important range extensions northward. Migrations of waterfowl are noted in detail; post-breeding concns. of diving ducks on an open lake continued for several weeks. In life history studies of certain waterfowl, crow-predation was found to be a restrictive factor. Summer visitant land birds and their increase moved out several weeks before the first southbound transients arrived from the north. Land birds fed on Lonicera involucrata berries and neglected the more abundant berry crop of Amelanchier alnifolia. A fly maggot, Proto-calliphora h. hirudo, feeding subcutaneously on nestling passerine birds reduced the population of these hosts. Food taken from a nest of Cryptoglaux acadica indicated that small mammals, exclusively, were fed the young; the male parent was vocal, the female silent. 28 spp. of mammals are recorded. The populations of Microtus pennsylvanicus and Peromyscus mani-culatus were at or near peak proportions; Clethrionomys gapperi was less common; Sorex cinereus scarce. A reduction in the population of snowshoe rabbits through the summer of 1945 is attributed to predation pressure by horned owls. A study of coyote food habits based on examination of 61 winter and 46 spring and summer scats indicates snowshoe rabbit as a preferred food. The region is winter range for a large moose population.																			0003-0031	1938-4238					1949	41	1					1	138		10.2307/2422020	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2422020													WOS:A1949YA69900001

Samples were taken at 33 positions in January and July 2009 and December 2010. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify the different sources. To evaluate the potential risk and draw possible ecological risk index distributions, harm Hakanson and ArcGIS9.2 were applied with the potential ecological risk index classification standard to quantitatively calculate ecological risk classification area. The results demonstrated that concentrations of Cu, Fe, Mn, and Cr were mainly controlled by parent rocks; Pb, Zn and Cd were affected by industrial pollution. Meanwhile, concentrations of Hg and As were affected mainly by agricultural non-point source pollution and atmospheric settlement. Potential ecological risk analysis showed that potential ecological risk index in summer and winter was 337.37 to 869.03 and 177.45 to 685.58 and mean value were 572.67 and 389.73 respectively. Potential ecological risk indexes of area in level II, III and IVaccounted for 1.88%, 96.2%, and 1.92% of total area in winter and 0%, 52.9%, 47.1% in summer, respectively. The risk index of winter was high, and the majority was in the III level, however, nearly half of the area was at its highest level in summer, so the sediments had serious ecological risks in summer. Hg, Cd played contributed the main pollution factor, so, reducing waste water that contains mercury waste gas discharge and fertilizer loss is necessary to control heavy metal pollution in Ulansuhai Lake.					shi, XIAOHONG/KRP-1855-2024														1018-4619	1610-2304					2012	21	12					3666	3674																WOS:000320829200009

This study aims to assess the effect of the basin on several environmental parameters (temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), turbidity, pH, chloride, nitrite, and total chlorophyll) of the river water before entering the WTP and monitor the changes inside the basin caused by the seasonal hydrological and biological cycles. Sampling was carried out on 16 dates over 3 years at the inlet and outlet channel of the basin and in five locations along three depth values (1, 6, and 12 m, i.e., at the bottom). The results of the 3-year monitoring campaign demonstrated that the basin had an effect on pH (p=6.6x10(-9)), DO (p=0.000072), turbidity (p=0.011), and chlorophyll (p=0.033). No significant changes regarding nitrite (p=0.11), chloride (p=0.94), and temperature (p=0.66) were detected. The results gathered from the sampling campaign inside the basin demonstrated that, during the year, the basin experienced the following: two states of complete mixing in early spring and fall, when the differences in temperature between the surface and the bottom of the basin were less than 1 degrees C; a condition of late spring/summer stratification with a temperature difference between the surface and the bottom of 4-5 degrees C and a difference in DO, pH, and total chlorophyll concentration that increased throughout the spring season; and one or more states of summer circulation due to the weak stability of the warm season stratification. During the states of circulation, the persistent algae photosynthetic activity tended to cause a quick change in the concentration of DO, total chlorophyll, and pH value in the most superficial layer of the basin. The results of the principal component analysis (PCA) showed a strong direct relationship between the weight of the first component and the hydrodynamic states of the basin (stratification/circulation) and an inverse relationship between the weight of the second component and the intensity of photosynthetic activity of algae species.						fiore, silvia/0000-0001-5949-0559													0049-6979	1573-2932				OCT	2015	226	10							331	10.1007/s11270-015-2613-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-015-2613-1													WOS:000361764400010

The warming trend was interrupted by several abrupt shifts between colder (stadial) and warmer (interstadial) climate states following instabilities of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) in response to rapidly melting ice sheets. The sequence of abrupt shifts between extreme climate states had profound impacts on ecosystems which make it challenging to reliably quantify state variables like July temperatures within a non-analogue climate envelope. For Europe, there is increasing albeit inconclusive evidence for higher stadial summer temperatures than initially thought. Here we present a comprehensive floral compilation of plant macrofossils from lake sediment cores of 15 sites from S-Scandinavia covering the period similar to 15 to 11 ka BP. We find evidence for a continued presence of plant species indicating high July temperatures throughout the last deglaciation. The presence of hemiboreal plants in close vicinity to the southern margin of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet implies a strong thermal summer forcing for the rapid ice sheet melt. Consistent with some recent studies, we do not find evidence for a general stadial summer cooling, which indicates that other reasons than summer temperatures caused drastic setbacks in proxy signals possibly driven by extreme winter cooling and/or shorter warm seasons.

In many countries, chlorophyll-a concentrations (CHL) are used as an indicator of phytoplankton abundance and the trophic level of lakes or reservoirs. In-situ measurements of water quality parameters, however, are time-consuming, costly and of unknown but naturally limited spatial representativeness. In addition, the variety of the involved lab and field measurement methods and instruments complicates comparability and reproducibility. Taking Lake Geneva as an example, 1234 satellite images from the MERIS sensor on the Envisat satellite from 2002 to 2012 are used to quantify the spatial and temporal variations of CHL concentrations. Based on histograms of spring, summer and autumn CHL estimates, the spatial representativeness of two existing in-situ measurement locations is analysed. Appropriate sampling frequencies to capture CHL peaks are examined by means of statistical resampling. The approaches proposed allow determining optimal in-situ sampling locations and frequencies. Their generic nature allows for adaptation to other lakes, especially to establish new survey programmes where no previous records are available. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Measurements were made from April 2011 to January 2012 to gain a seasonal outlook on the role of such distributions in the blooms. It was found that large colonies tended to accumulate on the water surface, but the cell density fluctuated widely. The cell density in the water column increased continuously from spring to summer (i.e., April to October) and decreased after late autumn, showing apparent seasonal variations. The abrupt occurrence and disappearance of Microcystis blooms over short periods of time were not caused by the rapid growth of Microcystis but by the rise and accumulation of large Microcystis colonies at the water surface, both of which are affected by colony size. The ascent velocity of large colonies was higher than that of small ones, which enables large colonies to more readily overcome the stirring effects of water flows, waves and perturbations to rise to the surface. The results of canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) of Microcystis vertical distribution in relation to environmental factors suggested that nutrient concentrations and temperature were the main influencing factors related to bloom formation by Microcystis in Lake Taihu during our investigation.

Samples were taken in Cologne (Rhine-km 685) and Kalkar-Grieth (Rhine-km 845) from the same water parcel (Lagrangian sampling). A live-counting technique in combination with video microscopy was employed, allowing a quantitative analysis and an acceptable taxonomic resolution. The majority (99.4% of the annual mean abundance and 73.9% of the annual mean biovolume) of the HF were nanoflagellates (HNF, 2-20 mum in length). Large heterotrophic flagellates (LHF, >20 mum in length), which were mostly composed of flagellates of uncertain taxonomic position (Protista incertae sedis), peaked in spring and summer. Forty genera of HNF belonging to the chrysomonads, choanoflagellates, bodonids, Protista incertae sedis (including apusomonadids, cercomonads and thaumatomastigids), bicosoecids, euglenids, cryptomonads, dinoflagellates, hemimastigids and diplomonads (mentioned in decreasing order of their annual abundance) were recorded. The most abundant genus was that of the chrysomonad "Spumella". Different seasonal patterns in the occurrence of the different genera and species could be demonstrated. Some species such as Bodo saltans and Stelexomonas dichotoma were only recorded in winter, whereas others such as Bicosoeca lacustris and Desmarella spp. were recorded mostly in summer. The HF assemblages in the River Rhine were demonstrated to be as diverse and with a similar composition to those in lentic waters.

Simple models, solely based on Monod or Michaelis Menten equations, failed to give a reasonable simulation of the phytoplankton succession. A more complex model Rostherne (version 1.1a) calibrated on an extensive set of XRMA and conventional data, however, proved to be useful both for prediction of the outcome of the spring and summer competition and for the estimation of values of certain non-measured variables. It also helped to identify the limiting factors for different times of the year. Alteration of the simulated magnitude of the spring diatom bloom had a major influence on summer cyanobacterial maxima, demonstrating fine regulation of the biogeochemical balance within the modelled system.

Gas ebullition and gas emission in winter was not considered in this study. According to our results, Nihe reservoir was a total carbon source (690.42 +/- 15.18 mg m(-2) d(-1)) during the year. The maximum and minimum CO2 flux were 50.52 (mg m(-2) h(-1)) and 17.87 (mg m(-2) h(-1)), respectively. The diurnal and seasonal variation of CO2 flux was obvious: the CO2 emission during the daytime was lower than night; the CO2 flux was highest in summer (31.52 +/- 2.27 mg m(-2) h(-1)), and lowest in fall (25.03 +/- 3.21 mg m(-2) h(-1)). CO2 emission was negatively correlated with temperature, wind speed, and chlorophyll, while positively correlated with alkalinity. Ultimately, no single environmental factor can solely responsible for CO2 flux.					wang, yuqi/J-1632-2017																978-1-4673-4497-5				2012																								WOS:000310335801164

In early 2022, the identification of Dreissena bugensis (quagga mussel) marked the first record of a naturalized population in lakes south of the Alps. To investigate the colonization patterns of this invader and its potential interaction with the established invader D. polymorpha (zebra mussel), a comprehensive field survey was conducted in 2022 across twelve stations, encompassing littoral, sublittoral, and profundal zones, during both spring and autumn. By spring 2022, quagga mussels had colonized the littoral and sublittoral zones of nearly all stations, with higher density in the northern part of the lake and a growth rate dependent on depth. Between spring and autumn, their population continued to grow, surpassing zebra mussels at all stations and expanding into the profundal zone as well. Analysis of population structure and veliger monitoring suggest that quagga mussels likely arrived in the lake in 2019. The evidence of D. bugensis already being firmly established in Lake Garda, as well as in nearby Lake Ledro, highlights the need for biosecurity protocols to prevent further invasions and the spread of established invaders to other Italian lakes.

Using vertical temperature profiles to quantify groundwater-surface water exchange	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES					General Assembly of the European-Geosciences-Union	APR 13-18, 2008	Vienna, AUSTRIA	European Geosci Union				Heat is recognized as a natural tracer to identify the exchange of water between the groundwater and Surface water compartment. One-dimensional (ID) heat transport models have the ability to obtain quantitative estimates of vertical fluxes through the sediment matrix. Input to these models can come from temperatures observed in the Surface water and in the bed material of rivers and lakes. The upper thermal boundary condition at the groundwater-surface water interface is affected by seasonal and diurnal temperature variations. We hypothesize that effects of these transient influences are negligible at certain times of the year, such that the vertical temperature distribution can be approximated to be at steady state. Temperature time series observed over a year in the surface water and at several depths below a river in Belgium and in sediments of an acid mine lake in Eastern Germany were simulated with a heat balance model implemented in FEMME and the water and energy model VS2DH to obtain seepage fluxes. Temperature variations throughout the year at all depths could be adequately reproduced with the transient models. Vertical temperature profiles at several measuring times during the year were also fitted with an analytical, steady-state solution for I D heat transport and the obtained fluxes compared to the results from transient simulations. Fluxes obtained from the much simpler steady-state solution were compared well with the flux rates from transient simulations for moments between mid and late summer, as well as during the winter. During transitional seasons (fall and spring), the fluxes from the steady-state solution deviated significantly from the transient estimates with a tendency to underestimate at the beginning and to overestimate towards the end of those seasons. We conclude that fitting a simple analytical solution for I D vertical heat transport to temperature data observed at particular well-selected times of the year can provide an inexpensive, simple method to obtain accurate point estimates of groundwater-surface water exchange in rivers and lakes.

Food web ecology of Lahontan cutthroat trout	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												The diet of the Lahontan cutthroat trout (LCT; Oncorhynchus henshawi) introduced in Omak Lake is an example of fish adaptation to new ecosystems, providing more information for successful stocking. Our research aimed to elucidate the role of LCT in the Omak Lake food web, identifying and quantifying the main prey taxa in LCT diets throughout life stages. We investigated potential dietary limitations to support the sustainability and subsistence of LCT and assist management decisions for the sport fishery. Samples were collected seasonally during spring (2018-2021), summer (2019-2021), and autumn (2019-2021). Trout were divided into groups by age. We identified and quantified short-term prey consumption via stomach content analysis (SCA). Stable isotope analysis (SIA) of nitrogen and carbon (delta 15N, delta 13C) elucidated longer term predator/prey food web relationships. We found that juvenile LCT (1-2 yr; 150-299 mm) diets included aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates (57%). We observed an ontogenetic dietary transition to piscivory at about 2-4 yr (300-450 mm). Fish were a primary diet source (64%) for adult LCT (>4 yr; >450 mm); however, aquatic, and terrestrial invertebrates were still utilized, particularly in the spring season. The largest LCT (>600 mm) consumed mainly fish (>72%). According to SCA, the 5 largest dietary sources for LCT of all ages were peamouth > Coleoptera > LCT-cannibalized > longnose sucker > Odonata. Diptera were found in all LCT age groups, and terrestrial macroinvertebrates were an important seasonal food source. The SIA and SCA results revealed LCT's dietary plasticity and suggested prey fish scarcity may limit the growth of larger LCT (Beauchamp et al. 2007).

Soil phosphorus, cattle stocking rates, and water quality in subtropical pastures in Florida, USA	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Minimizing nonpoint source nutrient pollution is important to the sustainability of grazing lands. Increased nutrient loads have reduced water quality in Lake Okeechobee in south Florida, prompting establishment of a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) that will require large reductions in phosphorus (P) runoff into the lake. A significant portion of this reduction must come from beef cattle ranches, the major land use in the region. A large-scale research project, consisting of a 420-ha array of 8 improved summer and 8 semi-improved winter pastures, was established from 1998-2003 to investigate the influence of beef cattle stocking rate on nutrient loads in surface runoff. Each pasture type had two replicates of four different cattle stocking rates including a control with no cattle and stocked pastures with low, medium, and high stocking rates (1.3, 1.0, 0.6 ha . AU(-1) [animal unit] in summer pastures; 2.1, 1.6, and 0.9 ha.AU(-1) in winter pastures). Cattle stocking rate did not affect nutrient concentrations or loads in surface runoff during the study period. Average annual P discharges were 1.71 kg . ha(-1) from summer pastures and 0.25 kg.ha(-1) from winter pastures. Average total P concentrations in runoff were 0.63 mg.L-1 for summer pastures and 0.15 mg.L-1 for winter pastures. Differences in runoff P were related to differences in soil P test results, a difference believed to be due to prior fertilization practices. Our findings show that reducing cattle stocking rates on beef cattle pastures is not an effective practice for reducing nutrient loads, and that accumulation of P in soil from historical fertilization has an overriding influence on P loads in surface runoff. Results indicate that reducing the overall volume of surface discharges would be a more effective strategy than altering cattle stocking practices to reduce nonpoint runoff of P from cattle pastures in this region.					; Bohlen, Patrick/HNT-0140-2023	Bohlen, Patrick/0000-0002-3080-6297; 													1550-7424	1551-5028				JAN	2007	60	1					19	30		10.2111/05-072R1.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2111/05-072R1.1													WOS:000243649700003

Swans significantly reduced the biomass of tubers and rhizomes present in the study ponds in spring by 24%, but there was no significant impact on overall P. pectinatus shoot density and biomass the summer following herbivory. However, there were significantly fewer small P. pectinatus shoots (<1.0 g DW) in used areas, and other macrophyte species (Myriophyllum exalbescens, P. zosteriformis) were present in areas where foraging had occurred. R pectinatus may compensate for the effects of herbivory, as the number of larger shoots (range 1.0-5.0 g DW) were similar in areas where trumpeter swans had foraged and been excluded. These larger plants likely produce the tubers that will be consumed by trumpeter swans the next spring. Pond areas out of the reach of foraging swans provide a refuge for the tubers and rhizomes, also enabling the persistence of P. pectinatus. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

This paper describes the experimental design and short-term effects. Open-top fiberglass warming chambers are placed along the experimental snow gradients and in controls areas outside the fences; each warming plot is paired with an unwarmed plot. The purpose of the experiment is to examine short- and long-term changes to the integrated physical-biological systems under simultaneous changes of winter snow regime and summer temperature, as part of the Long-Term Ecological Research network and the International Tundra Experiment. The sites were at Niwot Ridge, Colorado, a temperate high altitude site in the Colorado Rockies, and Toolik Lake, Alaska, a high-latitude site. Initial results indicate that although experimental designs are essentially identical at the arctic and alpine sites, experimental effects are different. The drift at Niwot Ridge lasts much longer than do the Toolik Lake drifts, so that the Niwot Ridge fence affects both summer and winter conditions, whereas the Toolik Lake fence affects primarily winter conditions. The temperature experiment also differs in effect between the sites. Although the average temperature increase at the two sites is similar (daily increase 1.5 degrees C at Toolik and 1.9 degrees C at Niwot Ridge), at Toolik Lake there is only minor diurnal variation, whereas at Niwot Ridge the daytime increases an extreme on sunny days (as much as 7-10 degrees C), and minimum nighttime temperatures in the chambers are often slightly cooler than ambient (by about 1 degrees C), The experimental drifts resulted in wintertime increases in temperature and CO2 flux. Temperatures under the deep drifts were much more consistent and warmer than in control areas, and at Niwot Ridge remained very close to 0 degrees C all winter. These increased temperatures were likely responsible for observed increases in system carbon loss. Initial changes to the aboveground biotic system included an increase in growth in response to both snow and warming, despite a reduced growing season. This is expected to be a transient response that will eventually be replaced by reduced growth. At least one species, Kobresia myosuroides, had almost completely died at Niwot Ridge three years after fence construction, whereas other species were increasing. We expect in both the short- and long-term to see the strongest effects of snow at the Niwot Ridge site, and stronger effects of temperature at Toolik Lake.

However, the tests of this hypothesis have yet to be conclusive in existing literature. The objective of this study was to use long-term data to examine how wind direction and wind speed affect the spatiotemporal variations of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and Chl-a in Lake Tai, a typical shallow lake located in east China. The results indicated that the concentrations of nutrients and Chl-a tended to decrease from the northwest to the southeast of Lake Tai, with the highest concentrations in the two leeward bays (namely Meiliang Bay and Zhushan Bay) in the northwestern part of the lake. In addition to possible artificial reasons (e.g., wastewater discharge), the prevalent southeastward winds in warm seasons (i.e., spring and summer) and northwestward winds in cool seasons (i.e., fall and winter) might be the major natural factor for such a northwest-southeast decreasing spatial pattern. For the lake as a whole, the concentrations of TN, TP and Chl-a were highest for a wind speed between 2.1 and 3.2 ms(-1), which can be attributed to the idea that the wind-induced drifting and mixing effects might be dominant in the bays while the wind-induced drifting and resuspension effects could be more important in the other parts of the lake. Given that the water depth of the bays was relatively larger than that of the other parts, the drifting and mixing effects were likely dominant in the bays, as indicated by the negative relationships between the ratios of wind speed to lake depth, which can be a surrogate for the vertical distribution of wind-induced shear stress and the TN, TP and Chl-a concentration. Moreover, the decreasing temporal trend of wind speed in combination with the ongoing anthropogenic activities will likely increase the challenge for dealing with the eutrophication problem of Lake Tai.					; Hu, Yanbin/LRT-6991-2024	Wang, Xixi/0000-0003-3455-3124; 														2073-4441				MAR	2017	9	3								10.3390/w9030200	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w9030200													WOS:000398721300050

The concentrations of 16 PAEs in surface water from 15 urban lakes in the subtropical city, Guangzhou, were measured, respectively in spring, summer and winter 2006. to elucidate the effect of the seasonal variation in climate conditions on the distribution of PAEs. Seasonal variations of the Sigma(16)PAES concentrations, ranging, respectively from 0.47 to 6.19 mu g L-1 and from 24.9 to 221 mu gg(-1), were measured in the dissolved and suspended particulate matter (SPM) phases. The highest concentrations of PAEs were present in summer. The spatial distribution of PAEs was site-specific. Of the 16 PAEs, dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP). di(4-methyl-2-pentyl) phthalate (DMPP), di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) were present in all the samples analyzed, and dominated by DnBP, DiBP and DEHR Composition profile of PAEs indicated that the application of DnBP/DiBP is relatively high in the Pearl River Delta (PRD). Longer/branching alkyl PAEs likely adsorb to SPM in aquatic environments. Normalized partition coefficient (K-OC) between the dissolved water and SPM was correlated with n-octanol/water partition coefficient (K-OW) to understand the environmental behavior of PAEs.

Microzooplankton were the preferred food source for this copepod, and larger size fractions of phytoplankton were preferred to smaller size fractions. Ingestion rates of total chlorophyll a ranged from 2 to 14 ng center dot copepod(-1)center dot day(-1), while ingestion rates of micro zoo plank ton biomass ranged from 0.04 to 0.15 mu g C center dot copepod(-1 center dot)day(-1). In these experiments, microzooplankton carbon accounted for 22%-74% of the total carbon ingested. Clearance rates of microzooplankton carbon were positively related to the larger size fractions of chlorophyll a and to total suspended solids. Measured ingestion rates of microzooplankton and phyto plankton carbon suggest that calanoid copepod populations have the potential to control microzooplankton production in late winter and early spring, and even with an abundance of phytoplankton carbon, food availability may limit the reproduction of L. sicilis. Because microzooplankton contribute significantly to the diet of these copepods, stimulation of the microbial food web by terrigenous inputs of nutrients and carbon may be transmitted to higher trophic levels (i.e., mesozooplankton and their predators) through heterotrophic flagellates and protozoans.

J	Zhang, YL; Yin, Y; Wang, MZ; Liu, XH				Zhang, Yunlin; Yin, Yan; Wang, Mingzhu; Liu, Xiaohan			Effect of phytoplankton community composition and cell size on absorption properties in eutrophic shallow lakes: field and experimental evidence	OPTICS EXPRESS												We investigated phytoplankton absorption properties of Lake Taihu, in the spring and summer of 2005 and 2006, and for 17 days studied laboratory cultures of Scenedesmus obliquus (chlorophyta) and Microcystis aeruginosa (cyanophyta) to determine the effect of phytoplankton community composition and cell size on the absorption properties. There were significant seasonal differences in phytoplankton community composition and absorption coefficients. In spring, the phytoplankton community was dominated by chlorophyta with large cells, whereas in summer was dominated by cyanophyta with small cells. Phytoplankton absorption coefficients increased significantly from spring to summer, with the increase in chlorophyll a (Chla) concentration. In addition, Chla-specific absorption coefficients increased with the phytoplankton community succession from chlorophyta to cyanophyta. In culture, the cells density of S. obliquus was generally lower than that of M. aeruginosa, and Chla concentrations of S. obliquus were significantly higher than those of M. aeruginosa. Correspondingly, the Chla-specific absorption coefficients of S. obliquus were significantly lower than those of M. aeruginosa. Significant exponential correlations were found between absorption and Chla-specific absorption coefficients and Chla concentration for S. obliquus and M. aeruginosa. In addition, we developed a model to predict absorption and Chla-specific absorption coefficients using Chla concentration and cell size when data from two species was grouped together. Field and experimental results both showed that the Chla-specific absorption coefficients of cyanophyta were significantly higher than those of chlorophyta. The variability in specific absorption can attributed to phytoplankton community composition, cell size and pigment composition. As phytoplankton community composition changed significantly with season in the lake, and as variation in the cell sizes and accessory pigments of the phytoplankton community influenced the Chla-specific absorption coefficient, these factors may be considered explicitly in future improvements to bio-optical algorithms to more accurately estimate Chla concentration, primary production and phytoplankton community composition.

Polychlorinated biphenyls in freshwater salmonids from the Kerguelen Islands in the Southern Ocean	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												The Subantarctic Kerguelen Islands (49 degrees S, 70 degrees E) contain freshwater ecosystems among the most isolated in the world. Concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were assessed in the muscle of 48 brook trout and 38 brown trout caught during summer and spring 2006 in the rivers, lakes and ponds of Kerguelen. The sum of 29 PCBs averaged 404 and 358 ng g(-1) lipid, and dioxin-like PCB was 19 and 69 ng g(-1) lipid, in brook and brown trout, respectively. The values showed a high variability and some fish accumulated PCBs at levels similar to those of fish from impacted areas. While inter-sex differences were limited, the season and the morphotype appeared to have the most influence. Fish captured in summer had muscle PCB concentrations about three times higher than those caught in spring and the 'river' morphotype of brook trout showed the highest PCB levels.

Phosphorus control and dredging decrease methane emissions from shallow lakes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Freshwater ecosystems are an important source of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4), and their emissions are expected to increase due to eutrophication. Two commonly applied management techniques to reduce eutrophication are the addition of phosphate-binding lanthanum modified bentonite (LMB, trademark Phoslock(C)) and dredging, but their effect on CH4 emissions is still poorly understood. Here, this study researched how LMB and dredging affected CH(4 )emissions using a full-factorial mesocosm design monitored for 18 months. The effect was tested by measuring diffusive and ebullitive CH4 fluxes, plant community composition, methanogen and methanotroph activity and community composition, and a range of physicochemical water and sediment variables. LMB addition decreased total CH4 emissions, while dredging showed a trend towards decreasing CH(4 )emissions. Total CH4 emissions in all mesocosms were much higher in the summer of the second year, likely because of higher algal decomposition and organic matter availability. First, LMB addition lowered CH4 emissions by decreasing P-availability, which reduced coverage of the floating fern Azolla filiculoides, and thereby prevented anoxia and decreased surface water NH4+ concentrations, lowering CH4 production rates. Second, dredging decreased CH4 emissions in the first summer, possibly it removed the methanogenic community, and in the second year by preventing autumn and winter die-off of the rooted macrophyte Potamogeton cripsus. Finally, methanogen community composition was related to surface water NH4+ and O-2, and porewater total phosphorus, while methanotroph community composition was related to organic matter content. To conclude, LMB addition and dredging not only improve water quality, but also decrease CH4 emissions, mitigating climate change.

Studies and data on modern changes in the winter minimum average monthly flow of the rivers of the Lake Sevan basin and their climatic characteristics have acquired great practical importance and considerable interest due to the increased use of water resources for the purposes of various types of economic activities, in particular, in connection with the development of the economy, hydropower, irrigation, population growth and rising living standards. Especially relevant are the calculations of the minimum flow in relation to solving the problems of water supply for settlements, industrial enterprises. The aim of the work. Assessment of modern changes in the winter minimum average monthly runoff of rivers in the Lake Sevan basin and their climatic characteristics. Methods. The following methods were used in the work: mathematical-statistical, extrapolation, interpolation, spatial analysis, analogy, correlation and cartography. Results. A physical map has been compiled with a network of meteorological stations and hydrological posts in the Lake Sevan basin. Close correlations were obtained between the values of the winter minimum average monthly runoff and the average runoff of the winter period for a hydrological year.T hese dependences can be used for preliminary estimates of the minimum runoff of the winter low-water period of unstudied rivers in the territory under consideration. In the course of the research, the winter minimum average monthly discharges were calculated by months and for the entire observation period, the average value of the minimum runoff for the winter low water, and the linear trend of the climatic characteristic. Based on the obtained results, a map of the distribution of the modul of the average minimum runoff of the winter low-water period and the coefficients of the linear trend of the winter air temperature were constructed. Examples of curves of long-term changes in precipitation amounts for the autumn and winter periods, the sum of positive temperatures and the number of days with a positive average daily air temperature in the winter period for a series of meteorological stations in the study area are presented. The rivers of the Lake Sevan basin are characterized by an uneven spatio-temporal distribution of winter minimum runoff and climatic characteristics, changes in the winter average monthly minimum runoff, precipitation amounts for the autumn and winter periods are multidirectional, and air temperature changes are only an upward trend. In the area under consideration, there is mainly (by 8 out of 12 stations under study) a tendency to decrease in the values of the minimum average monthly river flow. The conducted studies lead us to the conclusion that the main factor causing changes in the low-water runoff of the rivers in the Lake Sevan basin in winter is the air temperature, or rather, its increase. It follows from this that when calculating and forecasting winter runoff, it is necessary to relate the values of runoff and air temperature.

Diet composition of chub, Squalius cephalus (Teleostei: Cyprinidae), in Lake Todurge, Sivas, Turkey	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												Digestive tract contents of 241 specimens captured between March 1998 and November 1999 were analysed using both qualitative and quantitative methods to determine diet composition and feeding habits of Squalius cephalus (L., 1758) inhabiting Lake Todurge, Turkey. Ages ranged from I to VI years; 60.6% of the fish were females, 39.4% males. The chub population appeared to consume a wide range of food items such as phytoplankton, zooplankton, nematodes, insects, fish, macrophytes, plant and animal detritus, whereby zooplankton (69.2%) predominated. Although individuals in the age I group preferred plankton (phytoplankton frequently; zooplankton infrequently), the older specimens (age groups IV, V and VI) behaved mostly as carnivores but also consumed some macrophytes. While there were no significant differences between diet compositions of males and females, seasonal changes were observed in frequency of occurrence, quality and quantity of consumption, and feeding activity. The chub specimens fed most heavily during spring (the pre-spawning period: March, April and May). Highest food volume (13.0 cm(3)) consumed was in May and the lowest in September (2.0 cm(3)) while also being correlated with temperature. All of the food items were found in the digestive tract (82.1% of the specimens examined over all seasons). Highest fullness (84.9%) was reached in autumn and the lowest during summer (79.8%).

Effects of food web changes on Mysis diluviana diet in Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Mysids are important benthic-pelagic omnivores in many deep-lake food webs, yet quantitative data on their diet are limited. We explored the trophic role of Mysis diluviana in offshore Lake Ontario using samples collected in May, July, and September 2013 with a focus on seasonal and ontogenetic patterns in herbivory and zooplanktivory using two approaches. We hypothesized that Mysis diet in 2013 differs from the last investigation in 1995 in response to changes in pelagic prey over 1995 to 2013. Gut fluorescence indicated high grazing by adult and juvenile Mysis in May 2013. In July, smaller mysids were more herbivorous than larger individuals, a pattern that was less pronounced in September. Microscopic gut analysis showed copepods, including Limnocalanus, were common in diets of both size groups in May. In July, mainly cladocerans were consumed, including Cercopagis pengoi which represents a change from a past investigation that preceded Cerdopagis invasion in the lake. Our results are consistent with earlier observations of a larger proportion of algae in mysid diets in spring, transitioning to relatively more zooplanktivory and use of cladocerans in the summer and fall. Higher chlorophyll content in small mysids in July than in September may be associated with the presence of a deep chlorophyll layer in July that had largely dissipated by September. Overall, Mysis in Lake Ontario continues to be a generalist omnivore, incorporating new prey items and exhibiting higher herbivory in spring.

DIVERSITY OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS IN THE LOWLAND WATERCOURSES: A CASE STUDY IN TRANSBOUNDARY RIVERS, TRANSBAIKALIA, RUSSIA	NATURE CONSERVATION RESEARCH												Planktonic communities have important roles in aquatic ecosystems, including rivers. But studies of plankton organisms in lotic systems are infrequent. The present research has been performed in transboundary rivers (River Uldza and River Imalka), flowing through the Daursky State Nature Biosphere Reserve (Transbaikalia, Russia) during the beginning runoff and increasing discharge (2020-2022). Aquatic organisms (algae, cyanobacteria, rotifers, and crustaceans) in the surveyed watercourses have been studied for the first time. We collected phytoplankton and zooplankton samples to explore species and functional diversity and temporal trends in the studied rivers. The total species composition included 134 phytoplankton taxa ranked below the genus level; the order of dominance was Bacillariophyta (49 taxa) > Chlorophyta (47 taxa) > Cyanophyta (18 taxa) > Charophyta (10 taxa) > Chrysophyta (4 taxa) = Euglenophyta > Cryptophyta (1 taxon) = Dinophyta) and 116 zooplankton taxa (Rotifera (64 taxa), Cladocera (35 taxa), and Copepoda (17 taxa). Not determined Bdelloida (Rotifera) and juvenile Copepoda and Anostraca were also encountered in zoo-plankton. Algal flora and fauna of invertebrates were formed mainly by cosmopolitans, 68.0% and 61.4% of the total composition respectively. Functional diversity of planktonic communities was determined by 19 Functional Groups of phytoplankton (FG(ph)), 7 Morphologically Based Functional Groups of phytoplankton (MBFG(ph)) and 17 Functional Groups of zooplankton (FG(zoo)). In phytoplankton, codons MP (epiphytic and epilithic species drifted in the plankton that prefer frequently stirred up, inorganically turbid shallow lakes) and X1 (species, which prefer shallow, eu-hypertrophic environments, resistant to stratification, sensitive to nutrients deficiency) and groups IV (organisms of medium size lacking specialised traits) and VI (non-flagellated organisms with siliceous exoskeletons) dominated in species composition and abundance. In zooplankton, littoral and phytophilic species, filter feeders and species with swimming and crawling locomotion were the most diverse and abundant. Plationus polyacanthus (Rotifera) and Megafenestra aurita (Cladocera) have been found for the first time in the fauna of Zabaikalsky Krai. In the River Uldza, the phytoplankton and zooplankton species diversity and quantitative parameters showed seasonal variations. Cyanobacteria, Chlorophyta, and Bacillariophyta dominated phytoplankton biovolume with peaks in Cyanobacteria (Anabaena spp., Coelomoron pusillum, Gloeocapsa minima, G. minor) and Chlorophyta (Monoraphidium griffithii, Willea apiculata, W. irregularis) occurring during summer and peaks in Bacillariophyta (Ulnaria ulna) occurring during spring and autumn. Seasonal patterns in zooplankton structure included peaks in larval stages of Copepoda and Anostraca during spring, Rotifera (Trichocerca elongata, Hexarthra mira, Euchlanis dilatata) during mid-summer and Chydoridae (Chydorus sphaericus, Pleuroxus aduncus, Coronatella rectangula) during autumn. Based on our results, we recommend undertaking a comprehensive study on transboundary rivers in order to research biodiversity and gain a clear understanding of the impact anthropogenic activities (dams) and climatic factors (the intensity and duration of flood) could have on aquatic communities.

W.; Wang, Dan; Wang, Yan			Seasonal antimony pollution caused by high mobility of antimony in sediments: In situ evidence and mechanical interpretation	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS												Antimony (Sb) mobilization in sediments and its impact on water quality remained to be studied. In this study, high-resolution dialysis (HR-Peeper) and diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) technique were used to measure soluble Sb and labile Sb in sediment-overlying water profiles for a full year in a eutrophic region of Lake Taihu. Results showed that the highest mean concentrations of soluble Sb in overlying water (11.27 and 6.99 mu g/L) appeared in December 2016 and January 2017, due to oxidation of Sb(III) to Sb(V) by Mn and Fe oxides, all of which exceeded the surface or drinking water limits set by China, United States and European Union. From April to November 2016, the concentrations of soluble Sb remained low with small monthly fluctuations and mean values ranging from 1.79 to 2.93 mu g/L. This was attributed to the predominance of insoluble Sb(III) in sediments under anoxic conditions. The concentration of soluble Sb was slightly higher in summer than in autumn, due to the complexation of Sb(III) with DOM, as shown under anaerobic incubation. The mobility of inorganic Sb in sediments was mostly determined by the transition between Sb(III) and Sb(V), with Sb pollution in bottom water during winter being of concern.					; Ding, Ding/F-8295-2011; Tsang, Dan/E-5442-2012; Liyuan, yang/R-3446-2019	Tsang, Dan/0000-0002-6850-733X; 													0304-3894	1873-3336				APR 5	2019	367						427	436		10.1016/j.jhazmat.2018.12.101	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2018.12.101								30611035					WOS:000459845000048

However, big challenges remain in developing remote sensing-based models for mapping concentrations of dissolved carbon dioxide (cCO2) in lakes at regional or global scales. We developed a cCO2 estimation model using Sentinel-3-derived lake environmental variables and near-synchronous field cCO2 data from 16 lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze and Huai River (ML_YHR) basins in Eastern China (N = 248). Stepwise quadratic polynomial regressions of several combinations of chlorophyll -a (Chl-a), water temperature (Tw), Secchi disk depth (ZSD), and photosynthetic active radiation (PAR)-related variables were tested and validated to select the best approach. The final model showed high performance in calibration and validation (R2 > 0.72, RMSE < 6.35 mu mol L-1, MAPE < 30.31%). The model sensitivity analysis, based on Monte Carlo simulations, showed the model's estimated bias as <25% based on uncertainties of all input variables. Spatial and temporal dynamics of dissolved CO2 concentrations in 113 lakes (>= 10 km2) in the ML_YHR basins were mapped from 2016 to 2021 using the Sentinel-3 data. The result showed that CO2 concentrations were low in the summer and autumn but high in the winter and spring with dramatic variations (e.g., mean coefficient of variation: 52.59%). The annual mean CO2 concentrations of lakes revealed that about 28% of the lakes acted as weak atmospheric CO2 sinks (14.96 +/- 1.13 mu mol L-1) while the rest were sources (19.22 +/- 2.02 mu mol L-1), compared with a mean concentration of CO2 atmospheric equilibrium (16.29 mu mol L-1). CO2 concentrations decreased with increasing eutrophication and decreasing lake size (p < 0.05). This study advances current knowledge about CO2 emissions from emerging meso-eutrophic lakes and shows how satellite remote sensing can expand the spatiotemporal coverage of lake CO2.					cao, zhigang/AHI-0088-2022; Luo, Juhua/AHE-4173-2022; Qi, Tianci/IRZ-2645-2023; Duan, Hongtao/B-7210-2011; Ma, Jinge/GOG-9613-2022; Kutser, Tiit/H-1304-2015	Luo, Juhua/0000-0002-4615-6006; Ma, Jinge/0000-0002-3803-6258; Duan, Hongtao/0000-0002-1985-2292; 													0034-4257	1879-0704				MAR 1	2023	286								113431	10.1016/j.rse.2022.113431	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2022.113431		JAN 2023											WOS:000921092500001

They are hotspots for the biogeochemical processing of elements, such as carbon (C), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn). In turn, those elementary cycles may control the mobility of selenium (Se), an essential micronutrient. To unravel these coupled biogeochemical cycles and identify processes controlling Se mobility, we studied four thermokarst ponds in a subarctic peatland valley influenced by permafrost thaw. The data set comprises of water column and sediment porewater concentration profiles collected during both summer and winter. Physicochemical parameters and dissolved concentrations of major elements, nutrients, and Se were measured and used to model fluxes at the sediment-water interface and to calculate Se speciation. The results suggest that the proximity of the pond from the permafrost structures influenced their biogeochemical dynamics. In the ponds close to permafrost, Se concentrations are 2-fold higher in winter compared to summer, accompanied by an increase in sediment fluxes from 13 to 149 pmol cm(-2) yr(-1) between summer and winter. The combination of comparatively older dissolved organic matter and of oxygenated conditions explain the seasonal variation in Se concentrations. In the ponds further from the permafrost, Se concentrations are higher, remain unchanged in the water column across seasons, and are linearly correlated with both DOC (R-2 = 0.64, p < 0.01, n = 50) and Fe (R-2 = 0.60) concentrations. Thermodynamic calculations show that Se(IV) dominates Se speciation in the porewater at all sites, while the water column reaches saturation with respect to elemental zerovalent Se, suggesting that precipitation of elemental Se could mediate dissolved Se concentrations. Collectively, our results point to the strong control that redox conditions exert on Se mobility, via DOC and Fe, and to the linkages between landscape features, pond physicochemistry, and Se dynamics.

J	Matthews, KR; Pope, KL				Matthews, KR; Pope, KL			A telemetric study of the movement patterns and habitat use of Rana muscosa, the mountain yellow-legged frog, in a high-elevation basin in Kings Canyon National Park, California	JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY												In a high-elevation (3470 m) lake basin (upper Dusy Basin) in Kings Canyon National Park, California, we used radio transmitters on 24 mountain yellow-legged frogs (Rana muscosa) to gather basic information on their movement patterns. Rana muscosa have declined throughout their range in the Sierra Nevada and restoration plans require information on their movement ecology. Our study indicates that R. muscosa had different movement patterns and habitat associations during the 1997 summer period (August and September) compared to October when winter dormancy began. In August, visual surveys found frogs in 10 of the 11 lakes in upper Dusy Basin. During August most tagged frogs moved little (mean movement 77 m over five day periods) and all were found in the lake or adjacent stream where they were originally tagged. During September, movement increased compared to August Frogs moved from the original capture lake mean distances of 145 m, and moved cumulative distances of 315-466 m. By October, frogs were again sedentary (mean distance moved 43 m) and frogs were found in three of the II lakes in the basin. Moreover, mean home ranges (adaptive kernel 90% contours) also were different throughout the summer and were highest for frogs tracked during September (5336.2 m(2)) compared to August (385 m(2)); and October (52.8 m(2)). Before this study it was assumed that R, muscosa over-wintered in the deepest portion of the lake. However, most lakes were frozen when our study ended, and tagged frogs were found nearshore under ledges and in deep underwater crevices suggesting that at least some R. muscosa over-winter in these nearshore areas. In this study, we found R. muscosa in different aquatic habitats over the course of their activity period and that they readily moved between these habitats using both aquatic and overland pathways. The movements appear to be associated with seasonal migrations between summer and over-wintering sites.

J	MORESHET, S				MORESHET, S			PHYSIOLOGICAL-ACTIVITY, IN A SEMI-ARID ENVIRONMENT, OF EUCALYPTUS-CAMALDULENSIS DEHN FROM 2 PROVENANCES	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Physiological activity including 14CO2 uptake, growth, stomatal conductance and evapotranspiration of E. camaldulensis Dehn. trees from 2 seed sources were compared: one from the tropical climate of northern Australia (Katherine) and the other from the dry subtropical climate of southern Australia (Lake Albacutya). The trees were grown in the semiarid climate (rainless summer) of southern Israel. Diurnal measurements were made on 9 occasions during the winter and summer of 1974/1975 on 4 yr old seedling trees. Physiological activity was low before the rains started. After the onset of rains renewal of activity was first detected in the Katherine provenance seedlings but after a short period the Lake Albacutya provenance seedlings showed higher rates of activity, reaching maximum midday rates of stomatal conductance and CO2 uptake of 2.2 mm s-1 and 0.24 mg m-2 s-1, respectively. Activity during the summer of 1975 was very low but CO2 uptake and stomatal conductance after the rains of winter 1975/1976 returned to the levels observed in the previous winter. The growth of seedlings of the 2 provenances, as indicated by the cumulative change in stem diameter, was well correlated with the evapotranspiration. Growth of the Katherine provenance seedlings did not recover after a dry period during the 2nd winter. The seedlings which originated in the cooler and drier region of Australia were adapted to the semiarid conditions of southern Israel than were those from the tropical region, although the aridity of the region imposed severe restaints on the growth of both provenances.																			0067-1924	1444-9862					1981	29	1					97	110		10.1071/BT9810097	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/BT9810097													WOS:A1981LU04100010
J	Han, SZ; Sun, JQ				Han, Shuangze; Sun, Jianqi			A skillful prediction scheme for April precipitation over central East China	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												Central East China (30 degrees N-42 degrees N, 105 degrees E-122 degrees E), around the lower and middle reaches of the Yangtze River valley to north China, is one of the main agricultural bases over East Asia. Spring precipitation can significantly influence the regional agricultural activity and production, such as the crop planting and winter wheat growing over the region. Here, we find that different from the March and May precipitation over central East China, the April precipitation there shows relatively weak relationships with the preceding El Nin similar to o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean basin mode (IOB) which are usually used as the prediction signals. Therefore, in this study, from the perspective of the prediction, we identify two predictors in the preceding months for the variability in the April precipitation over central East China: (1) the sea surface temperature (SST) over the subtropical North Atlantic in January and (2) the snow cover around the region to the east of Lake Baikal in March. The anomalous SST signal shows a good persistence from January to April, and further stimulates a wave train propagating from the subtropical North Atlantic eastward to East Asia during April, which could contribute to an anomalous East Asian trough and thereby the precipitation anomalies over central East China. The anomalous snow cover signal in March also tends to persist to the following April, and the associated anomalous cooling/ warming could exert an impact on the East Asian trough, consequently influencing the April precipitation over central East China. Based on the two predictors, we establish a statistical prediction scheme and further evaluate its predictive skills. The results suggest the potential of the scheme for the prediction of the April central East China precipitation.

Widespread occurrence and seasonal variation of pharmaceuticals in surface waters and municipal wastewater treatment plants in central Finland	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The presence of five selected pharmaceuticals, consisting of four anti-inflammatory drugs, diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, and an antiepileptic drug carbamazepine, was determined at four municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and in the receiving waterway in central Finland. The samples were taken from influents and effluents of the WWTPs and from surface water of six locations along the water way, including northern Lake Paijanne. In addition, seasonal variation in the area was determined by comparing the concentrations in the winter and summer. The samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in the multiple reaction monitoring mode. The concentrations in the influents and effluents ranged from hundreds of nanogram per liter to microgram per liter while ranged from tens of nanogram per liter in northern parts of the waterway to hundreds of nanogram per liter in northern Lake Paijanne near the city area. In addition, the concentrations were higher in the winter compared to summer time in surface water due to decreased temperature and solar irradiation. On the other hand, higher concentrations of ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen were found in summer at the WWTPs, possibly due to seasonal variations in consumption. In conclusion, there are considerable amounts of pharmaceuticals not only in influents and effluents of the WWTPs but also in lake water along the waterway and in northern Lake Paijanne.					; Lindholm-Lehto, Petra/P-8112-2019	Ahkola, Heidi/0000-0002-3329-3749; Lindholm-Lehto, Petra/0000-0003-1807-8116													0944-1344	1614-7499				APR	2016	23	8					7985	7997		10.1007/s11356-015-5997-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-5997-y								26769590					WOS:000374994600089

The Yichang Irrigation District, located within the Hetao Irrigation Area, has experienced persistent salinity challenges due to shallow groundwater tables and intensive irrigation. In this study, we aimed to simulate long-term soil water-salt dynamics in the Yichang Irrigation District and evaluate the effectiveness of different engineering and management scenarios using the SaltMod model. Field monitoring of soil salinity and groundwater levels during summer and fall (2022-2024) was used to calibrate and validate SaltMod parameters, ensuring accurate reproduction of seasonal soil salinity fluctuations. Based on the calibrated model, ten-year scenario simulations were conducted to assess the effects of changes in soil texture, irrigation water quantity, water quality, rainfall, and groundwater table depth on root-zone salinity. Our results show that under baseline management, soil salinity is projected to decline by 5% over the next decade. Increasing fall autumn leaching irrigation further reduces salinity by 5-10% while conserving 50-300 m(3).ha(-1) of water. Sensitivity analysis indicated groundwater depth and irrigation water salinity as key drivers. Among the engineering strategies, drainage system improvement and groundwater regulation achieved the highest salinity reduction (15-20%), while irrigation regime optimization provided moderate benefits (similar to 10%). This study offers a quantitative basis for integrated water-salt management in the Hetao Irrigation District and similar regions.																				2073-4395				SEP 22	2025	15	9							2239	10.3390/agronomy15092239	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy15092239													WOS:001581222800001

Past Warmth and Its Impacts During the Holocene Thermal Maximum in Greenland	ANNUAL REVIEW OF EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCES, VOL 49, 2021	Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences											Higher boreal summer insolation in the early to middle Holocene drove thousands of years of summer warming across the Arctic. Modern-day warming has distinctly different causes, but geologic data from this past warm period hold lessons for the future. We compile Holocene temperature reconstructions from ice, lake, and marine cores around Greenland, where summer temperatures are globally important due to their influence on ice sheet mass balance, ocean circulation, and sea ice. Highlighting and accounting for some key issues with proxy interpretation, we find that much of Greenland experienced summers 3 to 5 degrees C warmer than the mid-twentieth century in the early Holocene-earlier and stronger warming than often presumed. Warmth had dramatic consequences: Many glaciers disappeared, perennial sea ice retreated, plants and animals migrated northward, the Greenland Ice Sheet shrank rapidly, and increased meltwater discharge led to strong marine water stratification and enhanced winter sea ice in some areas. Summer air temperatures and open ocean temperatures around much of Greenland peaked in the early Holocene in response to elevated summer insolation. Peak summer air temperatures ranged from 3 to 5 degrees C warmer than the mid-twentieth century in northwest and central Greenland to perhaps 1 to 2 degrees C warmer in south Greenland. Many differences between records can be explained by proxy seasonality, ice sheet elevation changes, vegetation analogs and lags, and the nearshore effects of ice sheet meltwater. Early Holocene warmth dramatically affected glaciers and the Greenland Ice Sheet; meltwater discharge, nearshore ocean salinity, and sea ice; and diverse flora and fauna.					de Vernal, Anne/D-5602-2013; Axford, Yarrow/N-4151-2014	Axford, Yarrow/0000-0002-8033-358X; Osterberg, Erich/0000-0002-0675-1230													0084-6597	1545-4495	978-0-8243-2049-2				2021	49						279	307		10.1146/annurev-earth-081420-063858	http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-earth-081420-063858	10.7765/9781526119384												WOS:000661535000013

Declines in the energy content of yearling non-native alewife associated with lower food web changes in Lake Michigan	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												Juveniles of non-native alewife, Alosa pseudoharengus (Wilson), were collected in Lake Michigan in 1998, 1999, 2010, 2011 and 2013 to evaluate changes in energy content during a period of major ecosystem changes. Consistent with historical data, energy content of yearling alewife declined from late winter into late spring and was at its lowest point in June. Energy density and length-adjusted, entire-body energy were lower in 2010, 2011 and 2013 than in 1998 and 1999. Energy losses over the first winter in the lake were more severe for the 2010 year class (56% decrease) than for the 1998 year class (28% decrease). Alewife diets in late spring of 2010-2013 reflected the loss of major prey such as Diporeia spp. and a shift towards lower energy prey. The recent decline in energy content of yearling alewife can be linked to recent changes in productivity and abundance of key components of the lower food web of Lake Michigan following the dreissenid invasion.

J	Nicholls, KH				Nicholls, KH			CUSUM phytoplankton and chlorophyll functions illustrate the apparent onset of dreissenid mussel impacts in Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Untreated lake water samples were collected weekly, year-round from the drinking water intakes of five municipal water treatment plants on Lake Ontario and one plant with an intake in the upper St. Lawrence River and analyzed for chlorophyll a and phytoplankton density. CUSUM (cumulative sums of the differences between monthly means and the grand mean of each data set) chlorophyll and phytoplankton functions revealed rapid and dramatic reductions in chlorophyll and phytoplankton at four of the six sampling locations. Break-points in the CUSUM functions were in 1991 for western Lake Ontario, 1993 for the upper St. Lawrence River, 1994 for the Kingston (eastern) outlet basin of the lake, and 1995 for the central, north-shore area of the lake. These dates reinforce the anecdotal information available on the invasion history and spatial distribution of Dreissena spp. (zebra and quagga mussels) in Lake Ontario. Three-year "before and after" comparisons revealed that the highest percentage reductions in phytoplankton (several exceeding 90%) occurred during fall, winter, and spring, despite water temperatures near 0 degreesC (during winter), and were similar to reductions previously reported for the north shore of Lake Erie using similar methods.																			0380-1330						2001	27	4					393	401		10.1016/S0380-1330(01)70655-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(01)70655-7													WOS:000173010400001

We describe the dynamics of host-parasite interactions over a period of more than 30 years between the freshwater diatom Asterionella formosa and two highly virulent chytrid parasites (Rhizophydium planktonicum and Zygorhizidium planktonicum) in Lake Maarsseveen, The Netherlands. This period is characterised by a significant warming trend which is strongest in spring. 2. The key spring event in lakes, the diatom bloom, was in many years dominated by Asterionella. We examine whether and how climate warming has affected the prevalence of infection in Asterionella by chytrids. 3. In years with cold winters/early springs, a dense Asterionella bloom is followed by epidemic development of disease as high Asterionella densities greatly facilitate transmission of chytrid zoospores. This sequence of events is absent in milder winters. 4. Earlier experimental studies have shown that the parasite is almost non-infective at water temperatures below 3 degrees C, offering a disease-free window of opportunity for growth of Asterionella. Climate warming has reduced periods in which water temperature remains < 3 degrees C, narrowing the window of opportunity for uninfected growth. Consequently, Asterionella continuously suffers from infection, albeit at low levels. 5. Population reduction as a result of low level infection allows other diatoms to take over as dominant species, possibly through priority effects. 6. In mild winters, chytrid infections no longer reach epidemic levels, but remain at low prevalence since transmission is impaired at low host densities. Climate warming thus affects both host and parasite in intricate ways, with the host denied a bloom and consequently the parasite denied an epidemic. 7. A shift from Asterionella to a mixed diatom community in years with mild winters may benefit the food web, because of the poor edibility of Asterionella, unless the numerous chytrid zoospores produced during epidemics significantly contribute to zooplankton nutrition. 8. Our study demonstrates the potential complexity of climate change impacts on disease. A reduction in the likelihood of epidemic development of a virulent parasite would seem to be of great benefit to the host, but this was not the case. Unexpected, sometimes paradoxical consequences of climate change can be expected and suggest that the view of a 'warmer hence sicker world' may not always apply.

This meta-analysis investigated correlations of R. raciborskii with water temperature and N:P (nitrogen to phosphorus)-ratios across four lakes with different climates and trophic states by means of long-term time series and the hybrid evolutionary algorithm HEA. The results have shown that in the lakes with temperate and Mediterranean climate, R. raciborskii is strongly correlated with water temperature since germination and growth rely on rising water temperatures in spring. In contrast, there was a weaker correlation with water temperature in subtropical and tropical lakes where pelagic populations of R. raciborskii are overwintering, and are present all year round. However, the highest abundances of R. raciborskii coincided with highest water temperature for the Mediterranean, subtropical and tropical lakes, whilst in the temperate Langer See the highest abundances of R. raciborskii occurred at 24.1 degrees C, even though temperatures of up to 27 degrees C were recorded in 2013 and 2014. The correlation of R. raciborskii with N:P-ratios proved to be strongest for the meso- to eutrophic Lake Kinneret (r(2) = 0.8) and lowest for the eutrophic Lake Paranoa (r(2) = 0.16). However, the assumption has been confirmed that R. raciborskii is growing fastest when waters are N-limited regardless of trophic states. In terms of phenology, the temperate and Mediterranean lakes displayed "fastest growth" in spring and early summer. In contrast, the growing season in subtropical and tropical lakes lasted from spring to autumn most likely because of overwintering populations, and growing importance of direct and indirect biotic regulating factors such as competition, grazing, remineralisation of nutrients along warming climate. In order to carry out a meta-analysis of time series across four different lakes, HEA served as powerful tool resulting in inferential models with predictive capacity for population dynamics of R. raciborskii just driven by water temperature or N:P-ratios, whilst coefficients of determination r(2) served as criteria for hypotheses testing.					; Orr, Philip/I-2301-2017; Rücker, Jacqueline/H-8994-2019	Castelo Branco, Christina W/0000-0002-0509-171X; Rucker, Jacqueline/0000-0001-6841-7724; Orr, Philip/0000-0003-1620-2531; 													1568-9883	1878-1470				APR	2019	84						222	232		10.1016/j.hal.2019.04.005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2019.04.005								31128807					WOS:000471087800023

Water chemistry and titrable acidity levels in leaves of Isoetes setacea LAMARCK from a pool, and Isoetes lacustris L. from an oligotrophic lake were sampled over diel cycles in summer 1990 and, for the lake plants, in winter. In july, diel acid fluctuation in L setacea was almost twice than in late summer. Interestingly, the accumulation of acid at night showed no differences between leaves of submerged and emergent individuals. This result is contradictory to those obtained in other Isoetes species. There were marked diel changes in pH and 02 levels, and free CO2 was close to depletion at noon in the pool. The same pattern was observed in the lake, although fluctuations were not so pronounced. L lacustris also had maximum titrable acidity levels in july. Even though winter productivity of Isoetes lacustris was negligible, changes in the concentration of dissolved oxygen and free CO2 suggest photosynthetic activity under the ice. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that significant acid level fluctuations were measured in leaves of Isoetes lacustris in winter period.

However, the linkages between NH4+ regeneration and phytoplankton biomass and community composition dynamics remain largely unknown. To unravel the interactions between NH4+ regeneration and phytoplankton community, we measured water column NH4+ regeneration rates (REGs) during a continuous phytoplankton growing period and a contrast summer/winter turnover in eutrophic Lake Taihu. Measured REGs were higher in summer than in winter and significantly correlated to total phytoplankton biomass, Cyanophyta biomass and its biomass proportions, and the concentrations of particulate nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon as well as the relative abundance of labile components (proteins and lipids). Random forest regression analyses displayed that variation of REGs were mainly controlled by water temperature and algal-related parameters (including chlorophyll a, total phytoplankton biomass, and Cyanophyta biomass). Partial least squares path model further revealed that algal-related parameters were the direct and significant factors regulating REGs, and contributed to the largest effect of the variance in REGs. Of the algal community, Cyanophyta was the dominant phylum to accelerate REGs. Correspondingly, rapid internal NH4+ turnover may strongly support the persistence of cyanobacterial blooms, thus forming a positive feedback between cyanobacterial blooms and REGs during the nitrogen-limited summer months. We therefore deduced that the internal loop between cyanobacterial blooms and REGs during summer may be a key self-maintenance mechanism of continuous cyanobacterial blooms.

However, ground-based measurements of dust emissions at-source are rare and of generally short duration, failing to capture the annual cycle. Here, we provide new insights into dust dynamics by measuring aerosol concentrations and meteorological conditions for a full year (July 2015-June 2016) at Etosha Pan, Namibia, a globally significant dust source. Surface deployed field instrumentation provided 10-min averaged data on meteorological conditions, aerosol concentration (mg/m(3)), and horizontal dust flux (g/m(2)/min(10)). A Doppler lidar provided additional data for some of the period. 51 significant dust events were identified in response to strong E-ENE winds. We demonstrate that these events occurred throughout the year and were not restricted to the austral winter, as previously indicated by satellite observations. Peak horizontal flux occurred in the spring (November) due to strengthening erosive winds and highly desiccating conditions increasing surface erodibility. We identify a strong seasonal differentiation in the meteorological mechanisms controlling dust uplift; low-level jets on dry winter mornings (61% of all events), and cold pool outflows in humid summer evenings (39% of events). Significantly, we demonstrate a very strong bias toward the contribution of low frequency and high magnitude events, with nearly 31% of annual horizontal dust flux generated by only 6 individual events. Our study demonstrates how longer-term (approximate to 1 year), ground-based, and at-source field measurements can radically improve interpretations of dust event dynamics and controls at major source locations.					; Baddock, Matthew/A-5739-2012; von Holdt, Johanna/J-6587-2019; Bryant, Robert/C-7737-2009; Engelstaedter, Sebastian/A-9599-2009; Baddock, Matthew/JCO-2034-2023; Eckardt, Frank/N-3682-2015; Nield, Joanna/G-4916-2012	Engelstaedter, Sebastian/0000-0001-9315-580X; Baddock, Matthew/0000-0003-1490-7511; von Holdt, Johanna/0000-0003-1303-6208; Bryant, Robert/0000-0001-7943-4781; Thomas, David/0000-0001-6867-5504; Wiggs, Giles/0000-0002-2131-0724; 													2169-9003	2169-9011				AUG	2022	127	8							e2022JF006675	10.1029/2022JF006675	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022JF006675													WOS:000848236200001

An accumulation of phosphorus was found during the ice covered period in the 0 - 0.5 cm layer. This may be explained by mobilisation of redox-sensitive phosphorus forms in deeper sediment layers, followed by a diffusion to the oxygenated sediment surface where it was trapped by iron and detected as BD-P in the fractionation analysis. During spring mixing, the total phosphorus content in the 0 - 0.5 cm layer decreased by one third, due to a decline in BD-P. The loss of phosphorus from the sediment, occuring under oxic conditions, was probably due to resuspension and aerobic dissolution of iron-bound phosphorus due to steeper diffusion gradients during spring mixing. Differences in phosphorus accumulation during the two winter periods investigated may be an effect of variations in climatic factors, e.g, length of the ice covered period and mixing patterns. The variation in NaOH-nrP (0 - 0.5 cm) concentration, partly corresponding to bacterial phosphorus, showed a delayed response to the spring diatom sedimentation, as decomposition probably was restricted by low temperature. The calculated release rate from the investigated sediment area from April through September was on average 6 mg P day(-1) m(-2), while the estimated external loading was 0.02 mg P day(-1) m(-2) during the summer period. Our results show that the concept of "Internal loading" is not restricted to highly eutrophic systems. It is relevant also in less nutrient rich systems, and may even play a major role when the external loading is restricted by a long water residence time.																			0071-1128		3-510-47053-2				1998	51						157	167																WOS:000078414300011

To understand effects of seasonal water quality changes on the ostracod species diversity and occurrences in Lake Egirdir (Isparta, Turkey), a total of 23 ostracod taxa (10 live species, 13 taxa) were collected from ten stations in the lake during three years of seasonal samplings from 2016 to 2018. Six taxa (Candona candida, C. cf. weltneri, Fabaeformiscandona breuili, Heterocypris incongruens, Ilyocypris decipiens, Limnocythere inopinata) are new reports for the lake. There was no significant difference between the numbers of species found from littoral and pelagic zones. The number of ostracods were higher (4 live, 14 taxa) in winter seasons than the spring (5 live, 10 taxa), summer (4 live, 9 taxa) and fall (8 live, 5 taxa) seasons. Ostracod Watch Model illustrated that Physocypria kraepelini, Neglecandona neglecta and Darwinula stevensoni showed similar seasonal occurrences in almost all seasons during the study. Of these, P. kraepelini was the most abundant species while the others were relatively rare and/or very scarce in their occurrence and abundance values. The mean value of the dissolved oxygen was significantly different between pelagic and littoral zones (p < 0.05). The CCA diagram displayed 84.4% of the correlation between eight species and five ecological variables (water temperature, ammonium, pH, dissolved oxygen, depth). Two species (P. kraepelini and F. breuili) and D. stevensoni showed significantly negative correlation with NH4 and pH, respectively. Species with similar optimum values seemed to have similar ecological and/or habitat preferences along with similar seasonal occurrence patterns. Results point to a reverse relationship between ecological tolerance and optimum estimates of the species. Thus, ostracods with a narrow tolerance range can be considered good indicator species for the water quality estimates. Accordingly, our measurements exhibited that Lake Egirdir is mainly dominated by NO3-N and NH4-N, suggesting a critical reduction in water quality values. Compared with the fossil ostracods, finding six live of 12 fossil species during the present study provides supportive evidence that aquatic conditions of the lake have been declining since the Holocene age. Indeed, dominance of cosmoecious species and absence of several rare species can also be other supportive evidence of the lake water quality decline.					; Yağcı, Meral/AAY-6875-2021; KÜLKÖYLÜOĞLU, OKAN/A-6441-2018; Bulut, Cafer/JCP-1503-2023	Bulut, Cafer/0000-0002-5525-170X; CINAR, Sakir/0000-0002-1893-1116; KULKOYLUOGLU, OKAN/0000-0003-4712-5612; Yagci, Abdulkadir/0000-0002-7897-1734; Apaydin Yagci, Meral/0000-0002-2108-1853													0006-3088	1336-9563				MAR	2023	78	3					755	769		10.1007/s11756-022-01267-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11756-022-01267-5		DEC 2022											WOS:000895656900003

Modifications to trapping protocols that increase trap effectiveness should contribute to this eradication effort. Between October 1996 and May 1997 and between September 1997 and April 1998, we compared trap effectiveness, indicated by the numbers of captured weevils, in relation to selected habitat types. Each study period was divided into fall, winter, and spring seasons. Traps were closely associated with seven habitat types, including four types with prominent erect vegetation (brush-lined irrigation canal, brush, sugarcane, and resaca or ox-bow lake) and three types with only low-growing or sparse erect vegetation (irrigation drainage canal, unimproved pasture, and fallow fields). Captures of male and female weevils were statistically similar regardless of season or trapping habitat. Although captures differed significantly among habitats, these differences varied among seasons. Trapping habitats with prominent vegetational features generally produced higher weekly captures of weevils than habitats lacking these features. Also, captures in traps associated with prominent vegetation indicated seasonal differences in weevil activity, with highest captures occurring during the fall. Traps associated with habitats lacking prominent vegetation did not statistically demonstrate seasonal differences. Our results indicate that immediate trap surroundings strongly influence the effectiveness of the boll weevil pheromone trap. These results also suggest that effectiveness of current trapping programs may be improved through purposeful association of traps with selected vegetational features.																			0022-0493					JUN	2006	99	3					752	756											16813308					WOS:000238234500023
J	Faure, H; Walter, RC; Grant, DR				Faure, H; Walter, RC; Grant, DR			The coastal oasis: ice age springs on emerged continental shelves	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE					Symposium on Global Carbon Cycle and Its Changes over Glacial-Intergiacial Cycles	1999	STRASBOURG, FRANCE					As ice caps expanded during each of the last five glaciations, sea level fell at least 120 m below current levels, exposing continental shelves worldwide to create vast areas of new land. As a result of this exposure, the ecology, climate, pedology, and geology of global shorelines were dramatically transformed, which in turn altered the carbon cycle and biodynamics of this new landmass. In this paper, we focus on a little-known hydrogeological phenomenon that may have had profound influences on biodiversity, human evolution, and carbon storage during periods of severe climatic stress of the Pleistocene Ice Ages. We propose that freshwater springs appeared on emerged continental shelves because falling sea level not only drew down and steepened the coastal water table gradient, thus increasing the hydrostatic head on inland groundwater aquifers, but also removed up to 120 m of hydrostatic pressure on the shelf, further enhancing groundwater flow. We call this phenomenon the "coastal oasis", a model based on three well-established facts. (1) In all coastal areas of the world, continental aquifers discharge a continuous flow of fresh water to the oceans, (2) Many submarine sedimentary and morphological features, as well as seepages and flow of fresh water, are known on and below the shelves from petroleum explorations, deep-sea drilling programs, and mariners' observations. (3) Hydraulic principles (Darcy's law) predict increased groundwater flow at the coast when sea level drops because the piezometric head increases by the equivalent depth of sea-level lowering. Sea level is presently in a relatively high interglacial position. Direct observation and verification of our model is difficult and must rely on explorations of terrain that are now deeply submerged on continental shelves. For this reason, we draw parallels between our predicted model and simple, well-exposed terrestrial hydrological systems, such as present-day springs that appear on the exposed shores of lakes whose free-air water levels fell during periods of aridity. Such modem examples are seen in the Caspian Sea and Dead Sea, the Afar Depression, and the Sahara Desert. These modem analogues demonstrate the likelihood that underground water will be more abundant on emerged shelves during sea-level fall, causing springs, oases, and wetlands to appear. Our model creates an apparent paradox: in tropical and subtropical arid lands, such as most of Africa, sea-level fall during hyperarid glacial phases would produce abundant fresh water flow onto emerged continental shelves as the continental interior desiccated. Thus, emergent shoreline springs provided new habitats for terrestrial vegetation and animals displaced from the interior by increasingly and conditions, shrinking ecosystems, and dwindling water supplies, Such a scenario would have had a profound influence on the vegetation that spreads naturally to colonize the emerged shelves during glacio-eustatic sea-level lowstands, as well as creating new habitats for terrestrial mammals, including early humans.

The PM2.5 ranged from 5.7 to 149.7 mu g m(-3), and it was predominately crustal material (similar to 40% on average). The combined mass of eight water-soluble inorganic ions ranged from 1.0 to 41.5 mu g m(-3), with the largest contributions from SO42-, NO3-, and Ca2+. Low abundances of organic carbon (OC, range: 1.0 to 8.2 mu g m(-3)) and elemental carbon (EC, 0.2 to 2.3 mu g m(-3)) were found in QHL. Weak seasonality in the OC/EC ratio (4.5 +/- 2.0) indicated simple and stable sources for carbonaceous particles. The water-soluble ions, OC and EC accounted for similar to 30%, 10% and 2% of the PM2.5, respectively. Water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC, range: 0.5 to 4.3 mu g m(-3)) accounted for 47.8% of the OC. Both OC and WSOC were positively correlated with water-soluble K+ (r=0.70 and 0.73 respectively), an indicator of biomass burning. Higher WSOC and stronger correlations between WSOC and EC in spring and winter compared with summer and autumn are evidence for primary biomass burning aerosols. The concentrations of mass and major compositions were 2-10 times higher than those for some TP or continental background sites but much lower than urban areas. Compared with particles produced from burning yak dung (a presumptive source material), PM2.5 had higher SO42-/OC ratios. The higher ratios were presumed as a result of fossil fuel combustion. After excluding data for dust storms events, the relative percentages of OM, EC, K+, NH4+, NO3-and mineral dust showed little difference among seasons despite different monsoons dominated in four seasons; implying that the PM2.5 sources were relatively stable. The results from QHL evidently reflect regional characteristics of the aerosol.

Community composition and migration chronology of shorebirds using the saline lakes of the Southern Great Plains, USA	JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY												Shorebirds migrating through the Southern Great Plains (SGP), USA, use freshwater playas and saline lakes as stopovers. The importance of playas is well documented, but the role of saline lakes is not clearly understood. During 2002 and 2003, we conducted surveys to determine the extent to which the saline lakes serve as stopovers. Twenty-eight species were recorded, and total seasonal abundance ranged from 6779 to 29,924 birds. Potential shorebird abundance for extant saline lakes was estimated at 37,000-71,000 shorebirds annually. American Avocets (Recurvirostra americana), Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri), Baird's Sandpipers (C bairdi), Least Sandpipers (C minutilla), Snowy Plovers (Charadrius alexandrinus), Killdeer (Charadrius vociferus), and Wilson's Phalaropes (Phalaropus tricolor) were the most abundant species. Community composition of shorebirds differed between saline lakes and regional freshwater playas. Peak spring abundance was generally in April, whereas summer/fall migration was more protracted and shorebird abundance peaked during 6-8 weeks in August and September. Migration chronologies differed among morphologically similar species, and among representative species from different guilds. Such patterns of temporal separation permit partitioning of resources by shorebirds migrating through the SGP. The saline lakes of the SGP should be regarded as stopover sites of regional and international value. To ensure that saline lakes function as stopovers and to help maintain those unique communities that inhabit them, conservation of saline takes should focus on preserving spring flows and conserving water.																			0273-8570	1557-9263				FAL	2006	77	4					372	383		10.1111/j.1557-9263.2006.00067.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1557-9263.2006.00067.x													WOS:000242441900004

Therefore, high-resolution sedimentary records of past North Atlantic storm flooding are required. This multi-proxy study reconstructs storm-induced overwash processes from coastal lake sediments on the Shetland Islands using grain-size and geochemical data, and the re-analysis of historical data. The chronostratigraphy is based on Bayesian age-depth modelling using accelerator mass spectrometry 14C and 137Cs data. A high XRF-based Si/Ti ratio and the unimodal grain-size distribution link the sand layers to the beach and thus storm-induced overwash events. Periods with more frequent storm flooding occurred 980-1050, 1150-1300, 1450-1550, 1820-1900 and 1950-2000 ce, which is largely consistent with a positive North Atlantic Oscillation mode. The Little Ice Age (1400-1850 ce) shows a gap of major sand layers suggesting a southward shift of storm tracks and a seasonal variance with more storm floods in spring and autumn. Warmer phases shifted winter storm tracks towards the north-east Atlantic, indicating a possible trend for future storm-track changes and increased storm flooding in the northern North Sea region.					; Engel, Max/H-1818-2011; Koutsodendris, Andreas/G-8966-2013; Hansteen, Thor H./B-9228-2019; Heyvaert, Vanessa/AHA-3161-2022; Hansteen, Thor/B-9228-2019	Heyvaert, Vanessa/0000-0001-7382-0120; Kempf, Philipp/0000-0001-8626-141X; Engel, Max/0000-0002-2271-4229; Hess, Katharina/0000-0002-1621-5466; Koutsodendris, Andreas/0000-0003-4236-7508; Hansteen, Thor H./0000-0003-1991-5107; Dawson, Susan/0000-0001-8115-4551; Vakhrameeva, Polina/0000-0002-3660-2455; 													0267-8179	1099-1417				JAN	2024	39	1					37	53		10.1002/jqs.3568	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jqs.3568		SEP 2023											WOS:001093102700001

Results indicated that CDOM absorption of ice samples was lower compared to water samples. CDOM absorption also showed significant spatial variation but not temporal variation. In contrast, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations showed obvious temporal characteristics. A stronger linear relationship was found between CDOM absorption and DOC concentration in winter (water, R (2) = 0.95, p < 0.001; ice, R (2) = 0.85, p < 0.001) compared to samples from other seasons (April, R (2) = 0.51, p < 0.01; May, R (2) = 0.34, p < 0.05; September, R (2) = 0.45, p < 0.01). CDOM fluorescence varied over a large range across seasons, with the highest levels observed in January at the Xisha River (XSR). Moreover, strong linear relationships were also observed between CDOM absorption and fluorescence intensity at 355 nm [Fn(355)] in January (R (2) = 0.87, p < 0.001), May (R (2) = 0.76, p < 0.001) and September (R (2) = 0.94, p < 0.001). Also based on study findings, CDOM fluorophores identified by 3-D excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) illustrated that the rivers across the Liaohe Delta were seriously polluted by anthropogenic disturbances, exhibiting strong protein-like fluorescence of CDOM in the water column. In addition, the results also confirm that absorption and EEMs would be useful tools for tracing the sources and characteristics of CDOM and monitoring riverine water quality.					zhao, ying/ISA-2502-2023; Du, Jia/ADR-8738-2022	Shao, Tiantian/0000-0002-8681-7438; 													0277-5212	1943-6246				MAR	2016	36			1			S181	S192		10.1007/s13157-014-0622-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-014-0622-2													WOS:000371706900017

Energy density (kJ g(-1)) of somatic tissue increased markedly from June to September, then declined to low levels by the following spring. Consequently, energy mass (kJ) of somatic tissue increased to September and then declined slowly until March. Ovarian growth began in October, and the size of the ovaries was maximal in April, just before spawning in May. The energy density of ovaries, however, increased to a peak in December, and then declined. The increase in ovary size in the winter, therefore, resulted largely from an allocation of tissue of low energy density. Fecundity and gonad size were correlated with somatic and gonadal energy density. A bioenergetics model was used to describe the monthly allocations of energy to respiration, growth, excretion, and reproduction. Most direct reproductive costs (80%) were incurred from September to December, corresponding to the cycle in the activity of the liver. Energy acquired in the early summer may be critical for determining maturation, fecundity, and egg quality. From 1978 to 1990, <80% of the females from the western and west-central basins of Lake Erie were classed as spent in July.					; Collins, Nicholas/F-2704-2010	Collins, Nicholas/0000-0002-6901-6604; 													0022-1112					JUL	2000	57	1					122	133		10.1006/jfbi.2000.1293	http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/jfbi.2000.1293													WOS:000088508800010

Channel widths of macro-meanders can be 15 times larger than the recent meanders of the same rivers. Palaeolandscape and palaeohydrological reconstructions show that these periglacial river channels were formed under conditions of high spring water flow, up to eight times greater than the modern discharges, when the flow coefficient was close to 0.9-1.0 due to presence of permafrost, summers were dry and streams lacked ground water supply. Permafrost degradation increased soil permeability in spring and increased ground water flow in summer, causing a decrease of annual flow (due mainly to the flood flow decrease in spring). As a result, large periglacial channels were abandoned and transformed into lakes and bogs. Late Holocene channels have much smaller channel widths and meander lengths. These were formed under conditions of lower annual flows and much steadier flow regime.

Influenza A viruses in gulls in landfills and freshwater habitats in Minnesota, United States	FRONTIERS IN GENETICS												Introduction: The unpredictable evolution of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) presents an ongoing threat to agricultural production and public and wildlife health. Severe outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses in US poultry and wild birds since 2022 highlight the urgent need to understand the changing ecology of AIV. Surveillance of gulls in marine coastal environments has intensified in recent years to learn how their long-range pelagic movements potentially facilitate inter-hemispheric AIV movements. In contrast, little is known about inland gulls and their role in AIV spillover, maintenance, and long-range dissemination.Methods: To address this gap, we conducted active AIV surveillance in ring-billed gulls (Larus delawarensis) and Franklin's gulls (Leucophaeus pipixcan) in Minnesota's natural freshwater lakes during the summer breeding season and in landfills during fall migration (1,686 samples).Results: Whole-genome AIV sequences obtained from 40 individuals revealed three-lineage reassortants with a mix of genome segments from the avian Americas lineage, avian Eurasian lineage, and a global "Gull" lineage that diverged more than 50 years ago from the rest of the AIV global gene pool. No poultry viruses contained gull-adapted H13, NP, or NS genes, pointing to limited spillover. Geolocators traced gull migration routes across multiple North American flyways, explaining how inland gulls imported diverse AIV lineages from distant locations. Migration patterns were highly varied and deviated far from assumed "textbook" routes.Discussion: Viruses circulating in Minnesota gulls during the summer breeding season in freshwater environments reappeared in autumn landfills, evidence of AIV persistence in gulls between seasons and transmission between habitats. Going forward, wider adoption of technological advances in animal tracking devices and genetic sequencing is needed to expand AIV surveillance in understudied hosts and habitats.

A major inter-disciplinary observational program was initiated to study the importance of these episodic events on nearshore-offshore transport and the subsequent ecological consequences. In this paper, high density observations of winds and currents made during the winter of 2000 are analyzed to study the variability of the coastal circulation and the physical mechanisms resulting in the alongshore and cross-shore transport in the lake. The measurements of currents show the signature of forced two-gyre circulation in the southern basin. During northerly storm episodes the combination of directly wind forced currents and northward propagating vorticity wave generate significant offshore transport in this region.

Following major restoration programmes during the 1970s and early 1980s, involving massive efforts to reduce nutrient loads and pollution in the lake, the water quality has improved over the past two decades. This can be inferred from the increase in the nitrate: phosphate ratio, the intensification of the "clear-water phase" (i.e. the increase in the water column transparency in spring), and the reduction in the total phosphorus and chlorophyll a concentrations. However, blooms of the filamentous, phycoerythrin-rich, non-nitrogen fixing and hepatotoxic cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens have occurred since 1996 and have been maintained subsequently, at least during summer and autumn periods. Nutrients (especially phosphorus) are usually thought to be one of the most important factors responsible for cyanobacterial blooms, and so the question is asked if this bloom is a paradoxical outcome of the restoration programs? Using a large set of data taken from surveys of Lac du Bourget, from the literature, and from recent laboratory experiments, and also using field data for the neighboring Lake Geneva, we propose a realistic scenario to account for the population dynamics of the cyanobacterium and the occurrence and maintenance of the bloom in Lac du Bourget. The characteristics of the lake (high water column stability, deepening of the nutrient-depleted layer during the last decade, a long water residence time), local conditions (the nutrient load and charge) and global changes (global warming) all had to be taken into account to explain this bloom. We suggest that the success of P. rubescens in Lac du Bourget is probably due to increased transparency and a longer stratified period following (1) the restriction of other phytoplankton species following reduced phosphorus, which has allowed P. rubescens to make use of organic phosphorus to improve its competitiveness; (2) warmer than average winter/spring periods allowing an earlier water stratification and in fine a competitive advantage to P. rubescens; (3) lower than average surface irradiance, which has also given the low-light preferring P. rubescens an advantage. Finally, this study highlights the importance of long-term data sets in attempting to elucidate the global causes of a major ecological problem (such as this cyanobacterial bloom) and impacts with regard to the function and use of freshwater ecosystems.

Dreissenid veliger dynamics along a nearshore to offshore transect in Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Dreissenid mussel veligers compose a substantial component of pelagic biomass in the Great Lakes, yet their dynamics are poorly understood. To evaluate seasonal, spatial, and inter-annual variation in veliger density, we used a 64-mu m mesh plankton net (2008, 2013-2016) and a 153-mu m mesh plankton net (2007-2016) to collect dreissenid veligers at nearshore (15-25 m depth), transitional (45 m) and offshore (93-110 m) sites in southeast Lake Michigan during March-December. We also evaluated trends in density of recently settled mussels relative to veliger abundance and the density of the standing stock of adult mussels. Veliger density peaked during both summer and fall at all sites, but peak densities in summer were generally higher nearshore, whereas peak densities in the fall were generally higher offshore. The density of veligers in the 153-mu m net was overall 28% of that in the 64-mu m net, but there was high variability in this comparison among months. Smaller veligers were much more abundant in the 64-mu m net, but there was little difference in the size distribution and abundance between nets for the 210-300 mu m size classes. Thus, the 153-mu m net could still be a useful tool for assessing density trends of larger veligers just prior to their settlement. Newly settled mussels (<= 2 mm) were most abundant in summer or fall at the nearshore and offshore sites but were nearly absent at the transitional site despite the high density of veligers there. Factors other than veliger density must play an important role in mussel recruitment. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of International Association for Great lakes Research.

A maximum flooded time index was calculated and the overlay analysis with seasonal home range data was employed. The results showed: (1) in seasons, the home range size of winter was the largest while it was the smallest in summer. It was also found that home range of dry and wet periods in 2017 was larger than in 2016 for the same period; (2) The milu population lived together in the released area. They even moved to outside of Dongting Lake in summer and moved back in autumn with the water level change. The milu population separated into several groups during the movement process; (3) By combining home range and the maximum flooded time index map, the milu population habitat covered various types of land use and active area when water source was included. While managing the two types of land use these should be connected by vegetation and should not be too far apart. In general, the home range distribution and size changed with the changing periods i.e. dry period and wet period. Available space, food resources, and shelter were influenced by water level variation in Dongting Lake, and water level may be the main factor affecting the distribution and home range size of milu population, indirectly utilizing the habitat.

Heavy metal distribution and water quality characterization of water bodies in Louisiana's Lake Pontchartrain Basin, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The seasonal variation in physico-chemical properties, anions, and the heavy metal (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn) concentration was evaluated in water from nine different rivers in Lake Pontchartrain Basin, Louisiana, USA. The water quality parameters were compared with toxicity reference values (TRV), US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) drinking/aquatic life protection, and WHO standards. Among physico-chemical properties, pH, DO, and turbidity were high during spring, while, EC, temperature, and DOC were high during summer and vice versa. The anion study revealed that the concentrations of F-, Cl-, and NO3- were higher during summer and Br- and SO4- were higher during spring. Our research findings showed anion concentration decreased in the order of Cl- > SO4- > NO3- > Br- > F-, in accordance with the global mean anion concentration. The dissolved heavymetals (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb) except Zn were higher during spring than summer. None of the rivers showed any Cd pollution for both seasons. Co showed higher concentrations in Amite River, Mississippi River, Industrial Canal, and Lacombe Bayou during summer. The Cr concentration was higher than WHO drinking water standards, implicating water unsuitability for drinking purposes in all the rivers associated with the Lake Pontchartrain Basin. Cu showed no pollution risk for the study area. Mn and Co were similar to concentration in Lacombe Bayou, Liberty Bayou, Blind River, and Industrial Canal. Mn levels were greater than WHO standards for the Tickfaw River, Tangipahoa River, and Blind River in both seasons. Blind River, Tangipahoa River, Tickfaw River, and Amite River will require more monitoring for determining possible Mn pollution. Ni content in river water during both seasons showed low pollution risk. Liberty Bayou and Industrial Canal concentrations were closer to the WHO regulatory standards, indicating possible risk of Pb pollution in these water bodies. The Zn content was near the USEPA aquatic life standards in summer for all water bodies. None of the rivers showed any risk associated with Cd, Co, Cu, and Ni levels but medium to higher risk to aquatic life from Cr and Zn for both seasons for most of the rivers. Metal fractionation revealed the decreasing order of inert > labile > organic. The high inert fraction in the rivers under study reflects the major contribution of natural sources in Lake Pontchartrain Basin. The labile and organic forms of Cd, Cu, Ni, and Zn pose potential higher risk to the aquatic life in the Lake Pontchartrain Basin.

J	HICKMAN, M				HICKMAN, M			SEASONAL SUCCESSION, STANDING CROP AND DETERMINANTS OF PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY OF THE PHYTOPLANKTON OF MINISTIK LAKE, ALBERTA, CANADA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Ministik Lake (longitude 113.degree.01''; latitude 53.degree.21''), a well-mixed, shallow (mean depth 1.83 m), eutrophic lake is characterized by eutrophic chlorococcalean and cyanophycean phytoplankton associations and little change in standing crop size with increasing depth. Standing crops and primary productivity are low during the winter but pronounced spring and late summer/early autumn maxima occur. Mean yearly areal standing crop (.SIGMA.B) and primary productivity (.SIGMA.A) were 199.2 mg/m2 chlorophyll a and 319.5 mg C/h per m2, respectively. Annual productivity was estimated at 1399.6 g C/m2 yr. The mean increase in the extinction coefficient (.epsilon.) per unit increase in standing crop (B) was 0.03 ln units/m. High non-algal light attenuation (.epsilon.q) occurred averaging 46%, which prevented the ratio B.epsilon. from attaining more than 74.2% of the theoretical maximum, except once when self-shading occurred. Insignificant relationships existed between B (mg/m3 chlorophyll a) and Amax (mg C/h per m3), .SIGMA.A and .SIGMA.B and .SIGMA.A and B. Close correlations existed between .SIGMA.A and Amax/.epsilon. and .SIGMA.A and I0 (W/m2). The depth of the euphotic zone (zeu) varied between 0.6-2.0 m; the average relationship between zeu and .epsilon. was zeu = 3.78/.epsilon., and the mean standing crop in the euphotic zone represented 58.3% of the theoretical maximum. The .epsilon.q values made the model of Talling inapplicable to this lake. The Q10 value for the lake was 1.20. .vphi.max [maximum photosynthetic rate] was closely related to temperature and irradiance and was depressed by high pH values. Growth of the cyanophycean algae was correlated with temperature, chlorophycean algae with phosphate-phosphorus and temperature and the diatoms with dissolved silica and phosphate-phosphorus, but only in the case of Chaetoceros elmorii did any nutrient appear limiting. Indirect evidence that free CO2 limited photosynthetic rates is provided by the .vphi.max:pH relationship.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1979	64	2					105	121		10.1007/BF00023186	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00023186													WOS:A1979HA98500002
J	Müller, R; Stadelmann, P				Müller, R; Stadelmann, P			Fish habitat requirements as the basis for rehabilitation of eutrophic lakes by oxygenation	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												Eutrophic lakes often suffer from hypolimnetic oxygen depletion during summer and autumn, and the accumulation of reduced substances in the hypolimnion. The space fish can occupy is therefore reduced, and the potential for fish kills caused by toxic algae and the upwelling of anoxic water increases. Fish, such as coregonids, require at least 4 mg O-2 L-1 to survive in the long-term. This critical level has been postulated as one of the major goals for the rehabilitation of several eutrophic Swiss lakes. It was predicted that this oxygen criterion would reduce phosphorus release from the sediment and increase phosphorus retention, and re-establish natural reproduction of coregonids. Rehabilitation measures applied to three eutrophic Swiss lakes were hypolimnetic oxygenation during summer stratification, and artificial mixing using compressed air to enhance circulation in winter. These lake-internal measures carried out for more than 15 years showed the 4 mg O-2 L-1 criterion can be achieved most of the time. The measures have led to an expansion of habitat for oxygen-dependent organisms to greater depths. However, other goals were not attained, such as increasing phosphorus retention by the sediment. In addition, natural reproduction of coregonids could not be re-established. Excessive oxygen consumption by the sediment, arising from the decomposition of deposited organic matter produced during summer, caused death by suffocation of coregonid eggs developing on the sediment. Thus rehabilitation of eutrophic lakes by oxygenating the hypolimnion and artificial mixing will not be successful, unless it is accompanied by lowering the nutrient loading and thus primary production and oxygen consumption by the sediment. Nevertheless, positive effects of lake aeration were the expansion of living space for fish and benthic invertebrates, and the prevention of fish kills by upwelling anoxic hypolimnetic water.																			0969-997X	1365-2400				JUN	2004	11	3-4					251	260		10.1111/j.1365-2400.2004.00393.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2400.2004.00393.x													WOS:000221693800013

During periods of high S77 discharge in spring and early summer, cyanobacteria biomass dominated the phytoplankton community, including blooms of the harmful algal bloom (HAB) species Raphidiopsis raciborskii, Limnothrix redekei and Microcystis aeruginosa. During periods of low discharges from the lake, in mid-summer and autumn, water inputs to the canal came primarily from tributaries in the watershed surrounding the C-43. Phytoplankton biomass decreased, but the relative importance of dinoflagellates increased, including a bloom in July. The dinoflagellate community included Ceratium, Durinskia baltica, Glochidinium penardiforme, Gymnodinium fuscum, Parvodinium goslaviense, Parvodinium umbonatum/inconspicuum complex, Peridiniopsis quadridens, Woloszynskia reticulata, and an unidentified thecate and athecate species. D. baltica and P. goslaviense were recorded for the first time in Florida. Data was also obtained on water temperature, conductivity, fluorescent dissolved organic matter, chlorophyll a , total nitrogen, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, total phosphorus, PO4, discharge rates from water control structures, and water residence times. Results show that temporal shifts in the sources and rates of water inputs to the C-43 influence the character of environmental conditions that define phytoplankton composition and biomass in the canal. This suggests that management of discharges can play a role in mitigating HABs in the canal and downstream coastal environments receiving water from the canal.

Understanding its response to nutrient and hydro-meteorological factors is vital for managing eutrophication in Lake Taihu, one of China's largest freshwater lakes. This study investigates Chla dynamics in relation to nutrient levels (nitrogen, phosphorus, etc.), hydro-meteorological parameters (temperature, wind, precipitation, etc.), and previous season factors (the values of the factors mentioned above in the previous season) in Lake Taihu. By using various statistical analyzing methods (such as partial least squares regression) and introducing two new indices (similarity and influence), this research witnessed an upward trend in Chla concentration over the past three decades. And the similarity index between predicted and observed results is 0.8425, if all factors are considered, while the similarity index decreases by 6.94% and 33.27% when considering only current or previous factors, respectively. This demonstrates that antecedent seasonal parameters exert some influence on the developmental trend of Chla concentrations in Lake Taihu. When temporal seasonality is abstracted from consideration, air temperature emerges as the predominant forcing factor governing Chla dynamics. Seasonal correlations indicate that, in spring and summer, to control eutrophication and algae bloom in Lake Taihu, a comprehensive approach considering multiple factors is necessary, but the most important action should be controlling biomass of phytoplankton, while in autumn, reducing phosphorus input is crucial. This study provides not only quantitative analyses of the seasonal trends in Chla concentration but also detailed and actionable insights for sustainable freshwater ecosystem management in Lake Taihu.

DISCHARGE AND NUTRIENT TRANSPORT BETWEEN LAKES IN A HYDROLOGICALLY COMPLEX AREA OF VOYAGEURS NATIONAL PARK, MINNESOTA, 2010-2012	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												An acoustic Doppler velocity meter (ADVM) was deployed in the narrows between Namakan and Kabetogama Lakes in Voyageurs National Park, Minnesota, from November 3, 2010, through October 3, 2012. The ADVM can account for wind, seiche, and changing flow direction in hydrologically complex areas. The objectives were to (1) estimate discharge and document the direction of water flow, (2) assess whether specific conductance can be used to determine flow direction, and (3) document nutrient and chlorophyll a concentrations at the narrows. The discharge direction through the narrows was seasonal. Water generally flowed out of Kabetogama Lake and into Namakan Lake throughout the ice-covered season. During spring, water flow was generally from Namakan Lake to Kabetogama Lake. During the summer and fall, the water flowed in both directions, affected in part by wind. Water flowed into Namakan Lake 70% of water year 2011 and 56% of water year 2012. Nutrient and chlorophyll a concentrations were highest during the summer months when water-flow direction was unpredictable. The use of an ADVM was effective for assessing flow direction and provided flow direction under ice. The results indicated the eutrophic Kabetogama Lake may have a negative effect on the more pristine Namakan Lake. The results also provide data on the effects of the current water-level management plan and may help determine if adjustments are necessary to help protect the aquatic ecosystem of Voyageurs National Park.																			1093-474X	1752-1688				JUN	2016	52	3					578	591		10.1111/1752-1688.12412	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.12412													WOS:000385007100002

Vertical segregation and phylogenetic characterization of ammonia-oxidizing Archaea in a deep oligotrophic lake	ISME JOURNAL												Freshwater habitats have been identified as one of the largest reservoirs of archaeal genetic diversity, with specific lineages of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) populations different from soils and seas. The ecology and biology of lacustrine AOA is, however, poorly known. In the present study, vertical changes in archaeal abundance by CARD-FISH, quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyses and identity by clone libraries were correlated with environmental parameters in the deep glacial high-altitude Lake Redon. The lake is located in the central Spanish Pyrenees where atmospheric depositions are the main source of reactive nitrogen. Strong correlations were found between abundance of thaumarchaeotal 16S rRNA gene, archaeal amoA gene and nitrite concentrations, indicating an ammonium oxidation potential by these microorganisms. The bacterial amoA gene was not detected. Three depths with potential ammonia-oxidation activity were unveiled along the vertical gradient, (i) on the top of the lake in winter-spring (that is, the 0 degrees C slush layers above the ice-covered sheet), (ii) at the thermocline and (iii) the bottom waters in summer-autumn. Overall, up to 90% of the 16S rRNA gene sequences matched Thaumarchaeota, mostly from both the Marine Group (MG) 1.1a (Nitrosoarchaeum-like) and the sister clade SAGMGC - 1 (Nitrosotalea-like). Clone-libraries analysis showed the two clades changed their relative abundances with water depth being higher in surface and lower in depth for SAGMGC - 1 than for MG 1.1a, reflecting a vertical phylogenetic segregation. Overall, the relative abundance and recurrent appearance of SAGMGC - 1 suggests a significant environmental role of this clade in alpine lakes. These results expand the set of ecological and thermal conditions where Thaumarchaeota are distributed, unveiling vertical positioning in the water column as a key factor to understand the ecology of different thaumarchaeotal clades in lacustrine environments.

Long-Term Dynamics of Chlorophyll in Plankton of Different Sites in a Large Plain Reservoir	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												On the basis of field observations in 2009-2019, the seasonal and long-term dynamics of chlorophyll at six standard stations of the Rybinsk Reservoir is considered. The fluorescence method is used to determine chlorophyll. The average chlorophyll content at stations varies from the minimum 3.5-10.8 to the maximum 16.9-40.5 mu g/L in different years and from 12.0 at station 5 (Sredny Dvor) up to 21.6 mu g/L at station 2 (Mologa) on average for the entire period. The seasonal dynamics of chlorophyll is characterized by spring; summer; and, in some years, autumn maxima. With the same type of seasonal dynamics, the change in chlorophyll at the stations is to varying degrees coupled in the years of observation and is most often correlated in neighboring areas. Significant differences in the amount of chlorophyll at the stations are observed during surveys carried out within one day and are determined by the complex hydrological structure of the reservoir; active dynamic processes; and, in the spring, by the thermal regime. The presence of stable large circulation zones smoothes out the spatial differences of chlorophyll, the average seasonal concentrations of which do not differ significantly at all six stations in years with an average water level, and at four stations of the Main Reach in extremely high-water years. A close correlation in long-term dynamics is revealed for the average chlorophyll concentrations for the growing season at six stations, as well as at each station and the reservoir as a whole. The results of the work confirm the reliability of the data obtained for assessing the ecological state of the Rybinsk Reservoir.

Nitrate utilization by phytoplankton in Lake Superior is impaired by low nutrient (P, Fe) availability and seasonal light limitation - A cyanobacterial bioreporter study	JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												We previously developed a luminescent Synechococystis sp. strain PCC 6803 cyanobacterial bioreporter that is used as a real-time whole-cell sensor to assess nitrate assimilatory capacity in freshwaters. Applying the bioreporter assay to Lake Superior, a system whose nitrate levels have increased 6-fold since 1900, we investigated factors that constrain nitrate utilization in this oligotrophic system. Clean sampling methods were used to collect water from Lake Superior during spring and summer 2004, and nitrate utilization was measured by monitoring bioreporter luminescence. Bioreporter response was monitored during experiments in which the lake water was amended with nutrients and incubated under light regimes simulating integrated spring and summer mixing depths. These studies demonstrated that nitrate utilization was enhanced at most stations following addition of phosphorus (P). Moreover, at many stations, addition of iron (Fe) enhanced the P effect. Strength-of-effect statistical analysis provided the individual contribution of P and Fe toward stimulating bioreporter response. In general, distance from shore and season were not good predictors of nitrate assimilatory capacity. Manipulation of light flux during bioreporter experiments also showed that light intensities experienced during spring mixing are likely insufficient to saturate the rate of nitrate utilization. Overall, these data suggest that P-limited algae are deficient in their ability to assimilate nitrate in Lake Superior. Furthermore, we suggest that a secondary limitation for Fe may occur that further constrains nitrate drawdown. Lastly, during spring, light fluxes are sufficiently low to prevent maximal nitrate utilization, even in the absence of nutrient limitation.

In this study, eight SPEs based on four different algorithms, namely, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis 3B42, Climate Prediction Center morphing technique (CMORPH), Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP), and Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Imagery Using Artificial Neural Networks are evaluated by using an improved evaluation system over central Asia with respect to their performance in capturing precipitation occurrence and magnitude. Both satellite-only and gauge-corrected versions are assessed against gauge-gridded reference from June 2001 to May 2006. Main results show that all SPEs have difficulties in accurately estimating mountainous precipitation with great overestimation/underestimation in both winter and summer. In winter, CMORPH products fail to capture events over ice-/snow-covered region. In summer, large overestimations dominated by positive hit bias and missed precipitation are found for all products in northern central Asia. Interestingly, 3B42 and CMORPH products show great false alarm percentages (up to 90%) over lake region, which is more significant in summer than in winter. Significant elevation-dependent errors exist in all products, especially for the high-altitude regions (>3,000 m) with missed error and hit error being the two leading errors. Satellite-only products have large systematic and random errors, while the gauge-corrected products demonstrate significant improvements in reducing random errors. Generally, the gauge-corrected GSMaP performs better than others with good skills in reducing various errors.

Similarly to other aquatic environments in the temperate zone, dominance of picocyanobacteria was observed in summer and that of picoeukaryotes in winter. The mild winter in 2006-2007, with midday water temperatures of 5-10A degrees C, resulted in large winter phytoplankton blooms (maximum chlorophyll a concentration 800 mu g l(-1)) in the shallow pans. The phytoplankton was composed of single-celled picoeukaryotes and had a maximum of 108 x 10(6) cells ml(-1) in Budos-sz,k pan, 50 x 10(6) cells ml(-1) in Kelemen-sz,k pan in April 2007, and 47 x 10(6) cells ml(-1) in Zab-sz,k pan in March 2007. In order to explain the winter dominance of picoeukaryotes, we isolated picoeukaryotic and picocyanobacterial strains and determined the temperature and light dependence of their photosynthesis. Under temperatures < 15A degrees C, the photosynthetic activity of the picoeukaryotic strain was higher and their light utilization was better than those of the picocyanobacterial strain. The results indicate that low temperature and light intensity in winter provide a competitive advantage to picoeukaryotes, while higher temperatures and light intensity are more favorable for picocyanobacteria.					; Felfoldi, Tamas/F-7856-2011	Somogyi, Boglarka/0000-0003-0900-3315; 													1386-2588	1573-5125				SEP	2009	43	3					735	744		10.1007/s10452-009-9269-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-009-9269-0													WOS:000269837500014
J	Cherkauer, KA; Sinha, T				Cherkauer, Keith A.; Sinha, Tushar			Hydrologic impacts of projected future climate change in the Lake Michigan region	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The Great Lakes are an important source of fresh water, recreation resource and transportation corridor for the Midwestern United States and Canada. The timing and quantity of fresh water inputs and how those may change under projections of future climate change are important for understanding how conditions, including river flows, and lake levels, within the region may be affected. Water quality and the density and diversity of in-stream habitats are responsive to changes in the distribution of daily streamflow, something not typically included in studies of climate change impacts. Projections of precipitation and air temperature changes in the four states surrounding Lake Michigan from the IPCC AR4 were downscaled and bias-corrected before being used to drive a large-scale hydrology model and produce maps of surface runoff and baseflow. These were then routed along drainage networks for regional rivers, and hydrologic metrics describing aspects of the distribution of daily flows important for hydrology and in-stream ecology were computed. The impact of regional climate change projections on early- (water years 2010-2039) and mid-century (water years 2040-2069) streamflow was highly variable; however, by the late-century period (water years 2070-2099) annual streamflow was found to have increased in all rivers. Seasonally, winter and spring flows increased significantly by the late-century period, but summer flows become more variable with a decrease in low-flows and an increase in peak-flows. The number of days with flows above the annual mean-flow (T-Qmean) decreased in summer, but flashiness (R-B Index) increased. (c) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Energy density was directly measured using an adiabatic bomb calorimeter in samples collected in autumn, spring and summer. Dipterans belonging to the genus Chironomus were the most common and representative invertebrates within the study area. Starting from these measures, a predictive model based on the relationship between energy density and percentage of dry weight was developed, validated and applied to build a multi-annual dataset. This model was used to investigate seasonal energy density trends on longer time-scale, in relation to physical and chemical features, weather conditions and decomposition dynamics. The used approach allowed to build a 3-year dataset and to identify clear seasonal trends; moreover, the application of the model highlighted patterns in relation to precipitation regime, decomposition dynamics and the effects due to variations of these features in the investigated temporary detritus-based system over a multi-annual scale.

Oligochaeta worms can be found in association with snails of this family, inhabiting the umbilicus of their shells. Due to the lack of information on the ecology of these worms, this work focused on investigating which kind of Oligochaeta species associate with the mollusk Pomacea bridgesii (Reeve, 1856). Samples were collected during winter and spring 2003 and summer 2004. From a total of 209 snails collected, the presence of Oligochaeta worms was observed in only 58 of them (27.75%). In these infected snails, 89 Oligochaeta worms were found, all belonging to the family Naididae. The species Haemonais waldvogeli Bretscher, 1900, Dero (Dero) nivea Aiyer, 1929 and Dero (Dero) sawayai Marcus, 1943 were the most abundant (43.68%, 12.32% and 10.08%, respectively). Haemonais waldvogeli was found in all of the seasons studied, what demonstrates its affinity for this kind of substrate.

The campaign was based on high-frequency recordings of hydrological and meteorological parameters and weekly samplings of nutrients and the plankton community. The collected data allowed the construction of correlation networks, which revealed that water temperature was the most important factor governing community composition, structure and succession at different trophic levels, suggesting its ubiquitous food web control. Temperature favoured phytoplanktonic flagellates (Cryptophyceae, Chrysophyceae, and Chlorophyceae) and ciliates during winter and early spring. In contrast, it favoured Bacillariophyceae, dinoflagellates, phytoplankton < 6 mu m and aloricate Choreotrichida during spring. The secondary factors were light, which influenced phytoplankton, and wind, which may regulate turbidity and the nutrient supply from land or sediment, thus affecting benthic species such as Nitzschia sp. and Uronema sp. or salinity-tolerant species such as Prorocentrum sp. The central role of temperature in structuring the co-occurrence network suggests that future global warming could deeply modify plankton communities in shallow coastal zones, affecting whole-food web functioning.					; Vidussi, Francesca/KGM-2228-2024; Scotti, Marco/B-2487-2010	Vidussi, Francesca/0000-0003-2007-9003; Scotti, Marco/0000-0002-0775-6148													2045-2322					SEP 3	2021	11	1							17675	10.1038/s41598-021-97173-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-97173-y								34480057					WOS:000695648400042
J	Bennett, VA; Lee, RE; Nauman, JS; Kukal, O				Bennett, VA; Lee, RE; Nauman, JS; Kukal, O			Selection of overwintering microhabitats used by the Arctic woollybear caterpillar, Gynaephora groenlandica	CRYOLETTERS												In extreme envirorments such as the High Arctic, climatic conditions challenge physiological tolerance of insects resulting in prolonged dormancy and extended life cycles. Therefore, the selection of suitable microhabitats for overwintering is crucial. At two field sites on Ellesmere Island, we located hibernacula (silk overwintering structures) used by the Arctic woollybear caterpillar, Gynaephora groenlandica (Wocke) (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae) during their 11 month dormancy. All hibernacula found were anchored to the base of rocks and were not associated with vegetation. Rocks may function to absorb solar radiation and re-radiate heat, accelerating localized snowmelt, thus allowing caterpillars to emerge as early as possible in spring to begin foraging. Temperatures experienced by G. groenlandica in hibernacula throughout the winter were well within their physiological tolerance range. During late summer aestivation, hibernaculum temperatures were similar to, but more stable than, nearby soil surface temperatures. Lower maximum daily hibernaculum temperatures during the warmest month (July) may reduce metabolic rates and provide some energy savings. Since hibernacula were not randomly distributed around rocks, this suggests that G. groenlandica key in on some feature of the hibernaculum site. The northeast orientation of hibernacula at Eastwind Lake corresponds to the leeward side of rocks. Therefore wind patterns may be important in hibernaculum site selection. Other potential cues that may guide selection of hibernacula sites remain unclear: no seasonal changes in preference for light or soil moisture were observed between active and dormant caterpillars, and thermotaxis could not be distinguished from thigmotaxis.																			0143-2044					MAY-JUN	2003	24	3					191	200											12908029					WOS:000184349000008

M.; Yin, Chengqing			Anammox Bacterial Abundance, Activity, and Contribution in Riparian Sediments of the Pearl River Estuary	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The hypothesis of an anammox hotspot in river riparian zones was put forward based on our investigation on freshwater ecotones for over 25 years and previous anammox research. Here we used a complementary array of methods including isotope-pairing technique, quantitative PCR assays, and 16S rRNA and hydrazine synthase gene (hzsB) clone libraries to document the spatiotemporal evidence for a high abundance zone of anammox bacteria in river riparian sediment with observed abundance of 1.3-12 x 10(6) (summer) and 1.4-20 x 10(8) (winter) hydrazine synthase gene copies g(-1), which is the highest abundance in natural environments recorded so far. Meanwhile high anammox bacterial biodiversity were detected with 'Brocadia' and 'Kuenenia' dominating. However, the high anammox bacterial abundances were not related with high activities and contributions for nitrogen gas generation. The anammox activities ranged from 0.07 to 0.15 nmol N cm(-3) h(-1) (summer) to 1.0-2.6 nmol N cm-3 h(-1) (winter) with high temporal heterogeneity. The retrieval of archaeal and bacterial amoA sequences indicated that nitrifying microbes might be the major source of nitrite for anammox bacteria in winter, while in summer the anaerobic nitrate reduction is more likely the main source. On the basis of N-15 tracing technology, it was estimated that a total loss of 0.67-9.62 g N m(-2) yr(-1) is linked to anammox in the riparian zone while denitrification contributed 96.2-170.3 g N m(-2) yr(-1) in Pearl River riparian sediments.

Effects of Harvest, Natural Mortality, and Escapement on Reservoir Walleye Populations	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Walleye Sander vitreus are commonly introduced to reservoirs and provide valued fisheries. Walleye are lost though harvest and natural mortality in all systems, but escapement may also reduce reservoir populations. However, the effects of harvest, natural mortality, and escapement loss on reservoir Walleye populations are not known. Our objective was to quantify Walleye harvest, natural mortality, and escapement in two Iowa reservoirs (Big Creek Lake and Brushy Creek Lake) to understand how these factors limit populations. We also assessed Walleye behaviors and compared them among escaped, harvested, and in-lake Walleye to determine if behavior was associated with fate. Walleye were radio-tagged beginning in October 2016 and tracked through May 2019. Telemetry was used to estimate annual core and home ranges, seasonal depth use, and movement rates. Detection histories were analyzed using a multistate capture-recapture model with environmental covariates to estimate weekly harvest, natural mortality, and escapement. Harvest was greater in Big Creek than Brushy Creek and was higher in April through July compared to other months. Natural mortality was positively related to water temperature but did not differ between systems. No Walleye escaped from Big Creek (fish barrier on spillway), but escapement at Brushy Creek (no fish barrier) was positively related to mean water levels during April. During 2017-2018, annual Walleye escapement ranged from 22% to 47% at Brushy Creek (0% at Big Creek), harvest ranged from 13% to 27%, and natural mortality ranged from 36% to 38%. Depth of habitat occupied by Walleye was shallower during spring and summer when escapement occurred, intermediate in fall, and deepest during winter. Escaped Walleye at Brushy Creek used greater depths and moved less than in-lake Walleye; however, other behaviors did not differ among Walleye groups. Our results suggest that escapement can have a larger effect than harvest on reservoir Walleye populations in systems without physical barriers, and it should be taken into consideration when managing reservoir Walleye fisheries.

J	Hastenrath, S				Hastenrath, S			Variations of East African climate during the past two centuries	CLIMATIC CHANGE												The evidence on the climatic history of East Africa over the past two centuries comprises historical accounts of lake levels, observations and analyses of glacier variations, wind and current observations in the Indian Ocean, as well as raingauge measurements. East Africa experiences its rainy seasons in boreal spring and autumn, centered around April-May and October-November; the spring rains being more abundant and the autumn rains more variable. Rains tend to be abundant/deficient with slow/fast westerlies (UEQ) and Eastward Equatorial Jet (EEJ) in the upper hydrosphere of the equatorial Indian Ocean. A drastic climatic dislocation took place during the last two decades of the l9th century, manifest in a drop of lake levels, onset of glacier recession, and acceleration of UEQ and EEJ. The decades immediately preceding 1880 featured high lake stands, extensive glaciation, and slow UEQ and EEJ, as compared to the 20th century. The onset of glacier recession in East Africa after 1880 contrasts with a start of ice shrinkage in New Guinea and the Ecuadorian Andes around the middle of the l9th century. The regional circulation regime characterized by slow UEQ and EEJ in the decades prior to 1880 was conducive to extensive ice cover along with high lake stands in East Africa, and this may account for the onset of glacier recession much later than in the other mountain regions of the equatorial zone. The evolution of East African climate over the first half of the l9th century merits further exploration.																			0165-0009	1573-1480					2001	50	1-2					209	217		10.1023/A:1010678111442	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1010678111442													WOS:000169209700008

Mosquito production in stormwater treatment devices in the Lake Tahoe Basin, California	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION												In response to increasing evidence of mosquito production in structural stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs), a collaborative project was developed to document the occurrence, species composition, and seasonal abundance of mosquitoes from selected urban and highway BMPs in the Lake Tahoe Basin, California. Structural and environmental factors associated with mosquito production in highway BMPs were identified and analyzed. Ten species of mosquitoes were collected from 47 BMPs, including Culex tarsalis, Culiseta incidens, Cs. inornata, and 7 species of Aedes. In and around South Lake Tahoe, immatures were most abundant in urban BMPs during the warmer summer and fall months, whereas natural water sources in the surrounding area harbored mosquitoes more often during the colder months of early spring. In BMPs installed along Lake Tahoe's perimeter highways, mosquitoes were observed in 11% of site visits conducted during a single season. Larval presence in highway BMPs was positively associated with water temperature and negatively associated with precipitation, sand, and unspecified organic matter. The significance of mosquito production in BMPs of the Tahoe Basin and the potential for increased transmission of mosquito-borne disease are discussed.																			8756-971X					MAR	2008	24	1					82	89		10.2987/5643.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2987/5643.1								18437818					WOS:000254410300013
J	Pheifer, C; Hill, C				Pheifer, Chase; Hill, Craig			Great Lakes wave energy resource classification and Blue Economy opportunities	RENEWABLE ENERGY												As interest in Great Lakes offshore wind energy grows, documenting marine energy resources following IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) standards is imperative. Other assessments largely overlook the Great Lakes, yet its marine resource presents opportunities for wave energy research and development. This study highlights the Great Lakes wave energy resource, analyzing 2006-2020 historical model data from the Great Lakes Environmental Research Lab's Donelan wave model. Though the model does not meet all IEC criteria, this relatively coarse and simplistic model corresponds closely to NDBC buoy observations. Results highlight common sea states having significant wave heights between 0.5 and 1.0 m and wave energy periods between 3 and 4s. Omnidirectional wave power density peaks in early winter, reaching a maximum monthly average between 4.7 and 6.9 kW m(-1 )in December. The maximum monthly average wave power density dips in summer, ranging from 0.42 to 0.68 kW m(-1 ) in June. Fall and winter storms cause large wave power events, reaching 416 kW m(-1 ) in Lake Superior. Results are compared to previous localized Great Lakes marine energy studies and a coastal US wave power classification. Finally, a case study explores small-scale wave energy converter energy potential in Great Lakes' sea states, emphasizing the role the Great Lakes could play in developing marine energy solutions.																			0960-1481	1879-0682				NOV	2024	235								121213	10.1016/j.renene.2024.121213	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2024.121213		SEP 2024											WOS:001313196900001

Due to anthropogenic disturbances, the environmental factors and the fluxes of CO2 and CH4 in lake showed obvious spatial and seasonal variability; their average fluxes in summer are significantly higher than those in autumn. The fluxes in heavy pollution sites with high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrient in summer were 3.9 times (142.14 : 36.07 mg.m(-2).h(-1)) for CO2 and 22.3 times for CH4 (6.46 : 0.29) higher than those in little pollution sites. In autumn, they were 12.3 times and 7.1 times higher, respectively. Anthropogenic disturbance and heavy pollution increased their fluxes, but aquatic plants reduced the emission of CO2. Except the sampling site with flourishing lotus, most of sampling sites without aquatic plant are the emission source of CO2 and CH4. The correlation analysis, multiple stepwise regression, and redundancy analysis showed the key environmental factors for CO2 including temperature (T), pH, chemical oxygen demand (CODMn) in water, organic matter (OM), total nitrogen, and ammonia nitrogen in water and sediment. As for CH4, the key environmental factors include turbidity, oxidation-reduction potential, dissolved oxygen, CODMn, and T in water and OM and N-NH4+ in sediment.					; Zhao, zhenhua/AAT-7422-2021	Zhao, zhenhua/0000-0003-2330-4288; 													2090-9063	2090-9071					2017	2017								8175631	10.1155/2017/8175631	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2017/8175631													WOS:000416302700001

Consumption of crucian carp (Carassius carassius L., 1758) by restocked pike (Esox lucius L., 1758) in a lake with frequent winter hypoxia	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												To assess the effects of stocked pike (Esox lucius L.) on crucian carp (Carassius carassius L.) biomasses, the annual consumption of pike was estimated and compared with removal fishery catches. The studied lake, Lake Savijarvi, is a small (40ha), shallow and eutrophicated lake in southern Finland with frequent algal blooms during summers and fish kills during winters. Until the 1980s, the fish fauna consisted of pike, perch (Perca fluviatilis L.), roach [Rutilus rutilus (L.)], crucian carp, and tench (Tinca tinca L.). Since 2003, when crucian carp were abundant in the extreme and with only a few roach and tench individuals, the lake has been biomanipulated by removal seining. To enhance the effects of seining, piscivorous pike were restocked in the spring of 2008. During the 3-year study, the catch of crucian carp decreased from 243 to 136kg while the catch of pike increased from 0.1 to 5.7kg per seining hectare due to their spawning in the lake as of 2009. The total crucian carp consumption by captured pike was 588kg during the 2008-2010 study period. When applying the number of pike estimated with the mark-recapture method, consumption estimate increased to 917kg, or 22.9kg per lake hectare in 2010. Thus, pike consumption of crucian carp was about 17% of the removal catch in 2010.

Management and assessment of the water environment in valley reservoirs are urgent due to the recent eutrophication and water quality deterioration. As an essential component of the water body, total suspended matter (TSM) hinder the light availability to underwater and then affect the photosynthesis of aquatic ecosystem. We used long-term HJ-1A/B dataset to track TSM variation and elucidating the driving mechanism of valley reservoirs. Taking a typical deep-valley reservoir (Xin'anjing Reservoir) as our case study, we constructed a TSM model with satisfactory performance (R-2, NRMSE, and MRE values are 0.85, 18.57%, and 20%) and further derived the spatial-temporal variation from 2009 to 2017. On an intra-annual scale, the TSM concentration exhibited a significant increase from 2.13 +/- 1.10mgL(-1) in 2009 to 3.94 +/- 0.82mgL(-1) in 2017. On a seasonal scale, the TSM concentration in the entire reservoir was higher in the summer (3.36 +/- 1.54mgL(-1)) and autumn (2.74 +/- 0.82mgL(-1)) than in the spring (1.84 +/- 1.27mgL(-1)) and winter (1.44 +/- 2.12mgL(-1)). On a monthly scale, the highest and lowest mean TSM value occurred in June (4.66 +/- 0.45mgL(-1)) and January (0.67 +/- 1.50mgL(-1)), and the monthly mean TSM value increased from January to June, then dropped from June to December. Combing HJ-1A/B-derived TSM, climatological data, basin dynamic, and morphology of the reservoir, we elucidated the driving mechanism of TSM variation. The annual increase of TSM from long-term HJ-1A/B data indicated that the water quality of Xin'anjiang Reservoir was decreasing. The annual increase of phytoplankton jointed with an increase of built-up land and decrease of forest land in the basin may partially be responsible for the increasing trend in TSM. This study suggested that combining the long-term remote sensing data and in situ data could provide insight into the driving mechanism of water quality dynamic and improve current management efforts for local environmental management.					; , 张一波/AAY-5453-2020; Yao, Xiaolong/M-6262-2018; Zhang, Yunlin/N-5464-2014; Shi, Kun/O-2638-2013	Zhang, Yibo/0000-0001-5542-2495; Moreno-Madrinan, Max/0000-0001-7154-0707; Zhang, Yunlin/0000-0002-3382-4570; Shi, Kun/0000-0002-6124-7512; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				JAN	2019	26	3					3041	3054		10.1007/s11356-018-3778-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-3778-0								30506385					WOS:000456198400086
J	Thompson, DK; Woo, MK				Thompson, Dan K.; Woo, Ming-Ko			Seasonal hydrochemistry of a high Arctic wetland complex	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The seasonal evolution in the hydrochemistry of four types of wetland (pond, ice wedge trough, wet meadow and mesic site) was studied in a 0.5 km(2) wetland complex in the Canadian High Arctic on the Fosheim Peninsula, Ellesmere Island. In the spring, a large influx of overland runoff front snowmelt quickly flushed away the Solutes of the ice stored on the wetland surface over the winter, and homogenized the hydrochemistry across the entire wetland complex. As the surface flow receded, various wetland patches became hydrologically disconnected and their hydrochemical characteristics evolved differently. Although underlain by marine sediments and saline permafrost, solute concentrations in Much of the wetland complex remained dilute compared with many Arctic wetlands. Through Continued evaporation, melting of ground ice and localized thermokarst activities, the hydrochemistry of different wetland types acquired their distinctive characteristics as the summer progressed. This study demonstrates that large diversity in wetland hydrochemistry occurs even within a limited area, indicating the need to caution against generalizations based oil limited spatial and temporal samples.

The improved Wageningen Lowland Runoff Simulator (WALRUS) model incorporates an irrigation and drainage scheme, and a new stage-discharge relationship to account for hydrological processes in multi-land-use polder with paddy fields and pumping stations. Here, this model was applied to assess how climate and land use changes affected the runoff of a Chinese polder in Poyang Lake basin in the past two decades. Simulated results showed that the runoff in the autumn-winter transition and midsummer months increased significantly, whereas those in the other months decreased slightly during the period of 1996-2005, primarily affected by climate change. For the period of 2006-2014, the runoff in the autumn-winter transition and midsummer increased, while that in the other months declined, affected by both climate and land use/cover changes. The land use/cover change resulting from the conversion of rice-wheat rotation to dominantly double-rice cropping and the expansion of residential area, increased the runoff during this period by demanding more irrigation water from the outside basin.

Numbers of larvae collected were highest in mid-July. Zooplankton was the only food eaten throughout the survey; the cladoceran Moina hutchinsoni was the major species eaten at all locations. Another cladoceran, Diaphanosoma leuchtenbergianum, was also important to the diet of pelagic larvae, and the copepod Cyclops vernalis was eaten in significant quantities by nearshore fish. Changes in diet composition of larval tui chubs during summer corresponded to seasonal succession of zooplankton species in Pyramid Lake.																			0017-3614						1983	43	1					175	178																WOS:A1983QK20300012
J	CATTANEO, A				CATTANEO, A			THE EFFECT OF FETCH ON PERIPHYTON SPATIAL VARIATION	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The marked spatial variation in periphyton could reflect differences in exposure, grazing or substratum. To determine if any of these factors was significant, I studied the relationship between the degree of exposure to waves (measured as fetch), grazing intensity (measured as invertebrate biomass) and spatial variation in periphyton biomass in sites of similar substratum along an island in the central mesotrophic basin of Lake Memphremagog (Quebec). In spring, there was a positive relationship between fetch and periphyton biomass both on stones and on artificial substrata. This effect was especially strong for diatoms, for algae between 100-1000 mu-m3, for planktonic forms and for filamentous and long-stalked species. In spring, water renewal encouraged growth of these forms, but the effect disappeared in summer, coincident with silica depletion. Grazers, which were not important in the spatial variation observed in spring, probably contributed to the sudden decline of periphyton in the exposed sites in summer. Observations in nearby lakes indicate that these patterns may be general.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				OCT 15	1990	206	1					1	10		10.1007/BF00018964	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00018964													WOS:A1990EW13600001

Introduction and phytoplankton results	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The Great Lakes National Program Office of the U.S. EPA has been conducting biological monitoring of the Laurentian Great Lakes since 1983. This paper presents synoptic survey data of phytoplankton communities from all five lakes. These communities were highly diverse, each lake typically supporting over 100 species during both the spring and summer surveys. Much of that diversity was contributed by diatoms, which dominated the plankton of all lakes except Lake Superior in the spring. Summer communities shifted away from diatoms, toward chrysophytes in the upper lakes and chlorophytes in the lower lakes. Ordination analyses indicated the close similarity of communities in the upper lakes, in particular Lakes Huron and Michigan, and a diverse range of communities in Lake Erie. Floristically, Lake Ontario was fundamentally different from all other lakes.																			0380-1330						2001	27	2					134	154		10.1016/S0380-1330(01)70628-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(01)70628-4													WOS:000169535900003

Seasonal Behavior of the CO2 Gas Exchange Process in the "Atmosphere-Water" System of Littoral Zone of Southern Baikal. 2. Hydrological Summer	ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC OPTICS												This is the next in the series of publications devoted to the analysis of seasonal features of the carbon dioxide exchange process in the littoral zone of Southern Baikal. It is shown that, in the littoral zone of Lake Baikal by late July - early August, vigorous photosynthetic activity of summertime complex of water biota causes a reduction in the content of biogenic elements in the littoral lake water, and the annual minimum values of their concentrations are observed. The diurnal behavior of CO2 and O-2 in the surface water layer, caused by the effect of water biota, is well pronounced and prevails over other processes. In the littoral zone of the lake, distinct diurnal variations in CO2 is observed in the entire water column, including the near-floor layers. Photosynthetic activity of biota, persisting well into the spring-to-summer transition period, and the development of the summer population of plankton decrease the CO2 concentration. Strong carbon dioxide flux from the atmosphere to the water surface in the daytime, characteristic of this period, and the increase in sunshine duration also determine the maximum values of the diurnally averaged sink of carbon dioxide in the littoral zone of Lake Baikal during the summertime hydrological season as compared to the period of hydrological spring.

Lake Mendota is a large, eutrophic natural lake that is a Long-Term Ecological Research site and among the world's best-studied freshwater systems. Metagenomic samples have been collected and shotgun sequenced from Lake Mendota for the last 20 years. Here, we analyze this comprehensive time series to infer changes to the structure and function of the protistan community and to hypothesize about their interactions with bacteria.ResultsBased on small subunit rRNA genes extracted from the metagenomes and metagenome-assembled genomes of microeukaryotes, we identify shifts in the eukaryotic phytoplankton community over time, which we predict to be a consequence of reduced zooplankton grazing pressures after the invasion of a invasive predator (the spiny water flea) to the lake. The metagenomic data also reveal the presence of the spiny water flea and the zebra mussel, a second invasive species to Lake Mendota, prior to their visual identification during routine monitoring. Furthermore, we use species co-occurrence and co-abundance analysis to connect the protistan community with bacterial taxa. Correlation analysis suggests that protists and bacteria may interact or respond similarly to environmental conditions. Cryptophytes declined in the second decade of the timeseries, while many alveolate groups (e.g., ciliates and dinoflagellates) and diatoms increased in abundance, changes that have implications for food web efficiency in Lake Mendota.ConclusionsWe demonstrate that metagenomic sequence-based community analysis can complement existing efforts to monitor protists in Lake Mendota based on microscopy-based count surveys. We observed patterns of seasonal abundance in microeukaryotes in Lake Mendota that corroborated expectations from other systems, including high abundance of cryptophytes in winter and diatoms in fall and spring, but with much higher resolution than previous surveys. Our study identified long-term changes in the abundance of eukaryotic microbes and provided context for the known establishment of an invasive species that catalyzes a trophic cascade involving protists. Our findings are important for decoding potential long-term consequences of human interventions, including invasive species introduction.BaNPxYigHXA7H5uqkH8sryVideo AbstractConclusionsWe demonstrate that metagenomic sequence-based community analysis can complement existing efforts to monitor protists in Lake Mendota based on microscopy-based count surveys.

The high number of allochthonous detritus and large sized aggregates were likely the primary * causes of oxygen depletion in the reservoir. Winter turnover was not able to mix the deep layers, but cold river inflows during late winter / early spring brought oxygen saturated water in the deep hypolimnion eliminating the sulphide production. By the end of spring sulphide developed in hypolimnion and the evaluation of the environmental parameters studied indicated that sulphide formation was inevitable. However, the operation of the power plant led to sulphide elimination by reducing stagnation in the dam area.

J	Xu, YY; Lin, J; Zhao, JW; Zhu, XY				Xu, Yuyue; Lin, Jing; Zhao, Jianwei; Zhu, Xiaoyun			New method improves extraction accuracy of lake water bodies in Central Asia	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Lakes play an important role in terrestrial ecosystems and have a significant impact on human production and life. Remote sensing techniques have been widely used to monitor changes in lakes. Several studies have been conducted pertaining to extraction of lake bodies using optical remote sensing images; however, owing to the influence of ice and snow in the lake and other parameters such as noise, the accuracy and stability of lake extraction still need to be improved. This study designed a new method by combing K-means clustering and the flood fill method (KCFFM) to improve the accuracy and stability of extraction results from complex backgrounds. Using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data for five lakes in Central Asia, the accuracy and stability of KCFFM in summer and winter were evaluated and compared with those of five other methods. KCFFM showed the highest accuracy and stability among all the methods, especially during the lake ice period. For KCFFM, the Kappa coefficient was greater than 0.97 and 0.92 and the overall accuracy was greater than 99% and 98% in summer and winter, respectively. The area error rate of KCFFM was less than 3%, except for Lake Alakol (less than 10%). In addition, KCFFM significantly decreased the area error rate compared to other methods (1% to 15% in summer and 10% to 50% in winter). The proposed method optimized the time continuity, accuracy, and stability of lake body extraction. Thus, KCFFM can provide valuable basic data for monitoring lake water bodies.

J	Gibbons, MS				Gibbons, Michael Stephan			Islanders in Community: Identity Negotiation through Sites of Conflict and Transcripts of Power	ISLAND STUDIES JOURNAL												This paper explores the problem of negotiated identity on Madeline Island (Wisconsin, USA). In this social context, who is and who is not an islander is not clearly defined as simply "locals" or "tourists." The winter population is numerically overwhelmed by the summer population, many of whom spend several months on the island over the summer. This creates a sliding scale of participation where the island identity is negotiated in the context of the rest of the island community. This negotiation is examined in geographic sites of conflict, discourse, and the transcripts referencing winter and its effects on people. This paper takes islanders' colloquial categories, builds them out more objectively, and illustrates how these categories and their membership is negotiated through claims to the "Islander" identity.																				1715-2593				NOV	2010	5	2					165	192																WOS:000208361000002

Here, we have reconstructed climate changes in the central Hexi Corridor, located at the monsoon-westerlies transition zone of western China, over the past 13.3 ka. Our element data from a loess record sug-gest a wetting trend through the Holocene, which is different from the climate pattern observed in areas influenced by the monsoon, but consistent with sites influenced by westerlies. Comparisons indicate that the average location of EASM northern boundary in northwestern China during the early to middle Holocene was similar to 300 km further northwest than today. Our Zr/Rb and grain size abundance data suggest a significant 500-year periodicity in the intensity of the East Asian Winter Monsoon (EAWM), which most likely originated from AO/NAO changes linked to solar output cycles.

This study investigated precipitation trends in Asian drylands in the previous four decades and simulated their possible linkage with snow cover reduction over the Tibetan Plateau. The results show that precipitation has been increasing and contributing to wetter conditions in Asian drylands. The increasing trends can be attributed to the deepened quasi-stationary wave trough around Lake Balkhash and the meridional water vapor flux originating from the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. The midlatitude waves and eddy disturbances correspond to the northward upper-level Tibetan Plateau (TP) mode of the South Asian high (TP-SAH) and the Afro-Asian jet with cyclonic rotation. Both SAH and Afro-Asian jet anomalies strengthen the ascending motion and northward water vapor convergence in Asian drylands, and those are favorable for summer precipitation. The anomalous circulations are linked to the following factors. First, the reduced snow cover (SC) over the west TP in the late spring results in decreasing soil moisture and increasing diabatic heating in summer and favors northward extension of TP-SAH and the Afro-Asian jet. Second, the reduced TP SC increases surface temperature over the TP and northeast Asia, which decreases the temperature gradient between the TP and the Indian Ocean, between northeast Asia and East Asia. Decreased temperature gradients are beneficial to the southwest-northeast cyclonic rotation of the Afro-Asian jet and consequently strengthen the southerly wind and northward water vapor flux over the TP and surrounding regions. This study emphasizes important effects of the reducing TP SC on intensifying summer precipitation in Asian drylands.

J	Brunstein, FC				Brunstein, FC			Climatic significance of the bristlecone pine latewood frost-ring record at Almagre Mountain, Colorado, USA	ARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												From 1900 to 1993, latewood frost rings occurred in 1903, 1912, 1941, 1961, and 1965 in 10 to 21% of the sampled bristlecone pines at Almagre Mountain, Colorado. In early to mid September in each of those years, a severe outbreak of unseasonably cold air from higher latitudes produced a memorable or historic late-summer snowstorm in the western United States. Record subfreezing temperatures during these snowstorms probably caused the latewood frost rings, shortened (by about 1 mo in 1912) already colder than normal growing seasons, and caused crop damage in parts of the Western United States. Latewood frost rings recorded in relatively high percentages of the sampled trees (such as the 1805 event in 61% of sampled trees) were probably caused by multiple severe outbreaks of unseasonably cold air from higher latitudes that occurred from early September (possibly as early as mid- or late August) to mid-September. Analyses of 1900-1992 temperature data for two widely separated Colorado stations, Fort Collins and Colorado Springs, show that average summer (June-September) temperatures during latewood frost-ring years in this century were 1.5 and 2.0 degrees C cooler than normal, respectively. Mountain snowpack probably persisted through these cool summers and was subsequently buried by the earlier than normal snowfall in September. Latewood frost-ring, ring-width, historical, and other data suggest that severe to cataclysmic volcanic eruptions from 1812 to 1835 triggered (1) an extended period of climatic cooling from as early as 1816 or 1817 through the early 1850s in the Southern Rocky Mountains, (2) catastrophic winters in Colorado and Wyoming in 1842-43 and 1844-45, and in the Great Salt Lake Basin in 1836-37, that caused large-scale destruction of bison and other large plains animals, and (3) Little Ice Age alpine glacial advances in about 1850-60 in the western United States.																			0004-0851					FEB	1996	28	1					65	76		10.2307/1552087	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1552087													WOS:A1996TZ75900008

Aquatic plants, a vital component of lacustrine ecosystems, influence the production and emission of GHGs. This influence might further increase the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of GHG emissions, particularly in shallow macrophyte-dominated lakes. In this study, a seasonal sampling of water, sediment, and gas was carried out in four sites, namely the Phragmites communis zone (Phrag), unvegetated zone (unveg), Potamogeton crispus zone (Potam) and mixed vegetation zone (mixed) in Lake Dongping, a shallow macrophyte-dominated lake located in the north of China. The physicochemical properties of water and sediment were analyzed, and fluxes of GHGs at the sediment-water interface (SWI) and water-air interface (WAI) were calculated. The results showed that the nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes at the WAI were high in winter, while the N2O fluxes at the SWI were low in autumn and in the mixed. Methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes at both the SWI and WAI were high in summer and in the Phrag, but low in winter and in the unveg. Water temperature was a primary and common determinant for the GHG fluxes at the WAI. Besides, NO3- concentrations also affected N2O fluxes, and water pH affected CO2 fluxes. Sediment pH and water pH were the key factors for CH4 and CO2 at the SWI, respectively. The results suggested the necessity to take seasonal variations and impact of aquatic plants into consideration to improve the estimation of GHG emission in macrophyte-dominated lakes.																			1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL 5	2025	84	14							402	10.1007/s12665-025-12407-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-025-12407-w													WOS:001524078900003
J	Donovan, NS; Stein, RA; White, MM				Donovan, NS; Stein, RA; White, MM			Enhancing percid stocking success by understanding age-0 piscivore-prey interactions in reservoirs	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Though young-of-year (YOY) saugeyes (Stizostedion vitreum x S. canadense) are routinely stocked in spring to create and maintain percid fisheries, their growth and survival to fall vary greatly among Ohio reservoirs, as well as among years within a reservoir. To understand the relative importance of size-dependent and size-independent mechanisms during ontogeny that underlie variable stocking success of saugeye, we quantified the role of stocking date and prey density (zooplankton and ichthyoplankton, i.e., larval gizzard shad [Dorosoma cepedianum]) in field enclosure, pond, and reservoir experiments. In 1-m(3) enclosures, ichthyoplankton density (0, 5, 10, or 20 larval gizzard shad/ m(3)) did not influence time to switch to piscivory by saugeye (all switched in <12 h); saugeye in enclosures with ichthyoplankton, regardless of density, grew faster than those without ichthyoplankton. In 0.4-ha ponds, saugeye growth and survival did not differ between ponds with zooplankton plus macrobenthic prey and ponds with those prey plus small ichthyoplankton (<10 mm). In reservoir experiments, we evaluated how time in reservoirs, zooplankton density, and peak density (as well as date) of ichthyoplankton influenced saugeye growth and survival during 1991-1994 (N = 31 reservoir-years). In 1993, we attempted to bracket the ichthyoplankton peak in five Ohio reservoirs by stocking two genetically identifiable cohorts of saugeye 2 wk apart in spring. For all reservoirs, those saugeye stocked before the ichthyoplankton peak grew larger than those stocked after the ichthyoplankton peak by 1 October. In 1994, we hypothesized that saugeye might overexploit local populations of ichthyoplankton when stocked at a single site. We paired 10 reservoirs (N = 5 pairs) with one reservoir of each pair scatter-stocked (i.e., saugeye numbers equally divided among five sites) and the second point stocked (i.e., at a single site). Stocking method did not influence saugeye survival; late gizzard shad spawning, coupled with low larval densities, yielded poor saugeye survival in 1994. However, YOY saugeye were considerably larger in fall 1994 than in fall 1993, when gizzard shad appeared earlier and produced more larvae. Zooplankton density at stocking influenced neither growth nor survival. Increased time in reservoirs increased fall size but did not influence survival. Although saugeye growth and survival during their first year were unrelated, both measures of stocking success critically depended on gizzard shad availability. Across all years, saugeyes stocked before ichthyoplankton peaks were large (as a result of their ability to consume fast-growing gizzard shad through summer), but survived poorly to fall (perhaps owing to early, high predatory mortality). Conversely, saugeyes stocked after ichthyoplankton peaks were small in fall (for they were unable to exploit large gizzard shad) but survived better (perhaps because gizzard shad provided a predatory buffer). By manipulating stock date relative to ichthyoplankton peaks, fisheries managers can either increase saugeye size or survival to fall, but not both.																			1051-0761					NOV	1997	7	4					1311	1329																WOS:A1997YD79000023

In addition to pupal exuvial samples, two rivers and one stream were sampled by collecting adult chironomids. Our purpose was to determine the timing and extent of the emergence period of common (abundant and wide-spread) lotic chironomid species in southern Finland. We describe the emergence patterns of 195 chironomid taxa (26% of the chironomid fauna recorded from Finland). A major proportion of species richness was accounted for by the sub-families Chironominae and Orthocladiinae. Many taxa considered intolerant of pollution emerged mainly in spring (May). On the other hand, tolerant taxa such as Chironomus and Glyptotendipes species emerged during an extended period in summer (June-August). During autumn (September), the majority of emerging chironomids were already detected in preceding samples, thus representing species with more than one generation per year. For biomonitoring of boreal rivers, a species-level tolerance classification of chironomids along the oligotrophy-eutrophy gradient is proposed.																			1863-9135						2008	170	4					291	301		10.1127/1863-9135/2008/0170-0291	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/1863-9135/2008/0170-0291													WOS:000253804100004
J	Chong, J; Ladson, AR				Chong, J; Ladson, AR			Analysis and management of unseasonal flooding in the Barmah-Millewa Forest, Australia	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												The Barmah-Millewa Forest is the largest red gum forest in the world and lies adjacent to the middle reaches of Australia's River Murray. Regulation of the River Murray, to supply water for irrigation, has changed the watering regime of the forest and thus is degrading its environmental values. The watering regime has been changed in two ways: (1) there are now fewer large winter/spring events that inundate extensive areas because these floods are mitigated by irrigation storages; and (2) there are more small summer/autumn events that flood low-lying areas and are caused by the way the river is operated to supply irrigation demand. The increased frequency of these small unseasonal floods is the subject of this paper. During the irrigation season, water to meet irrigation requirements must be released four days in advance to allow for travel time from storages to irrigation areas upstream of the Barmah-Millewa Forest. If there is heavy summer rainfall, irrigators cancel their orders so the flow that would have been diverted, remains in the river and causes a small 'rain rejection' flood. At the same time, river freshets from unregulated tributaries can also increase river flows. The River Murray channel in this area has low capacity and these high flows result in water spilling into the forest. Based on analysis of pre-regulation conditions (1908-1929) and current conditions (1980-2000), forest flooding has increased from 15.5% of days to 36.5% of days between December and April. In particular, small, localized floods, which cover less than 10% of the forest, occur at least eight times more frequently now, than before regulation. Work by others has related these hydrologic changes to tree death and changes in floristic structure in wetland systems. There are also economic costs because much of the water that spills into the forest is not available for irrigation. Two solutions to unseasonal flooding are described in this paper. One is to limit the maximum flow in the river during the irrigation season so there is capacity to convey at least some of the rain rejection flows without spilling water into the forest. The other is to maintain airspace in a diversion weir (Lake Mulwala) upstream of the forest to store the surplus water when orders are cancelled. Preliminary economic analysis shows the preferred option is to increase airspace in Lake Mulwala which provides net benefits of at least Aus$1.4 million per year along with unquantified environmental benefits from decreased unseasonal forest flooding.

Invasive Nitellopsis obtusa (starry stonewort) has distinct late-season phenology compared to native and other invasive macrophytes in Minnesota, USA	AQUATIC BOTANY												Understanding the phenology of the invasive macroalga Nitellopsis obtusa (starry stonewort) is critical for evaluating and predicting its impacts on native macrophytes and timing control efforts. We tracked N. obtusa phenology in two Minnesota (USA) lakes from 2017 to 2018. We measured N. obtusa biomass and counted bulbils (asexual reproductive structures) throughout the growing season and in winter, under ice. Additionally, we compared phenology of N. obtusa to other invasive and native macrophytes using a long-term, Minnesota statewide dataset. We found consistent late-season peaks in N. obtusa biomass in both lakes, and this extended growth distinguished it from common native and invasive macrophytes in the region. Phenological asynchrony of N. obtusa relative to native macrophytes indicates use of a distinct temporal niche that may contribute to its invasion success. Bulbil counts were lowest early to mid-summer and increased through fall; however, high variability in this relationship warrants more intensive sampling to clarify seasonal trends. Late-season growth of N. obtusa poses challenges for timing control efforts, as early-season treatments may be limited to avoid harming native species. Treatment during peak biomass, before peak bulbil abundance, may improve control.					; Glisson, Wesley/AAB-7984-2019; Larkin, Daniel/IVV-7477-2023	Glisson, Wesley/0000-0002-2540-3696; Muthukrishnan, Ranjan/0000-0002-7001-6249; 													0304-3770	1879-1522				JAN	2022	176								103452	10.1016/j.aquabot.2021.103452	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2021.103452		OCT 2021											WOS:000706240700004
J	Thompson, R; Ventura, M; Camarero, L				Thompson, R.; Ventura, M.; Camarero, L.			On the climate and weather of mountain and sub-arctic lakes in Europe and their susceptibility to future climate change	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												P> The complex terrain and heterogeneous nature of the mountain environment coupled with remoteness from major centres of human activity makes mountains challenging locations for meteorological investigations. Mountainous areas tend to have more varied and more extreme weather than lowlands. The EMERGE program has the primary aim of assessing the status of remote mountain and sub-arctic lakes throughout Europe for the first time. In this study, we describe the main features of the climate, ice-cover durations and recent temperature trends of these areas. The main weather characteristics of European mountain and sub-arctic lakes are their cold temperatures and year-round precipitation. Mean annual temperatures are generally close to 0 degrees C, and maximum summer temperatures reasonably close to 10 degrees C. Maritime versus continental settings determine the main differences in annual-temperature range among lake districts (10.5 degrees C in Scotland to 26.7 degrees C in Northern Finland), and a similar factor for ice-cover duration. Radiation ranges from low (120 W m-2) in the high latitude sub-arctic and high (237 W m-2) in the southern ranges of the Pyrenees and Rila. Similarly, precipitation is high in the main Alpine chain (250 cm year-1 in the Central Southern Alps) and low in the continental sub-arctic (65 cm year-1 in Northern Finland). The main temporal patterns in air temperature follow those of the adjacent lowlands. All the lake districts warmed during the last century. Spring temperature trends were highest in Finland; summer trends were weak everywhere; autumn trends were strongest in the west, in the Pyrenees and western Alps; while winter trends varied markedly, being high in the Pyrenees and Alps, low in Scotland and Norway and negative in Finland. Two new, limnological case studies on Lake Redon, in the Pyrenees, highlight the sensitivity of remote lakes to projected changes in the global climate. These two case studies involve close linkages between extreme chemical-precipitation events and synoptic wind-patterns, and between thermocline behaviour and features of the large-scale circulation. Individual lakes can be ultra-responsive to climate change. Even modest changes in future air temperatures will lead to major changes in lake temperatures and ice-cover duration and hence probably affect their ecological status.

This wetland received both point and nonpoint sources of nutrients. Input, output, and within-wetland water samples were collected at 15 sites, and flows were measured nine times in 1983 at lake levels varying over 2 m. The ratio of wetland inflow to outflow was related to changes in lake levels. During spring, the concentrations of total suspended solids, total P, and total Kjeldahl N throughout the wetland were lower than during summer and fall periods. Wetland outlet concentrations decreased with rising lake levels. When wetland inflows exceeded outflow, there was a net mass retention of total suspended solids, total P, and total Kjeldahl N. Exports from the wetland decreased as lake level increased. The sediment and nutrient treatment capacity of this lakeside wetland appeared to be dominated by hydrologic influences.																			0047-2425	1537-2537				JAN-MAR	1990	19	1					83	88		10.2134/jeq1990.00472425001900010010x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1990.00472425001900010010x													WOS:A1990CL22700010
J	Arhonditsis, G; Brett, MT; Frodge, J				Arhonditsis, G; Brett, MT; Frodge, J			Environmental control and limnological impacts of a large recurrent spring bloom in Lake Washington, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												A series of statistical analyses were used to identify temporal and spatial patterns in the phytoplankton and nutrient dynamics of Lake Washington, an mesotrophic lake in Washington State (USA). These analyses were based on fortnightly or monthly samples of water temperature, Secchi transparency, ammonium (NH4), nitrate (NO3), inorganic phosphorus (IP), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), dissolved oxygen (DO), pH and chlorophyll a (chl a) collected during 1995-2000 from 12 stations. Lake Washington has a very consistent and pronounced annual spring diatom bloom which occurs from March to May. During this bloom, epilimnetic chl a concentrations peak on average at 10 mug/L, which is 3 times higher than chl a concentrations typically seen during summer stratified conditions. The spring bloom on average comprised 62% diatoms, 21% chlorophytes and 8% cyanobacteria. During summer stratification, diatoms comprised 26% of the phytoplankton community, chlorophytes 37% and cyanobacteria 25%. Cryptophytes comprised approximately 8% of the community throughout the year. Overall, 6 phytoplankton genera (i.e., Aulacoseira, Fragilaria, Cryptomonas, Asterionella, Stephanodiscus, and Ankistrodesmus) cumulatively accounted for over 50% of the community. These analyses also suggest that the phytoplankton community strongly influences the seasonality of NO3, IP, DO, pH and water clarity. According to a MANOVA, seasonal fluctuations explained 40% of the total variability for the major parameters, spatial heterogeneity explained 10% of variability, and the seasonal-spatial interaction explained 10% of variability. Distinctive patterns were identified between offshore and inshore sampling stations. The results of our analyses also suggest that spatial variability was substantial, but much smaller than temporal variability.					; Brett, Michael/A-2066-2010; Arhonditsis, George/C-6980-2009	Brett, Michael/0000-0002-8796-9863; Arhonditsis, George/0000-0001-5359-8737; 													0364-152X					MAY	2003	31	5					603	618		10.1007/s00267-002-2891-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-002-2891-4								12719891					WOS:000182527100004

Fish, particularly the smallest species and individuals, aggregate in high numbers in the vegetation, and a strong predation pressure on zooplankton by shrimps and invertebrates, such as Chaoborus, can occur in these systems. We studied seasonal and diel changes in zooplankton and their potential predators (both fish and invertebrates) and physical and chemical characteristics among open water and vegetated habitats (emergent and submerged plants (SP)), in the subtropical Lake Blanca (34 degrees 54' S; 54 degrees 50' W), a shallow system with an extensive and complex littoral area and high abundance of vertebrate and invertebrate predators on zooplankton. We found differential horizontal distribution of some zooplankton species under the scenario of high abundance of small omnivorous-planktivorous fish and Chaoborus, especially in the seasons with intermediate catch per unit effort of fish. We found indications of a diel horizontal migration (DHM) opposite than described for temperate systems, as the two main cladocerans Bosmina longirostris and Diaphanosoma birgei were found in higher densities in the submerged plant beds during night, in spring and autumn respectively. Although we need experiments to prove DHM, Chaoborus seemed to be the main trigger of the apparent DHM, followed by small omnivorous fish. During summer no spatial differences were found likely because of high densities of fish in all habitats. In absence of piscivorous fish, the distribution of fish Jenynsia multidentata seemed to be conditioned by food availability and by predation risk of waterfowl. The refuge capacity of aquatic plants for zooplankton in subtropical systems seems weak and with consequent weak or no cascading effects on water transparency, as under very high fish and invertebrate densities (summer) the refuge for zooplankton was lost.

Field-scale nutrient loss assessment following cover crop and manure rate change	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Eutrophication due to elevated nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loss from croplands remains one of the most pressing water quality issues throughout the world. Understanding the effect of implementing conservation management practices is critical for meeting nutrient reduction goals as well as informing conservation programs and policies. A before-after-control-impact (BACI) analysis was used to evaluate the individual and combined effect of cover crops and manure application rate on discharge and nutrient loss using six water years (WY2014-WY2019) of measured data across four distinct drainage zones (1X-NCC; 1X-CC; 2X-NCC; 2X-CC) within an Ohio, USA, crop production field. White mustard significantly reduced mean monthly nitrate (NO3--N) concentration regardless of manure application rate (i.e., 65 m3 ha(-1) and 130 m3 ha(-1)). However, neither the use of white mustard, doubling manure rate, or the combination of the two had a significant impact on mean monthly drainage discharge, dissolved-reactive P (DRP), or total P (TP) loss. Seasonal analysis confirmed that NO3--N concentration in the cover crop zones was signficantly less in fall, winter, and spring. However, significant increases in spring discharge, NO3--N, DRP, and TP loads as well as TP concentration were noted with cover crop and greater manure rate treatments. These findings confirm that cover crops have a reducing effect on NO3--N concentration but may not have any effect on addressing P concerns. Further research is warranted; however, this study highlights that the resource concern (e.g., N or P) should be considered prior to implementing cover crops as a conservation management practice.

Laminated, high deposition rate sediments of the Cariaco Basin, a small anoxic basin on the Venezuelan continental shelf, clearly record large changes in the past intensity of this upwelling. Because sediments of the Cariaco Basin are largely unbioturbated, they offer a natural opportunity to study the stable isotopic records of multiple planktonic foraminiferal taxa and to evaluate their sensitivity to both the modern hydrography and temporal changes in upwelling intensity and climate. Oxygen isotope data (delta(18)O) from four dominant foraminiferal taxa are presented for the time period covering the last 28 kyr. The delta(18)O data from Globigerina bulloides, after correction for nonequilibrium precipitation, are used as a monitor of sea surface conditions during the winter-spring upwelling season. The delta(18)O data from white Globigerinoides ruber are used as a measure of annual-average conditions in the near surface, while pink G. ruber data are consistent with use as an index of end-member conditions during the summer-fall nonupwelling season. Data from the deeper dwelling Neogloboquadrina dutertrei yield information on conditions near the base of the local thermocline. During the last glacial, delta(18)O data from G. ruber and generally reduced interspecific differences indicate cooling of surface waters over the Cariaco Basin by up to 4 degrees C. This longer-term cooling does not appear to be related to changes in upwelling intensity along the coast but may instead reflect more regional cooling of the larger Caribbean. Superimposed on this pattern, between 12.6 and similar to 10 ka, is a convergence of delta(18)O data between G. bulloides and N. dutertrei, implying much stronger upwelling during the last deglaciation. This scenario is consistent with other evidence for high productivity at this time. At similar to 14 ka, a sharp delta(18)O depletion event observed in all taxa seems to have been produced by increased freshwater discharge to the southern Caribbean, suggesting either higher regional rainfall or the influence of glacial melting in the Andes. Minimum delta(18)O values of pink G. ruber around 6-7 ka record warmer summer sea surface temperatures and/or decreased salinity in the mid-Holocene.

J	Johnson, JL; Havel, JE				Johnson, JL; Havel, JE			Competition between native and exotic Daphnia: in situ experiments	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The recently introduced exotic cladoceran Daphnia lumholtzi offers an excellent opportunity to study the interactions between exotic and native species in invaded communities. Lake surveys in Missouri have indicated a seasonal succession between native Daphnia and D. lumholtzi. In the current study, we examined competition between D. lumholtzi and the native Daphnia parvula by conducting seasonal in situ field experiments in 1.61 enclosures. Competition was assessed by comparing the rates of increase (r) and birth rates (b) of each species when grown alone versus when grown together in these enclosures. At high densities, D. lumholtzi suppressed D. parvula rates of increase during the late summer and fall experiments, but did not appear to suppress D. parvula birth rates. The rated of increase of D. lumholtzi did not appear to be affected by the presence of D. parvula. The results of these experiments indicate that although competition between the two species occurs seasonally at high densities, the effects are asymmetrical. The lack of competitive effects on D. lumholtzi by D. parvula suggests that factors other than competition are involved in explaining the absence of D. lumholtzi in spring zooplankton assemblages.

Forecasting impacts of climate change on Great Lakes surface water temperatures	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Temperature influences the rates of many ecosystem processes. A number of recent studies have found evidence of systematic increases in Great Lakes surface water temperatures. Our study aims to construct empirical relationships between surface water temperatures and local air temperatures that can be used to estimate future water temperatures using future air temperatures generated by global climate models. Remotely sensed data were used to model lake-wide average surface water temperature patterns during the open-water period in Lakes Superior, Huron, Erie, and Ontario. Surface water temperatures typically exhibit linear warming through the spring, form a plateau in mid-summer and then exhibit linear cooling in fall. Lake-specific warming and cooling rates vary little from year to year while plateau values vary substantially across years. These findings were used to construct a set of lake-specific empirical models linking surface water temperatures to local air temperatures for the period 1995-2006. Hindcasted whole-lake water temperatures from these models compare favourably to independently collected offshore water temperatures for the period 1968-2002. Relationships linking offshore water temperatures to inshore water temperatures at specific sites are also described. Predictions of future climates generated by the Canadian Global Climate Model Version 2 (CGCM2) under two future greenhouse gas emission scenarios are used to scope future Great Lakes surface water temperatures: substantial increases are expected, along with increases in the duration of summer stratification.

We tested a harvest removal strategy for invasive Rusty Crayfish (Faxonius rusticus) at two nearshore native fish spawning habitats in northern Lake Michigan. Changes in average Rusty Crayfish densities were evaluated with a before-after reference-impact study design. We removed 3182 Rusty Crayfish, primarily adults (> 20 mm carapace length), at two sites over two harvest seasons, expending 17,825 trap days in effort. Generalized linear modeling results suggested a statistically significant reduction in Rusty Crayfish densities was achieved at one reef, Little Traverse Bay (LTB Crib). Reduced densities were sustained over the egg maturation period for native fish and into the following year after removal ceased. By late summer/early fall, between consecutive suppression efforts in 2018 and 2019, we observed a threefold increase in pre-removal densities. Size-frequency histograms from diver quadrat surveys showed higher abundances of juvenile (< 20 mm carapace length) size classes the following spring and summer at LTB Crib compared to its paired reference site. Stock-recruit curves fit to count data, pooled across all sites, provided further evidence of density-dependence. With a proviso that we only conducted two seasons of consecutive suppression, this study highlights an important aspect of invasive species management and raises questions about the efficacy of adult-only crayfish removal strategies.					; Herbert, Matt/S-2403-2019	Tucker, Andrew/0009-0001-4336-589X; 													1387-3547	1573-1464				SEP	2023	25	9					2831	2847		10.1007/s10530-023-03076-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-023-03076-6		MAY 2023						37362907					WOS:000983026600001

Development of an index of biotic integrity for a Southeastern Coastal Plain Watershed, USA	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												This study evaluated biological integrity expectations of fish assemblages in wadeable streams for the Alabama portion of the Choctawhatchee River watershed using a multimetric approach. Thirty-four randomly selected stream sites were sampled in late spring 2001 to calibrate an index of biotic integrity (IBI). Validation data were collected during the spring 2001, and summer and fall of 2003 from disturbed and least-impacted targeted sites (n = 20). Thirty-five candidate metrics were evaluated for their responsiveness to environmental degradation. Twelve metrics were selected to evaluate wadeable streams and four replacement metrics were selected for headwater streams. Scores that ranged from 58 to 60 were considered to be representative of excellent biotic integrity (none found in this study), scores of 48-52 as good integrity (31% of the sites in this study), 40-44 as fair (43%), 28-34 as poor (21%), and 12-22 as very poor (5%). Of the four stream condition categories (urban, cattle, row crop, and least impacted), the IBI scores for urban and cattle sites differed significantly from least-impacted sites. Row crop sites, although not significantly different from least-impacted, tended to have greater variability than the other categories. Lower IBI scores at both urban and cattle sites suggest that the IBI accurately reflects stream impairment in the Choctawhatchee River drainage.					; Simon, Thomas/B-4075-2012	Simon, Thomas/0000-0003-4393-4703; 													1093-474X	1752-1688				APR	2007	43	2					295	307		10.1111/j.1752-1688.2007.00023.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2007.00023.x													WOS:000245446200002
J	DISE, NB				DISE, NB			METHANE EMISSION FROM MINNESOTA PEATLANDS - SPATIAL AND SEASONAL VARIABILITY	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												The variability of methane flux with season, year, and habitat type was investigated in northern Minnesota peatlands from September 1988 through September 1990. Average daily fluxes calculated by integration of annual data for an open poor fen, an open bog, a forested bog hollow, a fen lagg in the forested bog and a forested bog hummock were 180, 118, 38, 35, and 10 mg CH4 m-2 d-1, respectively. Fluxes among the five ecosystems were significantly different from one another, although emission from all sites was highest in July and lowest in March. Winter fluxes occurred in all sites but the fen lagg. There was no difference in fluxes measured from the same sites in the spring of 1986, 1989, or 1990, but summer fluxes were significantly higher in the wetter year of 1989 than in 1990, and a summer pulse in methane emission occurred in 1989 that was not seen the next year. Concentrations of methane in pore water, reflecting the seasonal balance of production, oxidation, and release, declined during the month of peak flux, then increased to levels of about 500 muM in December. Consistent spatial and temporal differences in flux could be ascribed to differences in water table, temperature, and peat nutrient status. although additional variability remained. Integration gave an annual average flux of 20 g CH4 m-2 for the three bog ecosystems and 39 g CH4 m-2 for the two fen ecosystems. This gives an estimate of 1-2 Tg CH4 yr-1 from peatlands in the Great Lake states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan.																			0886-6236					MAR	1993	7	1					123	142		10.1029/92GB02299	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/92GB02299													WOS:A1993KW45000008

The full impact of arctic winters may be best manifest by freshwater ice growth and the extent to which abundant shallow ACP lakes freeze solid with bedfast ice by the end of winter. For example, winter conditions of 2016-17 produced record low extents of bedfast ice across the ACP. In addition to high air temperatures, the causes varied from deep snow accumulation on the Barrow Peninsula to high late season rainfall and lake levels farther east on the ACP. In contrast, the previous winter of 2015-16 was also warm, but low snowpack and high winds caused relatively thick lake ice to develop and corresponding high extents of bedfast ice on the ACP. This recent comparison of extreme variation in lake ice responses between two adjacent regions and years in the context of long-term climate and ice records highlights the complexity associated with weather conditions and climate change in the Arctic. Recent observations of maximum ice thickness (MIT) compared to simulated MIT from Weather Research and Forcing (Polar-WRF) model output show greater departure toward thinner ice than predicted by models, underscoring this uncertainty and the need for sustained observations. Lake ice thickness and the extent of bedfast ice not only indicate the impact of arctic winters, but also directly affect sublake permafrost, winter water supply for industry, and overwinter habitat availability. Therefore, tracking freshwater ice responses provides a comprehensive picture of winter, as well as summer, weather conditions and climate change with implications to broader landscape, ecosystem, and resource responses in the Arctic.					; alexeev, vladimir/B-2234-2010	Cai, Lei/0000-0002-9794-407X; Engram, Melanie/0000-0002-1144-1827; Arp, Christopher/0000-0002-6485-6225; Jones, Benjamin/0000-0002-1517-4711; Parsekian, Andrew/0000-0001-5072-9818; alexeev, vladimir/0000-0003-3519-2797; Creighton, Andrea/0000-0003-3183-5396													1748-9326					DEC	2018	13	12							125001	10.1088/1748-9326/aae994	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aae994													WOS:000451083200001

Within-lake spatio-temporal dynamics of cladoceran and diatom communities in a deep subtropical mountain lake (Lugu Lake) in southwest China	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Within-lake spatio-temporal variability of remains of cladocerans and diatoms were examined, using trap and surficial sediment sampling approaches in Lugu Lake, one of the deep mountain lakes in the subtropical region of southwest China, to understand the response to recent environmental change. Seasonality played a strong role in the distribution patterns of both cladocerans and diatoms, but their responses to seasonal change varied. The rich resources of food supported a cladoceran population peak during summer, while increased mixing and higher nutrient triggered diatom blooms in spring. The summer also witnessed increased grazing effects of primary consumers on diatoms when the water column was nutrient-enriched. In particular, Ceriodaphnia intensified grazing on small diatoms (Cyclotella ocellata), consequently affecting community patterns during summer, while increased wind activity during spring induced turbulence, remixing, transportation and depositional processes of remains of littoral Alona guttata and benthic diatoms. The distribution pattern of cladocerans in surface sediments was similar to that of diatoms. Seasonal community patterns and trophic interactions between cladocerans and diatoms in trap and surface sediments of differential depth gradients provide evidence that high-resolution sampling of multi-proxy biological remains in deep mountain lakes of southwest China can help reduce biases in paleoenvironmental reconstructions.

However, few studies have focused on seasonal variation patterns in taxonomic and functional community composition at the fine scale. As such, we conducted seasonal high-density sampling of the submerged macrophyte community in Hongshan Bay of Erhai Lake in China and used the generalized dissimilarity model (GDM) to evaluate the effects of environmental factors and geographic distance on taxonomic and functional beta diversity as well as corresponding turnover and nestedness components. At the fine scale, taxonomic turnover and nestedness as well as functional turnover and nestedness showed comparable contributions to corresponding taxonomic and functional beta diversity, with different importance across seasons. All taxonomic and functional dissimilarity metrics showed seasonal variation. Of note, taxonomic beta diversity was highest in summer and lowest in winter, while functional beta diversity showed the opposite pattern. Taxonomic and functional turnover showed similar change patterns as taxonomic and functional beta diversity. Taxonomic nestedness was low in summer and high in winter. Functional nestedness was also lower in summer. These results suggest that under extreme environmental conditions, both turnover and nestedness can exist at the fine scale and seasonal community composition patterns in submerged macrophytes should be considered. Future investigations on community assembly mechanisms should pay greater attention to long-term dynamic characteristics and functional information.

J	Kock, G; Triendl, M; Hofer, R				Kock, G; Triendl, M; Hofer, R			Seasonal patterns of metal accumulation in Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) from an oligotrophic Alpine lake related to temperature	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Cd and Pb concentrations in the liver, kidney, and stomach contents of Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) from an oligotrophic high mountain lake (Schwarzsee ob Solden Tyrol, Austria) with low pH (4.8 to 6.4) and alkalinity (-8 to +8 mu equiv.. L(-1)) were investigated over the course of 1 year. Peak concentrations of Cd and Pb in the water coincided with the drop of pH during snowmelt, whereas metal concentrations in liver and kidney were lowest at the end of winter and increased during summer. Furthermore, the Cd and Pb load of the food was considerably higher in winter than during summer. Thus, fluctuations in the metal levels in fish did not correlate with seasonal variations in the metal concentrations in lake water or in the diet. Rather, patterns of metal accumulation in the fish indicated that enhanced metal uptake was a consequence of increasing metabolic rates during summer. Thus, water temperature appeared to be the driving force of metal accumulation in fish from an oligotrophic lake. Concentrations of Cd and Pb in liver and kidney were positively correlated to age. A simple empirical model illustrates the ability of the fish to eliminate considerable amounts of accumulated metals.																			0706-652X					APR	1996	53	4					780	786		10.1139/cjfas-53-4-780	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-53-4-780													WOS:A1996VD06300011

It was created over many years by diverse organizations ranging from universities to federal, state, and local government agencies and utilities. Today, RHONET is a hybrid network with diverse observation sets aimed at advancing scientific understanding of physical processes driving extreme precipitation and runoff in the region. Its development is described, including the specific goals that led to a series of network enhancements, as well as the key characteristics of its sensors. The hydroclimatology of the Russian River area is described, including an overview of the hydrologic extremes and variability driving the scientific and operational needs in the region, from atmospheric river behavior and orographic precipitation processes to hydrologic conditions related to water supply and flooding. A case study of Lake Mendocino storage response to a land-falling atmospheric river in 2018 is presented to demonstrate the network's performance and hydrologic applications during high-impact weather events. Finally, a synopsis of key scientific findings and applications enabled by the network is provided, from the first documentation of the role of land-falling atmospheric rivers in flooding, to the occurrence of shallow nonbrightband rain, to the buffering influence of extremely dry soils in autumn, and to the development of forecast-informed reservoir operations for Lake Mendocino.																			0003-0007	1520-0477				OCT	2020	101	10					E1781	E1800		10.1175/BAMS-D-19-0253.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-19-0253.1													WOS:000588395600015
J	Salmaso, N				Salmaso, N			Factors affecting the seasonality and distribution of cyanobacteria and chlorophytes: a case study from the large lakes south of the Alps, with special reference to Lake Garda	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Chlorophytes and cyanobacteria are among the most typical algal groups, contributing to the aesthetic appearance and quality of the epilimnetic waters of the deep (251-410 m) and large (6.5-49x10(9) m(3)) lakes located on the southern edge of the Alps (from oligo-mesotrophy to meso-eutrophy: Maggiore, Garda, Como, Iseo and Lugano). The results obtained from monthly surveys carried out in the largest of these lakes (Garda) have been reported in detail. The thermal stability of the water column and silica depletion were the main factors responsible for the decline of the great spring diatoms. The successive growth of Mougeotia sp. was favoured by its lower sinking velocity and resistance to the increasing grazing pressure. During summer, the maximum stability of the water column, with high vertical nutrient concentration gradients, determined a major algal differentiation with a typical increase, among others, of Chlorococcales at the surface and metalimnetic stratification of various Oscillatoriales. The development of oligotrophic blooms, caused by a rapid thickening at the surface of Anabaena in the eastern, sheltered basin, was also discussed in light of the trophic characterisation of Lake Garda. From autumn to spring, the decreasing light, the increasing mixing depth and nutrient availability favoured a progressive dominance of vertical homogeneous populations of Planktothrix (autumn) and colonial diatoms. The same functional groups of chlorophytes and cyanobacteria have been recognised in the studies published so far on the phytoplankton of deep southern subalpine lakes. In this respect, their morphometric and physical properties appear to constitute a sort of standardising factor, reducing the range of possible dominants. With increasing TP concentrations and biomass, filaments of Planktothrix and Planktolyngbya, along with the Chlorococcales, became important. The dominance of Mougeotia (one of the most characteristic features of these large lakes) appears restricted to a medium trophic range, whereas the distribution of the Chroococcales and other filaments ascribed to Pseudanabaena and/or Limnothrix is more irregular. The conspicuous presence of Aphanizomenon in Lake Lugano is typical and characteristic of a more productive lake. Among the Nostocales, a clear interpretation of the Anabaena blooms in lakes Garda and Iseo is complicated by the peculiar behaviour of filaments concentrating at the surface, which is apparently restricted, within the medium trophic range, to stable water columns.

In this study, the extent of MPs pollution in Uiam Lake in fall of 2022 and spring of 2023 was assessed by determining both the number (n/m(3)) and mass concentrations (mu g/m(3)) of MPs. Moreover, the correlation between water quality parameters and MP properties was analyzed, and an ecological risk assessment was conducted. MPs abundance was higher in spring than in fall, probably due to the lifting of coronavirus disease-19 restrictions, melting of ice, higher rainfall, and faster wind speed. Fragment was the dominant shape of the MPs collected, while polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyester/ polyethylene terephthalate were the frequently detected polymer types of MPs in fall and spring, respectively. There was a moderate positive correlation between the number concentration of MPs and the total nitrogen, total phosphorus (T-P), and total organic carbon levels; in contrast, there was no significant relationship between the mass concentration of MPs and all water quality parameters. However, the abundance (mu g/m(3)) of PVC and polymethyl methacrylate MPs were positively correlated with T-P and electrical conductivity. The pollution load index, polymer hazard index, and potential ecological risk index (PERI) were generally higher when the mass unit of MPs was used due to the presence of large-sized MPs composed of highly hazardous polymers (e.g., polyurethane, PVC, and alkyd). For instance, the PERI value of the WWTP effluent was at the very high level (>1200) > 1200) in both seasons, regardless of the abundance unit of MPs. Therefore, WWTP effluents may have increased the ecological toxicity of MPs pollution in Uiam Lake.

Pike, E. lucius L., have been gill netted each winter since 1944, removing each year .apprx. 1/3 of the population over 55 cm in length. Perch are the main food of pike. Major changes have been observed in several population characteristics, including numbers, year-class strengths, and growth. These changes were not always similar in the north and south basins of the lake. Three periods, 1942-1959, 1960-1968, and 1969-1975, have been identified, with summer temperatures variable, cool, and warm respectively. Temperature, predation and cannibalism are suggested as the most important factors and their relative importance has varied in the different periods. Fishing policy has remained almost constant since the late 1940s, and the changes have occurred as a result of natural events.																			0020-6466						1984	41	3					259	267																WOS:A1984AFA3800006

Three lakes were mapped for their structure in summers 2004-05 and 2010-11 in western Dronning Maud Land, and one was also examined for the radiation budget. The lake body consisted of two layers, each similar to 1m thick: an upper layer with a thin ice layer on top and main body of liquid water, and a lower layer containing slush and hard ice sub-layers. A sediment- rich slush pocket was found at the bottom. Hydraulic conductivity of the lake body was 0.25-30 cm s(-1) depending on the stage of evolution, with 6.3 cm s(-1) for closely packed slush. Albedo of the lake was 0.4-0.6 and light attenuation coefficient was 0.5-0.7m(-1). The formation and the depth scale of the lakes are determined by the light attenuation distance and thermal diffusion coefficient, limiting the growth to less than about 1.5m in one summer. The potential winter growth is more and thus the lakes freeze up in winter in the present climatic conditions.					; Lepparanta, Matti/M-7507-2017	Mattila, Olli-Pekka/0000-0001-6887-2874; Lepparanta, Matti/0000-0002-4754-5564													0954-1020	1365-2079				JUN	2013	25	3					457	467		10.1017/S0954102012001009	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954102012001009													WOS:000319216500014

This study focused on the relationships between nematode colonization and microphytic community structure on CWD. In situ investigations were performed using white willow branches introduced into the floodplain lake, a part of the large natural floodplain in the middle section of the Danube River (Europe) impacted by strong sandy and silt accumulations. Our results showed that CWD support rapid colonization and high species richness of microphytes, regardless of seasonality and flood-induced environmental changes. Successional stages during the accrual of microphytic communities were expressed. Nematode functional feeding group compositions closely followed microphytic composition. The epistrate feeder Chromadorina bioculata over-dominated in diatom-dominated communities with adnate/prostrate and stalk-forming species in spring and autumn. The complex structure of cyanobacterial mats associated with green algae and diatom assemblages in summer attracted suction feeders, represented by the Dorylaimidae family. The obtained results indicated that nematodes are involved in strong trophic coupling with a microbial habitat on CWD. The retention of CWD in aquatic environments or addition of CWD to systems with little or no wood may have important implications for the primary and secondary production in these ecosystems.

The percentages of hydrophobic DOC (Hob-DOC) fractionated by XAD-8 resin were 33% for the bay waters and 41% for the river waters, whereas those of labile DOC (which decomposed during an incubation period of 100 days) were 20% and 24%, respectively. The increment of DOC to Chlorophyll a was calculated to be (0.014 mgl(-1))/(mu gl(-1)). The mixing experiments suggested a negligible deposition of DOC at the estuaries of inflowing rivers. The Hob-DOC went through the bay with negligible changes in concentration in both summer and winter, but its chemical characteristics, e.g. spectrophotometric properties and mean molecular weight, differed from those of riverine origin. In contrast, both labile and refractory components of Hil-DOC were produced mainly in the inner part of the bay during summer, and although a significant percentage of the labile component was subjected to biodegradation during transport to the outer part of the bay, its chemical characteristics did not change dramatically.

Tags were recovered from 2-63 months after application and between 62 and 328 miles from the tagging site. Fifty-six winter tag recoveries were spread over the herd''s entire range while the 26 summer recoveries were exclusively from the Keewatin District of the Northwest Territories. Tag recoveries have shown that the Manitoba-Keewatin caribou herd shares a portion of its winter range with the adjacent Saskatchewan herd but the 2 herds appear to use separate calving grounds and summer ranges. Herd movements have been variable and involve widely separated subgroups. Since a large portion of the herd''s range receives little or no hunting pressure, the herd''s seasonal distribution and specific movement could not be determined from the hunters'' tag recoveries.																			0022-541X	1937-2817					1967	31	1					150	+		10.2307/3798370	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3798370													WOS:A19678876100018

Multidecadal reanalyses-driven simulations with and without lakes revealed the systematic biases of the model and the impact of lakes on the simulated North American climate. The presence of lakes strongly influences the climate of the lake-rich region of the Canadian Shield. Due to their large thermal inertia, lakes act to dampen the diurnal and seasonal cycle of low-level air temperature. In late autumn and winter, ice-free lakes induce large sensible and latent heat fluxes, resulting in a strong enhancement of precipitation downstream of the Laurentian Great Lakes, which is referred to as the snow belt. The FLake (FL) and Hostetler (HL) lake models perform adequately for small subgrid-scale lakes and for large resolved lakes with shallow depth, located in temperate or warm climatic regions. Both lake models exhibit specific strengths and weaknesses. For example, HL simulates too rapid spring warming and too warm surface temperature, especially in large and deep lakes; FL tends to damp the diurnal cycle of surface temperature. An adaptation of 1-D lake models might be required for an adequate simulation of large and deep lakes.																			0280-6495						2012	64								16226	10.3402/tellusa.v64i0.16226	http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/tellusa.v64i0.16226													WOS:000300395600001

Thermal stratification was unstable but was established in 1 of the 2 summers of the study and was associated with O2 depletion in the hypolimnion. Both nitrate and phosphate concentrations showed distinct seasonality and the amounts in the influent were very similar to the amounts in the effluent. Large populations of Cryptomonas spp. developed in the early summer, when amounts of phosphate and nitrate were minimal, and were followed by a succession of planktonic Cyanophyta lasting into the winter. A population of Peridinium aciculiferum occurred over the winter. Based on their ecology in the reservoir the species of phytoplankton were divided into 3 groups an autochthonous group, which developed populations simultaneously all over the lake; an allochthonous group, which sometimes formed populations around the inflow; and the river plankton, which rarely developed in the reservoir.																									1968	25	6					1229	+		10.1139/f68-107	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f68-107													WOS:A1968B308800011

The content of carbon dioxide and methane was recorded continuously in the surface water and near-surface atmosphere along the ship route from Lake Baikal to the dam in the upstream pool and the dam area in the downstream pool. It is shown that in the summer-fall period the intense photosynthetic activity of biota leads to a significant decrease in the carbon dioxide concentration in water, and the Irkutsk water reservoir is an absorber of carbon dioxide. In the same period, the results of CH4 study indicate that in the summer-fall period the water reservoir is a source of methane inflow into the atmosphere.

It is also used directly for washing and drinking water, both for humans and cattle, especially in summer time. These are the reasons for the present study to follow survival and transfer of faecal indicators downstream from the wastewater treatment plant. Samples were collected in winter and summer from the bottom of the lake at deep sites. At some of the sites the vertical distribution of microbes in summer was also studied. Indicators determined were faecal coliforms, enterococci, sulphite-reducing clostridia and coliphages. The farthest point was 35km for bottom samples. All the indicators could be found in sampling sites near to the discharge point with relatively high numbers. At distant sample sites, coliphages or enterococci were the most abundant. In the winter, coliphages were found up to 18km from the discharge point. In summer, indicators survived well. The results suggest that the direct use of lake water could be considered a health risk.

Overall, the mean rate of regurgitation for striped bass which contained food contents in their stomach was 8(.)3%. Striped bass captured by wedging had a higher mean regurgitation rate (17%) than individuals that were either entangled (5%) or gilled (2%). Striped bass caught during the autumn had approximately the same frequency of regurgitation as individuals captured during the summer (10 v. 9%), but these regurgitation rates were higher than those observed for fish during the spring sampling periods (4%). Larger striped bass were more likely to regurgitate their stomach contents than smaller individuals, with the frequency of regurgitation increasing by 0(.)7% for every 50 rum increase in LT. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of identifying factors that influence regurgitation of stomach contents to minimize and account for biases associated with diet data collected from striped bass captured in gillnets. Using this information, sampling recommendations for food-habit and feeding-rate studies involving the collection of piscivorous fishes using gillnets are made.

J	Bocaniov, SA; Scavia, D				Bocaniov, Serghei A.; Scavia, Donald			Nutrient Loss Rates in Relation to Transport Time Scales in a Large Shallow Lake (Lake St. Clair, USA-Canada): Insights From a Three-Dimensional Model	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												A nutrient mass balance and a three-dimensional, coupled hydrodynamic-ecological model, calibrated and validated for Lake St. Clair with observations from 2009 and 2010, were integrated to estimate monthly lake-scale nutrient loss rates, and to calculate 3 monthly transport time scales: flushing time, water age, and water residence time. While nutrient loss rates had statistically significant relationships with all transport time scale measures, water age had the strongest explanatory power, with water age and nutrient loss rates both smaller in spring and fall and larger in summer. We show that Lake St. Clair is seasonally divided into two discrete regions of contrasting water age and productivity. The north-western region is dominated by oligotrophic waters from the St. Clair River, and south-eastern region is dominated by the nutrient enriched, more productive waters from the Thames-Sydenham River complex. The spatial and temporal variations in local transport scales and nutrient loss rates, coupled with strong seasonal variations in discharge and nutrient loads from the major tributaries, suggest the need for different load reduction strategies for different tributaries.

Humic substances in surface waters of the Ukraine	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF GENERAL CHEMISTRY												The results of studies of humic substances in water bodies of different types (lakes, rivers, and reservoirs) are given. It is shown that concentration of these natural organic compounds varies in a wide range of values (from 1.2 to 126.5 mg L-1) due to different sources of their formation. The highest concentrations of humic substances are characteristic for rivers of the Pripyat' River basin flowing through the wetland. As we move from the north to the south, the content of humic substances is reduced. So, in the Kakhovka Reservoir, closing the Dnieper cascade of reservoirs, the concentration of humic substances is almost thrice as low as in the Kiev Reservoir, which is at the head of the cascade. Seasonal changes of humic substances concentration and the reasons for these changes are discussed. The prevailing fraction in the composition of humic substances is represented by fulvic acids, the content of which reaches 80.8-94.8% of the total. The results of studies of the molecular weight distribution of humic substances and the reasons for changes in the ratio of their individual fractions, depending on the detection method (spectrophotometric and fluorescence methods), are considered. The values of the number average (M (n)) and weight average (M (w)) molecular weight of humic substances and the degree of polydispersity are calculated. It is shown that M (w) varies seasonally. In spring and summer it is lower, but significantly increased in autumn. The reason for this phenomenon is degradation of high-molecular fractions of humic substances under the influence of UV light of solar radiation and increased microbiological activity during the summer season. As a result of these processes high-molecular fractions of humic substances are transformed into fractions with lower molecular weight, which become predominant.					; Linnik, Peter/S-5725-2019; Linnik, Rostyslav/F-5593-2017; Zhezherya, Vladislav/AAK-5774-2020	Linnik, Peter/0000-0002-2144-4052; Zhezherya, Vladyslav/0000-0002-1128-5270; Linnik, Rostyslav/0000-0002-6401-8184; 													1070-3632	1608-3350				DEC	2013	83	13					2715	2730		10.1134/S1070363213130185	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1070363213130185													WOS:000331205400018
J	Wang, ZF; Qian, YF				Wang Zhifu; Qian Yongfu			The Relationship of Land-Ocean Thermal Anomaly Difference with Mei-yu and South China Sea Summer Monsoon	ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												Based on the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data for the period of 1948-2004 and the monthly rainfall data at 160 stations in China from 1951 to 2004, the relationships among the land-ocean temperature anomaly difference in the mid-lower troposphere in spring (April-May), the mei-yu rainfall in the Yangtze River-Huaihe River basin, and the activities of the South China Sea summer monsoon (SCSSM) are analyzed by using correlation and composite analyses. Results show that a significant positive correlation exists between mei-yu rainfall and air temperature in the middle latitudes above the western Pacific, while a significant negative correlation is located to the southwest of the Baikal Lake. When the land-ocean thermal anomaly difference is stronger in spring, the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) will be weaker and retreat eastward in summer (June-July), and the SCSSM will be stronger and advance further north, resulting in deficient moisture along the mei-yu front and below-normal precipitation in the mid and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and vice versa for the weaker difference case. The effects and relative importance of the land and ocean anomalous heating on monsoon variability is also compared. It is found that the land and ocean thermal anomalies are both closely related to the summer circulation and mei-yu rainfall and SCSSM intensity, whereas the land heating anomaly is more important than ocean heating in changing the land-ocean thermal contrast and hence the summer monsoon intensity.																			0256-1530	1861-9533				JAN	2009	26	1					169	179		10.1007/s00376-009-0169-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00376-009-0169-y													WOS:000264090200017

Apparent breeding success drives long-term population dynamics of a migratory swan	JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY												The ability of a species to adapt to environmental change is ultimately reflected in its vital rates - i.e. survival and reproductive success of individuals. Together, vital rates determine trends in numbers, commonly monitored using counts of species abundance. Rapid changes in abundance can give rise to concern, leading to calls for research into the biological mechanisms underlying variations in demography. For the northwest European population of Bewick's swan Cygnus columbianus bewickii, there have been major changes in the population trends recorded during nearly five decades of monitoring (1970-2016). The total number of birds increased to a maximum of ca 30 000 in 1995 and subsequently decreased to about 18 000 individuals in 2010. Such large fluctuation in population numbers is rare in long-lived species and understanding the drivers of this population change is crucial for species management and conservation. Using the integrated population model (IPM) framework, we analysed three demographic datasets in combination: population counts, capture-mark-resightings (CMR) and the proportion of juveniles in winter over a period of similar to 50 years. We found higher apparent breeding success in the years when the population had a positive growth rate compared to years with a negative growth rate. Moreover, no consistent trend in adult and yearling survival, and an increasing trend in juvenile survival was found. A transient life-table response experiment showed that apparent breeding success and adult survival contributed most to the variation in population trend. We explored possible explanatory variables for the different demographic rates and found a significant association between juvenile survival both with the water level in lakes during autumn migration, which affects food accessibility for the swans, and with summer temperatures. Such associations are important for understanding the dynamics of species with fluctuating population sizes, and thus for informing management and conservation decisions.

Population peaks of the different taxa were clearly separated in time. In early spring there were chironomid density peaks of Stictochironomus sticticus, in one year followed by a Polypedilum maximum. From June-July chydorid cladocerans dominated, with a peak of Monospilus dispar followed by a peak of Rhynchotalona falcata. In autumn the chironomid Cladotanytarsus mancus became dominant, remaining so throughout the winter. To study the spatial heterogeneity of the major macro- and meiofaunal taxa, samples were taken in a grid of 2.5 x 10 m. Distributions of all but one taxon were significantly different from random, with Morisita indices varying from 1.23 (chironomids) to 2.10 (the chydorid Monospilus dispar). Wind-induced disturbance presumably had strong and species-specific effects on littoral macro- and meiobenthic taxa. Chydorid heterogeneity increased immediately following the first autumn storm of the season; this may be explained by the tendency of these organisms to remain attached to detritus particles. Temporal and spatial coefficients between macro- and meiobenthic taxa were generally low, suggesting that interactions between these groups are weak, with distribution patterns that are independent of each other. Among the meiofaunal taxa, positive spatial and temporal correlation coefficients were found; apparently, the similarity in both seasonal dynamics and spatial distributions is larger among the meiofaunal taxa than between macro- and meiofaunal taxa. Also among most of the chironomid species significant positive temporal correlations were found, except for Stictochironomus sticticus and Polypedilum sp.; these species have similar life-cycles, but were during one year temporally separated by several alternating settlement peaks. In the next year, Polypedilum disappeared completely following an extremely strong Stictochironomus settlement peak.						van de Bund, Wouter/0000-0002-2749-0850													0018-8158					MAR 10	1995	299	2					125	138		10.1007/BF00017564	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00017564													WOS:A1995QU04600004

Large scale seasonal forecasting of peak season algae metrics in the Midwest and Northeast US	WATER RESEARCH												In recent decades, many inland lakes have seen an increase in the prevalence of potentially harmful algae. In many inland lakes, the peak season for algae abundance (summer and early fall in the northern hemisphere) coincides with the peak season for recreational use. Currently, little information regarding expected algae conditions is available prior to the peak season for productivity in inland lakes. Peak season algae conditions are influenced by an array of pre-season (spring and early summer) local and global scale variables; identifying these variables for forecast development may be useful in managing potential public health threats posed by harmful algae. Using the LAGOS-NE dataset, pre-season local and global drivers of peak-season algae metrics (represented by chlorophyll-a) are identified for 178 lakes across the Northeast and Midwest U.S. from readily available gridded datasets. Forecasting models are built for each lake conditioned on relevant pre-season predictors. Forecasts are assessed for the magnitude, severity, and duration of seasonal chlorophyll concentrations. Regions of pre-season sea surface temperature, and pre-season chlorophyll-a demonstrate the most predictive power for peak season algae metrics, and resulting models show significant skill. Based on categorical forecast metrics, more than 70% of magnitude models and 90% of duration models outperform climatology. Forecasts of high and severe algae magnitude perform best in large mesotrophic and oligotrophic lakes, however, high algae duration performance appears less dependent on lake characteristics. The advance notice of elevated algae biomass provided by these models may allow lake managers to better prepare for challenges posed by algae during the high use season for inland lakes.					; Wilkinson, Grace/AAD-3202-2020	Beal, Maxwell/0000-0003-2332-0704; Block, Paul/0000-0003-1993-7496													0043-1354	1879-2448				FEB 1	2023	229								119402	10.1016/j.watres.2022.119402	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2022.119402		NOV 2022						36462259					WOS:000923947500007
J	Jones, RC				Jones, RC			Seasonal and spatial patterns in phytoplankton photosynthetic parameters in a tidal freshwater river	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The photosynthetic response to irradiance was quantified for phytoplankton from the tidal freshwater Potomac River biweekly to monthly over a period of six years. Samples were collected from two shallow embayments and portions of the deeper river mainstem. Photosynthetic rate was measured in the laboratory at in situ temperature over a range of irradiance levels and photosynthetic parameters were calculated using nonlinear regression. p(max)(B), the maximum photosynthetic rate standardized to chlorophyll a, increased with temperature up to 25 degrees C with a Q(10) of 2.02. Above 25 degrees C, p(max)(B) essentially constant with temperature. Lesser correlation between p(max)(B) and ambient irradiance could be explained by the correlation of irradiance with temperature. alpha, the slope of the P-I curve at low light, was correlated with both ambient irradiance and temperature. Highest alpha values were found in late summer when high temperature and intermediate ambient irradiance were observed. Spring and early summer were characterized by low alpha. Despite low light penetration, I-k and alpha values were indicative of sun limitation possibly due to intermittent high light levels experienced during mixing. I-k showed a clear seasonal trend directly related to days from summer solstice. Spatial patterns were minimal except that I-k was consistently lower in one shallow embayment than in the other two areas. Seasonal patterns in photosynthetic parameters corresponded roughly to changes from a spring diatom population to summer cyanobacterial assemblage.

J	Manca, M; Cavicchioni, N; Morabito, G				Manca, M; Cavicchioni, N; Morabito, G			First observations on the effect of a complete, exceptional overturn of Lake Maggiore on plankton and primary productivity	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY												This manuscript presents some results of a monitoring of the planktonic communities of Lago Maggiore during the complete overturn of the lake in the winter of 1998/1999. These results are of particular interest not only because holomixy is a rare event in this well-known water body, but also because these are the first such results obtained after a significant change in the lake's trophic status. Holomixy can be regarded as a "whole lake experiment" sensu EDMONDSON (1993): irrespective of the mechanisms underlying the process, it produces an internal enrichment of algal nutrients, and particularly of phosphorus. The increase in biomass and productivity of phytoplankton seems to be driven more by the increase in phosphorus than by a decrease in potential grazers. However, once the luxury amount of nutrients supplied by the overturn was exhausted, the photosynthetic productivity decreased to values more typical of a "normal" spring productivity, in accordance with the present trophic condition of the lake. Similarly, the enhancement of phytoplankton growth seems likely to have stimulated the numerical increase of zooplankton, and especially of small, fast reproducing rotifer species. Moreover, the spring pulse of primary productivity and the phosphorus enrichment represent a crucial phase for the storage of the potential energy necessary for the development of the zooplankton population, particularly of cladocera, in summer.

The population dynamics of Potamopyrgus antipodarum showed the same seasonal pattern in the numbers of embryos carried per individual female in both years, but seasonal patterns in density and potential reproductive output of the population differed between shores. Densities of Potamopyrgus antipodarum were high, with a trend for highest densities to occur in spring and summer. The population consisted almost entirely of females, which is indicative of a parthenogenic mode of reproduction. Fecundity was high, with the number of embryos carried per female peaking in spring. In summer, the population was dominated by small individuals, but some small snails were present at all times of the year. Potamopyrgus antipodarum was found to be a very successful invader of Lake Purrumbete, with high densities, high fecundity, parthenogenesis and the presence of embryos throughout the year contributing to this success.																			1323-1650						1998	49	1					73	78		10.1071/MF97113	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF97113													WOS:000073144900009

Generalized Linear Mixed Modelling was used to analyse patterns of both flea and trypanosome occurrence. Overall, males of all sizes and ages were more likely to be infested with fleas than their female counterparts. Flea prevalence also showed direct density dependence during the winter, but patterns of density dependence varied amongst body mass (age) classes during the summer. Trypanosome prevalence did not vary between the sexes but was positively related to past flea prevalence with a lag of 3 months, with the highest levels occurring during the autumn season. A convex age-prevalence distribution was observed, suggesting that individuals develop a degree of immunity to trypanosome infection with age and exposure. An interaction between age and whether the individual was new or recaptured suggested that infected animals are less likely to become territory holders than their uninfected counterparts.					; Burthe, Sarah/Q-9505-2016; Bennett, Malcolm/G-4004-2010; burthe, sarah/Q-9505-2016	Bennett, Malcolm/0000-0002-5490-2910; Burthe, Sarah/0000-0001-8871-3432; Bennett, Malcolm/0000-0003-0475-390X; Begon, Mike/0000-0003-1715-5327; Telfer, Sandra/0000-0002-9596-0711													0031-1820	1469-8161				SEP	2005	131		3				355	365		10.1017/S0031182005007766	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0031182005007766								16178357					WOS:000232315600009

This research was planned to calculate the seasonal variations in metal (Pb, Cu, and Ni) bioaccumulation in different tissues of Gills, Liver, Kidney, and Muscle from Cirrhinus mrigala sampled from River Chenab from an area of high-intensity pollution near Thatta Muhammad Shah. The results revealed significant (P 0.5) vari-ations in metals bioaccumulation in different seasons. The lowest level of selected metals was observed in winter, whereas the maximum level was noted in the summer. The concentration of selected heavy met -als differed seasonally. During winter Pb concentration distribution in descending order was observed in liver (0.823 +/- 0.009 ppm) kidney(0.817 +/- 0.011 ppm) > muscle(0.758 +/- 0.009 ppm) > gills(0.742 +/- 0. 011 ppm). Whereas, in summer it was noted as liver (1.726 +/- 0.066 ppm) > gills (1.633 +/- 0.060 ppm) > k idney (1.575 +/- 0.051 ppm) > muscle (1.532 +/- 0.050 ppm). While during winter, the bioaccumulation of Cu in organs was noted with descending order of kidney (1.88 +/- 0.038) > liver(1.75 +/- 0.037) > gills (1.67 +/- 0. 043) > muscle (1.45 +/- 0.031)ppm, while in summer, it was gills (2.85 +/- 0.071) > kidney (2.84 +/- 0.082) > liver (2.83 +/- 0.068) > muscle (2.72 +/- 0.065) ppm. In winter, the Ni bioaccumulation with descending order was in the kidney (7.83 +/- 0.139) > liver (7.68 +/- 0.159) > muscle (7.63 +/- 0.162) > gills (7.61 +/- 0.129)ppm and ina season of summer, it was detected as in kidney (8.71 +/- 0.129) > muscle (8.59 +/- 0.131) > liver (8. 56 +/- 0.141) > gills (8.56 +/- 0.131) ppm. All studied heavy metals were found to be above the WHO permis-sible limits. Histopathological evaluation of fish tissues has been considered an important indicator of environmental pollution monitoring. Histology of kidney and liver tissues showed congestion, necrosis, dilation in Bowman capsule space, while liver showed necrosis, cytoplasmic vacuolation, and sinusoid dilation. This study revealed that the Chenab River is being polluted due to the untreated discharge of industrial effluents and sewage runoff from the city, and these heavy metals from anthropogenic pollu-tion load have adverse effects on the fish population in the river system.

The availability of food resources in the habitat is critical and varies within water levels. Although the water-level fluctuations in Poyang Lake have been extremely variable interannually in recent years, the wintering waterbird populations have remained relatively stable. Hence, the mechanism of maintaining the stability is worth exploring. This study aimed to compare the distribution of vegetation and herbivorous waterbirds in 2015 - 2016 and 2016 - 2017, focusing on three shallow sub -lakes and one main lake are. The results showed that the emergence of tubers and the growth of Carex spp. provided a continuous food supply and habitat for wintering waterbirds with a gradual decline in the water level. Shallow sub -lakes supported almost all of the tuber-eating waterbirds (1.42 - 1.62 x 10 5 ) and most geese (1.34 - 1.53 x 10 6 ). However, the main lake area, covered with Persicaria hydropiper , did not provide adequate and accessible food. This resulted in almost no distribution of tuber-eating waterbirds, with only a few geese congregating in early winter. Our results demonstrated that the shallow sub -lakes under human control provided a different environment from the main lake and are key to sustaining the successful wintering of hundreds of thousands of migratory waterbirds in Poyang Lake. Therefore, we recommend refining the anthropogenic management of the shallow sub -lakes to regulate the water level to ensure the carrying capacity of Poyang Lake.					gao, bin/JYW-5418-2024														2053-7166						2024	15								100178	10.1016/j.avrs.2024.100178	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.avrs.2024.100178													WOS:001249383900001

The analysis of climatic and hydrological data since 1950 identified eight distinct hydrological stages, with runoff trends strongly correlated to ENSO phases. During the La Nina phases, discharge in downstream areas decreases by 33-36 % compared to the El Nino phases. Gradual increases in average temperatures and decreased winter precipitations lead to pronounced water deficits in summer, with changes in the snow-to-rain ratio. Hydrograph analysis in the basin's headwaters reveals three major periods: (i) 1950-1976, characterized by two flood peaks-one from winter precipitation, another from spring snowmelt; (ii) 1978-2000, marked by reduced discharge and smoother hydrographs; and (iii) 2001-2024, showing erratic precipitation and sharp-peaked hydrographs, indicative of a rain-dominated catchment. In recent decades and due to climate warming, the Lower Basin faces a seasonal hydrological deficit, with an annual precipitation of 154 mm and evaporation of 1738 mm. However, despite a 2.18 degrees C temperature increase (1989-2015), reduced summer wind velocity, likely due to a southward shift of the westerlies, has mitigated evaporation rates. Agricultural water use in the Upper Basin and Sarmiento Delta surpasses urban consumption by over 900 %, with irrigation in the Upper Basin using three times the combined domestic and industrial water supply and 6.23 times more in the Lower Basin. The desiccation of Colhue<acute accent> Huapi Lake is driven by reduced discharge through the Falso Senguerr course and increasing La Nina frequency, exacerbated by higher water consumption in the Lower Basin. These processes have intensified desertification, favoring the formation and migration of eolian dunes on the dry substrate and increasing dust transport during windstorms.					; Paredes, Jose/S-4679-2019	Oporto Romero, Francisco Emanuel/0009-0004-1974-5552; 													0895-9811	1873-0647				AUG 15	2025	162								105608	10.1016/j.jsames.2025.105608	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsames.2025.105608													WOS:001504581500003

Samples of bottom organisms were collected from July through October 1952, and in May 1953 from 9 sampling stations located above and below all the major influxes of hot spring water into the river. The Gardiner River and Lava Creek were surveyed to gather additional information. The average yearly standing-crop of the Firehole River and other Yellowstone Park streams was positively correlated with temperature and bicarbonate alkalinity, the latter being highly significant. Analysis of data from other streams and lakes further illustrated the influence of alkalinity on standing crop of organisms. Standing crop, as expressed by weight, was high in the spring with a gradual decrease in the summer to a low in the fall. Rubble bottom had a average of 2.48 times the weight of organisms on bedrock. The relative-density of Trichoptera had significant positive correlation with average alkalinity, the relative-density of Ephemeroptera had a significant negative correlation with average alkalinity, and the correlations of the relative-density of Coleoptera and Diptera with average alkalinity were negative, but non-significant. It was postulated that alkalinity might be the chief factor that determines the level of standing crop in a stream, but that this level can be highly modified by the action of temperature, current, and the physical composition of the stream bottom.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1958	39	4					571	580		10.2307/1931597	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1931597													WOS:A1958WR63100001
J	Gibb, OT; Hillaire-Marcel, C; de Vernal, A				Gibb, Olivia T.; Hillaire-Marcel, Claude; de Vernal, Anne			Oceanographic regimes in the northwest Labrador Sea since Marine Isotope Stage 3 based on dinocyst and stable isotope proxy records	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Sea surface temperature (SST), salinity and density gradients in the upper water column of the northwest Labrador Sea have been reconstructed based on high resolution analysis of a core (HU2008-029-004PC) spanning the last similar to 36 ka, raised off Hudson Strait. The modern analogue technique was applied to dinocyst assemblages and combined with stable isotope data from Neogloboquadrina pachyderma left-coiled (Npl) for this purpose. Three oceanographic regimes were identified, broadly corresponding to the "glacial", "deglacial" and "postglacial" intervals. The site remained under the direct influence of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) margin until the postglacial and did not record the Bolling-Allerod warming and weakly recorded the Younger Dryas event. The "glacial" regime lasted until similar to 12.2 cal ka BP. It was characterized by generally low concentrations of dinocysts within an assemblage indicative of quasi-perennial sea ice. The "deglacial" regime (ca 12.2-8.3 cal ka BP) was marked by increased biogenic fluxes and more diversified dinocyst assemblages and possibly an enhanced subsurface inflow of North East Atlantic Deep Water. Warm summer (similar to 11 degrees C) but low winter (similar to 0 degrees C) sea surface temperatures, sea ice cover during about 3 months per year, and low summer salinity (similar to 28) suggest strong stratification in the upper water layer in relation to meltwater supply from the LIS. Following the final drainage of glacial Lake Agassiz through Hudson Strait, which is dated here at similar to 8.3 cal ka BP, and the subsequent LIS collapse, increased summer salinity (up to similar to 35) was accompanied by a reduced seasonal gradient of sea surface temperature from winter (similar to 3.8 degrees C) to summer (similar to 8.6 degrees C) suggesting enhanced penetration of North Atlantic Water. Weakened stratification of the surface water layer then allowed for winter convection and Labrador Sea Water formation, which is consistent with increased Npl-delta C-13 values in response to higher ventilation of the subsurface water layer.

Here, we present a 115-yr-resolution record of bGDGTs (branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers) based mean annual air temperature (MAAT) from Ngamring Co in the southern TP, spanning the past 18 ka. Our record reveals the MAAT generally responds to annual insolation and greenhouse gases changes, showing slight cooling during the deglaciation and remaining at low temperature until 6 ka BP, and then warming up to present. Combination with other records reveals the regional annual temperature shows a warming trend in the Holocene, which is in agreement with the model simulation rather than the stacked proxies. Importantly, the distinct cold interval during 10e6 ka BP is not present either in the simulation or in most of records for the adjacent region. We suggest such cold interval was a response to the positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) conditions during the early Holocene, which led to a decrease in winter temperature and increased snowfall in the southern TP. Considering the consistent pattern of local annual and winter insolation over past 18 ka, and the high correlation between annual and winter temperature over the past 40 yr, we cautiously indicate that winter season may be crucial for the annual temperature in the TP. Additional quantitative records with clear seasonal signals, especially in winter, are needed to confirm our hypothesis. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Byström, P; Andersson, J; Kiessling, A; Eriksson, LO				Bystrom, Par; Andersson, Jens; Kiessling, Anders; Eriksson, Lars-Ove			Size and temperature dependent foraging capacities and metabolism:: consequences for winter starvation mortality in fish	OIKOS												The foraging related capacities, energy requirements and the ability of individuals to withstand starvation are strongly dependent on body size and temperature. In this study, we estimated size-dependent foraging rates and critical resource density (CRD) in small Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) under winter conditions and compared these with previous observations under summer conditions. We investigated if starvation mortality is size-dependent in the laboratory, and we assessed the potential for winter growth and the occurrence and size dependency of winter mortality both in a large scale pond experiment and in natural lakes. The efficiency of foraging on macroinvertebrates increased with size but was lower at 4 than 12 degrees C, still CRD was lower at 4 than 12 degrees C as metabolic rates decreased faster than foraging efficiency with temperature. When starved, small char died before large and at rates which suggest that YOY char need to feed during winter to avoid starvation. Results from both our pond experiment and field study indicate that survival of YOY char over winter is high, despite severe winter conditions, because YOY char are able to feed and grow during winter. In seasonal environments with declining resources, the size scaling and temperature dependency of foraging and metabolic demands may provide conditions which can favour either small or large individuals. This size advantage dichotomy relates to that larger individual's by having a higher CRD are more likely to start starving, but once resource levels are below CRD for all size classes, small individuals starve to death at a higher rate. Negative size-dependent winter mortality from starvation is suggested to be more pronounced in species that are not adapted to feed at low temperatures and in species feeding on zooplankton, since zooplankton abundance, in contrast to macroinvertebrate abundance, is generally low during winter.

J	McKee, FR; Aukema, BH				McKee, Fraser R.; Aukema, Brian H.			Seasonal Phenology and Life-History of Dendroctonus simplex (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) in the Great Lakes Region of North America	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												The eastern larch beetle, Dendroctonus simplex LeConte (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is distributed throughout the North American boreal forest sympatric with its primary host, the eastern larch or tamarack, Larix laricina (Du Roi) K. Koch. Outbreaks of eastern larch beetles are typically small and associated with stressed tamaracks. Since 2000, however, an outbreak has killed >90,000 ha of tamarack in Minnesota and surrounding Great Lakes region. Identifying the causes of this epidemic is challenging due to knowledge gaps regarding the insect's biology. We present field data from 2011 to 2014 on degree days associated with spring emergence, dispersal, host colonization, and re-emergence from colonized hosts by mature adult beetles, as well as degree days associated with larval development, and prewinter emergence by adult progeny at study sites in northern Minnesota. After initial host colonization in early spring we found that a second brood was established in early summer by re-emerging parents. In 2012, a third brood was established. Across study years, first broods developed to adults by late summer, with many beetles relocating to the base of the host tree to overwinter. Second broods often reached adulthood and initiated prewinter emergence. The third brood of 2012 overwintered as adults, pupae, and late-instars, resuming development the following spring. Each spring, emergence of adult beetles from all broods established the previous year was highly synchronous. Knowledge of the biology of eastern larch beetles along the southern margin of their range aids in understanding how population dynamics may change with a changing climate.																			0046-225X	1938-2936				AUG	2016	45	4					812	828		10.1093/ee/nvw057	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/nvw057								27333874					WOS:000381911600006

Close inspection of the depth interval between 35.0 and 42.5 m in a 55-m-long core shows an environmental crisis at a depth of 40.95 m that lasted approximately 800 years and resulted in almost complete extinction of fir (Abies) from the communities existing at that time. Geochemical analyses reveal a simultaneous increase in sulphur in the deposits and a change in stable carbon and oxygen isotope ratios towards higher values, as well as a significant increase in the thickness of the laminae (up to 5 mm). Diatom studies show a clear increase in benthic diatoms in this interval, implying a decrease in water level. However, the predominance of such forms was probably caused by the elimination of planktonic diatoms by invasive blooms of Tetraedron, rather than lower lake levels, evidence of which was not noted in the pollen spectra. Hence, all these changes in the lake may have been triggered by the destruction of fir trees, the gradual decomposition of dead trunks and some inconspicuous geomorphological disturbances caused by wind throw. They resulted in a supply of micronutrients to the basin, an increase in varve thickness and rapid oscillations in the abundance and composition of algae and changes in the geochemical status of the lake. Rapid and significant drops in winter temperatures appear to be responsible for the extinction of fir. Alternatively, late frost in spring or hot and dry summers may have affected microsporophyll growth and the fir physiology as known from extant Abies populations. This environmental crisis, which is termed the Younger Holsteinian Oscillation (YHO), is noted at only a few sites. At Dethlingen (Germany), where hornbeam communities disappear at that time, a drop in summer temperatures is suggested to have been the driving force. We suggest that, at Ossowka, a drop in winter temperatures, late frost, or summer drought at the very start of the YHO are possible causes of the near-extinction of fir.

In this study, we tested the importance of trophic cascades on phytoplankton structure, predicting that environmental variations are the main drivers. We performed a monthly sampling during a year to measure environmental variables, phytoplankton and zooplankton, plus two samplings (winter and summer) to assess fish structure. Furthermore, we analyzed zooplanktivorous fish stomach-gut contents and completed a hatching zooplankton resting egg experiment to assess the effect of fish on dormant populations. We ran a partial redundancy analysis (pRDA) for phytoplankton using zooplankton, nutrient availability and environmental variables as predictor variables. We finally calculated several ratios of the zooplankton:phytoplankton biovolume to assess potential predation effects. Phytoplankton was correlated with variations in temperature and conductivity plus nutrients (pRDA: 63.4%, F=4.6, P=0.001) and was dominated alternatively by diatoms and cyanobacteria. Zooplankton was dominated by microphagous rotifers (>45% of the total biovolume), and only the ratio of microphagous rotifer:small chlorophytes was significant during summer and autumn (F=10.6, P=0.005). The fish community was dominated by insectivorous-planktivorous fish (>65% of total density), yet a negative selection of zooplankton items (Ivlev's index<0) was found. Nevertheless, the zooplankton resting stage analysis showed that microphagous Rotifera were dominant (29 species emerged), suggesting a structuring effect of fish on the zooplankton size. We conclude that phytoplankton was mainly controlled by environmental variations plus nutrient availability, while top-down had a less evident effect.					; Frau, Diego/V-2613-2019; Mayora, Gisela/JDX-0167-2023	Frau, Diego/0000-0002-7000-8863; Mayora, Gisela/0000-0003-2839-2803; Sinistro, Rodrigo/0000-0002-8007-7213; 													1386-2588	1573-5125				JUN	2019	53	2					265	280		10.1007/s10452-019-09687-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-019-09687-3													WOS:000467538000009
J	Hessen, DO; van Donk, E; Gulati, R				Hessen, DO; van Donk, E; Gulati, R			Seasonal seston stoichiometry: effects on zooplankton in cyanobacteria-dominated lakes	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Seasonal dynamics in elemental composition [carbon (C), nitrogen and phosphorus (P)] of seston and zooplankton were studied over several years in three hypereutrophic Dutch lakes with persistent dominance and high biomass of cyanobacteria. In all three lakes, there was a strong pattern with decreased P-content and increased C:P ratio in seston (< 150 mu m) coinciding with the increase in water temperature. The seston C:P ratios (at:at) were more than doubled with the rising temperature, i.e. from similar to 200 (at:at) in winter to 500 in summer. Sestonic C:P ratios increased over the growing season, suggesting that seasonal dynamics among autotrophs with high P-uptake in winter and support of subsequent phytoplankton growth by consumption of internal cellular P (P-quota) was the main cause of low sestonic P contents in late summer. This could, however, occur in concert with a physiologically driven decrease in cell-specific P at higher temperatures in summer. In contrast, the annual variation of C:P ratios of the zooplankton fraction was only 10% of that of seston. The variations of C:P ratios of the zooplankton were, nevertheless, strongly correlated with those of seston. For most of the summer, seston C:P ratios were far above the threshold ratio for P-limitation in Daphnia and other P-demanding species. This will pose further constraints on growth performance of Daphnia in these lakes, thus adding to the fish predation pressure and the poor food quality of cyanobacteria per se. The low grazing pressure causes a high biomass of low-quality autotrophs, promoting a stable state with low trophic transfer efficiency.

Characterizing winter season severity in the Midwest United States, part II: Interannual variability	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												The Accumulated Winter Season Severity Index (AWSSI) describes the "harshness" of the cold season. This work utilizes AWSSI to explore the interannual teleconnective influences that shaped winter severity between 1951 and 2020 across the Midwest U.S. Annual AWSSI total variability clusters into four distinct geographic areas, each shaped by different teleconnective influences. The regions are closely delineated by the main river basins and include the Ohio (Region 1), upper Mississippi and Missouri (Region 2), central Mississippi and southern Missouri (Region 3), and the Great Lakes (Region 4). Of outmost influence in shaping severe winters across the Midwest have been synoptic flow modifications associated with significant meandering and southern displacement of the Polar jet over the conterminous United States and/or the Midwest that depress near-surface air temperatures and increase the likelihood of snow fall and/or snow depth. These flows are most closely related to the combined influence of the negative (positive) phases of the NAO (PNA and PDO) in Region 1, PNA- in Region 2, NAO- in Region 3, and the negative (positive) phase of the PNA (TNH) across Region 4. Mild winters have been shaped by more zonal flows with the Polar jet positioned north of the Midwest and bringing milder temperatures, less snowfall, and reduced winter severity to the impacted areas. Such modifications have been related to TNH-, PNA+, and NAO+ across Regions 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Mild winters have been shaped by TNH- and to a limited extent NAO+, across Region 4.

Our high-resolution study of a sediment core from Yileimu Lake presents end members (EMs) of grain-size distributions (similar to 5-year resolution), and major and trace elements (similar to 10-year resolution), including the Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA) and Rb/Sr ratio. In contrast to records from these other lakes in ACA, our study indicates a warming and wetting trend in the southern Altay regional climate over the last five centuries. We suggest that continuously increasing snow/ice meltwater from the surrounding high mountains related to an increasing trend in atmospheric temperature, and increasing winter snowfall triggered by a decreasing trend in winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, have dominated the regional climate in the southern Altay Mountains during 1620-1835 AD. We also suggest that temperature dependent evaporative losses greatly exceeding the water input to the lake, and reduced summer precipitation, caused the drought events during 1586-1620 and 1835-1870 AD. Heavy summer precipitation associated with significant increases in the local moisture supply induced by intense evaporation of snow/ice meltwater in the alpine and gorge terrain of the Altay Mountains played a critical role in the summer floods around the 1900s AD.					; Huang, Shuaitang/NHP-5506-2025; Guo, Qiaoqiao/HKW-5407-2023; Jiang, Hanchao/ABG-2653-2020; zhang, siqi/KWU-0918-2024; Xu, Hongyan/I-4518-2017	Fan, Jiawei/0000-0002-8565-5094; Jiang, Hanchao/0000-0003-3391-4477; 													1040-6182	1873-4553				AUG 10	2021	592						37	50		10.1016/j.quaint.2021.04.035	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2021.04.035		MAY 2021											WOS:000660396600004

Heavy metals risk assessment in water and bottom sediments of ICOLLs in northern Poland	GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL												Natural diversity of intermittently closed and open lakes and lagoons (ICOLLs) depends on mutual interactions of several factors: (i) an impact of sea water and land background; (ii) temporary meteorological situation; (iii) hydrological conditions; and (iv) the shape of lake basin. However, some regional, local or even sudden impacts including anthropogenic ones create their final ecological status. To identify heavy metals risk assessment in ICOLLs located in Polish coastline wide range of them were determined in water and bottom sediment samples collected in 10 water reservoirs. Multidimensional data set of 20 variables was explored by the use of chemometrics according to seasonality (Spring, Summer, Autumn), sample type (water, sediment) and level of isolation (fully isolated, partially and fully connected lakes). The results showed that 70.5% and 77% of the data variance can be explained by the use of principal component analysis for waters and sediments, respectively. Waters of fully isolated or partially connected lakes are more abundant with Ir, Nd and Sm, while less abundant with Pr and Sr. Bottom sediments taken from Jamno lake show significant contamination by heavy metals of the highest environmental concern (Al, Cr, Cu, Ni, Ti and Zn).

Lake Erie beaches: diel variation in fish assemblage structure and implications for monitoring	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Knowledge of temporal variation in nearshore Laurentian Great Lakes fish assemblages is important for understanding species-habitat associations, how abiotic and biotic influences vary temporally, and when sampling should occur. Using spring and fall seining data from Lake Erie beaches, we compared day and night fish assemblages and tested for differences among sampling periods. Beaches were utilized by a diverse collection of Lake Erie basin fishes (one-third of known species). During all sampling periods, catches were dominated by cyprinid species (53-91%), and by invertivores and planktivorous fishes. Diel differences were detected in abundance, species richness and assemblage structure. Multivariate analyses (canonical analysis of principal coordinates) indicated that season had a larger influence on fish assemblage structure than diel period. Given observed temporal variation in assemblage structure, studies of Laurentian Great Lakes beach fishes should be restricted to a single time period (e.g. day-time spring sampling), or adopt sampling designs that permit diel period and season to be included as factors in analyses. Second, the large seasonal variation in assemblage composition combined with higher night species richness indicates that night sampling during both spring and fall would be the most efficient and comprehensive approach for beach fish inventory.

The waterbirds were evaluated according to whether they were residents, winter migrants, summer migrants, or transit migrants and were assigned to foraging behavior groups. At Lakes Aksehir-Eber, 67 waterbird species belonging to 17 families and 9 orders were observed, while at Lake Koycegiz 42 species belonging to 14 families and 9 orders were recorded. The waterbird fauna in both lake systems is composed of the following bird groups in the same order of occurrence: diving birds > wading birds > ducks > marsh birds. According to the qualitative comparison of waterbirds in the wetlands, the compositions of winter and summer migrant communities showed significant differences that could suggest that the vegetation composition, the size, the eutrophication level, and the seasonal climatic conditions of these wetlands play a role.

We examined the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of zooplankton in lake surface waters during the spring of 3 years in Lake Washington, U.S.A., a large lake with a high production of sockeye salmon fry. 2. We show large within-season and among-year variation in the horizontal distribution of temperature, chlorophyll a concentration, and zooplankton in the lake. The main pattern, a delay in zooplankton population increase from the north- to the south-end of the lake, recurred in each year and was persistent within each spring. 3. The delay is primarily caused by the development of a temperature gradient during spring warming, as cold mountain water enters the south end of the lake, while warm water enters the north end via a river draining a nearby lake. Climate factors, such as air temperature and precipitation during winter and spring, appear to influence the extent of the delay of zooplankton increase. 4. If the climate continues to warm, the temporal disconnection in zooplankton development between lake areas immediately influenced by cold river inflow and areas that are influenced by spring warming may increase in magnitude. Thus, the different areas of the lake may not contribute equally to fish production.

J	Hawes, I; Schwarz, AM				Hawes, I; Schwarz, AM			Epiphytes from a deep-water characean meadow in an oligotrophic New Zealand lake: Species composition, biomass and photosynthesis	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The epiphytic flora of a characean meadow in Lake Coleridge, a deep, oligotrophic lake on the South Island of New Zealand, was dominated by diatoms, particularly Eunotia pectinalis and Achnanthes minutissima. The meadows occupied a depth range from 5 to 30 m. Adnate taxa predominated at all depths below 5 m, while increased taxonomic diversity at 5 m resulted from an increased abundance of erect taxa, including chlorophytes and stalked diatoms. 2. Seasonal changes in epiphyte biomass were followed using artificial substrata and by estimating epiphyte chlorophyll a concentration on host plants. The latter required development of a novel technique utilizing the consistent relationship between fucoxanthin and chlorophyll a concentrations in the epiphyton. Epiphyte chlorophyll a on host plants varied with depth and host species between 0.1 and 0.3 mg g(-1) dry weight. Maximum epiphyte biomass was at 10-15 m depth. At depths of 15 m and less, epiphyte chlorophyll a reached a maximum of approximate to 200-300 mg m(-2) in mid-summer, while at greater depths maximum biomass was less and coincided with a period of clear water in spring. 3. Photosynthetic carbon fixation was estimated from photosynthesis-radiation curves and estimates of radiation flux at sampling depths. At depths greater than 10 m, variability of the vertical extinction coefficient of lake water rather than seasonal fluctuations in incident radiation were responsible for determining the temporal pattern of production. Chlorophyll a-specific photosynthesis was estimated to peak in summer at 5 m (8 mg mg(-1) day(-1)), and in spring at all other depths. 4. Annual epiphyte production was estimated as 27 g C m(-2) year(-1) at 5 m depth, falling to 15 g C m(-2) year(-1) at 15 m and 1 g C m(-2) year(-1) at 30 m. Areal biomass changes tended to be temporally but not quantitatively coupled to estimated in situ photosynthesis, and we hypothesize that epiphyte biomass may have been controlled by grazing gastropod snails.

A cross-lake comparison of crustacean zooplankton communities in the Laurentian Great Lakes, 1997-2016	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Spring and summer open-water crustacean zooplankton communities were examined across all five Laurentian Great Lakes from 1997 to 2016. Spring communities were dominated by calanoid (lakes Superior, Huron and Michigan) or cyclopoid (lakes Erie and Ontario) copepods. Volumetric biomass of summer communities increased along an assumed trophic gradient (Superior, Huron, Michigan, Ontario; eastern, central and western Erie), as did dominance by cyclopoids and cladocerans. Over the time series of the study, summer communities in lakes Michigan, Huron and Ontario shifted towards greater dominance by calanoids and greater similarity with Lake Superior. Trajectories of changes were different; however, reductions in cladocerans accounted for most of the change in lakes Michigan and Huron while reductions in cyclopoids and increases in Leptodiaptomus sicilis were behind the changes in Lake Ontario. Shifts in the predatory cladoceran community in Lake Ontario from Cercopagis pengoi to occasional dominance by Bythotrephes longimanus, a species much more vulnerable to planktivory, as well as the appearance of Daphnia mendotae in a daphnid community previously consisting almost exclusively of the smaller Daphnia retrocurva, suggest impacts of reduced vertebrate predation. In contrast, strong correlations between cladocerans and chlorophyll in lakes Michigan and Huron point to the possible importance of bottom-up forces in those lakes. Large interannual shifts in cladoceran community structure in the central and eastern basins of Lake Erie suggest intense but variable vertebrate predation pressure. The zooplankton communities of lakes Huron, Michigan and Ontario may be approaching a historic community structure represented by Lake Superior.

The method is used to assess the relative impacts of major nutrient loading sources and a reservoir on the river's water quality. The river completely freezes over during winter; hence, the sensitivity analysis was carried out seasonally, for winter and summer, to account for the influence of ice-covered conditions on nutrient transformations. Furthermore, the integrity of the river's aquatic ecosystem was examined through the inter-relationship between variables and comparing hierarchy index values and water quality indices at four locations along the river. Sensitivities of model parameters varied slightly at different locations along the river, with the phytoplankton growth rate being the most influential parameter. Nitrogen and phosphorus transformation processes were more sensitive in winter, while chlorophyll-a and dissolved oxygen parameters showed higher sensitivity in summer. A more complicated correlation between variables was observed downstream of the junction of the Red Deer River. Our results reveal that the lower correlation between variables may suggest a more balanced and healthier system, although further analysis is needed to support this statement.

J	Yan, DD; Wünnemann, B; Zhang, YZ; Andersen, N				Yan, Dada; Wuennemann, Bernd; Zhang, Yongzhan; Andersen, Nils			Holocene climatic and tectonic forcing of decadal hydroclimate variation on the north-eastern Tibetan Plateau	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												A better understanding of past climate and landscape variability in high resolution on the Tibetan Plateau is of critical importance for the understanding of fundamental mechanisms and interactions in the global climate system. However, due to relatively few datasets in decadal-resolution available for analyzing possible seasonal effects and seismic activity on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, further high-resolution lake records as an integration need to be explored to test the significance of the seasonal variations of surface processes and climatic phenomena as well as tectonic impact on a decadal scale. The rhomb-shaped pull-apart Lake Donggi Cona along the modern monsoon marginal zone on the north-eastern TP is considered an excellent archive that monitors neotectonic and climatic changes through time. We obtained new high-resolution (mean 20 yr) proxy records from a 488 cm-long sediment core from the lake and compare them directly with paleoclimate records from nearby lakes. A decadal-resolution oxygen stable isotope (818O) record co-varies positively with carbonate content and demonstrates the profound and varying contribution of glacier/snow melt (winter/spring moisture) to lake hydrology at different lake evolution stages. This is also indicated by the grain size composition and related endmember modelling (EMMA) results. During 11.8-9.4 cal Ka BP, the lake experienced a swamp status, apart from the major lake body followed by water rise towards the littoral zone until 7.5 cal Ka BP. Glacier melt water supply started to be active since the late Younger Dryas and led to the strong excursions of carbonate contents and 818O values according to insolation increase. This phase was dominated by the westerlies and characterized as low seasonality with long winter duration. Water rose to its highest level during 7.5-6.5 cal Ka BP and fluctuated with deep water phases until 4.7 cal Ka BP, due to glacier melt maxima and potential increase of summer (convective) moisture preserved in the oxygen isotopic signals. Water cover dropped and remained low until 2.9 cal Ka BP due to the reduced glacier melt and colder climate. However, the low 818O values at a reduced water budget points to the still active contribution of spring glacier/snow melt that kept the lake not dryup unlike other lakes with no glacier melt water supply. After 2.9 cal Ka BP water level dropped towards a pond/ lagoon situation until 2.0 cal Ka BP, albeit temperature rise after a long cold climatic interlude. It might be caused by another phase of lake deepening triggered by subsidence and related sediment relocation from the shore, rather than by climatic factors. However, water level increased again afterwards and fluctuated towards the present level due to non-summer moisture supply in long freezing winters. We assume profound signatures of high seasonality in climate after 7.5 cal Ka BP and the lake became open since1.3 cal Ka BP. We suggest that combined thermal forcing by glacier/snow melt and tectonics play a significant role together with solar forcing, governing hydroclimate changes on the north-eastern Tibetan Plateau with decadal to millennial cycles.

J	Miretzky, P; Cirelli, AF				Miretzky, P; Cirelli, AF			Silica dynamics in a pampean lake (Lake Chascomus, Argentina)	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Silica dynamics in a pampean lake, Lake Chascomus (Chaco-Pampa plain, Argentina) is described. Pampean lakes are shallow alkaline ecosystems, with circulation pattern corresponding to polymictic lakes, due to the nearly continuous vertical mixing that promotes a high concentration of suspended particulate matter and low transparency. A silica budget was calculated in Lake Chascomus in 1999-2000 using a one-box model that constitutes the first one for a shallow pampean lake. In general terms, the dissolved silica in Lake Chascomus contributed by streams and groundwater, the latter responsible for 70% of the incoming dissolved silica, was able to support the diatom production development. However, in the algal bloom period (spring and summer), the winter input contributed by the streams and groundwater was insufficient, and therefore, an extra source of dissolved silica was necessary. Dissolution of silicate mineral phases, or silica desorption from metallic oxides might provide the dissolved silica needed for the seasonal increase in diatom abundance. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

J	Werner, S; Rothhaupt, KO				Werner, Stefan; Rothhaupt, Karl-Otto			Mass mortality of the invasive bivalve Corbicula fluminea induced by a severe low-water event and associated low water temperatures	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The Asian clam Corbicula fluminea, originating from Southeast Asia, was first recorded in Lake Constance in 2003 and developed local mass occurrences afterwards. Effects of harsh winter conditions in 2005/2006 associated with a strongly decreasing water level were studied at three different depths at and below the mean low water level (MLL, MLL -1 m and MLL -3 m). Low winter temperatures produced a massive die-off of the C. fluminea population. The mortality of the clams was size class and depth dependent. At the mean low water level (MLL), all clams died because of lying dry. However, at MLL -1 m and at MLL -3 m, mortality was a consequence of water temperatures around 2 degrees C for nearly 3 months. At MLL -3 m, clams > 5 mm died later than young clams < 5 mm and later than clams of all sizes at MLL -1 m. But in late spring even the clams > 5 mm at MLL -3 m were dead and only about 1% of the overall population of C. fluminea survived the winter conditions until spring 2006. Lethal effects of low water temperatures on C. fluminea, which may become effective only after a time lag, were corroborated in an outdoor mesocosm experiment with constant water level and without predation.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2008	613						143	150		10.1007/s10750-008-9479-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-008-9479-9													WOS:000258401000014
J	Mayer, TD; Naman, SW				Mayer, Timothy D.; Naman, Seth W.			STREAMFLOW RESPONSE TO CLIMATE AS INFLUENCED BY GEOLOGY AND ELEVATION	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												This study examines the regional streamflow response in 25 predominately unregulated basins to warmer winter temperatures and snowpack reductions over the last half century in the Klamath Basin of California and Oregon. Geologic controls of streamflow in the region result in two general stream types: surface-dominated and groundwater-dominated basins. Surface-dominated basins were further differentiated into rain basins and snowmelt basins on the basis of elevation and timing of winter runoff. Streamflow characteristics and response to climate vary with stream type, as discussed in the study. Warmer winter temperatures and snowpack reductions have caused significantly earlier runoff peaks in both snowmelt and groundwater basins in the region. In the groundwater basins, the streamflow response to changes in snowpack is smoothed and delayed and the effects are extended longer in the summer. Our results indicate that absolute decreases in July-September base flows are significantly greater, by an order of magnitude, in groundwater basins compared to surface-dominated basins. The declines are important because groundwater basins sustain Upper Klamath Lake inflows and mainstem river flows during the typically dry summers of the area. Upper Klamath Lake April-September net inflows have decreased an estimated 16% or 84 thousand acre-feet (103.6 Mm(3)) since 1961, with the summer months showing proportionately more decline. These changes will exacerbate water supply problems for agriculture and natural resources in the region.																			1093-474X	1752-1688				AUG	2011	47	4					724	738		10.1111/j.1752-1688.2011.00537.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2011.00537.x													WOS:000293092200007

This later (D. orghidani) was harvested for the first time in Algeria. Some physicochemical parameters such as the temperature of surface water, pH, dissolved oxygen, salinity, conductivity, and nutrients were also evaluated. The distribution of the abundance of both species in the lake is not even and varies from season to season, it depends mainly on the environmental factors, and the originality of its composition depends on water quality. The abundance of D. orghidani presented higher values mainly in the summer (71% in the cladoceran community) and lower in late autumn. On the contrary, the abundance of D. orghidani increased in autumn.

J	BATES, GT; HOSTETLER, SW; GIORGI, F				BATES, GT; HOSTETLER, SW; GIORGI, F			2-YEAR SIMULATION OF THE GREAT-LAKES REGION WITH A COUPLED MODELING SYSTEM	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												In this paper, we report on an experiment aimed at evaluating the feasibility of the application of our coupled regional climate modeling system to long-term climate simulations over the Great Lakes region. The simulation analyzed covers a continuous 24-month period beginning 1 September 1990 and extending to 1 September 1992. Many aspects of this simulation agreed well with observations. Compared with European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) analyses, area-averaged atmospheric temperature and moisture biases were generally small. The largest temperature biases were found in the simulated boundary layer, up to 1-1.5 K colder than observed in most months. Atmospheric moisture biases were of both signs and small in magnitude, almost universally less than 0.5 g kg(-1). Comparison of simulated surface air temperatures with station observations also indicated that model simulated temperatures generally display a cold bias. Simulated precipitation values agreed well with observations during the cold portions of the year while during warm month precipitation was overpredicted by 10%-50%. Spatial patterns of precipitation over the model domain agreed well with observations during the winter months but were not as well simulated during the other seasons. A one-dimensional lake model was coupled to the atmospheric component of the model to capture the effects of the Great Lakes on regional climate. Lake surface temperatures were generally well simulated by the lake model in the summer and fall seasons, and lake ice extent agreed well with the analysis over at least three of the five lakes. The greatest shortcomings in lake temperature simulation were the earlier-than-observed warm-up in the spring and warmer than observed peak temperatures in the summer over the northern portions of the lakes. Also, lake ice extent was generally overpredicted over Lake Superior and underpredicted over Lake Erie. In summary, the coupled modeling system described in this paper shows promise for use in climate simulations over regions where lakes are important such as the Great Lakes. It has been shown that many aspects of the simulation are in good agreement with available observations. Areas in which the results point to the need for further work are the model's convective parameterization, the eddy diffusivities in the lake model, and the treatment of clouds in the radiation package.

Microplastics in the Water of Transboundary Lake Khanka and Rivers of Its Basin	GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES												A novel assessment of the content of microplastics in the surface waters of Lake Khanka and its tributaries is performed. Collection, preparation, and analysis of samples were carried out in 2021-2022. Five geographical sites were selected (the source of the Sungacha River, the mouth of the Spasovka River, the Vostochnyi cordon, the Ilistaya River, and the Komissarovka River) as areas most susceptible to pollution. Scanning spectrophotometry with an AIM-9000 SHIMADZU IR microscope detected the presence of microplastic particles (MPs) in all the water samples. The microplastics are predominantly of mixed and synthetic nature; the concentration varies depending on the season, amounting to 6-27 units/m3 in the spring-summer and 5-24 units/m3 in the autumn-winter sampling period. The detected microplastics are of mostly secondary origin and are overwhelmingly identified as fibers. Spectral analysis of the particles show that polyester and organic fibers are the most common types of microplastics. An increased concentration of microplastics is observed at the mouths of the Spasovka and Komissarovka rivers; in the area of the Vostochnyi cordon, which is located in the eastern coastal region of the lake on the territory of the Khanka Nature Reserve; and at the source of the Sungacha, the drainage river of Lake Khanka. It is concluded that the likely sources of microplastic pollution in Lake Khanka and rivers of its basin are runoff from wastewater treatment plants carried in by river flow, runoff from agricultural land, and precipitation and/or untreated wastewater. A comparative analysis of the surface waters of Lake Khanka, the Hai River (China), the Songhua River (China), and rivers of Japan and South Korea is performed. In all the considered water bodies, the predominant type of microplastics is fibers of synthetic origin. The average concentration of microplastics in Lake Khanka is found to be noticeably lower than in the other water bodies, with only that in the Hai River lower.

Temperature and oxygen conditions in the western, central and eastern (connected to Lake Dobskie) parts of the Pilwa Bay were studied by analyzing the vertical distribution of temperature and dissolved oxygen concentrations in the winter and summer seasons of three consecutive years (2005-2007). Measurements were performed using the WTW OxiTop OC 100 system with automatic temperature compensation. During winter stagnation, the highest dissolved oxygen content was noted in the top water layer under ice cover, and oxygen concentrations varied widely between years. An analysis of temperature and oxygen profiles revealed an insignificant temperature difference of approximately 1-2 degrees C between the surface and bottom layers of water, which indicates that the studied bay was not characterized by a summer stratification pattern typical of deep water bodies.

Increasingly, urbanization and climate-driven hydrological alterations are affecting the availability and quality of aquatic habitats in salmon catchments. Thus, conservation of freshwater habitat integrity has emerged as an important challenge in supporting salmon life-history diversity as a buffer against continuing ecosystem changes. To inform catchment management for salmon, information on the distribution and movement dynamics of juvenile fish throughout the annual seasonal cycle is needed. A number of studies have assessed the ecology of juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) during summer and autumn seasons; catchment use by this species throughout the annual cycle is less well characterized, particularly in high-latitude systems. Here, n = 3,792 tagged juvenile coho salmon were tracked throughout two complete annual cycles to assess basin-wide distribution and movement behaviour of this species in a subarctic, ice-bearing catchment. Juvenile coho salmon in the Big Lake basin, Alaska, exhibited multiple habitat use and movement strategies across seasons; however, summer rearing in lotic mainstem environments followed by migration to lentic overwinter habitats was identified as a prominent behaviour, with two-thirds of tracked fish migrating en masse to concentrate in a small subset of upper catchment lakes for the winter. In contrast, the most significant tributary overwintering site (8% of tracked fish) occurred below a culvert and dam, blocking juvenile fish passage to a headwater lake, indicating that these fish may have been restricted from reaching preferred lentic overwinter habitats. These findings emphasize the importance of maintaining aquatic connectivity to lentic habitats as a conservation priority for coho salmon during freshwater residency.

J	Meng, HB; Zhang, J; Zheng, Z; Lai, YQ; Geng, HR				Meng, Haobin; Zhang, Jing; Zheng, Zhen; Lai, Yuequn; Geng, Haoran			Risk assessment and spatio-temporal characteristics analysis of water bloom in three large-scale eutrophic reservoirs in Fujian Province, China	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The occurrence of water blooms in reservoirs poses a serious threat to water safety, so the assessment of water bloom risk is crucial. In this study, we constructed a reservoir water bloom risk index (RWBRI) using the trophic state index (TSI), floating algae index (FAI), temperature, precipitation, and wind speed datasets, and estimated and validated the water bloom risk levels of three large-scale eutrophication reservoirs in Fujian Province, China, from 2019 to 2023 based on the Sentinel-2 MSI dataset at the pixel scale. The results showed that there is no positive correlation between the TSI and FAI parameters of the three reservoirs (the significance test coefficients for Shanzai Reservoir, Dongzhen Reservoir, and Shanmei Reservoir were -0.455**, -0.371**, and -0.049, respectively, and ** indicates that the reservoir passed the statistical significance test at the 0.01 significance level). The TSI of Shanmei Reservoir was less fluctuating and more stable than that of Shanzai Reservoir and Dongzhen Reservoir, but the average value of FAI was higher. The average value of water bloom risk in Shanzai Reservoir and Dongzhen Reservoirs is higher than Shanmei Reservoir (0.47, 0.46, and 0.41, respectively), but the trend of annual average changes indicates that the overall risk of Dongzhen Reservoir is decreasing, while the risk of Shanzai Reservoir and Shanmei Reservoir is increasing. Due to the influence of weather, the water bloom risk in spring and summer is higher than that in fall and winter in the three reservoirs, and the highest risk value usually occurs in summer. The high values in Shanzai Reservoir were mainly distributed in the two inlet channels in the northern and southwestern parts of the reservoir, the bank risk was higher than in the other areas of Dongzhen Reservoir, and the high value of the risk in Shanmei Reservoir was mainly distributed in the center of the reservoir. The RWBRI method can be used for water bloom risk identification in reservoirs with eutrophication trends by comparing it with four-hourly and monthly water quality level data.					; Lai, Yuequn/IAQ-8165-2023	zhang, jing/0000-0002-9610-5821; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				JAN	2024	158								111539	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.111539	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.111539		JAN 2024											WOS:001161865400001

Effect of Season on Fatty Acid Composition and n-3/n-6 Ratios of Zander and Carp Muscle Lipids in Altinapa Dam Lake	JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE												In this study, seasonal variations on total fatty acid composition of carp, Cyprinus carpio, and zander, Sander lucioperca, muscle lipids in Altinapa Dam Lake were determined. Fish samples in 2 seasons (summer and winter) were obtained from Altinapa Dam Lake in Konya, Turkey. Polyunsaturated fatty acids were found to be higher during the cold season than in the hot both in zander and carp. Whereas the Docosahexaenoic acid was high in zander both in summer and winter, in carp it was high only during wintertime. Zander contained more n-3 fatty acids during the cold season compared to carp. Especially, the n-3:n-6 ratios in zander were 3.89 and 3.84 in summer and winter, respectively. In conclusion, seasonal variations affected fatty acid composition of zander and carp in Altinapa Dam Lake. Practical Application Fish oil is very important for human health because it contains long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially n-3 PUFAs. No reports have been published about the effects of seasonal variations on the fatty acid composition of important species of carp and zander in Altinapa Dam Lake. In view of these facts, it is believed that carrying out a systematic work on lipid profile of carp and zander in this dam lake is necessary. Therefore, the aim of this work is to characterize and compare carp and zander muscle lipids in terms of their fatty acid in different seasons of the year. As a result, fatty acid compositions of 2 fish species muscle lipids have been identified. This is important for the consumers' health.					; Zengin, Gokhan/K-9393-2015; CAKMAK, Yavuz Selim/B-3785-2014	Citil, Ozcan Baris/0000-0003-1999-5805; Zengin, Gokhan/0000-0001-6548-7823; CAKMAK, Yavuz Selim/0000-0001-8954-5485													0022-1147	1750-3841				MAY	2011	76	4					C594	C597		10.1111/j.1750-3841.2011.02136.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2011.02136.x								22417340					WOS:000290270600035

As climate warming effects on smaller zooplankton are less understood than larger zooplankton, we focused on rotifers to study their response to a future climate warming scenario in outdoor mesocosms. Our year-long experiment (14 July 2020 to 13 July 2021) included present temperature conditions as controls and a treatment simulating a future warmer climate involving occasional heatwaves. Total rotifer abundance increased with warming, with Keratella spp. and Polyarthra spp. benefiting the most, while the Kellicottia spp. population collapsed. Filinia spp. were negatively affected by warming in the summer of 2020, but increased during winter and the following summer. Our findings suggest that thermophilic or eurytherm rotifers such as Keratella and Polyarthra may increase in a warmer future, while heat-sensitive Kellicottia may be negatively affected in the temperate region. Milder winters may allow some rotifer genera to proliferate while allowing others to recover from high summer temperatures, thereby considerably changing the composition and dominance patterns of rotifer assemblages.					; Salis, Romana/J-4374-2019; Hansson, Lars-Anders/HCI-2735-2022; Devkota, Nischal/NQF-4096-2025	Salis, Romana/0000-0001-7724-4984; Devkota, Nischal/0000-0003-0473-0513; Hansson, Lars-Anders/0000-0002-3035-1317													0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2025	852	4					971	985		10.1007/s10750-024-05744-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-024-05744-7		NOV 2024											WOS:001358169300001

Variation at 14 microsatellites was analyzed for 10,500 juvenile Sockeye Salmon obtained from surveys conducted during 1996-2011. Using a 404-population baseline, we identified the sampled individuals to 47 populations or stocks of origin. Stock compositions of the mixtures increased in diversity in more northerly sampling locations, indicating a general northward movement of juveniles. The primary migration route of Columbia River and Washington stocks was northward along the west coast of Vancouver Island, with a majority of the juveniles subsequently migrating through Queen Charlotte Sound and Dixon Entrance. Fraser River stocks migrated principally through the Strait of Georgia and Johnstone Strait. Some Fraser River populations, such as the Cultus Lake population, appeared to spend little time rearing in the Strait of Georgia, as individuals from this population were primarily observed in July samples from Hecate Strait, Dixon Entrance, and Southeast Alaska. Other Fraser River populations, such as the Chilko Lake and Quesnel Lake populations, were widely distributed during July surveys, as they were observed from the Gulf of Alaska to the Strait of Georgia. For the British Columbia central coast and Owikeno Lake stocks, not all individuals migrated northward in the summer: some individuals were still present in local areas during the fall and winter after spring entry into the marine environment. Juvenile Fraser River Sockeye Salmon dominated the catch of juveniles at the Yakutat, Prince William Sound, Kodiak Island, and Alaska Peninsula sampling locations. There was a wide divergence among stocks in dispersion among sampling locations.

Aha Reservoir has been contaminated by Hg due to small scale coal mining activities. Mercury concentrations in both water and sediment were elevated. A clearly seasonal variation of dissolved Hg (DHg), particulate Hg (PHg) and total Hg (THg) concentrations in the water column was observed. The concentrations of these Hg species in the wet season were significantly higher than in the dry season. Runoff input and diffusion of Hg from sediments could be the reasons for elevated concentrations of these Hg species in the wet season. The contaminated sediment is acting as a secondary contamination source for both inorganic Hg (IHg) and methylmercury (MeHg) to the overlying water. The cycling of Mn in the sediment governs the diffusion process of Dig to the water column. In the dry season (winter and spring). Mn occurs as MnO2 because the uppermost part of sediment is in an oxic condition and Hg ions are absorbed by MnO2. In the wet season (summer and fall), the uppermost part of the sediment profile is in a reduced condition because of stratification of the water column and MnO2 is reduced to Mn2+, which results in transformation of Hg2+ into porewater as Mn2+ became soluble. This causes a higher diffusive Lux of IHg from sediment to overlying water in the wet season. Both sampling stations showed a consistent trend that THg concentrations decreased in the uppermost part of sediment cores. This demonstrated that the measures taken to reduce ADM contamination to Aha Reservoir also reduced Hg input to the reservoir. Methyl Hg diffusive fluxes from sediment to overlying water were higher in the wet season than the dry season demonstrating that high temperatures favor Hg methylation processes in sediment.

Geothermal activity and hydrothermal mineral deposits at southern Lake Bogoria, Kenya Rift Valley: Impact of lake level changes	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												Lake Bogoria, a saline alkaline closed-lake in a drainage basin of Neogene volcanic rocks in the central Kenya Rift, is fed partly by 200 hot alkaline springs located in three groups along its margins. Hot springs along the midwest shoreline (Loburu, Chemurkeu) and their travertine deposits have been studied, but little is known about the geothermal activity at southern Lake Bogoria. Observations, field measurements and analyses (geochemical and mineralogical) of the spring waters and deposits, spanning three decades, show that the southern spring waters are more saline, the hydrothermal alteration there is more intense, and that most hot spring deposits are siliceous. Geothermal activity at southern Lake Bogoria (Ng'wasis, Koibobei, Losaramat) includes littoral boiling springs and geysers, with fumaroles at slightly higher elevations. Modern spring deposits are ephemeral sodium carbonates, opal-A crusts and silica gels. Local fossil spring deposits include diatomaceous silica cemented conglomerates that formed subaqueously when the lake was then dilute and higher than today, and outlying calcite tufa deposits. In contrast, mineral deposits around neighbouring fumarole vents and sites of hydrothermal alteration include clays (kaolinite), sulfate minerals (jarosite, alunite), and Fe-oxyhydroxides linked to rising acidic fluids. When lake level falls, the zone of acidity moves downwards and may overprint older alkaline spring deposits. In contrast, rising lake level leads to lake water dilution and vents in the lower parts of the acidic zone may become dilute alkaline springs. The new evidence at Lake Bogoria shows the potential for using the mineralogy of geothermal sediments to indicate former changes in lake level. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Blooms of FGA influenced the energy balance, chemical cycling, physical features, and biological conditions in the littoral zone. Photosynthetic capacity of the FGA, dominated by Zygogonium, was greater than that of acidified epilithon, the normally dominant littoral algal association, partially offsetting acidification-induced oligotrophication in the littoral zone. Intra- and inter-annual variability of FGA growth was large, however, so that FGA were an unreliable energy source for the littoral food web. Nutrient uptake varied with the degree of FGA growth; e.g., FGA were occasionally the largest phosphorus pool in the epilimnion. Nitrogen dynamics of FGA varied seasonally causing acidification in spring and summer, and alkalinization in fall. The blooms also affected epilimnetic cycling of dissolved inorganic carbon. Peak blooms prevented as much as 90% of the light from reaching the lake bottom. Local depletions of oxygen resulting from FGA decomposition also posed potential risks for animals using the FGA as habitat.																			0706-652X					OCT	1995	52	10					2264	2275		10.1139/f95-817	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f95-817													WOS:A1995TQ59400019

Influence of Sex and Reproductive Status on Seasonal Movement of Lake Sturgeon in Namakan Reservoir, Minnesota-Ontario	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We evaluated the influence of sex and reproductive condition on seasonal distribution and movement patterns of Lake Sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens in Namakan Reservoir, Minnesota-Ontario. Blood samples were collected from 133 Lake Sturgeon prior to spawning and plasma concentrations of testosterone and estradiol-17 ss were analyzed using radioimmunoassay. Steroid concentrations were used to determine sex and the reproductive stage of each sturgeon. A subset of 60 adults were implanted with acoustic transmitters prior to spawning in 2007 and 2008. Movement was monitored using an array of 15 stationary receivers covering U.S. and Canadian waters of Namakan Reservoir and its tributaries. Of the monitored sturgeon, there was no significant difference in the minimum distance traveled between sexes or among seasons. Site residency did not differ between sexes but differed significantly among seasons, and Lake Sturgeon of both sexes had higher residency during winter (mean = 24 d). Five females implanted with transmitters were characterized as presumed reproductive and 14 as nonreproductive based on plasma steroid concentrations. In general, movement patterns (i.e., migration) of presumed reproductive females corresponded positively with availability of spawning habitat in tributaries. Moreover, presumed reproductive females traveled greater distances than nonreproductive females, particularly during prespawn, spawning, and fall time periods. Distance traveled by presumed reproductive females was highest in the fall compared with other seasons and may be linked to increased energy requirements during late oogenesis before spawning in spring. Combining movement data with information on Lake Sturgeon reproductive status and habitat suitability provided a robust approach for understanding their seasonal migration patterns and identifying spawning locations.

J	Dominik, K; Höfle, MG				Dominik, K; Höfle, MG			Changes in bacterioplankton community structure and activity with depth in a eutrophic lake as revealed by 5S rRNA analysis	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The community structure of bacterioplankton was studied at different depths (0 to 25 m) of a temperate eutrophic lake (Lake Plusssee in northern Germany) by using comparative 5S rRNA analysis. The relative amounts of taxonomic groups were estimated from 5S rRNA bands separated by high-resolution electrophoresis. Comparison of partial 5S rRNA sequences enabled detection of changes in single taxa over space and during seasons. Overall, the bacterioplankton community was dominated by 3 to 14 abundant (>4% of the total 5S rRNA) taxa. In general, the number of 5S rRNA bands (i.e., the number of bacterial taxa) decreased with depth. In the fall, when thermal stratification and chemical stratification were much more pronounced than they were in the spring, the correlation between the depth layers and the community structure was more pronounced. Therefore, in the fall each layer had its own community structure; i.e., there were different community structures in the epilimnion, the metalimnion, and the hypolimnion. Only three 5S rRNA bands were detected in the hypolimnion during the fall, and one band accounted for about 70% of the total 5S rRNA. The sequences of individual 5S rRNA bands from the spring and fall were different for all size classes analyzed except two bands, one of which was identified as Comamonas acidivorans. In the overall analysis of the depth profiles, the diversity in the epilimnion contrasted with the reduced diversity of the bacterioplankton communities in the hypolimnion, and large differences occurred in the composition of the epilimnion at different seasons except for generalists like C acidivorans.																			0099-2240					JUL	2002	68	7					3606	3613		10.1128/AEM.68.7.3606-3613.2002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.68.7.3606-3613.2002								12089049					WOS:000176631600057
J	de Waele, J				de Waele, Jo			Interaction between a dam site and karst springs: The case of Supramonte (Central-East Sardinia, Italy)	ENGINEERING GEOLOGY					1st General Meeting of the European-Geosciences-UnionSymposium on Natural Anthropogenic Hazards in Karst Areas	APR 25-30, 2004APR 07, 2006	Nice, FRANCEVienna, AUSTRIA	European Geosci Union				Sardinia is one of the Italian regions with the greatest number of dams per inhabitants, almost 60 for a population of only 1.5 million people. Many of these dam sites are located on non-carbonate rocks along the main rivers of the Island and their waters are used for irrigation, industrial, energy supply, drinking and flood regulation purposes. The Pedra a Othoni dam on the Cedrino river (Dorgali, Central-East Sardinia) is located along the threshold of the Palaeozoic basement on the Northern border of the Supramonte karst area, where water is forced to flow out of the system through several resurgences, the most famous of which is the Su Gologone vauclusian spring, used for drinking water supply. The other main outflows of the system, Sri Tippari and San Pantaleo springs, are at present almost permanently submerged by the high water level of the Pedra 'e Othoni dam. In the near future water will be supplied also to other communities with a possible increase of water taken from the spring. The dam, originally meant to regulate the flooding of Cedrino river but actually used for all sorts of purposes (electricity supply, drinking water, irrigation of farmlands, industrial uses), has a maximum regulation altitude of 103 m a.s.l., only slightly less than a meter below the Su Gologone spring level (103.7 m), and 4 and 9 m respectively above the submerged Su Tippari and San Pantaleo springs. During floods of the Cedrino river, occurring on average twice a year, also the Su Gologone spring becomes submerged by the muddy waters of the lake for a time ranging between a couple of hours up to several days, making water supply impossible. The analysis of the available meteorological and hydrogeological data relative to the December 2004 flood, one of the severest of the past 100 years, suggests that the reservoir is filled in a few days time. Several flooding scenarios have been reconstructed using digital terrain models, showing that backflooding submerges most of the discharge area of the aquifer, having important repercussions also on the inland underground drainage system. The upstream flood prone areas prevalently comprise agricultural lands with some sparse houses, but also highly frequented tourist facilities. Fortunately flooding occurs outside the tourist season, thus limiting risk to a limited number of local inhabitants. Massive discharge at the dam site, instead, determines a more hazardous situation in the Cedrino coastal plain, where population density in low lying areas is much higher. To avoid flooding hazard upstream the water level in the lake should be regulated, keeping it low in the flood prone seasons, and having it filled from the end of the winter in order to have enough water stocked before the beginning of the summer. Discharge at the dam site, instead, should be done cautiously, preventing severe flooding of the coastal Cedrino plain. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Hydro-climatic and ecological behaviour of the drought of Amazonia in 2005	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												In 2005, southwestern Amazonia experienced the effects of an intense drought that affected life and biodiversity. Several major tributaries as well as parts of the main river itself contained only a fraction of their normal volumes of water, and lakes were drying up. The consequences for local people, animals and the forest itself are impossible to estimate now, but they are likely to be serious. The analyses indicate that the drought was manifested as weak peak river season during autumn to winter as a consequence of a weak summertime season in southwestern Amazonia; the winter season was also accompanied by rainfall that sometimes reached 25% of the climatic value, being anomalously warm and dry and helping in the propagation of fires. Analyses of climatic and hydrological records in Amazonia suggest a broad consensus that the 2005 drought was linked not to El Nino as with most previous droughts in the Amazon, but to warming sea surface temperatures in the tropical North Atlantic Ocean.					; Tomasella, Javier/I-8073-2012; Marengo, Jose/J-9382-2012	Cardoso, Manoel/0000-0003-2447-6882; Tomasella, Javier/0000-0003-2597-8833; 													0962-8436	1471-2970				MAY 27	2008	363	1498					1773	1778		10.1098/rstb.2007.0015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2007.0015								18270160					WOS:000254577500008

A decadal-resolution record of total organic carbon (TOC) and grainsize retrieved from a composite piston core from Kusai Lake, NW China, provides solid evidence for decadal- to centennial-scale Asian monsoon variability for the Northern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau during the last 3770 yr. Intensified winter and summer monsoons are well correlated with respective reductions and increases in solar irradiance. A number of intensified Asian winter monsoon phases are potentially correlated with North Atlantic climatic variations including Bond events 0 to 2 and more recent subtle climate changes from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age. Our findings indicate that Asian monsoon changes during the late Holocene are forced by changes in both solar output and oceanic-atmospheric circulation patterns. Our results demonstrate that these forcing mechanisms operate not only in low latitudes but also in mid-latitude regions (the Northern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau). (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The depletion is caused by the transport of O2 demanding species, particularly H2S, from the hypolimnion into the epilimnion. Hydrogen sulfide accumulates progressively through the summer, mostly via42- reduction, to unusually high concentrations; a maximum of 1.65 mM has been observed. These conditions are apparently manifestations of hypereutrophy, and thus may be subject to remediation through P management efforts.

Warmer Winters Increase the Biomass of Phytoplankton in a Large Floodplain River	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Winters are changing rapidly across the globe but the implications for aquatic productivity and food webs are not well understood. In addition, the degree to which winter dynamics in aquatic systems respond to large-scale climate versus ecosystem-level factors is unclear but important for understanding and managing potential changes. We used a unique winter data set from the Upper Mississippi River System to explore spatial and temporal patterns in phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a, CHL) and associated environmental covariates across 25 years and similar to 1,500 river km. To assess the role of regional climate versus site-specific drivers of winter CHL, we evaluated whether there were coherent long-term CHL dynamics from north to south and across lotic-lentic areas. We then estimated the degree to which these patterns were associated with climate variability (i.e., the Multivariate El Nino-Southern Oscillation Index), winter severity (freezing degree days), river discharge, or site-specific environmental variables (ice depth, snow depth, and nutrient concentrations). We found that winter CHL was typically highest in ice-free reaches and backwater lakes, occasionally exceeding summer values. We did not find highly synchronous CHL dynamics across the basin, but instead show that temporal trends were independent among river reaches and lotic-lentic areas of the river. Moreover, after accounting for these spatial dynamics, we found that CHL was most responsive to winter air temperature, being consistently higher in years with warmer winters across the basin. These results indicate that although productivity dynamics are highly dynamic within large river ecosystems, changes in the duration and severity of winter may uniformly increase wintertime productivity.					; Scheuerell, Mark/N-6683-2016	Smits, Adrianne/0000-0001-9967-5419; Jankowski, Kathi Jo/0000-0002-3292-4182; Houser, Jeffrey/0000-0003-3295-3132; Scheuerell, Mark/0000-0002-8284-1254													2169-8953	2169-8961				SEP	2021	126	9							e2020JG006135	10.1029/2020JG006135	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JG006135													WOS:000703067000015

Crustacean zooplankton	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Open water zooplankton communities were sampled across all five Laurentian Great Lakes during spring and summer 1998. Spring communities were characterized by relatively low species; Crustacean communities in all lakes except Lake Ontario were dominated by numbers and densities. diaptomid copepods in spring. During summer both abundance and species richness increased, the latter owing largely to the appearance of populations of cladocerans. Crustacean communities in the upper lakes were dominated by diaptomid copepods, cyclopoid copepodites, and Daphnia galeata mendotae (codominant with Holopedium gibberum in Lake Superior), and showed a high degree of spatial homogeneity. Lake Erie supported a notably more species rich community, and also exhibited a high degree of spatial heterogeneity. Lake Ontario differed from the other lakes by its relative lack of calanoid copepods, being dominated instead by cyclopoid copepods, along with Bosmina and Daphnia. There was a clear distinction between community composition in the western and eastern portions of the lake, though the reasons for this are unclear.																			0380-1330						2001	27	2					167	184		10.1016/S0380-1330(01)70630-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(01)70630-2													WOS:000169535900005
J	Schultz, TD				Schultz, Tom D.			Diversity and Habitats of a Prairie Assemblage of Odonata at Lostwood National Wildlife Refuge, North Dakota	JOURNAL OF THE KANSAS ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY												An inventory of the dragonflies and damselflies (Insecta: Odonata) at the Lostwood National Wildlife Refuge (LNWR) was conducted during the summer of 2003. Adult censuses and larval sampling at 32 wetland sites produced 10 dragonfly and 14 damselfly species that were resident in the refuge. In 2006, two additional species were added. The odonate fauna of LWNR consisted primarily of widespread, common species that are adapted to fishless lentic communities and tolerant of alkaline and impermanent water regimes. Enallagma annexum (Hagen), Enallagma boreale Selys, Lestes disjunctus Selys, Lestes congener Hagen, Sympetrum costiferum (Hagen), and Sympetrum internum Montgomery were the most abundant odonates at the refuge. The odonate communities of semipermanent, oligosaline ponds were the most diverse and included species of Aeshna, Anax, Libellula, Leucorrhinia, Sympetrum, Lestes, Coenagrion, Enallagma, Ischnura, and Nehalennia. Large polysaline lakes were inhabited only by Ischnura damula Calvert and four species of Enallagma. Seasonal ponds that remained flooded until mid-July produced large numbers of Sympetrum internum, Lestes disjunctus, and Lestes unguiculatus. Spring-fed bogs and fens supported several species that were rare at the refuge including Sympetrum danae (Sulzer), Sympetrum semicinctum Say, and Amphiagrion abbreviatum (Selys). Long-term monitoring of odonate diversity and abundance may be useful in tracking the effects of climate change in the prairie pothole region but must take into account yearly fluctuations due to variation in winter and summer precipitation.																			0022-8567					JAN	2009	82	1					91	102		10.2317/JKES803.24.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2317/JKES803.24.1													WOS:000265226600008

Impacts of Adfluvial Fish on the Ecology of Two Great Lakes Tributaries	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Anadromous and adfluvial fish can transport high concentrations of nutrients and energy into streams during spawning runs. While the ecological effects of their spawning migrations are variable, in some instances these fish contribute to increased nutrient concentrations, primary productivity, invertebrate biomass, and resident fish growth and survival in the nutrient-poor streams of the Pacific Northwest. In tributaries of the Great Lakes, the effects of introduced salmonid and native adfluvial fish are poorly documented. We conducted field experiments to determine the effects of a semelparous fall fish, Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, and an iteroparous spring fish, steelhead O. mykiss, on the ecology and productivity of two tributaries to the Muskegon River, Michigan, a Lake Michigan tributary. We sampled stream biota and water chemistry before and after the introduction of Chinook salmon carcasses and eggs in the fall and steelhead eggs in the spring in a tributary stream with natural spawning runs and in another tributary stream without runs but with carcass and egg additions. There was no response in terms of invertebrate density or water chemistry to spawning migrations or salmon carcass introductions in either tributary. The density of resident brown trout Salmo trutta increased in both stream types after the introduction of salmon carcasses in the fall, and energy consumption increased after the addition of salmon eggs in the fall and spring in the manipulated stream. Based on stomach content analysis, fish that had eggs in their stomachs also consumed more energy than fish that did not consume eggs. The results suggest that adfluvial fish may affect some tributaries of the Great Lakes by providing high-energy food sources to resident stream fish, but the potential effect of this egg consumption on resident fish growth and survival requires more research.

The Holocene environmental history of a small coastal lake on the north-eastern Kamchatka Peninsula	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												A radiocarbon and tephra-dated sediment core from Lifebuoy Lake, located on the north-east coast of Kamchatka Peninsula, was analysed for pollen, spores, diatoms, chironomids and tephra in order to uncover regional environmental history. The 6500-year environmental history of Lifebuoy Lake correlates with the broad regional patterns of vegetation development and climate dynamics with both diatoms and chironomids showing near-synchronous changes. Between ca. 6300 and 3900 cal yr BP, the lake ecosystem was naturally enriched, with several Stephanodiscus species dominating the diatom plankton. This natural eutrophication state is likely to be due to a combination of the base-rich catchment geology, the fertilisation effect of several fires in the catchment, silica input from tephra layers and, possibly, nitrogen input from seabirds. The substantial tephra deposit at about 3850 cal yr BP might have stopped sedimentary phosphorus from entering the lake water thus decreasing the trophic state of the lake and facilitating the shift in diatom composition to a benthic Fragiliariaceae complex. Both diatoms and chironomids showed simultaneous compositional changes, which are also reflected by statistically significant changes in their rates of change 300-400 years after the arrival of Pinus pumila in the lake catchment. The rapid increase in both total diatom concentration and the percentage abundance of the large heavy species, Aulacoseira subarctica might be a response to the change in timing and intensity of lake spring turnover due to the changes in the patterns of North Pacific atmospheric circulation, most notably westward shift Of the Aleutian Low. The two highest peaks in A. subarctica abundance at Lifebouy Lake occurred during opposite summer temperature inferences: the earlier peak (3500-2900 cal yr BP) coincided with warm summers and the latter peak (300 cal yr BP-present) occurred during the cold summer period. These imply that A. subarctica shows no direct response to the changes of summer air temperature. Instead, it appears to thrive during the periods of increased winter precipitation, thicker ice and late spring turn-over periods, i.e., shows indirect response to climate. The clearest effect of tephra deposition on the lake ecosystem is above 908 cm (ca. 3800 cal yr BP) where the tephra deposit might have caused the shift from Stephanodiscus-dominated planktonic assemblages to the Fragilariaceae complex of benthic species. Tephra deposits might have also contributed towards the development of eutrophic plankton from about 6300 cal yr BP. It is not certain if several tephra deposits influenced diatom and chironomid changes during the last 300 years. (C) 2015 The Authors.

J	Rikardsen, AH; Amundsen, PA; Bodin, PJ				Rikardsen, AH; Amundsen, PA; Bodin, PJ			Growth and diet of anadromous Arctic charr after their return to freshwater	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												The post smolt of anadromous Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus ) from Lake Storvatn, northern Norway (70degrees39'48'), continued to feed and grow after their return to freshwater in late summer, but in late autumn (October) both their growth rate and feeding intensity ceased along with the drop in water temperature. In contrast, adult, sexually mature anadromous charr did not appear to feed during their freshwater residency. The stomach fullness of post smolts were similar to that of resident Arctic charr during early autumn, and their diets were similar, being dominated by pelagic prey such as surface insects, Holopedium sp., Bosmina sp. and chironomid pupae. Later in the autumn, the resident charr also included some more benthic prey, in particular gastropods, whereas the post smolts continued to feed predominantly on zooplankton and surface insects, but with a lower stomach fullness than the resident fish. This suggests that after arrival in freshwater, the post smolts continue their pelagic feeding behaviour displayed during the sea-migration.

J	Shi, W; Wang, MH				Shi, Wei; Wang, Menghua			Characterization of global ocean turbidity from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ocean color observations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Seasonal global ocean turbidity is studied and quantified using the diffuse attenuation coefficient at the wavelength of 490 nm, K-d(490), derived from measurements of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer onboard the Aqua satellite. The shortwave infrared-based atmospheric correction algorithm and a newly developed K-d(490) algorithm have been used to derive K-d(490) data for both the global open ocean and coastal turbid waters. The spatial pattern of global open ocean turbidity shows significant seasonal K-d(490) variations with highs in the boreal (or austral) spring and summer and lows in the winter for the Northern Hemisphere (or Southern Hemisphere). The clear water with K-d(490) <= 0.1 m(-1) covers an average of similar to 95.67% of the global ocean. The modestly turbid waters with K-d(490) values ranging from similar to 0.1 to 0.3 m(-1) has about 5.12% and 3.07% of the global ocean region in the summer and winter, respectively, with average coverage of similar to 3.59%. Turbid waters with K-d(490) over 0.3 m(-1) are all located in the coastal regions, river estuaries, and inland lakes with an average global coverage of similar to 0.74%, accounting for similar to 8% to 12% of the total global continental shelf area. The world's major turbid water regions are identified and evaluated in this study. Amazon River Estuary ranks as the world's most turbid region with the mean K-d(490) value of similar to 5 m(-1). In addition, different mechanisms for the water turbidity in the open oceans and coastal turbid waters are investigated. In the open ocean, variability in the seasonal turbidity is related to the seasonal variation of chlorophyll a concentration, i.e., the seasonal phytoplankton bloom dominates the global geographic perspective of the water turbidity (for waters with K-d(490) <= 0.3 m(-1)). In the coastal region, on the other hand, high turbidity (K-d(490) > 0.3 m(-1)) is attributed to the high loading of sediment concentration due to various physical processes, such as sediment resuspension, river runoff, etc.					Shi, Wei/F-5625-2010; Wang, Menghua/F-5631-2010	Wang, Menghua/0000-0001-7019-3125													2169-9275	2169-9291				NOV 23	2010	115								C11022	10.1029/2010JC006160	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2010JC006160													WOS:000284706100003

Evaluation of the response of phytoplankton communities to heavy metal stresses using multi-statistical approaches, Alexandria coast, Egypt	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												This is the first study to investigate the antioxidant response of the phytoplankton community to heavy metal stress in the open sea. The levels of Cu, Zn, Cd, Mn, Pb, and Fe were determined in the phytoplankton community and water in Abu Talat (AT), and El Dekhella Harbour (DH), Alexandria coast during spring 2018 and autumn 2019. Furthermore, the changes in phytoplankton abundance, the bioconcentration factor (BCF), the metal pollution index (MPI), and the pollution load index (PLI) were used to assess pollution status. The phytoplankton density in the DH stations was 17-42 folds higher than in the AT. The order of BCF during spring was Fe > Zn > Pb > Cu > Mn > Cd. However, Fe > Zn > Mn > Cu > Pb > Cd was found in both areas during the autumn. The BCF, MPI, and PLI of the phytoplankton community revealed that DH is more polluted than AT. The phenol, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity and total antioxidant activity of the phytoplankton communities achieved higher values in DH than in AT stations, in response to heavy metal stresses. Principal component analysis was performed to follow pollution sources, suggesting that station 3 in both seasons was a hot spot because of stagnant water. A correlation matrix indicated that phenol and DPPH interacted positively in both locations during the two seasons. Analysis of variances with replicate tests on heavy metals in phytoplankton revealed significant seasonal differences across the two areas at a significance level < 0.05.					; Ismail, Mona/ABD-2473-2020	Ismail, Mona M./0000-0001-7029-6802; 													1735-1472	1735-2630				DEC	2023	20	12					13595	13608		10.1007/s13762-023-04914-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-023-04914-9		MAY 2023											WOS:000982745900001
J	NURNBERG, GK				NURNBERG, GK			THE ANOXIC FACTOR, A QUANTITATIVE MEASURE OF ANOXIA AND FISH SPECIES RICHNESS IN CENTRAL ONTARIO LAKES	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The detrimental effect of oxygen depletion on fish is well known. Here a quantitative measure of anoxia is compared with the number of fish species in 52 south-central Ontario lakes. The anoxic factor (AF, days per year or per season) estimates the number of days that a sediment area equal to the lake surface area is overlain by anoxic water. It can be expressed separately as summer or winter AE Stepwise multiple-regression models were constructed with AF and common physical and chemical variables to predict fish species richness. Because some of the parametric regression assumptions were violated, the traditional statistics were evaluated with randomization tests to confirm significance. The best regression models included summer AF or lake surface area, or winter AF and mean depth, for subsets of acidic and circumneutral lakes; these models explained up to 75% of the variation in fish species richness. One of the models can be used to estimate the likelihood of winterkill. Anoxic factor was also correlated with the number of coldwater fish species present. The concept of AF can be used to model the distribution and number of fish species in stratified lakes and should be useful in the management of oxygen-dependent aquatic animals (e.g., finfish and shrimp) in freshwater and marine habitats.

J	Binner, M; Kloas, W; Hardewig, I				Binner, Maaike; Kloas, Werner; Hardewig, Iris			Energy allocation in juvenile roach and burbot under different temperature and feeding regimes	FISH PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY												Cold-active burbot (Lota lota (L.)) display reduced food intake during the summer. The impact of temperature on their energy budget was investigated in starved fish in a laboratory setting, simulating summer (20 degrees C) and winter (4 degrees C) conditions, to elucidate the impact of high temperature on burbot metabolism. Metabolic effects in burbot were compared to roach (Rutilus rutilus (L.)), which typically fast in winter. During warm acclimation, starvation (four weeks) resulted in a metabolic depression of oxygen consumption in both species. In roach, metabolic rate decreased by 55% after two weeks of starvation. Burbot, in contrast, displayed an immediate depression of metabolic rate by 50%. In both species, no reductions were observed in the cold. The temperature-induced differences between the metabolic rates at 20 degrees C and 4 degrees C showed a lower thermal sensitivity in burbot (Q(10) = 1.9) compared to roach (Q(10) = 2.7). Notably, for each species, energy consumption during starvation was highest under experimental conditions simulating their natural active periods, respectively. Warm acclimated roach relied mainly on muscle reserves, whereas in cold acclimated burbot, liver metabolic stores made a major contribution to the energy turnover. In cold acclimated roach and warm acclimated burbot, however, starvation apparently reduced swimming activity, resulting in considerable savings of energy reserves. These lower energy expenditures in roach and burbot corresponded to their natural inactive periods. Thus, starvation in burbot caused a lower energy turnover when exposed to high temperatures. These season-dependent adaptations of metabolism represent an advantageous strategy in burbot to manage winter temperature and withstand metabolism-activating summer temperatures, whereas roach metabolism correlates with the seasonal temperature cycle.																			0920-1742	1573-5168				JUN	2008	34	2					103	116		10.1007/s10695-007-9151-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10695-007-9151-8								18649028					WOS:000255192800001

Biogenic and Organic Substances	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF GENERAL CHEMISTRY												The article summarizes the results of long-term studies of the hydrochemical regime of some lakes of the Kiev city as an example of the urbanized area water bodies and its changes in summer. It is shown that the studied lakes are characterized by temperature and oxygen stratification, which continues from spring to autumn. In the surface water layer, its oversaturation with oxygen is observed, which indicates the intensive development of algae. In the bottom horizon, the concentration of dissolved oxygen approaches analytical zero. The difference in the water temperature values of the surface and bottom horizons often reaches 12-15 degrees C. The difference in the pH values of the water in these horizons can be about 2.5 units. In the bottom layer of the lakes, the dissolved oxygen deficiency and anaerobic conditions are formed, which contributes to the migration of biogenic and organic substances from their composition into the contacting water. The dominant form of inorganic nitrogen is ammonium nitrogen, the concentration of which in the bottom water reaches 8-12 mg N/L. Under such conditions, there is also a significant increase in the concentration of inorganic phosphorus up to 1.4-2.3 mg P/L. Ultimately, all this contributes to an increase in the trophic level of the water bodies with the ensuing negative consequences. The intensive development of phytoplankton affects the content of dissolved organic substances and their component composition. In summer, there is an increase in the share of organic substances-exometabolites. All these phenomena can be aggravated under the climate change conditions, taking place at present and expected in the future.

To improve the accuracy of the water quality index (WQI) model, multiple machine learning algorithms (CatBoost, SVM, LR, XGBoost, LightGBM) and entropy weight method (EWM) were introduced to determine the objective weight. Six combined weights were determined by game theory combining objective and subjective weights (AHP). Three aggregation functions were established, including a new function proposed based on the sigmoid function and two existing functions. Based on the six combined weights and three aggregation functions, eighteen WQI models were developed. To reduce the influence of spatiotemporal heterogeneity, the assessment models for the different water quality characteristics were proposed respectively. To validate the performance of improved model, the monthly water quality monitoring data of 16 sampling sites in Chaohu Lake during 2016-2020 was used. Among them, totally 10 water quality indicators were selected, including TN, TP, etc. The results showed high accuracy and reliability of the improved WQI assessment models. The model improved by CatBoost and EWM had low uncertainty (0.559-0.903) than SVM and LR (0.576-1.034). The sensitivity of the models improved by six combined weights is ranked as W-AE > W-AC > W-AS > W-AX > W-ALGB > W-AL. The uncertainty of the models improved by the three aggregation functions were ranked as SGM > SWM > WQM and the sensitivity were ranked as WQM > SWM > SGM. Compared with WQM and SWM, SGM could reflect the water quality spatiotemporal heterogeneity more accurately. The WQM(AE), SGM(AC) and SWMAC models were recommended for assessing water bodies with good quality, poor quality and heterogeneity respectively. Chaohu Lake was mainly Class II and Class III water. East had better water quality than the west. Water quality in summer and autumn was better than in spring and winter. This study can provide theoretical support for related water quality assessment work.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				MAR	2025	172								113299	10.1016/j.ecolind.2025.113299	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2025.113299		MAR 2025											WOS:001440628500001
J	Schlütz, F; Zech, W				Schlütz, F; Zech, W			Palynological investigations on vegetation and climate change in the Late Quaternary of Lake Rukche area, Gorkha Himal, Central Nepal	VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY												Palynological data and pedological investigations including stable isotopes and lignin biomarkers (Glaser et al. in press) from a 4 m core of Lake Rukche (3500 m a.s.l.) enhance our palaeoecological knowledge of the time since the LGM in the Gorkha Himal, Central Nepal. Even before 15000 B.P. forest types became established which prove the existence in Central Nepal of a temperate-humid climate with a considerable amount of winter and spring precipitation from westerly disturbances. Lignin input and pollen data point to a patchy vegetation cover around Lake Rukche with meadow-steppes dominated by Poaceae. Around 15000 B.P. Quercus and Pinus roxburghii dominated the lower altitudes while the vegetation around Lake Rukche was more steppe-like (Chenopodiaceae, Artemisia). Subsequently the climate became warmer and drier as winter and spring precipitation decreased while summer rain remained low. Later on more resource-demanding forests became established under improved temperature and precipitation conditions (Engelhardia). Around Lake Rukche coniferous forests (Abies, Picea) occurred beside meadow-steppes. The transition from the Pleistocene to the Holocene is not recorded. In the Holocene alpine Kobresia-meadows stabilised the soil surface causing sand accumulation to end. During the mid-Holocene (7800-2750 B.P.) humid oak forests with demanding elements (Ilex, Coriaria, Myrsine and Engelhardia) dominated the vegetation cover. A charcoal layer and a marked emergence of fire-induced communities with Pinus roxburghii, Poaceae, Ericaceae and Pteridium are proofs of a first strong anthropogenic change in vegetation which coincided with the climatic deterioration at the onset of the Subatlantic. Since 900 B.P. grazing pressure and the frequency of fires increased, resulting in a replacement of Betula utilis-forests by meadows and woods of Juniperus and Rhododendron. While previous anthropogenic influence increased the biodiversity by promoting replacement communities, recent developments have led to a decrease in biodiversity through loss of natural vegetation communities.

Indications of a changing winter through the lens of lake mixing in Earth's largest freshwater system	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Global surface freshwater primarily resides in lakes, with the overwhelming majority found in Earth's largest lakes, thus understanding potential climate change effects in these large lakes is critical. In dimictic lakes, climate change has extended the duration of summer thermal stratification and reduced the length of the ice season. These changes are relatively straightforward to evaluate in smaller, inland lakes. However, in large lakes, such as the North American Great Lakes, temporally intermittent and spatially heterogeneous ice cover, and spatial thermal heterogeneity limit the utility of simple ice on-off or mixing classifications; therefore, assessing how climate change is impacting winter conditions in large lakes is challenging. Here, we use in-situ and satellite-derived surface water temperature observations from the North American Great Lakes to overcome these limitations and show that warming air temperatures are driving reductions in the number of winter days, collectively those with either ice cover or inverse thermal stratification, in favor of increases in isothermal conditions for the period 1995-2023. We find that on average the Great Lakes are experiencing a loss of 14 winter days per decade. Our results demonstrate how climate change has yielded disproportionate changes in the annual thermal cycle and mixing conditions of Earth's largest freshwater system and signals the potential for fundamental ecosystem shifts due to a loss of winter.					; Anderson, Eric/JYO-8924-2024; Stow, Craig/AAG-8109-2020	Stow, Craig/0000-0001-6171-7855; Anderson, Eric/0000-0001-5342-8383													1748-9326					DEC 1	2024	19	12							124060	10.1088/1748-9326/ad8ee0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad8ee0													WOS:001360118900001
J	Klobucar, SL; Budy, P				Klobucar, Stephen L.; Budy, Phaedra			Consequences of seasonal variation in reservoir water level for predatory fishes: linking visual foraging and prey densities	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												In reservoirs, seasonal drawdown can alter the physical environment and may influence predatory fish performance. We investigated the performance of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) in a western reservoir by coupling field measurements with visual foraging and bioenergetic models at four distinct states (early summer, mid-summer, late summer, and fall). The models suggested that lake trout prey, juvenile kokanee (Oncorhynchus nerka), are limited seasonally by suitable temperature and dissolved oxygen. Accordingly, prey densities were greatest in late summer when reservoir volume was lowest and fish were concentrated by stratification. Prey encounter rates (up to 68 fish.day(-1)) and predator consumption are also predicted to be greatest during late summer. However, our models suggested that turbidity negatively correlates with prey detection and consumption across reservoir states. Under the most turbid conditions, lake trout did not meet physiological demands; however, during less turbid periods, predator consumption reached maximum bioenergetic efficiency. Overall, our findings demonstrate that rapid reservoir fluctuations and associated abiotic conditions can influence predator-prey interactions, and our models describe the potential impacts of water level fluctuation on valuable sport fishes.

To reveal the spatial characteristics of CH4 concentrations, diffusive fluxes and bubble fluxes during the ice-covered and ice-free periods in northern reservoirs, and in order to clarify the critical influences on their variations. We selected Dongfeng Reservoir, a large reservoir in Northeast China, and conducted six field investigations of CH4 concentrations and emissions in deep and shallow waters during the ice-covered (January 2022 and January 2023) and ice-free (July 2022, October 2022, March 2023, and September 2023) periods. The results showed that spatially, surface CH4 concentration and diffusive flux were significantly higher in shallow water than those in deep water. CH4 bubble flux had the largest range of variation in shallow water, while there was no obvious spatial difference in the proportion of CH4 in bubbles. Temporally, surface CH4 concentration, diffusive flux, bubble flux, and the proportion of CH4 in bubbles were generally high in summer and low in autumn. The surface CH4 concentration had the largest range of variation in winter, and the CH4 concentration under the ice was significantly higher in shallow water than those in deep water. Water depth determines the release of CH4 bubbles from sediments and is the basis for determining deep and shallow water based on bubbles. Ice cover leads to significant differences in CH4 production and transport compared with ice-free periods by indirectly changing the water environment and directly altering the CH4 release. CH4 accumulated under the ice and in the ice will greatly increase the CH4 release potential during the spring ice-melt period. Overall, this study improves the understanding of CH4 emissions from reservoirs characterized by ice-covered periods and provides theoretical basis for comprehensive estimation of CH4 emissions from reservoirs.																				2073-4441				FEB	2025	17	4							483	10.3390/w17040483	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w17040483													WOS:001429584000001
J	Woo, MK; Thorne, R				Woo, MK; Thorne, R			Streamflow in the Mackenzie Basin, Canada	ARCTIC												Rivers of the Mackenzie Basin exhibit several seasonal flow patterns that include the nival (snowmelt dominated), proglacial (influenced by glacier melt), wetland, prolacustrine (below large lakes), and regulated flow regimes. The Mackenzie amalgamates and moderates these regimes to deliver spring peak flows, followed by declining summer discharge and low winter flows, to the Arctic Ocean. The mountainous sub-basins in the west (Liard, Peace, and northern mountains) contribute about 60% of the Mackenzie flow, while the interior plains and eastern Canadian Shield contribute only about 25%, even though the two regions have similar total areas (each occupying about 40% of the total Mackenzie Basin). The mountain zone is the dominant flow contributor to the Mackenzie in both high-flow and low-flow years. A case study of the Great Slave system demonstrates the effects of natural runoff, regulated runoff, and lake storage on streamflow, as well as the large year-to-year variability of lake levels and discharge. Despite a warming trend in the past three decades, annual runoff of the Mackenzie Basin has not changed. Significant warming at most climatic stations in April (and at some, also in May or June) could have triggered earlier snowmelt. The first day of hydrograph rise for the main trunk of the Mackenzie (seen as a proxy for breakup) has advanced by about three days per decade, though the trend was not statistically significant for the mountain rivers. Peak flows do not reveal any trend, but the arrival of the spring peaks has become more variable. More evidence is needed to interpret these flow phenomena properly.																			0004-0843	1923-1245				DEC	2003	56	4					328	340		10.14430/arctic630	http://dx.doi.org/10.14430/arctic630													WOS:000188197700003

Allochthonous versus autochthonous carbon subsidies in small river food webs depend on seasonality and riparian tree species	AQUATIC SCIENCES												The river continuum concept (RCC), which proposes that terrestrial allochthonous inputs, namely, leaf litter, is the main source of organic carbon in trophic webs of forested headwater streams, was based on gut content analyses of benthic invertebrates. Modern methods, such as stable isotope analysis (SIA), fatty acid (FA) biomarker analysis, and elemental analysis (C:N stoichiometry), indicate autochthonous sources (periphytic microalgae) to be the main basal source of carbon in streams. However, these modern methods were applied in a comparatively limited number of cases. We hypothesize that: (1) proportions of incorporation of organic carbon of leaf litter by benthic consumers can be higher in spring than in autumn due to conditioning of the leaves during winter, and (2) carbon of leaf litter of certain tree species can be incorporated in river food webs to a higher degree than carbon of other tree species. Using SIA, FA, and C:N, allochthonous and autochthonous sources of organic matter and their quality in food webs of a small forest river in the Russian Far East were studied. It was found that some benthic animals obtained organic carbon mainly or exclusively from the allochthonous basal source, leaf litter. The other animals relied heavily or exclusively on the autochthonous basal source of organic carbon, periphytic microalgae, but some of them shifted to the conditioned leaf litter as the principal basal source in spring. Leaves of one of the tree species, Manchurian alder, appeared to be significantly more valuable food for primary consumers than leaves of the other studied species. Thus, the RCC should not be rejected but rather specified in terms of the seasonality and species composition of riparian vegetation.

Here, both adults and subadults have a complete moult in contrast to the juveniles which replace all but the remiges. This compressed, intense moult is believed to be an adaptation for exploiting the superabundant food source (brine shrimp, Artemia sp.) that is available in summer and autumn. No other grebe species is known to have so impressive a moult migration. Compared with moult migrations of anatids, this migration is unusual in that members of both sexes and all age groups are involved, and large, hypersaline/alkaline lakes are used.																			0030-5693						1985	16	4					253	260		10.2307/3676688	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3676688													WOS:A1985AUX0300002

Influence of geomorphic setting on the metabolism of Lake Huron fringing wetlands	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We measured gross primary productivity (GPP) and respiration (R) seasonally in benthic, water column, and epiphytic microhabitats of Lake Huron fringing wetlands. Spring areal GPP ranged from 33 to 103 mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1), spring R ranged from 16 to 110 mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1), and the water column was the most important microhabitat for both GPP and R on average. Summer GPP ranged from 40 to 131 mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1), R ranged from 25 to 155 mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1), and the water column and benthic microhabitats were equally important for GPP and R. Fall GPP ranged from < 1 to 19 mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1), and R ranged from < 1 to 47 mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1), with the benthic and water column microhabitats being equally important. Net metabolism (the difference between GPP and R) was close to zero at most wetlands, but when macrophyte productivity was accounted for, most wetlands appeared autotrophic. Both GPP and R were highest in deep wetlands protected from hydrologic energy and declined with increasing wave exposure. With increasing exposure, wetlands were restricted to shallower water and benthic GPP and R increased relative to water column GPP and R. This pattern persisted to intermediate levels of exposure, beyond which benthic GPP and R declined as a result of physical disturbance to the sediment. Coastal wetlands are hotspots of productivity in Lake Huron and hydrologic energy is an important driver of total metabolism rates, as well as the distribution of GPP and R among microhabitats.

J	Wilson, N; Webster-Brown, J				Wilson, Nathaniel; Webster-Brown, Jenny			The fate of antimony in a major lowland river system, the Waikato River, New Zealand	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Antimony is an element that is becoming of increasing concern as an environmental contaminant. Geothermal systems are a source of Sb into some fresh waters of New Zealand's North Island. The purpose of this research was to determine the factors controlling the behaviour of geothermally-derived Sb in the large lowland Waikato River system. The Waikato River is New Zealand's longest and most utilised river. Antimony in the system exhibited mainly conservative behaviour, and seasonally variable dilution was found to be the most important control on Sb concentrations. The most significant potential removal process was identified as adsorption of Sb onto suspended particulate material (SPM). The adsorption of Sb onto the SPM is enhanced at low (<5) pH conditions, and in the anoxic base of stratified lakes. There was evidence that the adsorption of Sb is mainly onto Fe oxides in SPM, and changes with changing Fe concentrations. Therefore, Sb adsorption was higher in winter (when Fe concentrations in SPM were higher) than in summer. In Lake Ohakuri, which was stratified during the late summer/early autumn of 2007, there was also potential for removal of Sb as Sb2S3 in the presence of sulfide formed in the anoxic layer. The behaviour of Sb was conservative through the estuary at the mouth of the river. Antimony was compared to As. a metalloid often assumed to exhibit behaviour similar to Sb in aquatic environments. It was found that while the removal processes affecting Sb will also affect As, the inverse did not necessarily apply. Arsenic will adsorb more readily to SPM than Sb and, while there was evidence for bioaccumulation of As by freshwater macrophytes, there was no such evidence for Sb. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Among the expected changes, including the dynamics of phytoplankton, the growth of cyanobacteria is often cited. This study evaluated the individual and combined effects of increased temperature and nutrients on phytoplankton community structure in a large, oligo-mesotrophic subtropical shallow lake (Mangueira Lake, southern Brazil). The study was conducted in microcosms to simulate possible scenarios of climate change, alone and in combination with nutrient enrichment (N and P); water samples were collected in winter and summer. Phytoplankton total biomass, species richness and diversity did not vary significantly with manipulation of temperature alone, either in winter or in summer. Only cyanobacteria biomass increased significantly with an increase in temperature, in the winter experiments. In summer, phytoplankton total biomass, species richness, Bacillariophyceae and Cyanobacteria increased significantly with enrichment of N and P. The interaction between temperature increase and nutrient addition did not significantly affect phytoplankton attributes. Temperature increase alone was not sufficient to cause structural changes in the phytoplankton community. Instead, nutrient addition (N and P) proved to be the most significant influence on most phytoplankton attributes, even though turnover of bloom-forming cyanobacteria was not observed. Further studies on the resilience of aquatic ecosystems to climate changes may contribute to the conservation and management of these environments.

Assessment of health risks associated with heavy metal contamination in selected fish and crustacean species from Temsah Lake, Suez Canal	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Marine pollution caused by heavy metals has emerged as a significant environmental concern, garnering increased attention in recent years. The accumulation of heavy metals in the tissues of marine organisms poses substantial threats to both marine ecosystems and human populations that rely on seafood as a primary food source. Fish and crustaceans are effective biomonitors for assessing heavy metal contamination in aquatic environments. In this study, we determined the concentrations of several heavy metals, including cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), nickel (Ni), mercury (Hg), and tin (Sn), in four fish species (Mugil cephalus, Mugil capito, L. aurata, and Morone labrax) and five crustacean species (S. rivulatus, Cerastoderma glaucum, Paratapes undulatus, R. decussatus, Callinectes sapidus, and Metapenaeus Stebbingi) from Temsah Lake during both winter and summer seasons. To evaluate the potential ecological and health risks associated with consuming these fish and crustacean species, we calculated the metal pollution index (MPI), weekly intake (EWI), target hazard quotient (THQ), and carcinogenic risk (CR) values. The results revealed a noticeable increase in metal levels during the summer compared to winter in the studied samples. Moreover, the concentration of heavy metals in the muscles of the species generally exceeded those in the liver and gills. The MPI values indicated that Morone labrax exhibited the highest values during winter, while L. aurata showed the highest values during summer. Mugil cephalus demonstrated the lowest MPI values in both seasons. The EWI values for the studied metals were found to be lower than the corresponding tolerable weekly intake (TWI) values. Additionally, under average exposure conditions, the THQ and HI data were generally below one for most study species in the area. The calculated CR values for investigated metals in the studied species indicated acceptable carcinogenic risk levels. Therefore, this suggests that consuming studied species within Temsah lake does not present any potential health hazards for consumers.					; Hanafy, Said/GQZ-2899-2022	Hanafy, Said/0000-0002-6000-472X; Younis, Alaa M./0000-0002-8669-4191													2045-2322					AUG 12	2024	14	1							18706	10.1038/s41598-024-69561-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-69561-7								39134587					WOS:001290178500087

While there are studies available on the impact of physical processes (stratification and mixing) on the biogeochemistry of tropical reservoirs, not much information is available on the inter-annual variability in the low-oxygen conditions and production/accumulation of hydrogen sulphide (H2S) and methane (CH4) during summer. This paper presents time series data based on monthly in situ observations from a tropical reservoir Maharashtra) situated in the Western Ghats in India. Sampling was carried out for temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), H2S, and CH4 at a fixed location from March 2010 until June 2014. The reservoir experiences stable stratification during summer (March to June) with complete loss of oxygen and production of H2S (max. similar to 9 mu M) and CH4 (max. similar to 185 mu M) in the profundal zone. During the summer stratification, the hypolimnion acted as a pool of CH4 with integrated values ranging between 3502 and 41,632 mg m(-2). However, the intensity and duration of anoxia varied during different years, influencing H2S and CH4 production. Mixing in the reservoir was observed between July and September in association with the monsoonal runoff, which increased the DO concentrations in the sub-surface layers. Besides, complete mixing was observed between December and February due to winter convection. This, however, was found to play an important role, as weaker mixing in the preceding year was associated with severe oxygen loss in the profundal zone during the following summer with a production of H2S and CH4. In contrast, more robust mixing during winter led to moderate low-oxygen conditions with less production of these gases in the subsequent summer. Based on our observations and considering a large number of reservoirs in the tropics, we hypothesise that with the present trends of global warming and less cold winters, low-oxygen conditions in the profundal zone may become more severe in the future with positive feedback on H2S and CH4 production during summer.

This study integrates stable carbon isotope ratios (delta C-13(POC)), C/N elemental ratios, and Bayesian MixSIAR modeling to quantify seasonal shifts in POC source across 6 saline lakes in Turpan-Hami Basin, China. The results show that terrestrial C3 plant material predominantly contributes to POC in spring (5.5-30.2 % contribution), while soil organic matter (SOM) and sewage-derived inputs become more prominent in summer (up to 43 % and 22 %, respectively). Allochthonous sources account for 51-65 % of annual POC flux, with autochthonous algal contributions peaking in Huancaihu Lake during summer (27 % contribution). Salinity exhibited no significant correlation with POC characteristics, whereas C/N ratios demonstrate strong covariation with POC sources, serving as more reliable indicators. delta C-13(POC) values were significantly more negative in summer (-23.4 parts per thousand to -19.85 parts per thousand) compared to spring (-27.68 parts per thousand to -22.59 parts per thousand) (p < 0.05), reflecting the decrease in contribution from terrestrial C3 plants. These findings demonstrate that hydrological seasonality and anthropogenic activities outweigh salinity as primary controls on POC composition in arid saline lakes. The study provides critical insights for developing source-specific management strategies in fragile lake ecosystems under global change pressures, particularly for mitigating sewage inputs and anthropogenic soil erosion during peak tourism seasons and protecting watersheds during spring melt periods.																			0301-4797	1095-8630				NOV	2025	394								127540	10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.127540	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.127540								41056777					WOS:001592359500001

Its outward and return migrations both took about 7 1/2 weeks. Both routes were practically identical, with the bird covering a total distance of 19,400 km, including its movements in its winter quarters in Zambia. On average 166 km were covered per day during migration. Its wintering quarters, where the bird stayed from the end of October until the end of February, extended over an area of ca. 25,000 km(2). The autumn migration of all individuals within Africa followed a relatively narrow corridor between longitudes 31 degrees and 36 degrees E from Suez south to Lake Tanganyika from where the birds dispersed. The greatest migration speed was reached by a young bird on the stage from Turkey to the Sudan, flying an average of 289 km per day.																			0021-8375					OCT	1995	136	4					401	422		10.1007/BF01651588	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01651588													WOS:A1995TG22600003

Ensuring safe reuse of residential wastewater: reduction of microbes and genes using peat biofilter and batch chlorination in an on-site treatment system	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY												Aims: A batch chlorination system was optimized for on-site wastewater treatment and reuse system (OWRS) and its efficiency was evaluated for reducing viruses, protozoa, bacteria and antimicrobial resistance in cold and warm seasons. Methods and Results: The OWRS performance in reducing microbial contaminants was determined by assessing three different faecal indicators (Escherichia coli, F-specific coliphages and Clostridium perfringens for measuring the disinfection efficiency of bacteria, viruses and spore-formers and surrogate for protozoa, respectively) using culture-based methods. Quantitative PCR was used to quantify pathogenic bacteria (Shiga-toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), Campylobacter spp., and Arcobacter spp.), a human-associated faecal marker (gyrB), and tetracycline resistant bacteria (tetQ). The levels of E. coli, coliphages and Cl. perfringens showed 5.4, 2.3, 2.5 log reduction, respectively, upon disinfection. In the final effluents, coliphages (1.7 x 10(2) PFU 100 ml(-1)) and Cl. perfringens (3.4 CFU 100 ml(-1)) were detected in 80 and 100% of the samples, but E. coli was not found. The removal and inactivation of E. coli and Cl. perfringens were not significantly different across the seasons, however, efficacy of removal and inactivation of F-specific coliphage was significantly reduced during the winter/spring season compared to the summer/autumn season (P = 0.009). The reduction of Arcobacter, gyrB and tetQ by 3.1, 2.3 and 2.3 log, respectively, was mostly due to peat biofiltration under the study conditions. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that peat biofiltration was the most important step of the OWRS to remove microbes and genes from wastewater before spray irrigation of the effluents. The irrigation system is not suitable for edible crops because of the potential presence of residual pathogens. Significance and Impact of the Study: On-site wastewater treatment systems are a practical option for reusing the wastewater for landscape, especially for those areas where geological and seasonal limitations impact the removal of microbial contaminants by soil infiltration.

J	Stronge, KM; Smith, RV; Lennox, SD				Stronge, KM; Smith, RV; Lennox, SD			Predicting the spring algal biomass in Lough Neagh using time series analysis	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Lough Neagh is a large eutrophic lake covering 387 km(2) with a mean depth of 8.9 m. It is an important natural resource, being the largest single source of potable water for Belfast, Northern Ireland. 2. This report examines the causes of the year-to-year variation in the April-June (spring) algal biomass, measured as chlorophyll a, for the period 1974-92. 3. The spring chlorophyll a declined following the introduction of a phosphorus (P) reduction programme at major sewage treatment works in 1981. However, since 1990 the chlorophyll a concentrations in the spring have increased. 4. Time series methodology was employed to develop a model which explained 76% of the annual variation in spring chlorophyll a concentrations. 5. The independent variables used in the multiple regression model were the previous year's spring chlorophyll a concentration, soluble reactive P inputs for April-June and the particulate P concentration in the Lough during the previous summer.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				MAY	1998	39	3					593	600		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1998.00305.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1998.00305.x													WOS:000073798300018

In this study, multi-phase distribution, spatiotemporal variation and ecological risk of 18 antibiotics in rivers and lakes from Suzhou City were investigated based on urban-rural gradient. The total antibiotic concentration in surface water, suspended particulate matter (SPM) and sediments was 39.28-2578 ng/L, 6.16-171.09 ng/L and 12.67-2249 ng/g, respectively. High detection frequency (>76%) and concentration of antibiotics in multi-phase suggested universal pollution. Quinolones (QNs) and tetracycline (TCs) were the dominant antibiotics detected. The partitioning coefficient (K-p) value of SPM-water was 1.43-29.93 times larger than sediment-water, indicating that SPM can greatly affect the fate and distribution of antibiotics. Significant positive correlations between antibiotics and environmental parameters (e.g. TOC, TP and TN) revealed combined contamination and similar pollution sources. Antibiotic pollution exhibited evident spatiotemporal variation. For spatial variation, urban area showed more serious antibiotic pollution and greater ecological risk than rural and suburb areas, especially for sediments. Besides, antibiotic level and risk in rivers were higher than lakes. For seasonal variation, in case of surface water, rural area exhibited higher content in winter, while greater content was detected in autumn and spring in urban and suburb areas, respectively. The highest antibiotic content in SPM and sediments was all measured in winter owing to weak degradation ability. Ecological risk assessment based on risk quotients (RQs) indicated that norfloxacin (NFX), ciprofloxacin (CFX) and anhydmerythromycin (ETM-H2O) in surface water presented medium to high risk throughout the entire year, while sulfadiazine (SDZ) and enmfloxacin (EFX) in sediments showed higher accumulation potential. Thus, these five antibiotics were selected as the priority antibiotics for pollution control. In short, this study improves the understanding of antibiotic fates in the urban-rural watershed and provides scientific basis for the authorities to regulate antibiotic pollution.					; Hassan, Muhammad/N-6336-2018; Zhang, Bo/Q-7605-2018; Zhang, Xiaofan/HKN-0924-2023; Gin, Karina/AIB-8230-2022; Yang, Jun/N-8514-2014; Hassan, Muhammad/AAO-8562-2021; 黄, 源生/HLG-0828-2023	HUANG, Yuansheng/0000-0001-5105-9780; Hassan, Muhammad/0000-0002-5622-4017; 													0147-6513	1090-2414				DEC 15	2020	206								111156	10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111156	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111156								32866891					WOS:000582222400015

J	Mohammed, H; Longva, A; Seidu, R				Mohammed, Hadi; Longva, Andreas; Seidu, Razak			Impact of Climate Forecasts on the Microbial Quality of a Drinking Water Source in Norway Using Hydrodynamic Modeling	WATER												This study applies hydrodynamic and water quality modeling to evaluate the potential effects of local climate projections on the mixing conditions in Lake Brusdalsvatnet in Norway and the implications on the occurrence of Escherichia coli (E. coli) at the raw water intake point of the angstrom lesund water treatment plant in the future. The study is mainly based on observed and projected temperature, the number of E. coli in the tributaries of the lake and projected flow. The results indicate a gradual rise in the temperature of water at the intake point from the base year 2017 to year 2075. In the future, vertical circulations in spring may occur earlier while autumn circulation may start later than currently observed in the lake. The number of E. coli at the intake point of the lake is expected to marginally increase in future. By the year 2075, the models predict an approximately three-fold increase in average E. coli numbers for the spring and autumn seasons compared to current levels. The results are expected to provide the water supply system managers of angstrom lesund with the information necessary for long-term planning and decisions in the protection of the drinking water source. The method used here can also be applied to similar drinking water sources in Norway for developing effective risk management strategies within their catchments.

J	Hutchinson, I				Hutchinson, Ian			Climate Change and Indigenous Subsistence in the Thompson River Watershed (British Columbia) in the Late Holocene	ENVIRONMENTAL ARCHAEOLOGY												The Indigenous peoples of the Thompson River watershed on the northern Columbia Plateau traditionally subsisted in winter on dried salmon, dried roots and berries from upland meadows, and game. A summed probability distribution (SPDF) based on 54 radiocarbon ages from twenty-eight winter villages and summer fishing camps along that river exhibits volatile activity in anti-phase with an SPDF derived from 77 radiocarbon ages from twenty-six sites in the neighbouring uplands in the 2500-500 cal BP interval. Activity levels on the riverbanks decline after similar to 2000 cal BP, increase rapidly from similar to 1600 cal BP to similar to 1350 cal BP, fall dramatically in the next century, then rise again after similar to 700 cal BP, echoing patterns at other upriver fisheries on the northern Columbia plateau. Periods of increased activity on the Thompson riverbank are linked to robust runs of sockeye salmon, prompted by cooler/wetter phases of regional climate, and marked by higher lake levels, glacial advances, and increased rates of coastal upwelling in the northeast Pacific. Less reliable salmon harvests in the intervening periods are indicated by increases in activity in the uplands, with a concomitant greater reliance on roots and game in the local diet.																			1461-4103	1749-6314				2024 MAY 22	2024										10.1080/14614103.2024.2356945	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14614103.2024.2356945		MAY 2024											WOS:001229089100001
J	Xu, TB; Ma, W; Chen, J; Duan, LZ; Li, HY; Zhang, HC				Xu, Tianbao; Ma, Wei; Chen, Jun; Duan, Lizeng; Li, Huayu; Zhang, Hucai			Water Quality of Lake Erhai in Southwest China and Its Projected Status in the near Future	WATER												The water quality of Lake Erhai has deteriorated in recent decades due to socioeconomic development in the lake basin. After the massive implementation of water environmental protection measures in Lake Erhai in 2016, the trend of water quality deterioration has been curbed and the intensity and frequency of algal blooms has decreased. However, water quality monitoring data show that pollutant concentrations in Lake Erhai still exceed acceptable values, and there is a risk of water quality standard limits being further exceeded in the future. Therefore, it is urgent to systematically study the variability characteristics of water quality in Lake Erhai to provide practical methods to predict the future evolution of water quality. Based on water quality monitoring data from 2009 to 2019, the current water quality characteristics of Lake Erhai were analyzed, and a two-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality mathematical model was built to predict the water quality in 2025. The results showed that the total phosphorus (TP) concentration declined after 2016, mainly due to the significant reduction of TP entering the lake due to pollution interception. However, the concentrations of the potassium permanganate index (CODMn) and total nitrogen (TN) increased after 2016, demonstrating that the pollution control measures have had little effect on the improvement of CODMn and TN. The spatial and temporal distribution of pollutants showed that the water quality in winter and spring was better than in summer and autumn, and the water quality in the southern lake was better than in the northern lake. This analysis indicates that non-point source pollution remains the main source of pollution in Lake Erhai, and that rainfall is the main driving force of pollutants exceeding the water quality standard. According to the water quality predictions, without additional pollution control measures, pollutant concentrations in Lake Erhai will exceed the Class II water quality standard by 2025. This study analyzes the water quality characteristics, predicts the direction of future water quality changes, and provides a theoretical basis for the future water quality protection of Lake Erhai.					; Li, Huayu/KMX-1704-2024	Zhang, Hucai/0000-0001-7733-2036; Xu, Tianbao/0000-0002-8954-6362														2073-4441				APR	2024	16	7							972	10.3390/w16070972	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16070972													WOS:001201019200001

Expanded response-surfaces: a new method to reconstruct paleoclimates from fossil pollen assemblages that lack modern analogues	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Pollen-based paleoclimatic interpretations of late-glacial to early Holocene climates (17-9 ka) in Midwestern North America are hampered by samples that lack modern analogues. Unresolved questions include the magnitude and direction of temperature seasonality (i.e. were these climates more or less seasonal than present) and the temporal changes in precipitation. Central to the no-analogue problem is the truncation of modern pollen-climate relationships for abundant late-glacial taxa such as Fraxinus. Here we present a new method called the expanded response-surface (ERS) method, developed to reconstruct climates from no-analogue pollen assemblages and applied to a high-resolution late-glacial pollen record from Crystal Lake, Illinois to test hypotheses about late-glacial climates. The key assumptions central to the ERS method are: (1) plant species and pollen abundances follow symmetrical unimodal distributions along climatic gradients, (2) taxa with truncated distributions in modern climate space occupy a subset of their fundamental niche, and (3) expansion of truncated distributions by mirroring around the distributional mode recovers the portion of the fundamental niche not realized in the modern climate space. With the ERS method, we expanded modern pollen-climate relationships by mirroring pollen abundances for each taxon around a mode defined with respect to four climate axes (mean winter temperature, mean summer temperature, mean winter precipitation, and mean summer precipitation). The ERS method reconstructed past temperatures and precipitation during the height of no-analogue conditions (14 160-12 370 cal yr BP) for 37% of the Crystal Lake samples where techniques that employed only modern observational data found matches for only 13% of the fossil samples. The total climate space of the expanded taxa set allowed analogue matches under more seasonal-than-present climates with higher-than-p resent precipitation. The ERS climate reconstructions for the height of no-analogue conditions indicated cooler-than-present summer and winter temperatures, similar-to-present seasonal range in temperatures, higher-than-present winter precipitation, and similar-to-present summer precipitation. These results thus suggest that high moisture availability helped drive the formation of the Midwestern no-analogue communities with high Fraxinus nigra abundances, but do not show higher-than-present temperature seasonality notwithstanding the higher-than-present insolation seasonality at this time. During the no-analogue late-glacial interval, Picea mariana, E nigra, and Larix stands probably grew on low-lying, poorly drained soils in the Crystal Lake region; whereas Abies, Picea glauca, Quercus, and Ostrya/Carpinus grew on upland positions with better soil drainage.

Dispersal of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) downstream of an invaded reservoir	AQUATIC INVASIONS												Zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha, have recently invaded Central Texas. More information is needed to predict their spread in this region and inform management decisions. In this study, we examined riverine zebra mussel dispersal from, and settlement downstream of, a recently invaded reservoir, Lake Belton. Veliger samples and settlement of juveniles on artificial substrata were monitored at sites within Lake Belton and 0.4 to 54.7 river kilometers (rkm) downstream from the lake outlet. Veliger density varied greatly across space and time with peak densities of live veligers found in both early summer (May-June) and fall (October). High juvenile settlement occurred consistently at 2.5 and 6.0 rkm downstream. Juvenile settlement was not observed >= 13 rkm downstream until the spring of 2016 after a period of prolonged increased river discharge. Our findings suggest that mussels were dispersal limited in 2015, and prolonged periods of increased river discharge may have facilitated their dispersal further downstream in 2016.

Seasonal trends for PAHs, PCBs, and organochlorine pesticides	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												This is the second of two papers demonstrating the feasibility of using passive air samplers to investigate persistent organic pollutants along an urban-rural transect in Toronto. The first paper investigated spatial trends for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). This second paper investigates the seasonality of air concentrations for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), PCBs, and OCPs along this transect. Air samplers, consisting of polyurethane foam (PUF) disks housed in stainless steel domed chambers, were deployed for three 4-month integration periods from June 2000 to July 2001. The seasonal variations of derived air concentrations for PAHs, PUS, and OCPs reflected the different source characteristics for these compounds. PAHs showed a strong urban-rural gradient with maximum concentrations at urban sites during the summer period (July-October). These high summer values in Toronto were attributed to increases in evaporative emissions from petroleum products such as asphalt. PCBs also exhibited a strong urban-rural gradient with maximum air concentrations (similar to 2-3 times higher) during the spring period (April-June). This was attributed to increased surface-air exchange of PCBs that had accumulated in the surface layer over the winter. alpha-HCH was fairly uniformly distributed, spatially and temporally, as expected. This pattern and the derived air concentration of similar to 35 to similar to 100 pg m(-3) agreed well with high volume air data from this region, adding confidence to the operation of the passive samplers and showing that site-to-site differences in sampling rates was not an issue. For other OCPs, highest concentrations were observed during the spring period. This was associated with either (i) their local and/or regional application (gamma-HCH, endosulfan) and (ii) their revolatilization (chlordanes, DDT isomers, dieldrin, and toxaphene). Principal component analysis resulted in clusters for the different target chemicals according to their chemical class/source type. The results of this study demonstrate how such a simple sampling technique can provide both spatial and seasonal information. These data, integrated over seasons, can be used to evaluate contaminant trends and the potential role of large urban centers as sources of some semivolatile compounds to the regional environment, including the Great Lakes ecosystem.

Thirty-year trends in suspended sediment in seven Lake Erie tributaries	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Sediment is an important pollutant for Lake Erie and its tributaries as a carrier of other substances and as a pollutant in its own right. Environmental managers have called for major reductions in sediment loadings in Lake Erie tributaries. In this study, 30-yr (1975-2005) datasets with daily resolution are analyzed to identify and interpret trends in sediment concentrations and loads in major US tributaries to Lake Erie. The Maumee and Sandusky Rivers in agricultural northwest Ohio show continual decreases throughout this period, but (he River Raisin shows increases, especially in the last decade. The urban and forested Cuyahoga River shows little trend before 2000 but shows increases since then. The mostly forested Grand River shows strong decreases before 1995, little change thereafter until the early 2000s, and then increases. In most cases, the greatest decreases or smallest increases, depending on the river, are associated with summer and fail and with low flow conditions, whereas the smallest decreases or greatest increases are associated with the spring and with high flow conditions. Analysis of concentration-flow relationships indicates that these changes are not due to weather but reflect positive and negative arithropogenic influences. Sediment decreases in the northwestern Ohio tributaries seem to reflect the Successful Use of agricultural practices to reduce erosion and prevent sediment loss. Opportunities for further reductions in sediment loads and concentrations lie in better management of sediment losses during winter and spring.																			0047-2425					SEP-OCT	2008	37	5					1894	1908		10.2134/jeq2007.0590	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2007.0590								18689751					WOS:000258936900025

The non-chimeric sequence reads were classified taxonomically into 49 phyla, 114 classes, 185 orders, 244 families and 384 genera. Proteobacteria was found to be the most abundant bacterial phylum in all the four samples. The highest number of observed species was found to be 3097 in sample taken from least populated area during summer (LPS) whereas the summer sample from highly populated area (HPS) was found most diverse among all as indicated by taxonomic diversity analysis. The QIIME output files were used for PICRUSt analysis to assign functional attributes. The samples exhibited a significant difference in their microbial community composition and structure. Comparative analysis of functional pathways indicated that the anthropogenic activities in populated areas and higher summer temperature, both decrease functional potential of the Lake microbiota.

The gap between demand and supply of water has been increasing exponentially year by year. Deforestation, use of groundwater vigorously for agricultural practices, and polluting our present water resources such as rivers, lakes, and wells are triggering the freshwater scarcity problem. Ninety percent of people of Uttarakhand depend on springs for their daily life activities. In such a case, the quality and quantity of spring water should be a prime topic to be focussed on. In the Kumaon region of Uttarakhand, spring water quality is good but there is an issue with its availability, especially in summer. This review paper details the studies that have been conducted on nutrient status, hardness, heavy metals, and the presence of microbiological diversity in spring water, as well as this article, also uncovers the information of some critical springs, geological settings of their aquifers, and the steps that have been adopted to rejuvenate the spring. Some other practices have been done for springs' revival and their improvement in discharge rate, by the government and local communities like construction of percolation pits, contour trenches, check dams, and improvement of water resources which are also tried to touch those areas. It has been observed among the analyzed sample that the Kumaon region is dominated by arsenic, cadmium, chromium, and lead, whereas aluminum, barium, cobalt, and manganese are more in the Garhwal region. Apart from spring, this review paper also reveals the physicochemical characteristics of the spring-fed river and lakes of the Kumaon region.

Diel Variability of CO2 Emissions From Northern Lakes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Lakes are generally supersaturated in carbon dioxide (CO2) and emitters of CO2 to the atmosphere. However, estimates of CO2 flux (FCO2) from lakes are seldom based on direct flux measurements and usually do not account for nighttime emissions, yielding risk of biased assessments. Here, we present direct FCO2 measurements from automated floating chambers collected every 2-3 hr and spanning 115 24 hr periods in three boreal lakes during summer stratification and before and after autumn mixing in the most eutrophic lake of these. We observed 40%-67% higher mean FCO2 in daytime during periods of surface water CO2 supersaturation in all lakes. Day-night differences in wind speed were correlated with the day-night FCO2 differences in the two larger lakes, but in the smallest and most wind-sheltered lake peaks of FCO2 coincided with low-winds at night. During stratification in the eutrophic lake, CO2 was near equilibrium and diel variability of FCO2 insignificant, but after autumn mixing FCO2 was high with distinct diel variability making this lake a net CO2 source on an annual basis. We found that extrapolating daytime measurements to 24 hr periods overestimated FCO2 by up to 30%, whereas extrapolating measurements from the stratified period to annual rates in the eutrophic lake underestimated FCO2 by 86%. This shows the importance of accounting for diel and seasonal variability in lake CO2 emission estimates.					; Oliveira Sawakuchi, Henrique/ABA-9796-2021; Rudberg, David/JMP-4750-2023; Oliveira Sawakuchi, Henrique/K-6194-2014; Sieczko, Anna/O-2310-2015	Rudberg, David/0000-0003-0934-2077; Pajala, Gustav/0000-0001-7960-0129; Schenk, Jonathan/0000-0002-6191-3933; Karlsson, Jan/0000-0001-5730-0694; Oliveira Sawakuchi, Henrique/0000-0002-6815-7261; Verheijen, Hendricus/0000-0002-2858-6299; Sieczko, Anna/0000-0003-0472-7840													2169-8953	2169-8961				OCT	2021	126	10							e2021JG006246	10.1029/2021JG006246	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JG006246													WOS:000711969900032

Depleted oxygen isotopes in lake deposits were commonly interpreted in terms of enhanced summer monsoon moisture supply, implying a migration of the ASM deep into the interior of the plateau during Holocene periods. In order to test this relationship we used a high resolution oxygen isotope record (mean 20 yr resolution) in combination with carbonates and mineral phases, titanium flux, grain size and ostracod abundances derived from a 6.84 m long sediment core in the endorheic Kuhai Lake basin, north-eastern TP. The results confirm 1) continuous positive co-variance between enriched delta O-18(carb) and total carbonates during the last 14 ka, indicative of dominant seasonal influence on multi-decadal to centennial scale isotopic signatures in lake water and respective carbonate precipitation, 2) negative co-variance between allochthonous sediment flux and delta O-18(carb) (and carbonates) attributed to relative increase of flux rates during non-summer seasons, 3) correspondence of lake level variations with carbonate mineral phases and the occurrence/disappearance of ostracod assemblages, and 4) inverse relationships between isotopic signatures in ASM-dominated and MLW-controlled lake records across the TP. Enriched delta O-18(carb) in Kuhai Lake sediments was primarily a result of high evaporation during the summer seasons, while ASM-related rainfall amount did not play an important role, likely counterbalanced by isotopic signatures from different water sources. Conversely, depleted delta O-18(carb) was mainly attributed to water supply during non summer seasons of colder temperatures and generally light isotopic signatures from MLW-derived sources. This finding may lead to a paradigm shift in such way that depleted delta O-18 in carbonates is primarily not the result from ASM-related rainfall as previously assumed. The reconstructed hydro-climatic history of Kuhai Lake indicates the dominance of westerly-derived climate during the Younger Dryas interval (12.8-11.5 ka) under very shallow pond-like conditions. Despite climate amelioration during the early Holocene (11.5-7.5 ka) hydrological conditions remained unstable with frequent alternations between dominance of summer and winter seasons. During the middle Holocene (7.5-5.5 ka) the lake experienced highest lake levels dominated by summer monsoon-related water supply, assigned to the Holocene hydro-climatic optimum. Frequent high-amplitude fluctuations afterwards (5.1-2.9 ka) refer to cooling/drying events under enhanced MLW influence accompanied by a strong lake level decline. The late Holocene (2.9 ka- Present) period experienced moderate isotopic variations and fluctuating lake levels in response to variable influence of summer- or winter-related hydro-climatic conditions. This seesaw-like pattern with amplitudes of >10 parts per thousand in delta O-18(carb) resembles fluctuations in cave records and variations between air and seawater (Dole effect). High correspondence with cooling events derived from North Atlantic drift ice and meltwater discharge indicate close ties to northern hemispheric climate transmitted by the MLW across the TP.

Regarding spatial distribution, a decreasing N-->S gradient was generally observed for the pigments, except in summer. This inversion observed during the summer was influenced by the predominant fetch (N-E). The horizontal heterogeneity was proved (ANOVA) for all seasons of the year, except spring. Spatially in spring, the vertical variance was much more significant (p<0.05) than the horizontal one. The sampling shifts presented a permanent degree of variability among the seasons of the year, showing the existence Of a diurnal cycle in the concentration of chlorophyll a. This behavior was related to the fetch, mainly from the NE and SW quadrants, disturbing the system because it is a shallow lake. This confirmed the influence of the Itapeva Lake's hydrodynamic regime on the spatial-temporal distribution of the phytoplankton pigments.					de S Cardoso, Luciana/D-9523-2013	da Motta Marques, David/0000-0002-3809-8053													1516-8913	1678-4324				AUG	2004	47	4					587	600		10.1590/S1516-89132004000400013	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1516-89132004000400013													WOS:000223676100013

Sediment characteristics are strongly correlated to the internal P loading in lakes. This study investigated speciation of P, Fe, Al, and Ca in sediments of six sampling sites with varying trophic status in Baiyangdian Lake of North China during the period of July 2008 and March 2009. The results of sequential extraction experiments of the top sediments showed that total extractable P ranged approximately from 13 to 28 mu mol g(-1) for all sampling sites and the rank order of P-fractions was HCl-P > NaOH(85)-P > NaOH(25)-P > BD-P > NH(4)Cl-P. BD-P and BD-Fe had a consistent change with seasons. Their concentrations were both much higher in early spring and mid-autumn. BD-Fe, Al extracted with NaOH at 25A degrees C and 85A degrees C affected corresponding P concentration in sediments, while high concentration of extractable Ca from sediments showed no direct effects. According to the Kopaek et al. model of the molar ratios of Al:Fe and [NaOH(25)-Al]:[NH(4)Cl-P + BD-P], there was potential P release from sediments twice a year for some hypereutrophic sites in early spring and mid-autumn, especially in the former season.

The greatest hazards are winter injury and bunch rot. This suggests that cultural practices which minimize these hazards should be utilized for Pinot noir (1). Such practices include: use of low vigor rootstock, vertical training, summer pruning, leaf removal, botryticide application, double pruning, and multiple trunks to allow compensation for winter injury. These data also have helped to guide our research on growing Pinot noir in New York. We have emphasized testing to identify clones which have superior winter cold hardiness, which resist bunch rot and which produce wines with sufficient color and flavors characteristic of mature fruit, even in cooler growing seasons.																					0-9630711-2-2				1995							45	51																WOS:A1995BH55A00008
J	Harrad, S; Hunter, S				Harrad, Stuart; Hunter, Stuart			Concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers in air and soil on a rural-urban transect across a major UK conurbation	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were measured in air (using PUF disk passive samplers) and soil samples taken at approximately monthly intervals over 1 year at 10 locations on a transect across the West Midlands of the UK. Concentrations in air are consistent with those detected elsewhere in Europe and the Great Lakes basin. Concentrations in soil fall within the range reported for rural woodland and grassland soils in the UK and Norway. In both air and soil, concentrations clearly decrease with increasing distance from the city center, supporting the existence of an urban "pulse", indicating the West Midlands conurbation to be a source of PBDEs to the wider environment. Examination of seasonal trends revealed no evidence of a "spring pulse" in concentrations in air, with no summer peak in concentrations in air observed for 70% of sites. The PBDE congener pattern in air differs from that in soil, with ratios of congeners 47: 99 higher in air than in soil. It is hypothesized that PBDEs volatilize from treated products indoors, before ventilating outdoors, where congener 99 undergoes preferential atmospheric deposition and accumulation in soil.

A Framework to Determine Present and Future Effects of Rain-on-Snow on Spring Hydrology and Nutrient Loading in the Lake Erie Basin	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Rain-on-snow (ROS) events occur when temperatures allow for liquid precipitation to fall onto an existing snowpack. Although ROS is a fundamental facet of winter and spring hydrology in the Great Lakes Basin with the potential to result in severe flooding and influence water quality issues, its role in this region is understudied compared with alpine regions. Many watershed models do not comprehensively characterise the ROS process and thus may misrepresent hydrological and water quality outputs. Here, we elucidate the importance of ROS on spring water balance and nutrient loading in the Big Creek watershed, part of the Lake Erie Basin (LEB), through an ensemble of statistical, hydrological, and climate modelling tools. We found that spring flow events with enhanced ROS melt are conducive to excessive loading export from both agricultural and natural land uses. The incorporation of a novel ROS routine into the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model demonstrated that the modified version improved performance in 76% of 504 random streamflow simulations. The ROS characterisation can more accurately recreate the magnitude of extreme flow events in spring, which is a commonly reported shortcoming of the SWAT model. The ROS submodel simulated earlier shifts in snowmelt, water yield and evapotranspiration by 1 month compared with the original model. In examining a climate scenario associated with modest greenhouse gas emission changes, we found that monthly average streamflow over the 21st century is projected to remain relatively stable, but the occurrence of extreme flow conditions will increase. ROS event frequency is projected to increase in February and March and decrease in April in urban and natural land uses, but agricultural areas will only experience a slight decline, suggesting that the landscape attributes play an important role in localised shifts in ROS event frequency. We contend that ongoing watershed modelling work must include the ROS process to improve representation of critical facets of hydrology and water quality that could be extrapolated to other more complex watersheds within the LEB and elsewhere.

For instance, whether moisture availability gradually decreased, remained relatively constant, or increased during the last 7000 years remains a matter of debate. To assess Holocene limnology, hydrology and moisture dynamics, the coastal lakes Lago Preola and Gorgo Basso, located in southwestern Sicily, were investigated through several stratigraphic analyses of ostracodes, including multivariate analyses of assemblages, transfer functions of salinity, and biochemical analyses of valves (Sr/Ca, delta O-18 and delta C-13). During the early Holocene, the Gorgo Basso and Lago Preola ostracode records are similar. After an initial period of moderate salinity (1690-6100 mg/l from ca. 10,000-8190 cal yr BP), syndepositional or diagenetic dissolution of ostracode valves suggests that salinity declined to <250 mg/L from ca. 8190 to 7000 cal yr BP at both sites. After ca. 6250 cal yr BP, the ostracode records are strikingly different. Lago Preola became much more saline, with paleosalinity values that ranged from 2270 to about 24,420 mg/L. We suggest that Lago Preola's change from a freshwater to mesosaline lake at about 6250 cal yr BP was related to sea level rise and resulting intrusion of seawater-influenced groundwater. In contrast, Gorgo Basso remained a freshwater lake. The salinity of Gorgo Basso declined somewhat after 6250 cal yr BP, in comparison to the early Holocene, ranging from about 550 to 1680 mg/L. Cypria ophtalmica, a species capable of rapid swimming and flourishing in waters with low dissolved oxygen levels, became dominant at approximately the time when Greek civilization took root in Sicily (2600 cal yr BP), and it completely dominates the record during Roman occupation (roughly 2100 to 1700 cal yr BP). These freshwater conditions at Gorgo Basso suggest high effective moisture when evergreen olive-oak forests collapsed in response to increased Greco-Roman land use and fire. Ostracode valve geochemistry (Sr/Ca, delta O-18) suggests significant changes in early vs. late Holocene hydrochemistry, either as changes in salinity or in the seasonality of precipitation. Harmonizing the autecological and geochemical data from Gorgo Basso suggests the latter was more likely, with relatively more late Holocene precipitation falling during the spring, summer, and fall, than winter compared to the early Holocene. Our ostracode-inferred paleosalinity data indicate that moisture availability did not decline during the late Holocene in the central Mediterranean region. Instead, moisture availability was lowest during the early Holocene, and most abundant during the late Holocene. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	MARSH, P; HEY, M				MARSH, P; HEY, M			THE FLOODING HYDROLOGY OF MACKENZIE DELTA LAKES NEAR INUVIK, NWT, CANADA	ARCTIC												The hydrologic regime of lakes in the Mackenzie Delta is controlled primarily by lake sill elevations and water levels in the Mackenzie River distributary channels. The resulting variations in lake regime have important effects on the water, sediment, and nutrient balance of delta lakes, and therefore on the biologic regime of each lake. Analysis of 12-25 years of Mackenzie river East Channel water levels allowed the documentation of the relationship between flooding regime and sill elevation for lakes in the study area near Inuvik, N.W.T. These data showed that in this portion of the delta, the timing of the spring rise in water levels is very consistent, with peak levels, for example, occurring on 3 June with a standard deviation of only 4 days. The magnitude of the spring flood varies greatly from year to year, and as a result only 67% of lakes in the study area flood annually in the spring, while the remaining lakes have a flood frequency of greater than 1 year and less than 4 years. Since the mean summer flood peak of 2,777 m asl is considerably lower than the mean spring peak of 5.636 m asl, summer lake flooding is not as extensive , with only 20% of lakes receiving floodwater annually during the summer. By late summer, water levels drop to 1.5 m asl annually, cutting of approximately 88% of lakes from the Mackenzie River. These data on the return period of lake flooding allowed the classification system described by Mackay (1963) to be quantified. The no-, low-, and high-closure lakes were found to represent 12, 55 and 33% respectively of all lakes in the study area. Variations in the hydrologic regime of the Mackenzie River could occur in the future due to hydro-electric development, climate change, or rising sea level. Even small changes in Mackenzie River levels could result in a significant modification to the hydrologic regime of delta lakes. The effects on the viability of these lakes, or their chemical and nutrient balances, are not well known.																			0004-0843	1923-1245				MAR	1989	42	1					41	49																WOS:A1989U042500005

Do Water Level Fluctuations Influence Production of Walleye and Yellow Perch Young-of-the-Year in Large Northern Lakes?	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Many ecological processes depend on the regular rise and fall of water levels (WLs), and artificial manipulations to WL regimes can impair important ecosystem services. Previous research has suggested that differences in WL between late summer and early spring may alter the suitability of shoals used by Walleyes Sander vitreus for spawning. Other species, such as the Yellow Perch Perca flavescens, are unlikely to be affected in the same way by WL fluctuations because their spawning requirements are quite different. We used 11-23 years of data from six northern Minnesota lakes to assess the effects of WL fluctuations on the abundances of young-of-the-year (age-0) Walleyes and Yellow Perch. In two lakes (Rainy Lake and Lake Kabetogama), a change in WL management occurred in 2000, after which these lakes saw increased age-0 Walleye abundance, while the other study lakes experienced decreases or no change. Rainy Lake and Lake Kabetogama also had increases in age-0 Yellow Perch, but another study lake did also. We used partial least-squares regression to assess whether WL metrics were associated with variation in age-0 Walleye and Yellow Perch abundances, but WL metrics were seldom associated with age-0 abundance for either species. Our analysis suggested a potential influence of WL regulation on age-0 Walleye abundance, but we found no evidence that early spring access to spawning shoals was the mechanism by which this occurred.					; Peterson, Kevin/MIO-2378-2025	Larson, James/0000-0002-6414-9758; 													0275-5947	1548-8675					2016	36	6					1425	1436		10.1080/02755947.2016.1214645	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2016.1214645													WOS:000391851900020

We investigated the influence of canopy coverage on abundance, diversity, phenology and feeding guilds among Diptera assemblages at two rheocrene karst springs located near each other. The springs differed by canopy coverage while physicochemical characteristics of the water were similar. We set six emergence traps for one year at each spring covering all available microhabitats proportionally. We hypothesized that canopy coverage will have a strong effect on assemblage composition of Diptera as well as on diversity, abundance, phenology and feeding guilds composition between sites and that it will have a stronger effect than microhabitat characteristics. Similarity of species composition among springs was only 37.5%, with 23 common species/taxa out of 74 species/taxa. Abundance of Diptera was 8.5 x higher at the open canopy spring, while diversity and number of species/taxa was higher at closed canopy spring. Emergence started earlier at open canopy site and was prolonged even in winter months. The majority of species were detritus feeders followed by collectors and there was no substantial difference among sites. We conclude that at springs with similar water characteristics, canopy coverage is the main driver of Diptera assemblage structure, with water velocity as a complementary factor, Substrate and other physicochemical factors seem less important.

However, nutrient inputs from angling bait by recreational fisheries have not yet been estimated. We quantified nutrient inputs from angling baits in small lakes supporting specialized carp, put-and-take, and specialized roach recreational fisheries with a 2-year field survey of angling activity and in-person angler questionnaires. Angling activity was highly variable among recreational fisheries and averaged 82 (+/- 74 SD) angler-day/ha/year in lakes with specialized carp fisheries, 145 (+/- 80) in lakes with put-and-take fisheries, and 36 (+/- 18) in lakes with specialized roach fisheries. Angling activity also differed temporally among recreational fisheries, with high angling activity in spring and summer for specialized carp and specialized roach fisheries, and in autumn and winter for put-and-take fisheries. The type and amount of baits used by anglers strongly differed among recreational fisheries, with specialized carp anglers using boilies (2.5 +/- 1.5 SD kg/angler/day) and seeds (2.1 +/- 1.9 kg/angler/day), put-and-take anglers using exclusively pellets (0.39 +/- 0.15 kg/angler/day), and specialized roach anglers using ground baits (0.72 +/- 0.36 kg/angler/day). Nutrient inputs from angling baits were highly variable among recreational fisheries and ranged from 0.5 (+/- 0.2 SD) kg/ha/year of nitrogen and 0.1 (+/- 0.0) kg/ha/year of phosphorus in specialized roach fisheries to 10.2 (+/- 9.3) kg/ha/year of nitrogen and 1.6 (+/- 1.5) kg/ha/year of phosphorus in specialized carp fisheries. Our findings revealed that ecological consequences of ground baiting differed among recreational fisheries, which should be useful for developing fishery-specific regulations to efficiently manage ground baiting.

A pronounced rainfall response is observed in post-ENSO summer, especially over North Xinjiang and Yili River valley. A possible mechanism is proposed for such a seasonal lagged impact. El Nino could induce Indian Ocean warming that persists into boreal spring and summer although El Nino itself has dissipated. The warmer Indian Ocean sea surface temperature (SST) would heat the tropospheric atmosphere and elevate the tropical geopotential height at the upper level. As a result, the South Asian High (SAH) exhibits a southward extension due to the increasing geopotential height in its southern flank. A southward displacement of subtropical jet is evident associated with such SAH shift, which further induces a barotropic low pressure anomaly over central Asia. Meanwhile, associated with the southward displacement of subtropical jet, the water vapor from tropical Indian Ocean tends to transport across Iranian Plateau and bring wet and warm air into central Asia. The resultant convergence of water vapor with cold and dry air from high latitude leads to the observed rainfall anomaly to the south and east of Balkhash Lake, explaining the lagged relationship between ENSO and SPNWC.

J	Bektas, S; Yildirim, A; Arslan, M				Bektas, Serdar; Yildirim, Ayhan; Arslan, Murat			Seasonal and spatial variability of condition and length-weight relationship of European Chub (Leuciscus cephalus) inhabited in Upper Coruh River (Turkey)	CYBIUM												Seasonal and spatial variations in Fulton condition factor (K), somatic index (SI) and length-weight relationship (L-WR) for Leuciscus cephalus from Upper Coruh River (Turkey) were analysed from March 2000 to February 2001. There was slightly temporal variation in both K and SI for adults and juveniles with generally lower value in summer and winter and higher value in spring. Although a considerable spatial variation in K was reported, there was no statistically difference in SI. L-WR was calculated as W = 0.008 x L-3.164 for males, W = 0.008 x L-3.176 for females, W = 0.009 x L-3.102 for juveniles, and W = 0.008 x L-3.162 for overall, indicating positive allometric growth in mature and juvenile fish. Exponent b value also varied both spatially and temporally. Our results suggested that condition, somatic growth, and growth characteristics of Leuciscus cephalus changed depending on both gonadal development and spawning properties of species and environmental condition of the basin.

J	Chen, CY; Folt, CL				Chen, CY; Folt, CL			Consequences of fall warming for zooplankton overwintering success	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY					Symposium on Regional Assessment of Freshwater Ecosystems and Climate Change in North America	OCT 24-26, 1994	LEESBURG, VA	Amer Soc Limnol & Oceanog, N Amer Benthol Soc, US EPA, US Geol Survey				Increased temperatures in fall as predicted by recent climate models will have important consequences for the overwintering strategies and seasonal phenologies of organisms in temperate lakes. We compare fall thermal responses of species representatives of the copepod Epischura lacustris and the cladoceran Daphnia catawba. Daily temperatures and weekly population densities were measured in a lake where these species co-occur, and demographic variables for each species (survival, reproduction, egg hatching, and production of resting stages) were assessed over a temperature range of 15 to 30 degrees C in the laboratory. This study provides three types of evidence that the success of these species could be altered by fall warming events (temperatures > 15 degrees C). First, resting eggs of E. lacustris could be stimulated to hatch from the ''seed bank'' in fall. If so, they would be unable to reach maturity before winter, and the cohort could be lost. Second, sexually reproducing D. catawba populations in fall could be induced to switch from sexual to asexual reproduction. This switch could delay production and reduce the number of ephippial resting eggs. Third, on the basis of thermal tolerances, E. lacustris is representative of a species whose geographic range is likely to be altered by warming at any time. Over the long term, the disruption of overwintering strategies by warming in fall could be a mechanism that alters the geographic ranges of species.																			0024-3590					JUL	1996	41	5					1077	1086		10.4319/lo.1996.41.5.1077	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1996.41.5.1077													WOS:A1996VN45800030

Contribution of Leaf Litter to Nutrient Export during Winter Months in an Urban Residential Watershed	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Identification of nonpoint sources of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in urban systems is imperative to improving water quality and better managing eutrophication. Winter contributions and sources of annual N and P loads from urban watersheds are poorly characterized in northern cities because monitoring is often limited to warm-weather periods. To determine the winter export of N and P, we monitored stormwater outflow in a residential watershed in Saint Paul, Minnesota during 2012-2014. Our data demonstrate that winter melt events contribute a high percentage of annual N and P export (50%). We hypothesized that overwintering leaf litter that is not removed by fall street sweeping could be an important source to winter'oads of N and P. We estimated contributions of this source by studying decomposition in lawns, street gutters, and catch basins, during two winters. Rates of mass and N loss were negligible during both winters. However, P was quickly solubilized from decomposing leaves. Using mass balances and estimates of P leaching losses, we estimated that leaf litter could contribute 80% of winter total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) loading in this watershed (similar to 40% of annual TDP loading). Our work indicates that urban trees adjacent to streets likely represent a major source of P pollution in northern cities. Management that targets important winter sources such as tree leaves could be highly effective for reducing P loading and may mitigate eutrophication in urban lakes and streams in developed cities.

The optimal network was found to consist of seven input neurons, six hidden neurons, and one output neuron, and coefficient of determination (R-2) values for the training, validation, and test sets were 0.77, 0.49, and 0.76, respectively. Respective values of the root mean square (RMSE) and bias for the three data sets are 17.24 and -1.05 for training, 12.48 and 0.62 for validation, and 11.01 and 2.2 for testing. Compared with multiple linear regression models, the BRBPNN model fit the data much better. Thus, the BRBPNN model was shown to be a powerful tool for predicting the long-term chlorophyll-a concentration dynamics in Meiliang Bay. Furthermore, we find that algae in the Meiliang Bay, principally Microcystis, were alkalophilic, and phytoplankton production was controlled by P inputs from spring to early summer, whereas N played a more dominant controlling role in summer-fall. Therefore, reducing P may no longer be adequate for Lake Taihu, and new nutrient reduction strategies should incorporate N-input reduction along with P-input reductions.					zhang, ruibin/JXL-6292-2024; Qian, Yu/KXQ-5387-2024														1092-8758	1557-9018				NOV 1	2015	32	11					938	947		10.1089/ees.2015.0164	http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/ees.2015.0164													WOS:000364314300005
