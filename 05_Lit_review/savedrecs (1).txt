J	Kennedy, RJ; Barry, J; Boyd, A; Allen, M				Kennedy, Richard J.; Barry, James; Boyd, Adele; Allen, Michelle			Does phenology influence predation rate on Salmo trutta parr during lake migration?	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Acoustic tags fitted with predation sensors, which trigger following ingestion by piscivorous predators, were used to compare direct predation rates during downstream migration (out-migration) of potamodromous (freshwater) brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) parr from their natal river into a large freshwater lake system during spring and autumn. Thirty-eight spring migrants were tagged across two study years (2021 and 2022) of which 13 individuals (34%) were predated. By contrast 40 autumn migrants were tagged (2020 and 2021) of which three individuals (7.5%) experienced predation. The overall predation loss rate for spring migrants was 0.342% day(-1) and was 0.075% day(-1) for autumn migrants. Most predation events during spring (77%) occurred within the lower river before tagged fish entered the lake, whilst no predation events were recorded within the river in the autumn. Predation events were significantly linked to tagging season (spring or autumn), with the probability of tags remaining untriggered (as a proxy for survival) being higher 93% (95% confidence interval [CI] [87%, 100%]) in autumn than in spring 66% (95% CI [53%, 83%]). The spring migration periods showed significantly lower river discharge (0.321 m(3)/s mean daily discharge, April 1 to May 31) to those measured during autumn (1.056 m(3)/s mean daily discharge, October 1 to November 30) (Mann-Whitney U-test, U = 1149, p < 0.001). Lower flows, clearer water, and longer sojourn in the river may have contributed to greater predation losses in the spring relative to the autumn.																				1095-8649				MAY	2025	106	5			SI		1334	1343		10.1111/jfb.15719	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfb.15719		MAR 2024						38491848					WOS:001185869900001

The results showed that the RGR of C. demersum was the highest (1.29 for spring and 0.58 for autumn) among the five macrophytes, while that of P crispus was the lowest (0.039) in the spring experiment and M. spicatum was the lowest (0.022) in the autumn experiment. Also, total phosphorus (TP) removal rates of C. demersum (91.75% and 92.44%) during the spring and autumn were the highest in the five macrophytes. Among the five macrophytes, the order of phosphorus removal capacities was: C. demersum > E. canadensis > P. crispu during the spring. But for autumn, the order was C demersum > V spiralis > M. spicatum.

J	Churchill, JH; Williams, AJ; Ralph, EA				Churchill, JH; Williams, AJ; Ralph, EA			Bottom stress generation and sediment transport over the shelf and slope off of Lake Superior's Keweenaw peninsula	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												[ 1] Data from near-bottom instruments reveal that the mechanisms responsible for generating bottom stresses and resuspending sediment over the shelf and slope off of Lake Superior's Keweenaw peninsula exhibit distinct seasonal variations. Notably, near-bottom flows over the slope are persistently weak (< 10 cm s(-1)) during summer but frequently attain high speeds, in excess of 20 cm s(-1), in autumn and winter. During the intense storms of autumn and winter the generation of bottom stress is enhanced by the action of near-bottom orbital velocities due to surface waves. Even at 90-m depth, orbital velocities can increase bottom stress by a factor of up to 20% during storms. Where the seasonal thermocline intersects the lake floor, bottom stress is also considerably enhanced, often by more than a factor of 2, by high-frequency motions in the internal wave band. Over the Keweenaw slope, sediment resuspension is largely confined to autumn and winter episodes of high bottom stress. Our analysis indicates that this resuspended material tends to be carried offshore, a phenomenon that is partly due to the coincidence of the direction of the buoyancy-driven component of the Keweenaw Current with downwelling favorable alongshore winds. As a result of this coincidence, currents and bottom stresses tend to be greater during periods of downwelling, as opposed to upwelling, circulation. A potential challenge to modeling storm-driven resuspension in the study region is indicated by observations that the minimum stress required for resuspension may vary significantly with time over the autumn and winter.

However, human activity and climate change have obscured the clarity of this relationship and its driving mechanisms, particularly in northern grassland lakes. This study focused on Hulun Lake, the largest grassland lake in northern China, to quantitatively analyze the carbon dioxide exchange flux (FCO2) at the water-air interface from 1963 to 2023. The analysis revealed significant seasonal, interannual, and decadal variations in the FCO2. Over the past 60 years, FCO2 varying significant in seasons and years has notably decreased, averaging 0.324 +/- 0.106 gC<middle dot>m(-2)<middle dot>d(-1). Notably, there was a qualitative change in FCO2 from "sink" (0.161 +/- 0.109 gC<middle dot>m(-2)<middle dot>d(-1)) to "source" (-0.130 +/- 0.087 gC<middle dot>m(-2)<middle dot>d(-1))between 2019 and 2020. From 1963 to 2019, the lake acted as a CO2 source, releasing an average flux of 0.438 +/- 0.111 gC<middle dot>m(-2)<middle dot>d(-1). During this period, FCO2 was the highest in spring, followed by summer, and the lowest in autumn and winter when the lake was covered by ice. In 2020, the lake transitioned into a CO2 sink with an average FCO2 of -0.248 +/- 0.042 gCm(-2)<middle dot>d(-1) from 2020 to 2023. During this period, FCO2 peaked in autumn, followed by summer and spring, and was lowest in winter when the lake was ice covered. A structural model equation (SEM) was employed to analyze the effects of various factors, including physical, chemical, and biological aspects, on FCO2 and the source-sink pattern of Hulun Lake. This study suggested that lake eutrophication, compounded by global warming, may be the primary driving force behind these changes. Rising temperatures and eutrophication enhanced the primary productivity of the lake. The amount of CO2 fixed through photosynthesis surpassed that emitted by respiration. Consequently, the eutrophication may alter the CO2 exchange pattern in Hulun Lake, shifting it from a "source" to a "sink".																			0048-9697	1879-1026				NOV 25	2024	953								176052	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.176052	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.176052		SEP 2024						39241885					WOS:001317005800001
J	Li, DQ; Huang, D; Guo, CF; Guo, XY				Li, Dongqing; Huang, Di; Guo, Chaofan; Guo, Xiaoyu			Multivariate statistical analysis of temporal-spatial variations in water quality of a constructed wetland purification system in a typical park in Beijing, China	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Using discriminant analysis (DA) and principal component analysis/factor analysis (PCA/FA), we described the variations in the water quality of a constructed wetland (CW) purification system in Olympic Park supplied with reclaimed water (RW). The analyses were conducted across three seasons (spring, summer, and autumn) and four functional zones (composite vertical flow constructed wetland [CVW], plant oxidation pond [POP], mixed oxidation pond [MOP], and main lake [ML]). The results demonstrated the relatively high water quality of the CW, which was suitable for landscape reuse. The most severe contamination occurred in autumn and in the ML/MOP. Chemical oxygen demand (CODMn), NO3--N, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), and total nitrogen (TN) caused 91.8 % of the temporal variations while DO, cyanobacteria (PCY), and pH caused 70.8 % of the spatial variations. The low accuracy of the DA indicated that the four functional areas exhibited similar pollution characteristics. Internal pollution was the major pollutant source in all selected seasons/functional zones. In spring, the CW was largely affected by organic matters. In summer, the CW was contaminated chiefly by nutrient pollutants (N and P), particularly in the CVW and POP. In autumn, the major threat became eutrophication. Enhancing water circulation and shortening hydraulic retention time can effectively weaken the effect of nutrient salts and organic pollutants.

Hydroacoustic assessment of young-of-year perch, Perca fluviatilis, population dynamics in an oligotrophic lake (Lake Annecy, France)	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												A cohort of perch, Perca fluviatilis (L.) was monitored from hatching to first winter in the oligotrophic Lake Annecy, France, by combining hydroacoustic and direct capture methods (fish plankton net and pelagic trawl). The total stock of pelagic fish increased by a factor of 10 during the season, reaching a maximum in August and decreasing in autumn. Juvenile perch were mainly pelagic, being aggregated into schools in the daytime and dispersed at night. Migration of young-of-year (Y-O-Y) perch to the pelagic zone of Lake Annecy in late spring did not significantly affect zooplankton population abundance. It did, however, result in changes in zooplankton vertical distribution, with Daphnia remaining deeper in the water column. The increase in Y-O-Y biomass during summer was possibly associated with collapse of the Daphnia population by late July, and copepods one month later.					; GUILLARD, Jean/A-2577-2011	Guillard, Jean/0000-0003-0116-1167; Perga, Marie-Elodie/0000-0002-9003-0769													0969-997X					OCT	2006	13	5					319	327		10.1111/j.1365-2400.2006.00508.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2400.2006.00508.x													WOS:000240149300006

Prevailing in the local habitat, indigenous microalgae are more successful for wastewater treatment processes. Integrated microalgae-based biofuel and bioproduct production with wastewater treatment is a successful practice of modern research. This report describes the isolation and identification of 61 microalgal strains from lakes, springs, ponds, creeks, and rivers of the gigantic area of Malakand, Pakistan. Our study involves the seasonal existence of Chlorophyta in the area, with most dominant flora identified in the summer season followed by spring, autumn, and winter seasons, respectively. The highest ratio of microalgae was found in stagnant waters followed by slow-running water and running water, respectively. However, algal species were reported from all water bodies throughout the year. Commercially important genera like Chlorella, Scenedesmus, and Chlamydomonas were also reported, attracting the research area for further analysis regarding biofuel, bioproduct production, and simultaneous wastewater treatment.

Arctic organic aerosol measurements show particles from mixed combustion in spring haze and from frost flowers in winter	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Submicron atmospheric aerosol particles were collected between 1 March 2008 and 1 March 2009 at Barrow, Alaska, to characterize the organic mass (OM) in the Arctic aerosol. Organic functional group concentrations and trace metals were measured with FTIR on submicron particles collected on Teflon filters. The OM varied from 0.07 mu g m(-3) in summer to 0.43 mu g m(-3) in winter, and 0.35 mu g m(-3) in spring, showing a transition in OM composition between spring and winter. Most of the OM in spring could be attributed to anthropogenic sources, consisting primarily of alkane and carboxylic acid functional groups and correlated to elemental tracers of industrial pollution, biomass burning, and shipping emissions. PMF analysis associated OM with two factors, a Mixed Combustion factor (MCF) and an Ocean-derived factor (ODF). Back trajectory analysis revealed that the highest fractions of the MCF were associated with air masses that had originated from northeastern Asia and the shipping lanes south of the Bering Straits. The ODF consisted of organic hydroxyl groups and correlated with organic and inorganic seawater components. The ODF accounted for more than 55% of OM in winter when the sampled air masses originated along the coastal and lake regions of the Northwest Territories of Canada. Frost flowers with organic-salt coatings that arise by brine rejection during sea ice formation may account for this large source of carbohydrate-like OM during the ice-covered winter season. While the anthropogenic sources contributed more than 0.3 mu g m(-3) of the springtime haze OM, ocean-derived particles provided comparable OM sources in winter. Citation: Shaw, P. M., L. M.

J	ASSEL, RA				ASSEL, RA			FALL AND WINTER THERMAL STRUCTURE OF LAKE-SUPERIOR	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Temperature surveys were made along the normal upbound (westward) and downbound (eastward) shipping lanes across Lake Superior to document fall and winter thermal structure of that lake. This work was done as part of the Congressionally-funded Demonstration Program to Extend the Navigation Season on the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Seaway. Surveys were made aboard ore carriers using a portable bathythermograph (BT) system and expendable BT probes. Surveys usually took 2 to 4 days to complete. Twenty-one surveys were made during the winters of 1973 to 1976 and 25 surveys were made during the falls of 1976 to 1979. Mean seasonal temperature trends identified from these data include: (1) approximately exponential increase in fall mixed layer depth through early to mid-November, (2) maximum value of average mixed layer and upper 25-m layer temperatures between the end of August and mid-September, (3) maximum value of average water column temperature in late September, (4) isothermal conditions between mid-November and mid-December, (5) completion of fall overturn in December and winter restratification in December or January depending primarily upon winds, (6) average winter [January to March] monthly mixed layer depth between 60 m and 100 m and, (7) minimum value of average water column temperature in late March. Midlake and nearshore thermal regimes were identified. These thermal regimes show agreement in trend with lake bathymetry, wind fetch, and lake circulation patterns. Deeper areas with longer wind fetch in both thermal regimes have the deepest mixed layers during winter. Areas having the combination of greater depth and larger wind fetch, midlake areas in most cases, also tend to have higher column temperatures and ice cover of short duration in winter and lower column temperatures in summer relative to adjacent areas.																			0380-1330						1986	12	4					251	262		10.1016/S0380-1330(86)71725-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(86)71725-5													WOS:A1986F591200003

The RCM applied is the Rossby Centre regional climate model RCA3.5. A simulation where all lakes in the model domain are replaced by land surface is compared with a simulation where the effect of lakes is accounted for through the use of the lake model FLake coupled to RCA. The difference in 2m open-land air temperature between the two simulations shows that lakes induce a warming on the European climate for all seasons. The greatest impact is seen during autumn and winter over southern Finland and western Russia where the warming exceeds 1 C. Locally, e.g. over southern Finland and over Lake Ladoga, the convective precipitation is enhanced by 20%-40% during late summer and early autumn while it is reduced by more than 70% over Lake Ladoga during early summer.

Picophytoplankton (picocyanobacteria and picoeukaryotes) communities in Lake Kinneret were studied from 1988 to 1992. No prochlorophytes were observed in the lake. 2. Picocyanobacteria were a prominent and ubiquitous component of the phytoplankton, being present at all depths throughout the year, with concentrations ranging from 2 X 10-8 x 10(5) cells ml(-1). Low cell numbers in winter and spring were followed at the end of the annual dinoflagellate bloom by maximal abundances in summer-autumn in the epilimnion. High cell numbers (> 10(4) cells ml(-1)) were sometimes also found in the anaerobic hypolimnion. Net growth rates for picocyanobacteria ranged from 0.29 to 0.60 divisions day(-1). 3. Picoeukaryotes were a very minor constituent of the picoplankton, mostly present in winter and spring, and sometimes at the end of autumn, with concentrations ranging from 44 to 5700 cells ml(-1). Higher cell numbers tended to occur in the near surface water layers. In August-September, picoeukaryotes were found only in the hypolimnion. In December, the occurrence of picoeukaryotes in the deep water layers probably resulted from advection with cold water currents from the Jordan river. Net growth rates for picoeukaryotes ranged from 0.26 to 0.43 divisions day(-1). 4. Overall, the contribution of picophytoplankton to the phytoplankton standing crop in Lake Kinneret was limited; picocyanobacteria and picoeukaryotes accounted for no more than 7.0 and 0.1% of total algal biomass (semiannual average), respectively. 5. Picophytoplankton cell numbers in pelagic waters were usually similar to those in shallower lake stations. 6. Picocyanobacteria appear to be an autochthonous population, whereas picoeukaryotes are probably brought annually by the Jordan River and do not maintain themselves in the lake.																			0046-5070					OCT	1995	34	2					241	254		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1995.tb00884.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1995.tb00884.x													WOS:A1995TA71400004

Snap beans [Phaseolus vulgaris (L.) ''Bush Blue Lake''], sweet corn [Zea mays] (L.) ''Sundance''], cauliflower [Brassica oleracea (L.), Botrytis group, ''Snow Crown''], summer squash [Cucurbita pepo (L.)

The double-crop systems used were spring snap bean and fall cauliflower, summer squash and fall broccoli, and spring sweet corn and fall snap beans. The monocrop system was used as a control for the double-crop systems. The greatest net returns were: squash monocropped or squash/broccoli double-cropped, squash double-cropped, cauliflower or cauliflower/snap bean double-cropped and broccoli or cauliflower or snap beans monocropped. Fall snap beans provided the least economic return. The double-cropping system allows an option of crop production with a potential increase in yield and economic returns using half the amount of land per year required for either crop grown in monoculture. In addition, these systems reduce the risk of economic failure during a year of low-market demand for either crop grown alone.																			0003-1062	2327-9788					1985	110	3					414	417																WOS:A1985AGB3700026

Seasonal spatial ecology of Lake Trout in Lake Erie	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												ObjectiveLake Trout Salvelinus namaycush are native coldwater apex predators that play an important role in maintaining ecosystem functionality and diversity in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Following population collapses, rehabilitation efforts were widely initiated in the Great Lakes to reestablish self-sustaining Lake Trout populations. Lake Erie may pose a challenge to these rehabilitation efforts due to limited availability of appropriate oxythermal habitat. Our goal was to investigate seasonal habitat use of adult Lake Trout in Lake Erie to inform management and rehabilitation efforts.MethodsWe used acoustic telemetry in Lake Erie, which was equiped with a lake-wide acoustic receiver grid, to quantify Lake Trout seasonal region occupancy, dispersal distances, bottom depth occupancy, space use extent, and space use overlap.ResultWe found that 32% of fish tagged in the eastern basin and all fish from the western basin dispersed more than 100 km from their tagging location, which represents a greater proportion of the population moving long distances than what has been previously documented in the Great Lakes. During stratification, Lake Trout were detected almost exclusively in the offshore eastern basin in areas where water depth exceeded 25 m. During nonstratified seasons, fish used other regions of the lake, occupying areas of highly variable depths. During fall, most fish tagged in the eastern basin occupied habitat along the southern shore of the eastern basin. Fish tagged in the western basin returned to this region in the fall of subsequent years despite occupying the offshore eastern basin during stratification and having depth occupancy, home range size, and overlap similar to that of eastern basin-tagged fish. Fish size was positively correlated with receiver depth during winter and spring, and with home range overlap during spring and summer.ConclusionThe results of this study can begin to inform management decisions regarding stocking locations, harvest regulations, and habitat restoration to facilitate the continued rehabilitation of this important native species. This study provides the first description of lakewide, year-round spatial ecology of Lake Trout in the Great Lakes. We found that Lake Trout in Lake Erie were restricted to offshore areas of the eastern basin during summer and congregated along the southern shore of the eastern basin during fall, but they dispersed widely during spring.Impact statement					Vandergoot, Christopher/JAO-1190-2023; Brenden, Travis/B-2186-2012; Murray, Charles/T-7847-2019	Funnell, Tyler/0000-0002-9074-3531; Kraus, Richard/0000-0003-4494-1841													0002-8487	1548-8659				SEP	2023	152	5					672	693		10.1002/tafs.10430	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tafs.10430		SEP 2023											WOS:001108796200001

Planktonic Cladocera dominated the abundant summertime community whilst during the late autumn and early spring the low density community was dominated by copepods. Non-planktonic cladocerans formed only a small component of the community encountered in mid-water. Young roach (40-65 mm) fed predominantly on microcrustaceans. Their diet was assessed on 25 occasions through the four year period. During late spring and summer, diet was dominated by planktonic cladocerans, whereas during the remainder of the year non-planktonic Cladocera were the most important group. The relationship between relative contribution to the diet of planktonic Cladocera and their abundance in the lake is sigmoidal. The switch between a diet principally of planktonic to one principally of non-planktonic cladocerans occurred as density of the former fell below approximately 40 individuals per litre. We propose that this field example of ''switching'' arises as a result of a change by the predators from feeding in mid-water to feeding near and in the bottom sediment.

In a recently constructed (1995) permanent-pool impoundment, MeHg levels typically increased from inflow to outflow during 1997; this trend broke down from late 1998 to early 1999. MeHg levels in the outflow reached seasonal maxima in mid-summer (maximum of 1.0 ng L-1 in July 1997) and late-winter (maximum of 6.6 ng L-1 in February 1999), and are comparable to high levels observed in new hydroelectric reservoirs in Canada. Spring and autumn MeHg levels were typically about 0.1-0.2 ng L-1. Overall, MeHg levels in both the inflow (a ditch that drains peatlands) and outflow were significantly higher than in three nearby reference natural lakes. Eleven older permanent-pool impoundments and six natural lakes in northwestern Minnesota were sampled five times. The impoundments typically had higher MeHg levels (0.071-8.36 ng L-1) than natural lakes. Five of six lakes MeHg levels typical of uncontaminated lakes (0.014-1.04 ng L-1) with highest levels in late winter, whereas a hypereutrophic lake had high levels (0.37-3.67 ng L-1) with highest levels in mid-summer. Seven temporary-pool impoundments were sampled during summer high-flow events. Temporary-pool impoundments that retained water for about 10-15 days after innundation yielded pronounced increases in MeHg from inflow to outflow, in one case reaching 4.6 ng L-1, which was about 2 ng L-1 greater than the mean inflow concentration during the runoff event.

J	HOLMES, RT				HOLMES, RT			BREEDING ECOLOGY AND ANNUAL CYCLE ADAPTATIONS OF RED-BACKED SANDPIPER (CALIDRIS ALPINA) IN NORTHERN ALASKA	CONDOR												Ecological and behavioral specializations in the annual cycles of sandpipers of the inclusive genus Calidris nesting in the Arctic reveal adaptive adjustments to the environment, particularly to the shortness of the summer. In the comparative study of this general problem, the breeding ecology of Calidris alpina, was investigated in 5 consecutive summers, 1959 to 1963, in northern Alaska; for the nonbreeding phases of the annual cycle, wintering populations in California were observed from 1960 to 1964. At Barrow, Alaska, latitude 71[degree] 20'' N, the arctic summer lasts from early June until late Aug. Red-backs arrive throughout a 2 week period singly, in small flocks, or in formed pairs, depending on local weather conditions. Self-contained territories of 12 to 17 acres are established on upland tundra. Egg-laying is relatively synchronous, most clutches being completed between 12 and 18 June; later clutches mainly represent attempts at renesting following early-season nest loss. Both sexes incubate, the male''s role increasing as hatching approaches. Hatching occurs primarily in early to mid-July, after which the precocial young, accompanied by their parents, move into lowland marshes. Growth of young proceeds rapidly; the immatures fly within 3 weeks of hatching. Survival of young to fledging is relatively high but varies in different seasons, with weather and predation being the major mortality factors. In late July and Aug young red-backs move to coastal or lake-margin habitats, and adults flock to uplands; both depart by late Aug. or early Sept. In fall red-backs apparently stay in the Arctic or sub-Arctic until mid- to late Sept., drifting slowly across the tundra or along the coast. Their arrival in California winter quarters occurs in late Sept. and early Oct., reaching a peak on San Francisco Bay in late Oct. and Nov. Numbers then remain relatively constant until late Jan., after which the population declines. Spring migration probably consists of a gradual northward shift of the wintering population, although this is not well understood. Postnuptial molt of C. alpina is compressed into the short summer at high latitudes, beginning in mid-June concurrently with egg-laying and terminating by mid-Sept. before the species reaches its coastal North Temperate wintering quarters; most other Calidris sandpipers breeding at Barrow molt after the fall migaration. Although food supply in terms of total available biomass is higher in June and Aug. than in midsummer, the number and variety of surface insects required as food by precocial young are maximal in mid-July when young sandpipers are growing most rapidly.																				1938-5129					1966	68	1					3	+		10.2307/1365173	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1365173													WOS:A19668090400001

We therefore studied them with the aim of establishing an analytical model for inland water colour, to be used in remote sensing. Field measurements were carried out on 16 and 17 August 2006 (summer), 5 and 6 November 2006 (winter), and 29 and 30 March 2007 (spring) at 15 stations in northern Lake Taihu (China). Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption coefficients (a CDOM) are higher in summer than in spring and winter, with the ratios of a CDOM in spring, summer and winter being approximately 1:4.0:1.2 at both UV-C and UV-B. The spectral slope S CDOM values change with wavelength and season, and covary with CDOM concentration, as shown by regression analysis. For the CDOM absorption spectrum in the wavelength region 500-700nm (important for water colour remote sensing), a linear method simulates better than an exponential method. Seasonal variations in non-algal particulate (NAP) absorption (a NAP) at blue, green and red wavelengths show better consistency, in the order winterspringsummer. The average S NAP is 0.0065 +/- 0.0009nm-1, which is lower than that in other types of waters. Phytoplankton absorption (a ph) peak height changes with the season, with the pattern summerwinterspring, and phytoplankton absorption spectra can be expressed with high accuracy by a quadratic model. CDOM absorption contributions in the three seasons are low compared to phytoplankton and NAP.					huang, Changchun/E-6580-2016; Wang, Lizhen/JXL-5347-2024; Le, Chengfeng/A-2584-2013; huang, changchun/E-6580-2016	huang, changchun/0000-0002-9833-5663; huang, changchun/0000-0002-4704-548X													0143-1161	1366-5901					2009	30	13					3549	3571	PII 913310715	10.1080/01431160802581958	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431160802581958													WOS:000268277600015
J	Kalinowska, K; Karpowicz, M				Kalinowska, Krystyna; Karpowicz, Maciej			Ice-on and ice-off dynamics of ciliates and metazooplankton in the Luczanski Canal (Poland)	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												The ciliate-metazooplankton trophic coupling is well documented from both laboratory and field experiments. The knowledge about these relationships during winter ice-covered periods is very scarce. The abundance and composition of planktonic ciliates, rotifers and crustaceans were studied during the ice-covered and ice-free periods in the Luczanski Canal (Masurian Lakeland, Poland). We hypothesised that in winter, rotifers play a major role in the top-down control of ciliates and that ciliate-metazooplankton relationships differ not only between the ice-covered and ice-free periods, but also between ice-covered months. Our study showed that ciliates formed a significant part of zooplankton biomass during the winter ice-covered period when crustaceans occurred in very low abundances. Despite cold water temperature and the presence of ice cover, time was probably a cue that initiates zooplankton development. The ciliate, rotifer and crustacean numbers and biomass, as well as chlorophyllaconcentrations, were lower in February than in ice-free periods. In the winter month with ice cover, bottom-up control by resources was more important than top-down control by zooplankton grazing in regulating ciliates. In the spring month with ice cover, crustaceans and rotifers may include ciliates as an important part of their diets. In April, the studied groups of organisms were not related to each other in contrast to the summer, when zooplankton communities were closely related to each other. In autumn, rotifers may play an important role in controlling ciliates. The abundance, composition and ciliate-metazoan relationships can vary considerably not only across seasons, but also across ice-covered months.

The facet pattern of the dorsal plate is similar to that of the common North American phenotype of Keratella cochlearis and K. taurocephala. The rigid, thickened lorica, long recurving posterior spine, and constriction of the body near the base of the anterior spines is distinctive from known congenors. The species was abundant (> 300 individuals/L) within a well-defined habitat, and appears to have a narrow geographic range. Keratella armadura occurred in spring and summer months and was absent from fall and winter collections. This restricted distribution, if common among rotifers, suggests that many undescribed species still exist in Michigan and in North America.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				NOV	1990	68	11					2306	2309		10.1139/z90-322	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z90-322													WOS:A1990EH96300012

Radiotransmitters were surgically implanted into 20-22 fish of each species in September and October 2006. Movements of all four species in autumn and winter were short with most fish remaining <= 2 km from locations where they were captured initially. Bluehead suckers and flannelmouth suckers began movements downstream in mid-to-late April and returned upstream to locations <= 2 km from their original locations by early summer. White stickers did not make substantial movements during spring, whereas longnose suckers made movements upstream during mid-June and returned downstream by early July. During their estimated spawning periods, longnose suckers used upstream portions, bluehead suckers and white suckers used middle portions, and flannelmouth suckers used downstream portions of the study area.																			0038-4909	1943-6262				SEP	2010	55	3					382	389		10.1894/CMT-01.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1894/CMT-01.1													WOS:000282111400008
J	Blais, EL; Greshuk, J; Stadnyk, T				Blais, Eric-Lorne; Greshuk, Jeremy; Stadnyk, Tricia			The 2011 flood event in the Assiniboine River Basin: causes, assessment and damages	CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL												In spring and summer of 2011, the Assiniboine River and its tributaries underwent a flood of unprecedented proportions. It was, by several measures, including the computed return period and duration of flooding, a more extreme event than the 1997 Red River "Flood of the Century," and may have been the most severe flood experienced in the history of Canada. The 2011 flood was the largest recorded in the over 100 years that flow records have been kept on the Assiniboine River. As reported in the 2013 Manitoba 2011 Flood Review Task Force Report, antecedent conditions, winter snowpack and summer rains combined to produce one of the largest floods ever experienced in Manitoba. The spring of 2011 was preceded by a very wet fall in 2010 when precipitation averaged between 150 and 200% of normal over a wide area in Manitoba and Saskatchewan This produced extremely high regional antecedent moisture conditions whereby soil moisture levels were 100 to 250% of the long-term average. Added to this, the winter snowpack was relatively high, varying geographically in the range of 90 to 130% of normal snow water content and lower-than-normal winter temperatures, causing significant frost penetration. The combination of high soil moisture in the previous summer/fall and deep frost penetration reduced the soil's ability to absorb spring meltwater and increased runoff volumes contributing to the magnitude of the spring peak. The severe winter was followed by a series of rainfall events that resulted in unprecedented rainfall volumes in the region throughout the months of May, June and July, when some areas received rainfall amounts that were 350% of normal and produced up to two additional flood peaks at some locations. Flooding on the Assiniboine River near Brandon lasted for 120 days. Large volumes of floodwater were diverted to Lake Manitoba due to the use of the Portage Diversion to mitigate flooding downstream of the City of Portage La Prairie. This large volume of inflow resulted in a wind-effect-eliminated Lake Manitoba level that peaked at 249.1 m in late July of 2011, which was close to 1 m higher than flood stage and almost 1.5 m higher than the top of the desirable range. Peak outflow from Lake Manitoba into the Fairford River was almost double historic maxima and resulted in Lake St. Martin levels that peaked in July of 2011 at 245.55 m, which was more than 0.6 m higher than the historic peak that occurred under natural conditions in 1955, and 1.4 m above flood stage. The damage estimate for this flood event has not been finalized but is likely in excess of CAD $1 billion. The majority of flood damages were incurred by communities and infrastructure along major tributaries like the Souris and Qu'Appelle Rivers, and the communities on Lake Manitoba and Lake St. Martin. The Lake St. Martin First Nations community was virtually destroyed, and as of 2014 some First Nations people from the communities along Lake St. Martin are still evacuated and waiting for their homes and communities to be rebuilt. Temporary flood control works were largely effective in preventing infrastructure damage to communities along the Assiniboine River, such as Brandon, although the agricultural damage and damage to individual properties were extensive.

J	Karsten, HD; Fick, GW				Karsten, HD; Fick, GW			White clover growth patterns during the grazing season in a rotationally grazed dairy pasture in New York	GRASS AND FORAGE SCIENCE												White clover (Trifolium repens L.) is an important stoloniferous pasture legume in the Great Lakes region of the United States, but it often has limited persistence. Researchers in New Zealand and Wales have found that in spring, compared with other seasons, white clover plants have reduced branching complexity and have the fewest buds that produce leaves. They therefore suggested that in spring the plants are most vulnerable to grazing and climatic stress. Because of severe winter and cool, wet spring weather in New York State, it was hypothesized that white clover plants would also be of low branching complexity, smaller and have low axillary bud activity in spring compared with later in the grazing season. To test this, growth of white clover was monitored in an orchard grass (Dactylis glomerata L.)/white clover pasture in New York that was rotationally grazed with dairy cows during the 1993 and 1994 grazing seasons. Three sets of plants were sampled. The first set consisted of forty random plants sampled before each grazing event. Stolen branching order, number of each stolen branching type and area the plant occupied were determined. Approximately each month before one gazing event, a separate set of 32 random plants was measured in the field to determine the area they occupied: these plants were then removed to the laboratory for the measurement of stolen order, number of each stolen type, stolen lengths, total number of growing points, number of taproots and adventitious roots, root position and above-ground dry matter. Once a month, 12 additional plants were removed to measure axillary bud activity at each node. Leaf development from nodes tended to increase from spring to summer. However, the stolen branching order of white clover plants was not simpler in spring compared with summer or autumn. In 1994 during and after a dry and hot period, white clover plants were smaller, of lower stolen branching order and had fewer roots. Climate and associated soil organism activity appear to explain the different white clover growth patterns observed in New York and New Zealand. Severe winters in New York limit earthworm activity and stolen burial, which is important in contributing to stolon/plant breakdown in New Zealand. During the years of this study in New York, a hot and dry period had the most negative effect on the growth pattern of white clover.																			0142-5242					JUN	1999	54	2					174	183		10.1046/j.1365-2494.1999.00165.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2494.1999.00165.x													WOS:000081364100009

Seasonal depth and temperature use, and diel movements of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) in a subarctic lake	ARCTIC SCIENCE												We conducted a multi-year acoustic telemetry study of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush (Walbaum, 1792)) in a small subarctic lake to investigate depth and temperature occupancy, and vertical activity across seasons (summer, fall, and winter), diel periods (day, twilight, and night), and during summer periods of 24 h light (day and twilight). Analyses using generalized additive mixed models revealed a high degree of individual variation in depth occupancy independent of the factors hour of day, season, and diel period, whereas temperature occupancy and vertical activity were explained using the three combined factors. Habitats occupied were typically 9-20 m and 6-9.5 degrees C in summer, 1-3 m and 2-15 degrees C in fall during presumed spawning, and <= 6 m and <3 degrees C in winter. Lake trout exhibited partial diel migration where individuals displayed a variety of vertical migratory directions within and among seasons or diel period, including during periods of 24 h light. Fish were most vertically active during periods of daylight and in fall. During 24 h light, some lake trout performed crepuscular movements, whereas individual behaviour best explained modelled depth and temperature occupancy and vertical activity. The variety of vertical patterns among individuals and seasons suggests multifactor proximate causes of partial diel migration and crepuscular movements.																				2368-7460				JUN	2019	5	2					71	89		10.1139/as-2017-0003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/as-2017-0003													WOS:000474784800001

Throughout the sampling period, species from 2-16 .mu.m (GALD) dominated the phytoplankton community. Small phytoplankters (2-8 .mu.m) were predominant in winter and early spring populations while algae of 8-16 .mu.m became important in summer (phytoplankton < 2 .mu.m was not counted). Principal coordinate analysis resulted in a cyclic pattern of dates in the reduced space, winter and early spring samples being well separated from the other dates. In multiple linear regressions between environmental parameters and size classes, temperature was always the most important variable.

J	Wegener, C; Ibebuchi, CC				Wegener, Caitlin; Ibebuchi, Chibuike Chiedozie			Application of XGBoost in Disentangling the Fingerprints of Global Warming and Decadal Climate Modes on Seasonal Precipitation Trends in Ohio	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Global warming (GW) is a defining challenge of the 21st century, driving notable changes in weather patterns. Simultaneously, multi-decadal climate modes, including the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), and the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO), shape decadal climate patterns and interact to influence regional climates. This study employs the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) gain-based feature importance metric to disentangle and rank the contributions of GW and these climate modes to seasonal precipitation changes in Ohio, US, a region known for its variable weather. Monthly precipitation data from 55 weather stations spanning 1960-2023 were analysed using Theil-Sen's Slope method, with statistical significance assessed at the 95% confidence level. Results revealed statistically significant increases in precipitation in winter (3.81 mm/decade) and summer (3.30 mm/decade), with no statistically significant changes in spring and autumn. For winter precipitation, 98% of stations exhibit a statistically significant negative correlation with PDO, while 51% show a significant positive correlation with GW; significant correlations with AMO and IPO are observed in fewer than 41% of stations. Analysing feature importance with XGBoost indicates that the GW signal ranks highest in 32.7% of stations-including the northeastern regions affected by lake-effect snow. In contrast, PDO dominates 58.2% of stations, and AMO in 9.1%. These findings highlight that Ohio's winters are becoming wetter and suggest that, among the variables we analysed, the net effects of PDO, followed by GW, are the strongest predictors of winter precipitation changes in Ohio.

A total of 46 A. manyasensis were examined for the presence of the helminth. The helminth was identified as Paradiplozoon homoion (Monogenea: Diplozoidae) and occurred on the gills of host fish. A total of 115 specimens of P. homoion infected 32 of 46 fish examined, with prevalence and mean intensity of infection of 69.57% (41.67% in Summer to 90.00% in Winter) and 3.59 (1.00 in Summer to 6.22 in Winter) respectively.

The highest values for prevalence and intensity of infection were found in winter for P. homoion. To our knowledge, this is the first ichthyoparasitological study for A. manyasensis in Turkey. This is also the first record of P. homoion from this host fish and locality.

In this study, we assessed the frequency of surface cyanobacterial blooms, in response to wind wave in Lake Taihu, China, based on high-frequency hourly GOCI images and long-term meteorological, hydrological and ecological environment records from 2011 to 2020. Results showed marked monthly and seasonal variabilities of cyanobacterial blooms frequency with two peaks in summer and autumn. Spatially, the prevailing wind directions from summer to winter, shifting from southeast to northwest winds, promoted the downwind horizontal drift and accumulation of surface cyanobacterial blooms from northwest to southwest in Lake Taihu. Moreover, we found significantly negative correlations between wind wave and cyanobacterial bloom frequency, particularly during the cyanobacterial bloom growth season from April to November. Further analysis revealed the determining role of wind wave in controlling cyanobacterial bloom dynamics in Lake Taihu, with contributions of 62.12% and 57.63% in spring and summer, respectively. Our findings offer an important scientific insight for the effective collection of harmful blooms in inland freshwater lakes under both nutrient management and climate change scenarios.

Mercury emission from a temperate lake during autumn turnover	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Lakes in temperate regions stratify during summer and winter months, creating distinct layers of water differentiated by their physical and chemical characteristics. When lakes mix in autumn and spring, mercury cycling may be affected by the chemical changes that occur during mixing. Sampling was conducted in Lake Lacawac, Eastern Pennsylvania, USA, throughout the autumn of 2007 to characterize changes in emission of gaseous elemental mercury (He) from the lake surface and dissolved mercury profiles in the water column during mixing. Water chemistry and weather parameters were also measured, including dissolved organic carbon (DOC), iron, and solar radiation which have been shown to interact with mercury species. Results indicate that emission of He from the lake to the atmosphere during turnover was controlled both by solar radiation and by surface water mercury concentration. As autumn turnover progressed through the months of October and November, higher mercury concentration water from the hypolimnion mixed with epilimnetic water, increasing mercury concentration in epilimnetic waters. Dissolved absorbance was significantly correlated with mercury concentrations and with iron, but DOC concentrations were essentially constant throughout the study period and did not exhibit a relationship with either dissolved mercury concentrations or emission rates. Positive correlations between dissolved mercury and iron and manganese also suggest a role for these elements in mercury transport within the lake, but iron and manganese did not demonstrate a relationship with emission rates. This research indicates that consideration of seasonal processes in lakes is important when evaluating mercury cycling in aquatic systems. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Organochlorine pollutants and stable isotopes in resident and migrant passerine birds from northwest Michoacan, Mexico	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												Although concentrations of organochlorine compounds (OCs) in birds from most of the United States and Canada have decreased over the last 30 years, there is still concern that migrant birds might be exposed to elevated concentrations of OCs during migration in Latin America. The Lerma-Chapala Basin in west-central Mexico is an important migration corridor and wintering area for many species. The objectives of this study were to assess if resident and migrant birds wintering in western Michoacan, Mexico accumulated elevated concentrations of OCs during fall and spring and to determine if the stable isotopes delta N-15, delta C-13, and delta D could be used to predict burdens and origins of DDE accumulation. Resident and migrant passerine insectivorous birds were collected during fall and spring (2001-2002) in northwest Michoacan, near Chapala Lake, Mexico. The carcasses were analyzed for OCs and tail feathers were analyzed for stable isotopes delta N-15, delta C-13, and delta D. The OCs detected in more than 50% of the samples were: oxychlordane (79%), p,p'-DDE (100%), p,p'-DDT (57%), and total PCBs (100%). p,p'-DDE was the OC detected at the highest concentrations, whereas residues of other OCs were near or below detection limits. Overall, there were no significant differences in concentrations of OCs between seasons or between resident and migrant birds. Concentrations of DDE and oxychlordane were somewhat higher in migrant and resident birds during spring than in fall; however, concentrations were significantly different only for oxychlordane. Two resident birds collected in fall and spring had DDE residues > 10 mu g/g wet weight in carcass. There were no significant differences in delta C-13 and delta N-15 values among species, between seasons, or between migrant and resident birds. However, delta D values were clearly different between species and helped differentiate migrant from resident birds. delta D values also were negatively and significantly correlated with DDE concentrations in carcass. Birds with more depleted delta D values in feathers tended to have higher DDE concentrations than those with less depleted delta D values, suggesting a potential latitudinal accumulation of DDE. Overall, our results suggest that during fall and spring, there is not a significant buildup of persistent OCs in migrant and resident passerine insectivorous birds in northwest Michoacan, Mexico.

Release experiments were conducted under a matrix of redox and pH conditions to investigate the importance of Ca- and Fe-related physicochemistry on sediment cores collected seasonally, i.e., during the spring, summer, fall, and winter periods. Strong seasonal variation in P release was observed, with rates ranging from similar to 3 to 38 mg P.m(-2).day(-1). This variation is attributed to changes in redox status and P concentration gradients at the sediment-water interface. An oxidized microlayer at the sediment-water interface partially inhibits sediment P release under isothermal, well-mixed conditions in the spring and fall. Phosphorus trapped in the oxic microlayer (sorption) is freed when the microlayer is chemically reduced at the onset of anoxia and high P release rates are observed. The oxidized microlayer serves to regulate seasonality in rates of sediment P release but does not influence long-term sediment-water exchange. It is proposed that the long-term P release process is best represented by a time-weighted annual average rate, calculated here to be similar to 10 mg P.m(-2).day(-1).

Attendant [H2CO3*]([H2CO3] + [CO2(aq)]) and CaCO3 equilibrium conditions were determined through application of equilibrium equations adjusted for appropriate temperatures and ionic strength. A seasonal cycle was demonstrated for the inorganic C species which was temporally correlated to the lake''s thermal and productivity cycles. Vertical homogeneity in CO3 chemistry was evident during turnover periods while dramatic differences developed between the epilimnion and hypolimnion during winter and summer stratification. The lake was supersaturated throughout the year with H2CO3*, although saturation was approached during the productive summer months in the epilimnion. The epilimnion was supersaturated with respect to CaCO3 from the start of spring turnover to the end of autumn turnover. Ca2+ levels within the epilimnion decreased through much of the same period. Dissolution of CaCO3 in the hypolimnion is indicated by increases in Ca2+ and alkalinity as stratification periods progress. Analysis of potentially influencing factors indicates that the seasonal trends are mostly a result of CO2 metabolism. This was further supported by concurrent algal biomass and 14C uptake.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1982	12	2					139	147		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1982.tb00609.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1982.tb00609.x													WOS:A1982NG74200003
J	Yesilbudak, B				Yesilbudak, Burcu			Summer Season is More Challenging for the Fish Clarias gariepinus in a Reservoir from Turkey	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												Fish have a very important place in biological monitoring studies due to the fact that they are periodic reflectors of environmental changes. In this study, we evaluated the effects of seasonality on the growth indices and antioxidant enzymes of the catfish Clarias gariepinus (Burchell, 1822) living in Aslantas reservoir located within the borders of Karatepe National Park in cukurova Delta. For this purpose, the morphological characteristics of 118 C. gariepinus specimens were investigated seasonally. The total length-weight relationship (LWR), Fulton's condition factor (K), hepatosomatic index (HSI), and gonadosomatic index (GSI) of fish were utilized in this study. Total protein and enzymatic antioxidant [superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT)] activities in muscle, liver and gill tissues were determined seasonally by spectrophotometric methods. The minimum-maximum length and weight of the fish during the year were found to be 18.00-85.00 cm and 160.700-900.90 g in the winter-summer seasons. Growth characteristics of fish showed positive allometry in the spring and the summer (b = 3.69, b = 3.12), while negative allometry was found in the winter and fall seasons (b = 2.49, b = 2.51). The highest decrease in the changes of K and GSI values were found in the summer season (22.57%, 47.21%; p < 0.05), while a relative increase in the change of HSI was observed in this season (13.24%, p > 0.05). The highest decrease in total protein of muscle and liver tissues were determined in the summer season, whereas the same situation was observed for SOD and CAT activities in the winter (p < 0.05). The fish somatic indices, total length-weight relationship parameters and biochemical results will provide data in deciding whether the development of fish is at appropriate values, which will lead to effective use of the data for various works such as sustainable fish stock studies.																			1995-0829	1995-0837				OCT	2022	15	5					624	631		10.1134/S1995082922050054	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1995082922050054		JUL 2022											WOS:000832798600005
J	Özdemir, K				Ozdemir, Kadir			The use of carbon nanomaterials for removing natural organic matter in drinking water sources by a combined coagulation process	NANOMATERIALS AND NANOTECHNOLOGY												Carbon nanomaterials are effective adsorbents for water treatment. This study examines natural organic matter (NOM) removal from drinking water with combined coagulation processes using single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Conventional coagulation using aluminum sulfate (alum) and ferric chloride (FeCl3) was also conducted using Ulutan Lake water (ULW) samples collected in four seasons. The removal was characterized by ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (UV254) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The proposed process was more effective than using alum and FeCl3. The highest removal occurred for FeCl3 with SWCNTs in winter (94.13% DOC and 96.14% UV254). In spring and fall, DOC (90% and 84.63%) and UV254 (95.87% and 88.8%) removal was highest when using FeCl3 with MWCNTs. The DOC removal was lowest in summer (67-71% for alum and 72-79% for FeCl3). Summer UV254 removal was similar to DOC removal for combined coagulation. Hydrophobic NOM in winter ULW samples is more easily removed by SWCNTs than by MWCNTs, while MWCNTs were more effective in other seasons. The results reveal that the proposed process is more effective than the conventional coagulants alone in different seasons.																			1847-9804					SEP 30	2016	6									10.1177/1847980416663680	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1847980416663680													WOS:000394816100001

While this seasonal pattern is commonly explained by an evolution of the subglacial drainage system from an inefficient distributed to efficient channelized configuration, mounting evidence indicates that subglacial channels are unable to explain important aspects of hydrodynamic coupling in late summer and fall. Here we use numerical models of subglacial drainage and ice flow to show that limited, gradual leakage of water and lowering of water pressure in weakly connected regions of the bed can explain the dominant features in late and post melt season ice dynamics. These results suggest that a third weakly connected drainage component should be included in the conceptual model of subglacial hydrology.

However, due to the complexity and variability of natural changes and human disturbances, it is difficult for multi-year research with yearly sampling frequency to cover accurate changes of phytoplankton and water environment or provide constructive suggestions for managers. Based on monthly monitoring data spanning 2011-2020 in a highly urbanized subtropical lake (Hongze Lake, China), Mann-Kendall test, ANOVA analysis and variation partitioning analysis were used to assess the changes of phytoplankton and water environment, and detect dynamic responses of phytoplankton to environmental changes. Rising water temperature during winter and spring, the decrease in nitrate, and the increase in water flow and turbidity were the main environmental characteristics from 2011 to 2020. The average and maximum abundance of Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta, and Cryptophyta significantly declined, while changes in Cyanobacteria were characterized by an increase of N2-fixing filamentous cyanobacteria and a decrease of non-filamentous cyanobacteria. The rising water temperature during spring may promote the early growth of N2-fixing filamentous cyanobacteria. The decrease in nitrate mainly resulted in the decrease of Chlorophyta and non-filamentous cyanobacteria, and the increase of N2-fixing filamentous cyanobacteria during summer and autumn. The increase of turbidity and water flow inhibited the growth of Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta, Cryptophyta, and non-filamentous cyanobacteria, but created favourable conditions for the growth of N2-fixing filamentous cyanobacteria. In summer and autumn, managers should focus on the proliferation of N2-fixing filamentous cyanobacteria when precipitation increase, nitrogen nutrients decrease, and non-filamentous cyanobacteria risk under opposite conditions. These findings greatly improved our understanding of the dynamic response of phytoplankton communities to natural changes and anthropogenic disturbances in the urbanized subtropical lakes, and can be used to develop lake management strategies.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				JUN 25	2023	879								162985	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.162985	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.162985		MAR 2023						36958549					WOS:000968321900001

For 13 years the response of the plankton and fish community to a decline in external phosphorus loading was studied in eight lakes with a mean depth < 5 m. We conducted chi-square analyses of sign of slope (positive or negative) of bimonthly averages of plankton variables for the eight lakes versus time. For fish, we compared results from two periods, i.e. 1989-1994 versus 1994-2001 as less data were available. 2. Fish community structure tended to respond to the lowered concentration of total phosphorus (TP), although not all changes were significant. While catch per unit effort (multi-mesh sized gill nets) of cyprinids (especially bream, Abramis brama and roach, Rutilus rutilus) was highest in the first 5-year period, the quantitative importance particularly of perch (Perca fluviatilis), pike (Esox lucius) and rudd (Scardinius erythropthalmus), a littoral species, increased significantly after 1994. 3. No changes occurred in zooplankton biomass, except for an increase in November and December. Biomass of small cladocerans, however, declined during summer and autumn, and the proportion of Daphnia to cladoceran biomass also increased. Average body weight of Daphnia and that of all cladocerans increased. The proportion of calanoids among copepods decreased in summer and the average body weight of cyclopoids and calanoids decreased during summer and autumn/early winter. 4. Total biovolume of phytoplankton declined significantly in March to June and tended to decline in November and December as well, while no significant changes were observed during summer and autumn. Non-heterocystous cyanobacteria showed a decreasing trend during summer and autumn, while heterocystous cyanobacteria increased significantly in late summer. An increase in late summer was also evident for cryptophytes and chrysophytes, while diatoms tended to decline during most seasons. 5. We conclude that phytoplankton, and probably also fish, responded rapidly to reduced loading, whereas the effect on zooplankton was less pronounced. However, increases in body weight of cladocerans and the zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratio during summer indicate reduced top-down control on zooplankton and enhanced grazing on phytoplankton. This conclusion is supported by a tendency for fish biomass to decline and a shift towards greater dominance by piscivores and, thus, an increased likelihood of predator control of zooplanktivorous cyprinids.

D.; Bergstrom, Ann-Kristin; Sponseller, Ryan A.; Berggren, Martin			Seasonal patterns in nutrient bioavailability in boreal headwater streams	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Changes in nutrient bioavailability due to increased loading of dissolved organic matter (DOM) may impact boreal freshwaters. Yet, the relative bioavailability of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) associated with terrestrial DOM remains poorly understood. We applied short-term bioassays with natural bacterial inocula to determine seasonal variation in bioavailable organic nutrient pools from four boreal headwater streams in northern Sweden. Experiments were designed to exhaust bioavailable nutrients associated with DOM by inducing limiting conditions when all required resources except for the targeted nutrient (C, N, or P) are provided in excess. We hypothesized that the supply of different bioavailable nutrients to streams would reflect seasonal variations in terrestrial demand, hydrology, and temperature. The delivery of bioavailable DOM-associated resources from the four streams were, on average, 2%, 11%, and 38% of the total dissolved organic C, N, and P, respectively, emphasizing the relatively low C bioavailability in these DOM-rich waters. Bioavailable N : P ratios peaked in autumn for all sites, with lower values in winter and spring. Both in terms of relative (% of total) and absolute bioavailable organic nutrient concentrations, the seasonal pattern was characterized by systematically high values for the autumn period. Furthermore, links between bioavailable resources and temperature and hydrology varied across sites, time periods, and the different elements. Thus, elevated concentrations of bioavailable organic resources in autumn suggest the potential for leaf fall, as well as late season storms that rewet dry soils, to serve as considerable sources of C, N, and P to boreal aquatic ecosystems.

Seasonal variations in SO42- concentrations and their isotopic compositions in lake water as well as in the tributaries were investigated in this study. The results showed that sulfate concentrations in river water range from 0.94 to 6.52 mmol/L and their delta S-34 values range from - 14.9% and 0.9%, while lake water has sulfate concentrations ranging from 1.91 to 2.79 mmol/L, and delta S-34 values from - 9.8% to - 5.9%. It is suggested that coal mining drainage is the major source of SO42- in the Aha Lake. Rainfall, sewage discharge, sulfide oxidation and gypsum dissolution have made only limited contributions. Different depth- dependent distributions of dissolved SO42- and delta S-34 were developed for both DB and LJK in summer and winter. Due to water overturn, delta S-34 values display homogenous vertical distributions in winter and spring. While in summer and autumn, significant positive shifts of delta S-34 were clearly observed in epilimnion and bottom strata as a result of water stratification.

Dissimilatory sulfate reduction by bacteria was thought to be responsible for the increase of delta S-34 value in hypolimnion.																			2096-0956	2365-7499				DEC	2011	30	4					444	452		10.1007/s11631-011-0530-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11631-011-0530-6													WOS:000218333300005

Vaughan; Lair, Stephane			Movements of Long-tailed Ducks wintering on Lake Ontario to breeding areas in Nunavut, Canada	WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												We used implanted satellite transmitters to track the northbound (spring) and southbound (fall) migration and possible breeding locations of three Long-tailed Ducks (Clangula hyemalis) wintering on western Lake Ontario in Ontario, Canada. The birds exhibited short, rapid migration movements punctuated by extended periods of up to 30 days at staging areas. For much of the nesting period (similar to 10 June to 10 July), the birds remained inland of western Hudson Bay in Nunavut. During fall migration, they circumnavigated Hudson Bay to its eastern coast, opposite the coast they had followed in spring, for a mean travel distance of 6,760 km. Identification of these previously unknown, key migration sites fills some important information gaps on Long-tailed Ducks in eastern Canada, and it augments what is known about important coastal marine habitats in the Arctic.

Habitat and food choice of Arctic charr in Linnevatn on Spitsbergen, Svalbard: the first year-round investigation in a High Arctic lake	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH					International Conference on Conservation and Management of Arctic Charr	JUN 30, 2004	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	Royal Soc Edinburgh, Scottish Nat Heritage & English Nature				Habitat and diet of Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus (L.) were studied by monthly sampling from late autumn to early summer in Linnevatn, Svalbard (78 degrees 3'N, 13 degrees 50'E). This is the first year-round study of a population of charr in the High Arctic, with samples being taken every 5-7 weeks. The ice cover lasted for more than 9 months, from mid-October to late July, with the greatest thickness in mid-May. Although most charr occupied the littoral zone during winter, the highest densities in April and October were found in the deeper areas (20 m) of the lake. The fish fed at all times of the year, but the number of stomachs with food and the stomach-filling indices were lowest during the darkest part of the season. The diet of smaller charr (< 15 cm) varied strongly with season, showing a dominance of zooplankton in late autumn and chironomids in winter (larvae) and summer (pupae). The food choice was in accordance with the density of food items available. Larger fish (>= 15 cm) were mostly cannibalistic during the entire year.

J	Yamamoto, Y				Yamamoto, Yoshimasa			Contribution of bioturbation by the red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii to the recruitment of bloom-forming cyanobacteria from sediment	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The development of cyanobacterial blooms in a small eutrophic pond was monitored along with the potential effect of bioturbation by the red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii discussed as well with respect to the recruitment of cyanobacterial from sediment. Cyanobacterial blooms were observed during the early spring and summer. the spring bloom was dominated by Aphanizomenon flos-aquae. Its population density reached the maximum level in late March, thereafter decreasing rapidly and becoming lower than the detection limit from May. When the water temperature exceeded 20 degrees C in late May, the population density of Microcystis spp. began to increase, and a bloom was formed from July to early August. anabaena spp. also contributed to the formation of the summer bloom. The population densities of both Microcystis spp. and anabaena spp. began to decline in mid August, Crayfish were sampled using baited traps from April to November. No sample was obtained in April, whereas crayfish were captured constantly form May to November. They were distributed widely throughout the pond from June, although a large number of crayfish were captured most effectively at a particular point in the pond. the first captures in late May were dominated by males. The sex ratio of the captures was almost 1:1 from June to September, and fell in favor of females from October. The sex ration reached a minimum (0.2:1) in mid November, when an extremely large number of crayfish were captured at a distinctly warm point. Next, the potential ability of crayfish to promote the recruitment of cyanobacterial from the sediment was examined by performing an incubation experiment. The presence of crayfish in containers of the pond sediment increased the densities of cyanobacteria such as Microcystis spp. and Anabacna spp. However, population densities of cyanobacteria began to decline after the crayfish was removed. Overall, bioturbation by crayfish seemed to be somewhat important in the dynamics of cyanobacterial blooms in the study pond; in addition, their effect varied with sex and season, Males may play an active role in the initiation of the bloom in late spring. Conversely, females may contribute to the extension of bloom in late autumn. Both males and females contribute equally to the maintenance of the bloom from summer to autumn.																			1129-5767	1723-8633					2010	69	1					102	111		10.4081/jlimnol.2010.102	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2010.102													WOS:000275919600010
J	Ward, SM; Neumann, RM				Ward, SM; Neumann, RM			Seasonal and size-related food habits of largemouth bass in two Connecticut lakes	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Stomach contents of 425 largemouth bass were identified and quantified using the Relative Importance (RI) index over three seasons (spring, summer, and fall) from Lake Lillinonah and Pickerel Lake, Connecticut. In Lake Lillinonah during spring, aquatic insects had the highest RI, followed by crayfish and fish (primarily white perch). During summer and fall, the RI of aquatic insects decreased, the RI of crayfish remained consistent, and the RI of fish approximately doubled. Fish (primarily bluegill) was the most important diet item of largemouth bass from Pickerel Lake during all seasons. Aquatic insects were the second most important diet item during spring and summer. In Lake Lillinonah and Pickerel Lake, the RT of aquatic insects decreased and the RI of fish increased with increasing fish length; aquatic insects were most important in largemouth bass less than 300 mm. In contrast to Lake Lillinonah where the RI of crayfish and fish were of equal importance in largemouth bass greater than or equal to 380 mm, largemouth bass greater than or equal to 380 mm in Pickerel Lake fed almost exclusively on fish. Our results suggest that food habits of largemouth depend on the type of lake system and the dominant prey types. In Connecticut lakes that lack suitable littoral areas and associated panfish species, largemouth bass may rely on pelagic fishes and crayfish as food sources.																			0270-5060					JUN	1998	13	2					213	220		10.1080/02705060.1998.9663609	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1998.9663609													WOS:000074003400008

Temporal variations in turbidity in an oil sands pit lake	ENVIRONMENTAL FLUID MECHANICS												We investigated temporal variations in turbidity in Base Mine Lake, an oil sands pit lake, located in northeast Alberta, Canada. The lake has a surface area of 7.8km(2), is 9m deep, and exhibits seasonal thermal stratification similar to that of natural dimictic lakes. Water turbidity was measured continuously throughout the year with moored sensors, supplemented with turbidity profiles and bottle samples, from sites on the lake. During summer there was a gradual exponential (e-folding time of 25days) decrease in epilimnetic turbidity due to relatively steady settling of solids from the epilimnion through the thermocline to the hypolimnion. Rapid oscillations (periods of approximately 1day) in turbidity during summer were due to wind driven internal waves. Convective cooling and wind-shear driven stirring during fall storm events increased the turbidity to an annual high just before ice-on. During these storm events, similarity scaling indicated wind shear imparted greater energy than convective cooling to the turbulence at the base of the water column. Ice suppressed wind forcing and resulted in a rapid decrease in turbidity. The rate of decrease in turbidity following ice-on was initially greater than the rate of decrease in the epilimnion during summer, and then slowed until the under-ice turbidity was a relatively constant value which was sustained during the latter half of the ice-on period. The minimum turbidity during winter was greater than the minimum during summer. Following ice-melt in spring, wind driven stirring increased turbidity until summer stratification began.					; Lawrence, Gregory/C-4798-2014; Tedford, Edmund/JLL-6051-2023	Tedford, Edmund/0000-0001-8367-6329; 													1567-7419	1573-1510				APR	2019	19	2					457	473		10.1007/s10652-018-9632-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10652-018-9632-6								31148952					WOS:000466435400007
J	Depew, D; Smith, R; Guildford, S				Depew, David; Smith, Ralph; Guildford, Stephanie			Production and respiration in Lake Erie plankton communities	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Planktonic community metabolism (photosynthesis and respiration) was assessed in the oligotrophic east basin of Lake Erie, from November 2001 to October 2002 using O-2 and C-14 methods. Areal gross production (AGP; mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1)) exceeded areal respiration (AR; mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1)) in the surface mixed layer for 69% of the observations during the study period. The median AGP:AR for the entire study period was 1.32. A significant positive relationship between AGP and AR existed, but AGP explained only 25% of the variation in AR. AGP:AR varied seasonally, being below 1.0 in the fall/winter of 2001 and in early spring 2002. High (>> 1.0) AGP:AR was observed in late spring (May) and AGP:AR remained > 1.0 for most of the summer stratified period (July-September). AGP:AR was > 1.0 in the fall of 2002, but the magnitude was less than observed during spring. The results supported traditional concepts of the seasonal production and consumption cycles in planktonic communities of large oligotrophic lakes. Parallel incubations of C-14 uptake and gross O-2 production determined with the light and dark bottle method revealed a mean experimental gross photosynthetic quotient (PQ(G)) of 1.29 +/- 0.48, indicating that the C-14 method used here had a variable but, on average, close relationship to gross production as it is commonly measured.

Seasonal periodicity of plankton and benthic fauna community structure and diversity in a small North African reservoir	WATER AND ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL												Aquatic biota in terms of phytoplankton, zooplankton and benthic fauna were qualitatively and quantitatively followed seasonally during 2007 in a North African small reservoir, Aswan Reservoir. Simultaneously, seasonal variations in water quality were investigated in order to determine how far the aquatic biota could be altered by physicochemical and biotic factors. In phytoplankton of the investigated reservoir, 75 species belonging to four systematic groups were recorded, comprising 11 Cyanoprokaryota, 24 Bacillariophyceae, 2 Dinophyceae and 38 Chlorophyceae. Most numerous zooplankton were Rotifera (23 species). Cladocera and Copepoda were less numerous, with only seven and three species, respectively. Early development stages of copepods, nauplii and copepodites were sometimes recorded in considerable numbers. Twenty-two invertebrate species related to five animal groups were exclusively benthic fauna: three Oligochaeta, nine Mollusca, seven larvae of Chironomidae, one Platyhelminthes, one Hirudinea and one Decapoda. Generally, the estimated values of phytoplankton species richness were relatively higher than those of zooplankton or benthic fauna. In particular, phytoplankton was influenced by physicochemical factors - water transparency, salinity and soluble reactive silica contents - as well as biotic factors - zooplankton and benthic fauna. Levels of pH value, Mg+2, NO3-N and chlorophyll-a contents appeared to be the most influential parameters dictating the pattern of seasonal periodicity of benthic fauna. Numerically, the phytoplankton was somewhat more abundant in winter and autumn than in spring or summer. The peak of zooplankton population densities was observed in spring season. Benthic fauna tended to be abundant in summer and autumn seasons, showing a reverse seasonal trend from that of zooplankton. Cyanoprokaryota and Bacillariophyceae were the most important groups that determined the seasonal fluctuation pattern of phytoplankton. Rotifera and Copepoda were the most predominant groups influencing the seasonal periodicity of zooplankton. Oligochaeta and Mollusca alternated the dominancy of benthic fauna community in Aswan Reservoir.																			1747-6585	1747-6593				DEC	2013	27	4					561	574		10.1111/wej.12003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/wej.12003													WOS:000329872800012

Climate-Sensitive Controls on Large Spring Emissions of CH4 and CO2 From Northern Lakes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Northern lakes are important sources of the climate forcing trace gases methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2). A substantial portion of lakes' annual emissions can take place immediately after ice melt in spring. The drivers of these fluxes are neither well constrained nor fully understood. We present a detailed carbon gas budget for three subarctic lakes, using 6 years of eddy covariance and 9 years of manual flux measurements. We combine measurements of temperature, dissolved oxygen, and CH4 stable isotopologues to quantify functional relationships between carbon gas production and conversion, energy inputs, and the redox regime. Spring emissions were regulated by the availability of oxygen in winter, rather than temperature as during ice-free conditions. Under-ice storage increased predictably with ice-cover duration, and CH4 accumulation rates (25 +/- 2 mg CH4-C.m(-2).day(-1)) exceeded summer emissions (19 +/- 1 mg CH4-C.m(-2.)day(-1)). The seasonally ice-covered lakes emitted 26-59% of the annual CH4 flux and 15-30% of the annual CO2 flux at ice-off. Reduced spring emissions were associated with winter snowmelt events, which can transport water downstream and oxygenate the water column. Stable isotopes indicate that 64-96% of accumulated CH4 escaped oxidation, implying that a considerable portion of the dissolved gases produced over winter may evade to the atmosphere.					; Jansen, Joachim/IXN-4782-2023; Friborg, Thomas/E-5433-2015; Crill, Patrick/ABC-1357-2021	Jansen, Joachim/0000-0001-5965-7662; Friborg, Thomas/0000-0001-5633-6097; 													2169-8953	2169-8961				JUL	2019	124	7					2379	2399		10.1029/2019JG005094	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019JG005094													WOS:000481443800039

Aquaculture carp contain almost similar saturated fatty acid (SFA) content (25.95% - spring and 30.77% - autumn) compared to open water carp (25.84% - spring and 31.91% - autumn). Palmitic acid was the major SFA in both aquaculture and open water carp. Regarding monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) content, it is significantly higher in both seasons in aquaculture (63.27% - spring; 59.85% - autumn) compared to open water carp (48.11% - spring; 54.12% - autumn). Oleic acid was identified as the major MUFA. In both seasons, the value of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) is significantly higher in open water (26.17% - spring; 13.97% - autumn) compared to aquaculture carp (10.90% - spring; 9.39% autumn). The most optimal results in terms of nutritional value of fish meat were found in open water carp, in the spring, due to high PUFA content, especially linoleic (n-6), as well as EPA and DHA (n-3) fatty acids. This is the result of diet, because carp consumes phyto and zooplankton from the lake's benthos, which are especially rich in essential fatty acids.

The results showed significantly increasing variations of lake ice breakup dates and nitrate concentrations over Sweden along with increasing winter air temperatures. Variability patterns of other water chemical variables were not affected by warmer winters. Nitrate concentrations increased their variability in spring and early summer not only between lakes but also within lakes, which was attributed to a climate-induced increase in spring nitrate concentrations in particular in southern Sweden, while summer nitrate concentrations remained rather constant and low all over Sweden (median 10 mu g l(-1)). Since nitrate concentrations play an important role for primary production, highly varying concentrations will be a challenge for biota to adapt.

Chla concentration retrieval algorithms were separately established using measured data and remote sensing images (HJ-1 CCD and MODIS data) in October 2010, March 2011, and September 2011. Then parameters of semi-variance were calculated on the scale of 30m, 250m and 500m for analyzing spatial heterogeneity in different seasons. Finally, based on the definitions of Lumped chla (chlaL) and Distributed chla (chlaD), seasonal model of chla concentration scale error was built. The results indicated that: spatial distribution of chla concentration in spring was more uniform. In summer and autumn, chla concentration in the north of the lake such as Meiliang Bay and Zhushan Bay was higher than that in the south of Lake Taihu. Chla concentration on different scales showed the similar structure in the same season, while it had different structure in different seasons. And inversion chla concentration from MODIS 500m had a greater scale error. The spatial scale error changed with seasons. It was higher in summer and autumn than that in spring.

Thus, this study was carried out to know dynamics of epiphytic microalgae and their host macroalgae of Florideophyceae at Jeddah coast, the Red Sea. The water temperature, salinity, pH and dissolved oxygen varied from 21.6 to 32.30 degrees C, 36.40 to 39.70 ppt, 8.04 to 8.60, and 3.00 to 8.90 mg/L, respectively. A total of 10 seaweeds species of Florideophyceae was found, and among them Gracilaria corticata was found throughout the year. Gracilaria tikvahiae and Digenea simplex occurred from spring to autumn, and Acanthophora muscoides occurred from winter to summer. A total of 108 taxa of epiphytes were identified; 95 belong to Bacillariophyceae, 9 Cyanophyceae, 2 Dinophyceae, 1 Chlorophyceae and 1 Raphidophyceae. The epiphytes on A. muscoides varied from 9.50 to 66.10x10(5) cells/100 g of A. muscoides, and the highest cell abundance was in spring. Epiphytic cell abundance on Amphiroa sp., fluctuated from 5.38 to 40.78x10(5) cells/100 g of Amphiroa sp. Similarly, for Digenea simplex, epiphytes varied from 27.56 to 51.69x10(5) cells/100 g of D. simplex. Epiphytic cell abundance on Gracilaria corticata varied from 7.28 to 74.21x10(5) cells/100 g of G. corticata, and the lowest and highest cell abundance were in winter and summer, respectively. Among the microalgae, the contribution of Bacillariophyceae was highest (87.96%), followed by Cyanophyceae (8.33%) and Dinophyceae (1.85%).

While most studies of such systems occur during the Antarctic summer, here we report on ice formation and water column attributes in four meltwater ponds on the McMurdo Ice Shelf during autumn, when they went from ice-free to > 80 cm thickness of ice. Ice thickness grew at an average rate of 1.5 cm d(-1) in all ponds and as ice formed, salts and gases were excluded. This resulted in conductivity rising from 3-5 to > 60mS cm(-1) and contributed to the ebullition of gases. Incorporation of gas bubbles in the ice resulted in a high albedo and under-ice irradiance declined faster than incident, the former falling below 1Wm(-2) (daily average) by early April. After two months of ice formation, only 0-15% of the volume of each pond was still liquid, although this represented 5-35% of the pond sediment area, where much of the biological activity was concentrated. We suggest that the stresses that the freezing process imposes may be as important to structuring the biotic communities as those during the more benign summer growth period.					; Sorrell, Brian/L-1351-2013	Safi, Karl/0000-0002-7785-1909; Arscott, David/0000-0001-5689-2587; Webster-Brown, Jenny/0000-0001-9665-871X; Hawes, Ian/0000-0003-2471-6903; Sorrell, Brian/0000-0002-2460-8438													0954-1020					JUN	2011	23	3					235	242		10.1017/S0954102011000046	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954102011000046													WOS:000291050900004

The quantity of seston was measured and the elemental carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus (C, N, P) and biochemical composition (carbohydrate, protein, lipid) of the < 53 mu m size fraction in three temperate lakes during one year was analysed. The lakes differed in nutrient concentration and were characterized as oligotrophic, mesotrophic and eutrophic. Linear regression analyses defined associations between seston composition and either lake trophic status, depth or season. 2. The concentration of particulate organic seston was greatest during spring and autumn;and lowest during the clear water period in early summer. Seasonal patterns in seston elemental and biochemical percentage composition (quality) were observed to be independent of differences in seston quantity. 3. Concentrations of seston C, N and P were high in most cases in the spring and autumn and low in summer. Concentrations of P were particularly high during late summer and early autumn in the metalimnion, perhaps because of recovery of P from anaerobic sediments and hypolimnetic waters. Because seston C and N did not increase as markedly as P, C:P and N:P ratios both declined in the autumn. Primary production was thought to be co-limited by N and P in all three of these lakes; however, the data suggested that N might be more important as a major limiting nutrient in the eutrophic lake as the metalimnion increased in depth in late summer and autumn. 4. Concentrations of protein, carbohydrate, polar lipid and triglyceride generally increased with lake type as expected (greatest in the eutrophic lake), but showed no relationship with water depth. As the year progressed, no significant changes were measured in protein and carbohydrate concentrations; however, the concentration of polar lipid decreased and triglyceride increased significantly with time of year. 5. The biochemical composition of seston varied during the year and among lakes; for example, in Lake Waynewood the proportion of protein composing the seston (percentage protein by weight) varied from < 10% to > 40%. No statistically significant patterns in the percentage protein or carbohydrate were found. However, the proportion of seston comprised of triglyceride decreased with lake type and increased during the year; whereas the proportion of seston as polar lipid increased with lake type and decreased during the year. Triglyceride comprised most of the lipid. Both protein:lipid and protein:carbohydrate ratios tended to be greatest in summer and lowest in the spring and autumn. 6. Relationships between samples and biochemical composition analysed by Canonical Correspondence Analysis (Canoco) indicated similar patterns in seasonal changes in seston biochemistry for the three lakes, with samples separated primarily by vectors for lake type (oligotrophic to eutrophic) and the percentage polar lipid (proportion of total lipid) and secondarily by vectors for date and water depth (epilimnion or metalimnion). 7. These seasonal biochemical changes in the seston food base were compared with biochemical changes known to occur in algae grown under N-or P-limited conditions in the laboratory, and the resultant quality of this algal food for suspension-feeding consumers (zooplankton). It was concluded that zooplankton were likely to be physiologically challenged by these distinct seasonal shifts in the quality of lake seston.																			0046-5070					DEC	1997	38	3					539	554		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1997.00233.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1997.00233.x													WOS:000071561200008
J	MANION, PJ				MANION, PJ			DOWNSTREAM MOVEMENT OF FISH IN A TRIBUTARY OF SOUTHERN LAKE-SUPERIOR	PROGRESSIVE FISH-CULTURIST												The influence of 2 environmental factors, stream flow and water temperature, on the downstream movement of 4 fish species in the Big Garlic River [Michigan, USA] over a 12 yr period is described. Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) migrated after floods had subsided in the spring and during rising water in the fall at temperatures of about 10.degree. C. Brook sticklebacks (Culaea inconstans) moved downstream chiefly in winter. Mottled scuplins (Cottus bairdi) moved primarily in the winter and during floods. Yellow perch (Perca flavescens) appeared to move generally in the fall as water levels increased and water temperatures decreased.																			0033-0779						1977	39	1					14	16		10.1577/1548-8659(1977)39[14:DMOFIA]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1977)39[14:DMOFIA]2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1977CX30800004
J	Schneider, T; Grosbois, G; Vincent, WF; Rautio, M				Schneider, Tobias; Grosbois, Guillaume; Vincent, Warwick F.; Rautio, Milla			Carotenoid accumulation in copepods is related to lipid metabolism and reproduction rather than to UV-protection	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Accumulation of carotenoid pigments in copepods has often been described as a plastic adaptation providing photoprotection against ultraviolet radiation (UVR). However, reports of seasonal carotenoid maxima in winter, when UVR is low, challenge the proposed driving role of UVR. Therefore, we here evaluate the mechanistic connection between UVR and the seasonal pattern of copepod carotenoid pigmentation. We assessed the carotenoids, fatty acid content and reproduction of Leptodiaptomus minutus along with UVR exposure, water temperature, phytoplankton pigments, and fish predation in a boreal lake during 18 months covering two winter seasons. The predominant carotenoid astaxanthin occurred in free form as well as esterified with fatty acids. Mono-and diesters accounted for 62-93% of total astaxanthin and varied seasonally in close correlation with fatty acids. The seasonal variability in total astaxanthin content of the copepods was characterized by net accumulation in late fall of up to 0.034 mu g (mg dry mass)(-1) d(-1), which led to the mid-winter maximum of 3.89 +/- 0.31 mu g mg(-1). The two periods of net loss (-0.018 mu g mg(-1) d(-1) and -0.021 mu g mg(-1) d(-1)) coincided with peaks of egg production in spring and summer leading to minimum astaxanthin content (0.86 +/- 0.03 mu g mg(-1)) in fall. This period was also characterized by the highest predation pressure by young-of-the-year fish. The results suggest that accumulation of astaxanthin in copepods is strongly related to lipid metabolism but not to UVR-photoprotection, and that seasonal changes of fatty acids and carotenoids are related to the reproduction cycle.

J	Hoxmeier, RJH; DeVries, DR				Hoxmeier, RJH; DeVries, DR			Habitat use, diet, and population structure of adult and juvenile paddlefish in the lower Alabama River	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We quantified habitat use, diet, and population characteristics of paddlefish Polyodon spathula in the lower Alabama River, Alabama, in an effort to determine whether juveniles and adults differ in their seasonal use of three types of habitats (oxbow lakes, backwater areas, and channel areas) and to identify differences in population characteristics between fish from the Alabama River and those from other drainage systems. Both juveniles and adults used backwater and channel areas. Paddlefish used backwater areas primarily during summer and fall and channel habitats during winter and spring. Juvenile paddlefish that were present in backwater areas migrated with prespawn adults, whereas juveniles in the oxbow habitat did not. Juvenile paddlefish used oxbow lakes as nursery areas, remaining there until sexual maturity. Paddlefish in the lower Alabama River had shorter life spans than those previously studied further north, suggesting a latitudinal gradient in fish survival. Although fecundity rates were higher, in part compensating for their shorter life span, growth rates were lower than observed elsewhere. Slow growth may result from inhabiting areas where water is warmer than optimal for feeding. However, part of the apparent difference in growth rates may be due to problems in aging paddlefish in previous studies. Paddlefish consumed primarily copepods and cladocerans when available; however, ephemeropteran nymphs were consumed heavily in the channel habitat during winter and spring.

J	Beyer, JE; Hambright, KD				Beyer, Jessica E.; Hambright, K. David			The niche and morphology of the invasive Daphnia lumholtzi in a subtropical reservoir, 20 years after invasion	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The establishment and persistence of invasive species are continuously shaped by resource availability, competition and predation, yet most research is conducted immediately after invasion. Twenty years after Daphnia lumholtzi invaded Lake Texoma, OK-TX we uncovered seasonality in D. lumholtzi abundances and defensive morphology. Tail-spine growth was hyperallometric (faster than core body growth) in summer and fall, but allometric (growing at same rate as body) in winter. Head-spine growth declined with increasing body size, and was curvilinear in summer and fall, but linear in winter. Thus, we hypothesized that the selective predation pressure acting upon these traits is strongest in summer and fall and that the large plastic defensive spines allow persistence of D. lumholtzi. Additionally, we found that abundances of D. lumholtzi in Lake Texoma were best predicted by cyanobacteria concentration. However, as lab experiments have shown that D. lumholtzi does not have superior cyanobacteria tolerance, cyanobacteria may be serving as a proxy for another pressure shaping the abundance of D. lumholtzi, like a seasonal predator. The niche of this invasive species within Lake Texoma appears to be primarily limited by predation pressure, and further studies may illuminate whether this limiting factor is responsible for range limits within North America.

J	Nyberg, P; Bergstrand, E; Degerman, E; Enderlein, O				Nyberg, P; Bergstrand, E; Degerman, E; Enderlein, O			Recruitment of pelagic fish in an unstable climate: Studies in Sweden's four largest lakes	AMBIO												Pelagic fish population biology was studied in the large Swedish lakes Vanern, Vattern, Malaren and Hjalmaren. It is crucial for fish fry in temperate regions to hatch early in the growth season to survive, and achieve large size before winter, and it is suggested that the key factors are to match the spring development of phyto- and zooplankton, but to avoid predation. This is more easily accomplished by the studied spring spawners smelt (Osmerus eperlanus) and pike-perch (Stizostedion lucioperca) than autumn spawners, such as vendace (Coregonus albula). It is shown that hatching of vendace fry shortly after ice-break-up is beneficial for year-class strength. In oligotrophic large lakes with few predatory species a rapid increase in water temperature after ice-break is also promoting recruitment, whereas this is not the case in eutrophic lakes where predation pressure from other species may become too high. The results indicate that autumn spawners will have difficulties in adapting to global warming and it is also suggested that the life history can explain the large variations observed in year-class strength between years.																			0044-7447					DEC	2001	30	8					559	564		10.1639/0044-7447(2001)030[0559:ROPFIA]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1639/0044-7447(2001)030[0559:ROPFIA]2.0.CO;2								11878031					WOS:000173812700013

Moron; Barboza, Francisco R.; Pansch, Christian			Population structure of the recent invader Hemigrapsus takanoi and prey size selection on Baltic Sea mussels	AQUATIC INVASIONS												The shore crab Hemigrapsus takanoi Asakura and Watanabe, 2005, native to the Northwest Pacific, was recorded in European waters about 25 years ago and it was first found in the Baltic Sea in 2014. Information on population structure of invaders and their new niche is needed in order to understand their biological impact. Over one year, we assessed temporal changes in relative abundance, size-class and sex ratio, as well as breeding season of H. takanoi in the Kiel Fjord (Western Baltic Sea). In addition, prey size preference and consumption rates on mussels (Mytilus edulis Linnaeus, 1758) were experimentally assessed in spring, summer and autumn. A total of 596 individuals were collected with highest and lowest abundances in June and February, respectively. Females were dominant over males (sex ratio 1.4:1), but males grew to larger sizes. H. takanoi reproduced between June and August with ovigerous females representing 30% of the entire female abundance registered over the entire year. Males were able to open larger mussels (due to larger claws) and consumed twice as many mussels when compared to females of similar size. Consumption rates for males were 6 and 2 times higher in summer (seawater temperature of 19 degrees C) compared to spring (8 degrees C) and autumn (13 degrees C), respectively. Females consumed 3 times more mussels in autumn than in spring. H. takanoi is an active predator, capable of reproduction in stressful brackish water conditions. Due to large abundances and high feeding pressure, this recently introduced species could play a key role in structuring post-settlement population dynamics of the dominant habitat builder M. edulis.

Monthly and seasonal variations of biomass partitioning and macronutrients in the invasive grass Vossia cuspidata (Roxb.) Griff	AQUATIC BOTANY												Vossia cuspidata (Roxb.) Griff. (Poaceae) is a serious invasive plant in Africa, capable to colonize several riverine wetlands. Controlling of any invasive plant is hampered by the lack of studies involving its growth ecology. Here, we aimed to evaluate the monthly and seasonal variations in the dry biomass partitioning of V. cuspidata and its macronutrients in three aquatic habitats (slopes, water edges and open water) along the banks of the River Nile in Cairo, Egypt. In the study area V. cuspidata started its growth in February 2018 by the formation of shoots, which sprouted from buds on the underground rhizomes, showed its maximum growth in autumn and entered the senescent stage in early winter. The monthly maximum biomass dry matter (BDM) of the root system (48.9 g DWm 2) occurred in October, and in April for rhizomes (110.4 g DWm(-2)). The BDM production of leaves was minimum in March at the three habitats while its maximum was obtained in September or October reaching 326.6 g DWm(-2) on slopes, 303.6 g DWm(-2) in water edges and 246.6 g DWm(-2) in open water, respectively. The maximum monthly total BDM partitioning of V. cuspidata was 604.5 g DWm(-2) on the slopes during September and reached 543.8 and 550.0 g DWm(-2) in open water and water edges, respectively, during October. The highest total BDM production was obtained in autumn, while the mean of BDM of the four seasons was 1869.7 g DWm(-2) +/- 150.9. Generally, the concentrations (% biomass DW) of the analyzed nutrient elements (K, Ca, Mg, N and P) showed mostly a gradual decrease with time during the year; starting from spring until summer or autumn, then increased again in autumn or winter. An important result of this study is that to conserve other native species, then the harvest of the aboveground organs of V. cuspidata should be carried out during late autumn in November after the translocation of reserved materials from the belowground organs to maximize V. cuspidata biomass removal.

Dreissena in the Lower Mississippi River experience seasonal regimes of temperature and suspended sediment that are distinctly different from those found in northern lentic environments. Shell growth and mortality were determined biweekly using marked animals in caged environments. Tissue condition was also estimated biweekly using mussels from caged and wild environments. Our results demonstrate that, although annual growth is comparable with that reported for more temperate environments, the seasonal pattern of increase is different. Shell growth and tissue condition were highest during the early spring. Tissue condition declined and shell growth;th ceased during the summer, when temperatures remained at 29-30 degrees C for 3 months. This midsummer depression was accompanied by increased mortality, particularly for mussels greater than 15 mm. Condition improved for all sizes in fall and winter. These patterns of growth and mortality appear to be primarily driven by fluctuations in seasonal temperature and spawning condition with some influence of suspended sediment. Our observations indicate that periodic summer mortality events will occur, and the extent of this mortality will depend primarily on temperature, population size structure, and spring tissue condition.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				MAY	1999	56	5					748	759		10.1139/cjfas-56-5-748	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-56-5-748													WOS:000081235400002

Daily temperature and precipitation data from 111 stations, together with the records of glacier changes, indicate that temperature patterns during 1961-2008 were consistent with warming at a statistically significant level. Seasonal warming was greatest in autumn and winter. Temperature rise showed a significant relationship with sea surface temperature in the Western Pacific, net longwave radiation flux, altitude, sunshine hours, strengthening anticyclonic circulations in summer and anomalous cyclonic circulation in winter. The increase was more apparent in higher altitude areas than in lower ones. Precipitation variations were less marked than those of temperature, generally showing weak decreasing trends during 1961-2008. Increasing trends were apparent only in spring and winter, when regional trends of precipitation increases with altitude also were evident. The strengthening Western Pacific Subtropical Highs were related to precipitation variation. Against the background of increasing temperature, especially the increasing warming with altitude, the fronts of 32 glaciers and areas of 13 glacial basins have retreated, mass losses of 10 glaciers have been considerable, glacial lakes in six regions have expanded and melt water discharge of four basins has also increased, but these glaciers and basins in our study are only a fraction of the retreating glaciers over southwestern China.

In this Mesopotamic region waters have low conductivity and the main nutrients are generally present in low concentrations. The shallow lakes of the Thera system are surrounded by extensive swamps by which streams circulate. Phytoplankton density showed seasonal variations, with minima in autumn-winter and maxima in spring-summer. The northeastern shallow lakes were characterised by their high density with dominance of Cyanobacteria. The reduction in phytoplankton density and increase of diversity towards the south of the system was related to the development of submerged vegetation. Phytoplankton density was higher in the limnetic area, where light and nutrient availability is enhanced in relation to the vegetated area. The Ibera system presented more than 1000 algal taxa and thus, it is one of the wetlands of higher diversity in South America. This complex system is a potential center of dispersion of species from the Argentine Mesopotamia.																			1612-166X		978-3-510-47067-9				2014	65						99	111		10.1127/1612-166X/2014/0065-0036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/1612-166X/2014/0065-0036													WOS:000339640200008

J	Ueda, S; Kondo, K; Chikuchi, Y				Ueda, S; Kondo, K; Chikuchi, Y			Effects of the halocline on water quality and phytoplankton composition in a shallow brackish lake (Lake Obuchi, Japan)	LIMNOLOGY												The relationships of the halocline to both water quality and phytoplankton composition in Lake Obuchi, a shallow brackish take in northern Japan, were investigated from April 2001 to December 2004. The halocline in this lake became stronger in summer (July-September, mean maximum density gradient 4.3-5.8 rho(t)m(-1)) but weaker in spring, fall, and winter (1.9-3.3 rho(t)m(-1)). Although the difference in water quality between the upper and lower layers separated by the halocline was high in summer, nutrients (PO43--P and NH4+-N) were eluted from the bottom sediment as levels of dissolved oxygen decreased in the bottom layer because of the strong stratification caused by the halocline formed over the long term. Moreover, phytoplankton taxa composition also differed between the upper and lower layers in summer, but was similar in other seasons. The dominant phytoplankton taxa in the upper layer in summer were Skeletonema costatum and Cyclotella spp., whereas in the lower layer, Gymnodinium spp. (Dinophyceae) and Chlorophyceae, which prefer eutrophic and low dissolved oxygen conditions, dominated. This suggests that the halocline was related to differentiations in both water quality and ecosystem components between the upper and lower layers in the brackish lake water.

A seasonal study in three well-conserved first-order Pampean streams was carried out to test the hypothesis that rainfalls are the main drivers of whole-stream metabolism, through their effects on hydrology. We estimated the stream metabolism and metabolic contribution of six relevant communities (angiosperms, macroalgae, seston, epiphyton, epipelon, and hyporheos) during late spring, summer, and winter and examined the relation between gross primary production (GPP) and photosynthetic active radiation (PAR). Our results showed that the decrease in available streambed light due to the dissolved organic carbon after rainfalls was the main factor related to the decrease in the ecosystem and community metabolisms. For instance, GPP oscillated from similar to 10 gO(2) m(-2) d(-1) in early spring (low flows) to similar to 3 gO(2) m(-2) d(-1) in summer (high flows). Ecosystem respiration (ER) was less sensitive than GPP to rainfalls due to the increase of hyporheic respiration. Rainfalls also caused a significant loss of downstream macroalgal biomass. At a day scale, the high PAR of late spring and summer saturated GPP during the afternoon, and the low temperature of winter mornings constrained GPP. Hence, the knowledge of weather changes is key to understanding the main hydrological drivers of stream function.					; Leggieri, Leonardo/JXM-5367-2024; Feijoó, Claudia/P-9398-2019; Acuna, Vicenc/L-6608-2014; Ferreiro, Nicolás/AAA-5060-2022; Acuña, Vicenç/L-6608-2014	Leggieri, Leonardo/0000-0002-1511-7506; Acuna, Vicenc/0000-0002-4485-6703; Ferreiro, Nicolas/0000-0002-2412-162X													0018-8158	1573-5117				OCT	2013	716	1					47	58		10.1007/s10750-013-1543-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-013-1543-4													WOS:000323249200005

Population Attributes of Lake Trout in Tennessee Reservoirs	SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST												We sampled stocked Salvelinus namaycush (Lake Trout) in Watauga Lake and South Holston Lake, TN using experimental gill nets in 2009-2010 to describe their growth, longevity, and condition. Annuli in sagittal otoliths formed once a year in early spring in both reservoirs. South Holston Lake (n = 99 Lake Trout) has been stocked since 2006, and the oldest fish was age 4. Watauga Lake has been stocked since the mid-1980s, and we collected 158 Lake Trout up to age 20. Annual mortality for age-3 and older fish in Watauga Lake was 24%. When compared to Lake Trout in northern lakes, Tennessee Lake Trout exhibited average to above-average growth and longevity. Condition of Lake Trout in both reservoirs varied seasonally and tended to be lowest in fall, but rebounded in winter and spring. Lake Trout in both reservoirs appeared to be spatially segregated from pelagic prey fishes during summer stratification, but growth rates and body condition were high enough to suggest that neither system was being overstocked.																			1528-7092	1938-5412				APR	2013	12	1					217	232		10.1656/058.012.0117	http://dx.doi.org/10.1656/058.012.0117													WOS:000321868900017

Although the presence (duration, abundance) of this fairy shrimp strongly differs among different seasons and both years, we showed that in a season with favourable conditions (spring 2018) its abundance increases rapidly at the end of the season as the shrimps persist in small pools until the water dries out. The species may appear again during the autumn, however, its abundance and persistence seem to be much lower and shorter than during the spring, respectively. Nevertheless, persistence and abundance may also differ strongly among the two successive spring seasons (less shrimps found during the shorter season of 2019 than in 2018). Larvae appear first, and are most abundant at the beginning of the season, and are followed by adult males (protandry) and females, which become most abundant at the end of the season. Also, larvae seem to be more abundant on exposed bottom (gravel path), while adults are much more abundant in the shelter of a submerged meadow. Ovigerous females had 9-37 cysts (fertilized eggs) in their brood pouch, and the position of differently developed eggs changed during the season; the presence of females without eggs during mid- and at the end of season indicates the production of thin-shelled summer, and thick-shelled winter cysts, respectively. In contrast with the water decrease that is in strongly negative association with the abundance of the fairy shrimps (lake size - abundance: r = -0.56, P<0.001), no other environmental parameters were highly associated ( r <= 0.38|) with species abundance. Although the local population (one of only two currently known) seems to be in good condition, appropriate conservation action should be taken to prevent the decrease of this population in the future.																			0011-216X	1568-5403				MAY	2021	94	5					529	549		10.1163/15685403.bja10075	http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/15685403.bja10075													WOS:000647057800002

Fish were located about every 10 d and were tracked over a 24-h period about Once it month between mid-April 2005 and March 2006. Seasonal variation's in movement and behavior were observed fer largemouth bass and spotted bass. Daily movement rates were greatest for largemouth bass during summer months when water temperature exceeded 25 degrees C. Spotted bass daily movement rates were greatest when water temperature was between 15 and 25 degrees C. and both species moved little. during the winter months. Largemouth bass moved more and had larger annual. spring, and fall home ranges (50 and 95% kernel) than spotted bass over the 11-month period. Spotted bass inhabited deeper water than largemouth bass.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				DEC	2008	23	4					599	606		10.1080/02705060.2008.9664247	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2008.9664247													WOS:000260590800011

Bar-Yosef; Wu, Xiaohong			Early Holocene palaeoseasonality inferred from the stable isotope composition of Unio shells from Catalhoyuk, Turkey	ENVIRONMENTAL ARCHAEOLOGY												Seasonal delta C-13 and delta O-18 data are presented from 14 Unio sub-fossil shells unearthed at the archaeological site of Catalhoyuk in central Turkey, spanning the occupation period ca. 9150-8000 cal years BP. The shells likely lived in the small lakes/wetlands around the site before being gathered and taken to Catalhoyuk. Wetdry seasonal cycles are clearly apparent in the delta(18)Oshell profiles with low winter values reflecting winter precipitation and high delta O-18 in the summer resulting from evaporation. The most striking trend in the delta O-18 data is the drop in maximum summer delta O-18 ca. 8300 years BP, which we infer as indicating lower summer evaporation and hence a reduction in seasonality. Previous palaeoclimate records from the area have suggested cooler and more arid conditions, with reduced precipitation, around this time. While the drop in summer delta O-18 values could be due to reduced summer temperatures reducing summer evaporation, but there was little change in winter delta O-18, perhaps suggesting winter growth cessation or reduced influence of winter climate change on delta O-18. This shift in seasonal climate could be linked to solar-forced climate change beginning ca. 8600 years BP, and enhanced by the regional expression of the 8.2k event. Changing water balance over the occupation period is likely an important contributory factor behind observed cultural changes at Catalhoyuk in the Late Neolithic/Early Chalcolithic period. Our results might be considered to support the fission-fusion farming hypothesis as we provide additional evidence for wet winter/early spring conditions during the Early Holocene which likely caused flooding of the Carsamba Fan. The changing water balance after ca. 8300 years BP (i.e. reduced seasonality and potentially reduced local summer evaporation) is also coincidental with the proposed end of this farming system due to multi-decadal drought.

Such blooms in lakes can happen throughout the year because of the changes in nutrient and hydrological cycles. Nutrient export to lakes from rivers is the main cause of eutrophication problems. Seasonal trends in nitrogen (N) export by rivers to lakes are still not well understood. The objective of this study is, therefore, to better understand the seasonal trends in river export of dissolved inorganic N (DIN) to lakes of the Hai He Basin. To this end, we selected Guanting and Baiyangdian as representative lakes, whose drainage areas include various cropping systems. We developed a seasonal version of the Model to Assess River Inputs of Nutrients to lAkes (MARINA-Lakes) model for Guanting and Baiyangdian while assessing N flows from the land to the lakes. The model accounts for the seasonality in human activities (e.g., cropping systems and fertilizer practices), climate, and hydrology. The effective seasons are winter (December-February), spring (March-May), summer (June-August), and fall (September-November). The model results for the year 2012 indicate that river export of DIN was highest in winter and lowest in summer. Point sources accounted for over 50% of DIN exports to Guanting and Baiyangdian across seasons. Avoiding direct discharges of animal manure (point source) in winter is needed to reduce future lake pollution. We argue that effective lake pollution control requires accounting for seasonal N cycles. Our study can support effective nutrient management and environmental policies.					; Ma, Lin/F-3770-2012; Chen, Xuanjing/LGY-1719-2024; Wu, Yihong/AAP-4587-2021; Strokal, Maryna/GSJ-1644-2022; Bai, Zhaohai/A-4959-2018; li, hongbo/B-1525-2010; Kroeze, Carolien/C-6938-2014	Strokal, Maryna/0000-0002-8063-7743; ma, lin/0000-0003-1761-0158; Bai, Zhaohai/0000-0001-7685-5441; 													2169-8953	2169-8961				OCT	2021	126	10							e2020JG005689	10.1029/2020JG005689	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JG005689													WOS:000711969900016
J	Holmes, JA; Youson, JH				Holmes, JA; Youson, JH			Laboratory study of the effects of spring warming and larval density on the metamorphosis of sea lampreys	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We tested the hypotheses that the incidence of metamorphosis in sea lampreys Petromyzon marinus is related to the magnitude of the spring rise in temperature and that high larval density prior to metamorphosis reduces the number of animals entering metamorphosis. Concurrently, we also tested the accuracy of predicting metamorphosis based on minimum size criteria of 120 mm and 3.0 g and condition factor (CF) of 1.45 for larval data collected in the fall, where CF = 10(6) (mass, g)/(total length, mm)(3). The spring rise in temperature was a critical step in stimulating metamorphosis, but neither the magnitude of warming in the spring nor larval density significantly affected the proportion of metamorphosing animals. By using a CF of 1.45 or greater as the criterion for larval data collected in fall, we predicted 92% of the metamorphosis that occurred the following summer. Predictions of sea lamprey metamorphosis based on fall data were as accurate as predictions made in previous studies that examined spring data and used minimum size criteria of 120 mm and 3.0 g and a CF of 1.50 or greater. The equal success of using a CF of 1.45 or greater with fall data and a CF of 1.50 or greater with spring data might have reflected that some lipid accumulation occurs between the fall and the onset of metamorphosis the following July.																			0002-8487					JUL	1997	126	4					647	657		10.1577/1548-8659(1997)126<0647:LSOTEO>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1997)126<0647:LSOTEO>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1997XU26600008
J	Oshima, K; Suzuki, N; Nakamura, M; Sakuramoto, K				Oshima, K; Suzuki, N; Nakamura, M; Sakuramoto, K			Shell growth and age determination of the brackish water bivalve Corbicula japonica in Lake Shinji, Japan	FISHERIES SCIENCE												Shell growth and age determination of Corbicula japonica were investigated from samples collected monthly at two sites and field growth experiments from November 1999 to November 2000 in Lake Shirji. Both specimens did not grow in winter when the water temperature was below 11degreesC, but grew rapidly from spring to early summer when the water temperature rose from 15degreesC to 30degreesC, before further growing slowly from summer to autumn after the main breeding period. The monthly marginal growth distribution of the samples indicated that the concentric groove on the shell surface was an annual growth ring. It is concluded that the age of C. japonica in the i-ring group when the shell growth resumed in spring was i + 0.5 (i = 1, 2,...), because the first true growth ring was formed at 0-2 mm in shell length, which then faded with growth. Lee's phenomenon was observed in the age determination results, and thus the growth coefficient and the asymptotic shell length of the von Eertelanffy growth equation were not estimated from the samples. However, these parameters were estimated from the annual shell length increments of the experimental individuals, which were 0.331/year and 28.2 mm, respectively.																			0919-9268	1444-2906				AUG	2004	70	4					601	610		10.1111/j.1444-2906.2004.00847.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1444-2906.2004.00847.x													WOS:000223632500011

Seasonal dynamics of the dac-tylogyrids on goldfish were investigated from March 2011 to February 2012 in the Liangzi Lake and a fish pond in Shishou, China. Six Dactylogyrus species were found, i.e. D. vastator, D. intermedius, D. arcuatus, D. baueri, D. formosus and D. inexpectatus. The highest mean abundance was recorded for D. arcuatus (4.39) on the wild goldfish, while the highest for D. vastator (0.27) on the farmed goldfish. In Liangzi Lake, except for D. inexpectatus with low infection, prevalence and mean abundance of the other five species of Dactylogyrus exhibited significant seasonal changes (P < 0.05). Three seasonal patters were observed, three peaks in spring, summer and autumn, such as D. vastator; two peaks in winter and summer, such as D. formosus; one peak in spring, such as D. intermedius, D. arcuatus and D. baueri. Despite of the different seasonal patters, high prevalence and mean abundance were observed for D. vastator, D. intermedius, D. arcuatus and D. formosus in February or March with low water temperature. In the pond, only the D. vastator exhibited high prevalence and mean abundance, and similar seasonal dynamic as that in the lake, which suggested that it was appropriate to prevent and control disease caused by D. vastator in February in goldfish farming.

J	Francis, MP; Duffy, C				Francis, MP; Duffy, C			Distribution, seasonal abundance and bycatch of basking sharks (Cetorhinus maximus) in New Zealand, with observations on their winter habitat	MARINE BIOLOGY												Basking sharks occur throughout New Zealand, but are most common in cool temperate latitudes of 39-51degreesS. Inshore records from miscellaneous sources peaked in spring-summer, with few winter records. Two records were of sharks observed in a large brackish water lake. About 203 basking sharks were observed caught by commercial trawlers between 1986 and 1999. Multiple captures were common, including 14 in one tow. Most trawl-caught sharks were taken near or outside the 250 in depth contour, and 91% came from three small regions - East Coast (EC) and West Coast (WC) of South Island and Snares-Auckland Islands (SA). The highest catch (93 sharks) and catch rate (58 sharks per 1,000 tows) were from EC, where sharks were caught only in spring-summer. In SA, sharks were caught mainly in summer, and in WC all were caught in winter. The modal seabed depths for shark tows were 300400 m at EC, 700-800 in at WC and 150-250 m at SA. Sharks were therefore caught in the deepest water in winter at WC. It was impossible to determine the actual depths of capture, but circumstantial evidence indicates that most sharks were caught on or near the bottom. The capture of some sharks in midwater in winter argues against hibernation, because hibernating sharks are unlikely to hover in midwater. Males dominated catches in all regions, particularly in WC and SA. In WC an S most sharks (94%) were 7-8 m long, whereas in E most sharks (73%) were <7 m. Based on their lengths, many of the WC and SA males could have been mature, but most EC males were probably immature. Few of the females would have been mature. This study provides support for the hypothesis that basking sharks over-winter in deep water on the continental slope.																			0025-3162					APR	2002	140	4					831	842		10.1007/s00227-001-0744-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-001-0744-y													WOS:000175819500019

Its overall moisture was 74.92 +/- 2.27 muscles, 72.45 +/- 2.887 gonads and 35.49 +/- 5.55 % livers. The livers recorded the highest crude protein (23.66 +/- 3.48%) and total lipids (36.45 +/- 6.32%). The annual total protein in muscles was 16.91 +/- 2.54%, while the annual total lipids were 3.39 +/- 1.05 %. Leucine was the most abundant (0.548 mg/g) > isoleucine (0.284 mg/g) of the essential amino acids. Sixteen fatty acids were recorded (12: SFAs, 4: MUSFAs), with butyric acid predominating. Assessment of tetrodotoxin (TTX) as mouse per unit (MU/g), gave the highest toxic abundant for skin (53.13%) > gonads (34.6) > muscles (12.9) and no detection in the livers. The average toxicity in all organs is at a low level and lower than the maximum permissible limits (<100 MU/g) despite strongly toxic samples. The abundance of all toxic samples was in summer (44.8%) and spring (36.8), followed by winter and autumn (9.2 each one). Muscles, gonads, and livers showed no response to toxicity tests during winter. On the contrary, muscles were highly contaminated with TTX in summer (25%) and spring (22.2). The findings confirmed that T. lineatus has a good nutritional value, toxicity restrictions in specific organs and seasons, recommending its better utilization with more studies to confirm its safety for human consumption.(c) 2021 National Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries.

It is a confirmed vector of the Western Equine Encephalitis and is responsible for loss of milk production in daily cattle during peak populations. This paper reports the flight activity pattern of Ae. albifasciatus for different seasons, in the southern coast of the Mar Chiquita Lake (central Argentina). Data were collected by sampling two sites between 1992 and 1993 with CDC traps and human-bait captures. Adult mosquito population density, estimated by CDC frapping and human-bait were highly correlated. However when compared to other species, the proportion of Ae. albifasciatus was higher ii? human-bait collections. Adult female populations were active only when temperature were higher than 6 degrees C. Two daily biting peaks were observed (dusk and dawn) during the spring, summer and autumn, and only one peak during winter (around 15:00 pm). Adult abundance was signficantly correlated (R(2)=0.71; p<0.01) with temperature and illumination.

We had four objectives: (1) determine the relative contribution of snowpack and soil nitrate to the spring nitrate pulse, (2) look for evidence of biotic control of N losses at the catchment scale, (3) examine dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) export patterns to gain a better understanding of the biological and hydrological controls on DON loss, and (4) examine the relationship between soil physico-chemical conditions and N export. At the Emerald Lake watershed, nitrogen budgets and isotopic analyses of the spring nitrate pulse indicate that 50 to 70% of the total nitrate exported during snowmelt (ca. April to July) is derived from catchment soils and talus; the remainder is snowpack nitrate. The spring nitrate pulse occurred several weeks after the start of snowmelt and was different from export patterns of less biologically labile compounds such as silica and DON suggesting that: (1) nitrate is produced and released from soils only after intense flushing has occurred and (2) a microbial N-sink is operating in catchment soils during the early stages of snowmelt. DON concentrations varied less than 20-30% during snowmelt, indicating that soil processes tightly controlled DON losses.

J	Jennings, E; Allott, N				Jennings, Eleanor; Allott, Norman			Position of the Gulf Stream influences lake nitrate concentrations in SW Ireland	AQUATIC SCIENCES												A positive relationship was observed between winter nitrate concentrations in two lakes in SW Ireland and the latitudinal position of the Gulf Stream in the previous spring. Weaker but statistically significant relationships were apparent between the Gulf Stream position and weather variables, as well as soil moisture levels, in the same year. Wind speed, cloud cover and precipitation in May and June were negatively related to the Gulf Stream position in April. In contrast, air temperature and sunshine hours in May and June and the magnitude of the soil moisture deficit in June were positively related. There was also a positive correlation between the magnitude of the early summer soil moisture deficit and lake nitrate concentrations in the following winter. This three way linkage implies that the concentration of winter nitrate in these lakes is influenced by a sequence of related factors that are initiated by the latitudinal position of the Gulf Stream. In this sequence the position of the Gulf Stream appears to influence early summer weather in SW Ireland which in turn dictates the extent of moisture deficit in catchment soils and, consequently, the degree of nitrate loss to surface waters in the autumn. This connection, between events in the Atlantic Ocean, weather systems in the North West Atlantic and processes in catchment soils in SW Ireland has implications for both the quality and quantity of biota in lakes and catchments in the region.

J	Elliott, JA				Elliott, J. Alex			Predicting the impact of changing nutrient load and temperature on the phytoplankton of England's largest lake, Windermere	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Climate change and eutrophication will be two of the largest threats to lake ecosystems this century. Therefore, the effect of changing water temperature (+0 to +4 degrees C) and nutrient load (0.5-2.0 proportional change) on the phytoplankton of Windermere was assessed using the phytoplankton community model, PROTECH (Phytoplankton RespOnses To Environmental CHange). 2. The following metrics were used for the analysis: annual, spring, summer and autumn mean chlorophyll a concentrations for total phytoplankton, diatoms and Cyanobacteria. Also, the timing of the spring diatom bloom was assessed and the number of days when the World Health Organisation (WHO)-derived risk threshold of 10 mg m) 3 Cyanobacteria chlorophyll a was exceeded. 3. The diatoms in Windermere produced their largest amount of chlorophyll a in the spring. Whilst the quantity of diatom biomass produced was relatively unaffected by the simulated changes in temperature and nutrient load, the timing of the bloom peak was 2-3 days earlier per 1 degrees C. 4. The modelled Cyanobacteria dominated in the summer and autumn and generally responded positively to both increasing nutrients and temperature illustrating a synergistic relationship between these two drivers. However, in the autumn, this relationship was sometimes disrupted because of variations in the length of stratification. 5. Temperature as a factor alone seemed to act in two ways: it affected phenology (e. g. bloom peak timing) mainly in the early part of the growing season and enhanced the dominance of Cyanobacteria in the late growing season. Furthermore, these effects were greatly reduced under the lower nutrient scenarios, suggesting that local management of nutrient inputs to the lake potentially offers a solution to the effects caused by the increase in temperature.

In winter, surface BP along Line 12 (southern transect) was higher than Lines 15 and 17 (central and northern transects) and reflected the water-temperature distribution. Additionally, any nutrients and dissolved organic carbon did not correlate to BP, suggesting water temperature primarily regulated BP in winter. In spring, surface BP was higher at eastern inshore stations, near large agricultural fields, and was correlated with nutrient concentrations rather than water temperature, suggesting that the limitation shifted to nutrient availability. In summer, surface BP at offshore stations along Lines 15 and 17 was notably lower than the other stations, and the horizontal heterogeneity became largest (maximum to minimum BP ratio = 9.5, compared to 2.8 similar to 4.1 in the other seasons). The BP was also positively correlated to nutrient concentrations, especially phosphorus. Surface BP in autumn also showed higher values at eastern stations as well as spring and positively correlated to phosphorus concentration. Additionally, there was a negative relationship between BP and water temperature, suggesting that bacterial growth was enhanced by groundwater seepage at the eastern stations. The results suggest that the horizontal distribution is characterized by a north-south distribution with a temperature gradient in winter, and allochthonous nutrient loading determines horizontal BP variations in the other seasons in this lake.					; Tomioka, Naotaka/B-1888-2011; Tsuchiya, Kenji/T-1541-2019	Tsuchiya, Kenji/0000-0002-6644-1701; 													1439-8621	1439-863X				JAN	2022	23	1					231	243		10.1007/s10201-021-00687-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-021-00687-7		NOV 2021											WOS:000720201600001

Results suggest that the YD was relatively cold and comprised two main phases. The first (ca. 12,500-12,000 cal. yrs BP) is characterized by a continental climatic regime and a decrease in winter temperatures and precipitation but an increase in spring/summer precipitation. The second phase (ca. 12,000-11,500 cal. yrs BP) was more mild with a variable continental climate, an increase in summer and winter temperature, a lengthening of the growing season and increased annual precipitation. The reconstructed water level generally follows changes in spring and summer precipitation and length of growing season. The frequency and timing of hydroclimatic oscillations at Swierczyna show strong similarities to records from other sites in Europe. This confirms that oxbows and valley mire ecosystems respond to rapid climate change during the YD and Early Holocene. This study therefore brings new insights into the effects of climate changes on river environments, especially during the YD. We also discuss the limitations of water depth, temperature and precipitation reconstructions inferred from the studied biotic assemblages. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Description of trophic interactions across broad spatial regions is likely necessary to fully appreciate the structure of this emerging food web. Spottail shiners, Notropis hudsonius, are numerically abundant in the nearshore zone of Lake Michigan, but their trophic interactions are under-described. To that end, we described fatty acid profiles of spottail shiner through spring, summer, and fall across western and eastern shorelines of Lake Michigan's southern basin. Fatty acids, used as dietary tracers, suggested a shift from benthic-based diets in spring to more pelagic-associated diets in summer and a reversal in fall. When time lag of fatty acid accumulation is accounted for in interpretations, diets likely follow spring plankton and summer/fall benthic invertebrate maxima. Fatty acid profiles also indicated differences in diet composition based on geographic location, with benthic tracers more prevalent among spottail shiner inhabiting the western shoreline. These interpretations were generally supported by stomach content data, with high Chironomidae consumption in spottail shiners from western waters. The presence of Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, and Odonata in spottail shiner stomach contents throughout the lake highlights its reliance on nearshore and potentially inshore areas. This study offers one of the most spatially broad depiction of spottail shiner foraging habits in Lake Michigan. (C) 2015 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

We conducted studies to determine the effects of these disturbances on benthic community structure and organization. Densities of benthic invertebrates in deeper areas of an active spawning bed were markedly lower than in marginal areas. Studies of experimental methods for determining recolonization patterns showed that artificially disturbed natural substratum was more appropriate than the use of containers filled with defaunated substratum. Seasonal variations in the recolonization of artificially disturbed natural substrata were marked. During the spring and summer, recolonization rates were rapid and equilibrium between disturbed and control areas was obtained for all taxa within 6-15 days, but in winter recolonization patterns and species compositions were markedly different. These data suggest that disturbance may not be an important organizational force in the spring and summer, but in late winter when fish reproduction begins, it appears to play a significant role in community structure and organization.																			0015-4040	1938-5102				MAR	1987	70	1					1	14		10.2307/3495085	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3495085													WOS:A1987G518000001

Phytoplankton in Alte Donau: Response to Trophic Change from Hypertrophic to Mesotrophic Over 22 Years	ALTE DONAU: SUCCESSFUL RESTORATION AND SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT - AN ECOSYSTEM CASE STUDY OF A SHALLOW URBAN LAKE	Aquatic Ecology Series											The long-term phytoplankton study in groundwater-seepage lake Alte Donau, a former side-arm of the Danube River in Vienna, covers four main lake treatment periods (1-4) from 1993 to 2014. During hypertrophic conditions with annual total phosphorus (TP) concentrations of 50-70 mu g L-1 and mean summer phytoplankton biovolume of 18-24 mm(3) L-1 before restoration (1), the filamentous cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii was the main taxon in association with Limnothrix redekei. The drastic phosphorus reduction by chemical RIPLOX-precipitation was repeated twice (2a/b, 1995 and 1996) and resulted in a prompt drop of summer phytoplankton to 4.6 mm(3) L-1 in 1995 and 1.7 mm(3) L-1 in 1996. Non-filamentous cyanobacteria contributed here only moderately while relative high peak contributions of chlorophytes occurred. After years of re-establishment of macrophytes (3), the summer phytoplankton biovolume remained low during the period of sustained ` stable conditions' (4) with values between 0.5 and 1.5 mm(3) L-1. In the long-term, phytoplankton was responding to low annual total phosphorus (10(-1)1 mu g L-1) which finally indicated a mesotrophic state close to oligotrophic conditions according to the lake classification scheme. The long-term median of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) content was 0.50% of wet weight phytoplankton biomass. As the phytoplankton composition shifted from a cyanobacteria dominated assemblage to a phytoplankton assemblage that was composed of taxa of various taxonomic affiliations, the chl-a content varied considerably. Chl-a content reached its lowest median value of 0.19% when cyanobacteria formed blooms contributing 77% to total phytoplankton (period 1) and was highest with 0.83% during the peak development of chlorophytes which contributed 18% to total biovolume (period 2b). The relationship between phytoplankton chl-a and TP is more robust than between phytoplankton biovolume and TP for indicating the lake's trophic state, although both response curves are statistically significant and provide roughly the same main picture of an ecosystem shift from hypertrophic in 1993 to mesotrophic in 2000 and the persistence of mesotrophic conditions for the 15 recent years. Trophic shifts were also indicated by the phytoplankton assemblage metric when comparing phytoplankton species composition between the lake treatment periods. The main picture of seasonal development of phytoplankton taxa and functional phytoplankton groups indicated that assemblages either prevailed in winter to spring or summer to autumn. Annual phytoplankton development thus seems primarily distinctive between the two half-year-cycles, namely the winter-spring and the summer-autumn period, rather than between the four seasons. While the seasonal development of phytoplankton follows the lake phenology commonly observed in temperate lakes, long-term compositional shifts of phytoplankton especially responded to the sustained reduction of TP forced by lake treatment measures in Alte Donau.

J	Ley, RE; Williams, MW; Schmidt, SK				Ley, RE; Williams, MW; Schmidt, SK			Microbial population dynamics in an extreme environment: controlling factors in talus soils at 3750 m in the Colorado Rocky Mountains	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												High elevation talus soils are extreme environments for life. They are pertinent to the hydrology and biochemical cycling of high elevation ecosystems that supply drinking water to major metropolitan areas, and are undergoing change as a result of N deposition. As biological systems, they are virtually unstudied. In order to gain a basic understanding of these important systems, we studied the seasonal timing of C inputs and microclimate, and how they corresponded to microbial biomass dynamics, in vegetated and unvegetated soils from a high altitude talus slope at 3750 m in the Colorado Front Range. The soil microclimate was described by soil moisture and temperature measurements; C inputs were estimated with measures of eolian dust inputs and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). The biomass of different microbial functional groups (glutamate and salicylate minerahzers adapted to different temperatures) was estimated seasonally over 3 years. We found that the soil microclimate can be divided into three distinct seasons: Winter, with free water and temperature between -2.9 and 0degreesC; spring, characterized by wet isothermal soils (0degreesC); and summer, characterized by hot (mean 10.3degreesC; range 0-29.3degreesC) dry soils occasionally wetted by precipitation. The highest OM inputs to unvegetated soils occurred in spring; PAR only reached soils in the summer. In unvegetated soils, the biomass of glutamate mineralizers (GM) was highest in spring and summer. In contrast, the GM of vegetated soils had highest biomass in the winter when plants were senesced. In both unvegetated and vegetated soils, salicylate mineralizers (SM) bad greater biomass levels in the summer when temperatures were highest.

To address this, we used metatranscriptomics to assess bacterial gene transcription variation among three sites across three seasons. Our metatranscriptome data for freshwater BCs at three public beaches (Ontario, Canada) sampled in the winter (no ice), summer and fall (2019) showed relatively little spatial, but a strong temporal variation. Our data showed high transcriptional activity in summer and fall but surprisingly, 89% of the KEGG pathway genes and 60% of the selected candidate genes (52 genes) associated with physiological and ecological activity were still active in freezing temperatures (winter). Our data also supported the possibility of an adaptively flexible gene expression response of the freshwater BC to low temperature conditions (winter). Only 32% of the bacterial genera detected in the samples were active, indicating that the majority of detected taxa were non-active (dormant). We also identified high seasonal variation in the abundance and activity of taxa associated with health risks (i.e., Cyanobacteria and waterborne bacterial pathogens). This study provides a baseline for further characterization of freshwater BCs, health-related microbial activity/dormancy and the main drivers of their functional variation (such as rapid human-induced environmental change and climate change).

Chlorophyll a concentrations increased uniformly at all depths during spring, reaching 3-4 mg/m3 by late May. Thermal stratification was followed by development of a subthermocline chlorophyll peak between 10 and 30 m that reached 8.5 mg/m3 by late July. The major subthermocline peak collapsed in mid-Aug. but was followed by 2 lesser peaks at depths of 10 and 30 m. Autumn mixing dispersed these peaks in the mixed layer, increasing the chlorophyll content of the epilimnion at a time when integral chlorophyll levels were declining. During fall overturn chlorophyll concentrations were uniformly distributed at approximately 1 mg/m3, where they remained throughout the winter. The presence of a deep chlorophyll maximum in Lake Michigan adds a new dimension to limnological studies of the Great Lakes. The influence of this peak must be considered in future investigations of food chain dynamics and eutrophication processes in the Great Lakes system.																									1977	34	12					2280	2287		10.1139/f77-306	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f77-306													WOS:A1977ED63800003
J	JOHANNSSON, O				JOHANNSSON, O			LIFE-HISTORY AND PRODUCTIVITY OF MYSIS-RELICTA IN LAKE-ONTARIO	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Mysis relicta is a common food of many fish species in Lake Ontario, yet little was known about its life history or production. We determined growth rates, cohort development patterns, reproductive patterns, and production of the population at a deep water station over a 4-year period. Four replicate vertical net hauls were collected monthly from April until October, each year. All animals were counted and 100 from each replicate were measured. The original mysid data of N.H.F. Watson, collected in 1971-72, were reanalyzed and the results compared with the present study. Most reproduction occurred in late autumn; the eggs hatched late the following winter; and the offspring reached maturity approximately 18 month later. In 1971 and 1972, abundances were similar to that in 1984 but cohort development was less synchronous. Average growth rate (1984-1987) in the first summer was 0.035 mm.d-1, through the winter it fell to 0.012 mm.d-1, and during the second summer it was 0.029 mm.d-1. Production was 1.90 g.m-2 in 1984 and 2.62 g.m-2 in 1986. Examination of sources of error suggest these values might underestimate production by 11% to 27%.

However, the persistence of pathogenic bacteria in those waters was not well documented. In this study, persistence of E. coli O157:H7 (EcO157) in 48 water samples (24 Spring samples and 24 Autumn samples) from the 3 urban recreational waters was investigated. Multivariate statistical analysis was performed to correlate survival data with water physicochemical properties and bacterial communities. Our data showed that EcO157 survived longer in Spring samples than in Autumn samples regardless of the lakes. Results revealed that recreational water physicochemical properties and bacterial community in Spring samples were different from those in Autumn samples. Mantel and Partial Mantel tests, as well as co-occurrence network analysis illustrated that EC salinity, TOC, and bacterial community were correlated with survival time (ttd) (p < 0.05). Variation partition analysis (VPA) indicated that bacterial community, EC, TOC, and TN explained about 64.81% of overall ttd variation in Spring samples, and bacterial community, EC, pH, and TP accounted for about 56.59% of overall ttd variation in Autumn samples. Structural equation model (SEM) illustrated that EC indirectly positively affected ttd through bacterial community. The correlation between bacterial community and ttd was negative in Spring samples and positive in Autumn samples. TN appeared a direct positive effect on ttd in Spring samples. TP displayed a direct negative effect on ttd in Autumn samples. Our results concluded that there was seasonal variation in environmental factors that directly or indirectly affected the survival of EcO157 in urban recreational waters.

J	WARREN, GJ				WARREN, GJ			PREDACEOUS FEEDING-HABITS OF LIMNOCALANUS-MACRURUS	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Limnocalanus macrurus, a large, glacial-relict copepod, has been assumed on omnivore or a herbivore; predaceous habits of the species are unknown. The predaceous feeding habits of Limnocalanus from Lake Michigan were studied in the laboratory using natural prey. Predation rates were highest on copepod nauplii. Copepodites of Diaptomus spp. and Cyclops spp. were preyed upon at lower rates. Limnocalanus preyed selectively upon nauplii < 300 .mu.m. Small cyclopoid copepodites (< .apprx. 750 .mu.m) were also selected over large copepodites. Experiments using two prey types showed that nauplii were selected over all copepodites, and that no selectivity existed for either diaptomid or cyclopoid copepodites. Predaceous feeding habits began in the fourth copepodite stage of Limnoicalanus. Predaceous feeding rates of Limnocalanus changed seasonally being highest in late spring and autumn and lowest in summer and early winter. Since Limnocalanus also feeds on net-phytoplankton, predation rate changes may be related to changes in the relative abundance of large phytoplankton and naupliar prey in nature. Limnocalanus predation may be an important factor in structuring the zooplankton community.																			0142-7873	1464-3774					1985	7	4					537	552		10.1093/plankt/7.4.537	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/7.4.537													WOS:A1985AMS8100009

In late autumn and winter, the microfauna on the pond bottom had a higher density and biomass than in the floating bed of macrophytes. In spring and summer instead, higher values in ciliate abundance and biomass were observed in the Lemna bed. Patterns of seasonal changes in the density of organisms - with one or two peaks in the year - were recognized in some species of ciliates. The dynamics of these species appear to be related mainly by physico-chemical and biological factors as the reduction of dissolved oxygen in the bottom and the growth of Lemna in the surface layer.																			0003-9136					JUN	1991	121	4					449	461																WOS:A1991GC47200005
J	CASE, DJ; MCCULLOUGH, DR				CASE, DJ; MCCULLOUGH, DR			THE WHITE-TAILED DEER OF NORTH MANITOU ISLAND	HILGARDIA												The white-tailed deer population on North Manitou Island, Michigan, was studied between June 1980 and May 1982. The National Park Service acquired the island in 1980, ending many years of deer hunting and winter feeding administered by the previous owners. A heavy dieoff in the winter of 1977-78 was the result of cessation of winter feeding by the private owners. Winter mortality was low in the following years as the severely reduced population began to increase. The population increased by an estimated 66 percent in 1980 and 59 percent in 1981 to a pre-winter population estimated at 2,080 deer. In a second major dieoff in the winter of 1981-1982, an estimated 76 percent of the population died. Fawns were most susceptible to winter mortality, and males were more susceptible than females among adults. Favorable spring-through-fall foods, including grasses, forbs, fruits, and an unusual food, a fish (the alewife), many of which die tin annual cycles in lake Michigan, support high population productivity. However, woody browse has been largely eliminated by previous deer browsing, with the exception of American beech, an unpalatable species. The lack of quality woody browse for winter food and the lack of winter thermal cover make the population high susceptible to winter mortality. The combination of favorable habitat from spring through fall and poor habitat in winter in a region with severe winter conditions can be expected to continue the historic pattern of rapid population increases followed by massive winter losses. This pattern can be broken. Hunting can control deer population numbers and allow regeneration of a more natural mix of woody species.																			0073-2230					DEC	1987	55	9					1	57																WOS:A1987M802500001

Trends in the Reproductive Phenology of two Great Lakes Fishes	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												To assess potential effects of climate change on Great Lakes fish populations, we evaluated trends in the reproductive phenology of Yellow Perch Perca flavescens (spring spawner) and Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush (autumn spawner). For Yellow Perch in Lake Michigan, the estimated reproductive midpoint date (50% of mature females ripe or spent, 50% not yet spawned) took place 6.2 d/decade earlier in the spring near Milwaukee from 1988 to 2012 and 1.8 d/decade earlier in Green Bay from 1980 to 2012. At both locations water temperatures at the spawning sites on the midpoint date showed no trends, but mean water temperatures during the spring at the spawning site and midlake increased over the study period. This suggests that Yellow Perch spawning areas were warming sooner in the spring and that Yellow Perch were spawning earlier to maintain a consistent spawning temperature. Lake Trout phenological patterns were more complex. For Lake Trout in Lake Michigan near Milwaukee, there was a marginally significant trend for spawning to take place 2.1 d/decade later in the autumn from 1983 to 2006. However, water temperatures at the spawning site at the midpoint date did not change and autumn temperatures at the site and at midlake did not show a warming trend. For Lake Trout in Lake Superior near the Apostle Islands, the midpoint date did not change from 1988 to 2012. Water temperatures at the spawning site on the midpoint date and during the autumn also showed no trends, but midlake summer and autumn water temperatures increased significantly. Overall, Yellow Perch in Lake Michigan have shifted reproductive timing in a manner consistent with a warming climate, but the relationship of climate change to reproductive phenology remains unclear for Lake Trout in Lake Michigan and Lake Superior.

During the survey, 1,028 walleyes were collected and examined for the presence of lymphocystis disease, dermal sarcoma, discrete epidermal hyperplasia and diffuse epidermal hyperplasia. Skin growths were high in prevalence in early spring, low in prevalence during the summer, and again high in prevalence in the fall. Lymphocystis disease and dermal sarcoma were more frequently observed than either discrete or diffuse epidermal hyperplasia. Histologically, a moderate to severe inflammatory response was associated with dermal sarcoma in the early spring and late spring but not in the fall. Regardless of the time of year, varying degrees of inflammatory response were seen associated with lymphocystis disease. Samples were inadequate to assess seasonal trends in incidence of discrete and diffuse epidermal hyperplasia.																			0090-3558	1943-3700				APR	1988	24	2					292	298		10.7589/0090-3558-24.2.292	http://dx.doi.org/10.7589/0090-3558-24.2.292								3373634					WOS:A1988N188300015

We analysed these series for the reliability of their temperature signal at annual and seasonal resolutions. Importantly, we analysed all of the indicators within the same statistical framework, which allows for their meaningful comparison. In this framework, we employed a cross-validation procedure designed to reduce the adverse effects of estimation bias that may inflate the reliability of various temperature indicators, especially when several indicators are used in a multiple regression model. In our data sets, timing of phenological observations and ice break-up were connected with spring, tree ring characteristics (width, density, carbon isotopic composition) with summer and ice formation with autumn temperatures. Baltic Sea ice extent and the duration of ice cover in different watercourses were good indicators of winter temperatures. Using combinations of various temperature indicator series resulted in reliable temperature signals for each of the four seasons, as well as a reliable annual temperature signal. The results hence demonstrated that we can obtain reliable temperature information over different seasons, using a careful selection of indicators, combining the results with regression analysis, and by determining the reliability of the obtained indicator.

Three-dimensional management model for Lake Washington, part I: Introduction and hydrodynamic modeling	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												A three-dimensional hydrodynamic model, CH3D-Z (curvilinear hydrodynamics in three dimension, Z-grid version), was implemented in Lake Washington as a part of a management model. The model was calibrated for hydrothermal distribution over a one-year time period for 1995 and verified for a two-year time period between 1996 and 1997. Simulation reproduced intra-annual variation of mixing represented by fall/winter mixing and spring/summer stratification. The simulated variation of vertical thermal structures also matched observation. Vertical flux was investigated in terms of stratification through turbulent mixing and internal waves. Basin scale internal waves showed a characteristic diurnal variation and modulation by surface wind. The model resolved the seasonal variation of thermal structures, assuring a good linkage to a nutrient-eutrophication model.

"Clean" common rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus) and silver Prussian carp (Carassius gibelio) were transported to the contaminated Glubokoye Lake and kept in cages during several months of exposure, while contaminated Glubokoye fish were kept in cages in the "clean" Starukha Lake. Radiocaesium (Cs-137) and radiostrontium ((90) Sr) were determined in intestine contents, muscle and bone tissues based on repeated samples during several months of exposure. During summer, the activity concentrations of Cs-137 and Sr-90 increased with time of exposure in clean fish caged in the contaminated lake. During autumn and winter, however, minor changes in fish uptake occurred during several weeks of exposure to the contaminated water. Furthermore, deputation in the contaminated fish was significant during summer, while insignificant during winter when exposed in the "clean" water. The rate constant of Cs-137 uptake in muscle was between 8.0 and 22 day(-1) during summer, while 0.2 to 1.0 day(-1) during autumnwinter. Similarly, the rate constant of Sr-90 uptake in bone was between 1.4 and 1.6 day(-1), while 0.08-0.52 day(-1) during autumn-winter. Biological half-lives of Cs-137 in fish muscle tissue in summer were 77 +/- 10 days, while exceeded 230 days during seasons at low water temperature. The results demonstrated that the transfer of Cs-137 and Sr-90 to fish was highly dependent upon seasons, in particular the water temperature. The transfer data obtained during low water temperature seasons deviated significantly from transfer data in literature and handbooks. Thus, seasonal changes in radionuclide transfer to fish should be taken into account when radiological impact to fish is assessed. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

While mature individuals are known to have extended longitudinal movements of over 90km along main river channels, details of the seasonal movements and residency of individuals within and between tributary habitats have been largely undocumented. Therefore, the current research aimed to detect and quantify the seasonal distances moved by adult taimen (65-96cm; n=10) within and between the Onon River (Amur River basin) and a major tributary (Balj) over 12 months using passive acoustic telemetry. The median distance moved by taimen in spring was 17.4km (n=6), in summer 9.1km (n=4), autumn 4.7km (n=9) and winter 0.4km (n=8). However, there were no statically significant differences amongst these median seasonal home range sizes. Two taimen traversed between the Onon River and the Balj tributary during the study period, recording overall home ranges of 44.5km and 126.1km. One of these individuals moved twice, exiting the tributary in autumn and returning again in spring where it remained for 36 days, while the second taimen moved only once into the tributary in spring and re-entered the main channel in late summer after 85 days. Another two taimen entered surrounding smaller tributaries and recorded home ranges of 26.1km and 29.2km, while all remaining individuals were detected moving only within the waterway where they were originally captured and released (0.8-20.1km). Taimen movements within tributaries such as the Balj can be extensive (<60km), as they provide access to important spawning, feeding and overwintering habitats as well as refuge from adverse thermal and hydrological conditions. Thus to enhance population recovery, it is essential that current and future management and conservation efforts include preserving or restoring the ecological integrity and hydrological connectivity of these critical tributaries and the main river channel throughout the Onon and Amur River basins and across the remaining distribution of this endangered species.					; Borchardt, Dietrich/D-1729-2009; Büttner, Olaf/C-6306-2008; Buttner, Olaf/C-6306-2008	Kaus, Andrew/0000-0001-5042-3413; Borchardt, Dietrich/0000-0002-6074-2829; Buttner, Olaf/0000-0002-4332-5441													1434-2944	1522-2632				DEC	2016	101	5-6					147	159		10.1002/iroh.201601852	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.201601852													WOS:000389313900001

Secchi-disk transparency varied from 10 m in winter to 2 m in September. Prior to the onset of stratification phosphate-phosphorus concentration was 4 .mu.g l-1 decreasing to undetectable values thereafter. Nitrate-nitrogen dropped from 590 .mu.g l-1 to about 100 .mu.g l-1 during the same time. The vernal bloom was dominated by Asterionella formosa Hass. which abruptly declined after silicon depletion. Spring growth ceased in early June, when Tabellaria flocculosa (Lyngb.) Kutz var. asterionelloides Grun. dominated. Oscillatoria rubescens D.C. and Microcystis aeruginosa Kutz. dominated summer and early autumn followed by the chrysophyte Dinobryon divergens Imh. and D. sociale Ehr. which formed up to 69% of total biovolume in October. Thereafter diatoms and Cryptophyceae (Rhodomonas lacustris Pascher and Ruttner, Cryptomonas pusilla Bach.) became abundant again. Maximum chlorophyll-a concentration in the epilimnion (16 .mu.g l-1) was reached during spring growth of the diatoms. During summer higher chlorophyll-a levels were always associated with the metalimnetic layer of Oscillatoria. Compared with earlier studies, both the total biovolume and the share of Oscillatoria rubescens significantly decreased because of reduced nutrient laoding of the lake and wash-out of Oscillatoria (theor. renewal time of the lake: 1.7 years).					; Dokulil, Martin/J-3464-2019	Dokulil, Martin/0000-0002-6369-1457; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				AUG 5	1986	138						9	24		10.1007/BF00027229	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00027229													WOS:A1986E070900003
J	BORCHERDING, J				BORCHERDING, J			THE ANNUAL REPRODUCTIVE-CYCLE OF THE FRESH-WATER MUSSEL DREISSENA-POLYMORPHA PALLAS IN LAKES	OECOLOGIA												The annual development of the gonads of Dreissena polymorpha was studied at three sampling sites in two lakes over 3 and 1 1/2 years, respectively. A resting stage occurred after the last spawning in summer/autumn. Oogenesis (accompanied by multiplying segmentation of the oogonia and early growth processes of its oocytes) restarted in specimens at least 1 year old at low temperatures (below 10-degrees-C) during winter and early spring. At one location (Fuhlinger See) the onset of the spawning season was correlated with an increase of water temperatures above 12-degrees-C. At 2 m depth, two main spawning periods in May and August were normally recognized, the first at temperatures of 12-16-degrees-C, the second at 16-21-degrees-C. It was clearly demonstrated for the first time in Dreissena polymorpha that the oocytes became mature in successive cohorts within one gonad. A female mussel may spawn several times during the reproductive season. At 9 m depth, the onset of spawning also started at about 12-degrees-C; this occurred in late summer, with two spawning periods within 1 month at a temperature range of 12-16-degrees-C. At another location (Heider Bergsee) the size of the gonads and the oocytes was reduced during April of both years studied, when food supply was low simultaneously with rapidly rising water temperatures in this shallow lake. There was no spawning period during spring. The major spawning period was delayed until July (temperatures 19-22-degrees-C). This shows (1) the synchronizing influence of low winter temperatures on the annual reproductive cycle and (2) a temperature threshold of at least 12-degrees-C for the start of the spawning processes. The results are discussed with regard to the geographical limits of further spread of Dreissena polymorpha.

This study analyzed 16 years data in Lake Erken, Sweden and revealed four baselines of phytoplankton succession with their underlying drivers. Results showed that there were two diatom-dominated phases annually. The vernal community was dominated by centric diatoms larger than 15 A mu m (functional groups B and C) which were fast-growing diatoms being highly efficient in the use of nutrients. The autumn community was comprised mainly meroplanktonic mixing-dependent Aulacoseira granulata and Fragilaria sp. (MP and P) or/and large centric diatoms (B). Between the two mixing-phases with diatoms, a Gloeotrichia echinulata (H 2) bloom occurred due to its preference for a stratified water column with elevated water temperatures and high light availability. The summer stratification in Lake Erken was weak and short, thus, favoring meroplanktonic diatoms to peak once the lake turned over in early autumn. Lake Erken represents an intermediate case between a highly mixed polymictic lake and a lake with strong summer stratification, where the observed stratification patterns allowed the development of an autumn diatom phase similar, by extent, to the vernal one and mainly dominated by meroplanktonic diatoms.

In order to understand formation of laminated sediments in the eutrophic Lake Kierskie (western Poland) we conducted a year-round (November 2015-October 2016), monthly sediment trap study along with physico-chemical water properties, water transparency, hardness, alkalinity, nutrients and solute content, trophic state indices, and the phytoplankton assemblage monitoring. Sedimentation in Lake Kierskie primarily resulted from the activity of photosynthetic organisms. The maxima of biogenic silica accumulation were synchronous with the bloom of centric diatoms observed in March and April. These were followed by the most intensive precipitation of CaCO3 noted between mid-April and mid-June, that corroborated with the domination of Stephanodiscus hantzschii and small flagellate forms acting as nucleation sites for crystal formation. At the same time shift from the diatom-dominated assemblages to the communities composed of chlorophytes, cryptophytes, and dinoflagellates, the groups with cellulose external covering, resulted in decreased proportion between SiO2 and organic matter. CaCO3 precipitation continued in the summer months, however its amount decreased simultaneously with a drop in S. hantzschii biomass. The significant overall flux of biogenically mediated materials from epilimnion was promoted by eutrophic towards hypertrophic conditions in Lake Kierskie revealed by the trophic state indices. Mixing of the water column in autumn triggered resuspension and redeposition of the previously deposited sediments resulting in the second, after the early spring, maximum sediment flux. Minima of sediment accumulation were observed during the winter water stratification when the smallest particles sedimented from suspension. The sediment flux to the lake bottom recorded by us in a 1-year, monthly sediment trap study matches a sequence of pale, whitish lamina deposited during spring and summer, followed by dark, grayish or black lamina deposited in the autumn and winter, observed in the macroscopic investigation of the short (0.5 m) core from Lake Kierskie. Preservation of distinct laminations in the dimictic Lake Kierskie is supported by anoxic hypolimnion developed under the high supply of organic matter from epilimnion of this highly eutrophic lake.					; Apolinarska, Karina/AAZ-3588-2020; Pleskot, Krzysztof/HTQ-1814-2023; Pełechaty, Mariusz/HDN-8393-2022; Siepak, Marcin/HGD-4520-2022	Pelechaty, Mariusz/0000-0002-4075-6561; Pleskot, Krzysztof/0000-0002-3724-1700; Apolinarska, Karina/0000-0002-3507-5139; Siepak, Marcin/0000-0002-6364-874X; Pelechata, Aleksandra/0000-0002-7487-8348; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				APR	2020	63	4					283	304		10.1007/s10933-020-00116-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-020-00116-2		FEB 2020											WOS:000516263200001
J	Dingemanse, NJ; Kalkman, VJ				Dingemanse, Niels J.; Kalkman, Vincent J.			Changing temperature regimes have advanced the phenology of Odonata in the Netherlands	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												1. Responses of biota to climate change have been well documented for a restricted number of taxa. This study examined shifts in phenology of 37 species of the aquatic insect order Odonata in the Netherlands over the last decade. 2. The present study shows that adults of the Dutch dragonflies and damselflies have advanced their flight dates over recent years due to complex effects of changing temperature regimes on the timing of adult flight dates. 3. Flight dates did not respond to changes in autumn/winter temperatures, advanced with increases in spring temperatures of the focal and previous year, and delayed with increases in summer temperatures of the previous year. Climate change consequently advanced the flight dates of the Odonata because only spring temperatures have increased during the study period. 4. The findings imply that climate change can evoke strong phenological responses in aquatic insects. Moreover, shifts in phenology due to climate change are likely to vary both spatially or temporally, depending on the exact nature of climate change.					; Dingemanse, Niels/ABE-6880-2020; Kalkman, Vincent/D-5275-2013	Kalkman, Vincent/0000-0002-1484-7865; Dingemanse, Niels/0000-0003-3320-0861													0307-6946					JUN	2008	33	3					394	402		10.1111/j.1365-2311.2007.00982.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2311.2007.00982.x													WOS:000255456000010
J	Deng, WF; Wei, GJ; Yu, KF; Zhao, JX				Deng, Wenfeng; Wei, Gangjian; Yu, Kefu; Zhao, Jian-xin			Variations in the timing of the rainy season in the northern South China Sea during the middle to late Holocene	PALEOCEANOGRAPHY												The amount and timing of precipitation in East Asia are important aspects of the East Asian monsoon. Many paleoclimate records that act as proxies for wet or dry climatic conditions have been linked to changes in precipitation amounts and are thus used to indicate changes in the East Asian monsoon system. However, few studies have examined changes in the timing of the rainy season. Here, we consider the timing of the seasonal precipitation cycle during the middle to late Holocene, using records derived from coupled high-resolution Sr/Ca and O-18 records preserved in Porites corals from the northern South China Sea. These records indicate that the timing of the rainy season in this region changed during the middle to late Holocene. The present-day rainy season generally occurs over the summer and autumn (June-October), which has also been recorded in Porites coral, whereas the rainy season at around 1500 and 6800years B.P. occurred through the autumn and winter (August-December), and the rainy season at around 2540 and 5000years B.P. occurred in the winter and spring (January-April or December-March). During the period around 5900years B.P., the seasonal distribution of precipitation varied from year to year. These shifts in the timing of the rainy season require changes in temperature and humidity patterns and appear to agree with changes in the magnetic susceptibility of lake sediments in this region, which may reflect movements of the Intertropical Convergence Zone location and changes in atmospheric circulation during the middle to late Holocene.

Investigations were carried out in summer, autumn, and winter of 2007/2008 and early spring of 2008. In both lakes, a domination of P agardhii in relation to the total cyanobacterial biomass oscillated, throughout the year, almost on the same level between 75 and 99%. The PCR analysis of mcyE gene indicated a presence of toxigenic strains in all collected samples. In addition, the result of semiquantification of mcyE gene band showed that both lakes seem to have variable, throughout the seasons, toxigenic potential with the highest density of mcyE gene in spring. Two separate methods were used: protein phosphatase inhibition assay for estimation of MCs toxicity (biological activity) and high-performance liquid chromatography for determination of MCs concentration (quantity). The highest seasonal MCs toxicity (15.8 mu g/L Bytynskie and 21.9 mu g/L Lubosinskie) and concentration (34.6 mu g/L Bytynskie and 52.2 mu g/L Lubosinskie) were determined in autumn and indicated on a Second Alert Level, according to WHO guidelines for bathing water. The results showed the ability of toxigenic strains of cyanobacteria dominated by P agardhii to remain and produce MCs during the whole year. This was confirmed by significant correlations between P. agardhii biomass and MCs concentrations in both lakes (r = 0.84, Bninskie and r = 0.79, Lubosinskie; P < 0.05).

Hegewald, a new genus Pseudotetraedriella E. Hegewald, and a new species Pseudotetraedriella kamillae E. Hegewald et J. Padisak are described. The species differs markedly from the described species with tetralobular/quadrangular shape like Tetraedron (Chlorophyta) or Tetraedriella (Xanthophyceae); differences to other morphologically similar species (Tetraedron minimum f. brachiata Printz, T. minimum f. tetralobulatum Reinsch, T. minutissimum Korsh., T. mediocris Hindak, T. quadrilobatum G. M. Smith, T. regulare Kutzing, Tetraedriella jovetii (Bourr.) Bourr. (=Pseudostaurastrum jovetii Bourr., Polyedrium minimum f. tetralobula Reinsch) are discussed. 18S rDNA sequence analyses demonstrated its close relationship with a morphologically different, aerophytic species, Monodopsis subterranea, within the class Eustigmatophyceae (Heterokontophyta). Pseudotetraedriella kamillae is typically occurring in the cold season (autumn-winter-spring), commonly in small amounts. Quantitative data from the stratifying, oligotrophic Lake Stechlin, N. Germany show that the population growths in the early spring isothermal period with an estimated doubling time of 46 days. Being a non-motile species, its abundance falls below detection level during the stratification period. In the period 1995-2002 with weekly-biweekly sampling its maximum abundance was recorded as 2.24 mu g L-1, corresponding to 0.41% of total biomass.

Microbial-driven impact on aquatic phosphate fluxes in a coastal peatland	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Polyphosphate-accumulating microbial mats can influence PO43- concentration in the benthic zone. To investigate the role of microbial mats in benthic P cycling, short peat cores including supernatant water from a coastal fen in NE Germany (southern Baltic Sea) were incubated in winter, summer and fall under 3 conditions: in situ, elevated temperature and oxygen-depletion. Bottom water PO43- concentrations decreased in treatments where a microbial mat had formed (summer and winter) but not in the mat-deficient fall treatment. The mats were densely populated with polyphosphate-rich Lyngbya sp. filaments. On the last day of incubation, PO43- concentrations in the oxygen-depleted bottom water were lower in the winter (70x) and summer (44x) than in the fall treatment, demonstrating the significant effect of microbial mats on PO43- fluxes, even under oxygen-depleted conditions. Mean polyphosphate-P content in the upper 1 cm peat layer of 8 freshly collected winter cores was 2.23 mu mol g-1 (5% of total P), comprising a noticeable percentage of the P reservoir. Low sediment Fe:P molar ratios among the cores (5.9-6.3) indicated that P-adsorption sites in Fe-P compounds were fairly saturated and had limited efficiency in precipitating additional bottom water PO43-. Using known temperature-dependent coefficients for biological systems, we estimate that bottom water PO43- concentrations in temperature-elevated cores were reduced by 96% in the presence of a microbial mat. We propose that a microbial mat can take up a large amount of dissolved inorganic P, highlighting its regulatory role in coastal peatland P fluxes under varying environmental conditions.					; Schulz-Vogt, Heide/I-1397-2012	Schulz-Vogt, Heide/0000-0003-3638-6139; Choo, Simeon/0000-0002-3779-4639; 													0171-8630	1616-1599				DEC 8	2022	702						19	38		10.3354/meps14210	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps14210													WOS:000893296600002

Winter Accumulation of Methane and its Variable Timing of Release from Thermokarst Lakes in Subarctic Peatlands	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Previous studies of thermokarst lakes have drawn attention to the potential for accumulation of CH4 under the ice and its subsequent release in spring; however, such observations have not been available for thermokarst waters in carbon-rich peatlands. Here we undertook a winter profiling of five black-water lakes located on eroding permafrost peatlands in subarctic Quebec for comparison with summer profiles and used a 2-year data set of automated water temperature, conductivity, and oxygen measurements to evaluate how the annual mixing dynamics may affect the venting of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. All of the sampled lakes contained large amounts of dissolved CH4 under their winter ice cover. These sub-ice concentrations were up to 5 orders of magnitude above air equilibrium (i.e., the expected concentration in lake water equilibrated with the atmosphere), resulting in calculated emission rates at ice breakup that would be 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than midsummer averages. The amount of CO2 dissolved in the water column was reduced in winter, and the estimated ratio of potential diffusive CO2 to CH4 emission in spring was half the measured summer ratio, suggesting a seasonal shift in methanogenesis and bacterial activity. All surface lake ice contained bubbles of CH4 and CO2, but this amounted to <5% of the total amount of the dissolved CH4 and CO2 in the corresponding lake water column. The continuous logging records suggested that lake morphometry may play a role in controlling the timing and extent of CH4 and CO2 release from the water column to the atmosphere.

J	Wille, C; Kutzbach, L; Sachs, T; Wagner, D; Pfeiffer, EM				Wille, Christian; Kutzbach, Lars; Sachs, Torsten; Wagner, Dirk; Pfeiffer, Eva-Maria			Methane emission from Siberian arctic polygonal tundra: eddy covariance measurements and modeling	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Eddy covariance measurements of methane flux were carried out in an arctic tundra landscape in the central Lena River Delta at 72 degrees N. The measurements covered the seasonal course of mid-summer to early winter in 2003 and early spring to mid-summer in 2004, including the periods of spring thaw and autumnal freeze back. The study site is characterized by very cold and deep permafrost and a continental climate with a mean annual air temperature of -14.7 degrees C. The surface is characterized by wet polygonal tundra, with a micro-relief consisting of raised moderately dry sites, depressed wet sites, polygonal ponds, and lakes. We found relatively low fluxes of typically 30 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1) during mid-summer and identified soil temperature and near-surface atmospheric turbulence as the factors controlling methane emission. The influence of atmospheric turbulence was attributed to the high coverage of open water surfaces in the tundra. The soil thaw depth and water table position were found to have no clear effect on methane fluxes. The excess emission during spring thaw was estimated to be about 3% of the total flux measured during June-October. Winter emissions were modeled based on the functional relationships found in the measured data. The annual methane emission was estimated to be 3.15 g m(-2). This is low compared with values reported for similar ecosystems. Reason for this were thought to be the very low permafrost temperature in the study region, the sandy soil texture and low bio-availability of nutrients in the soils, and the high surface coverage of moist to dry micro-sites. The methane emission accounted for about 14% of the annual ecosystem carbon balance. Considering the global warming potential of methane, the methane emission turned the tundra into an effective greenhouse gas source.

J	STEMBERGER, RS				STEMBERGER, RS			AN INVENTORY OF ROTIFER SPECIES-DIVERSITY OF NORTHERN MICHIGAN INLAND LAKES	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												More than 160 taxa representing 41 genera were identified from this extensive first time inventory of rotifers from inland lakes of northern lower Michigan. About 30 species of planktonic rotifers (36 species of total rotifers) were found per lake based on 8 collections (1 per season) for a 2 year period (summer 1973-winter 1975). This unusually large number of species may reflect the advantage of the year around sampling routine. Eight of the 75 planktonic species (11%) were endemic to North America. Large oligomesotrophic lakes contained nearly twice the number of planktonic species (34) as small, hypereutrophic bog lakes (18). WIldlife impoundments had the greatest number of planktonic species (39) and greatest number of total species recorded (65). Summer and fall collections contained .apprx. 60% of the total numbers of species found per lake whereas winter and spring collection had only 32% and 47% of total species, respectively. The inventory produced 2 new species in the genera Notholca and Keratella suggesting a high probability that many undescribed species still exist in Michigan and in the United States. Detailed taxonomic surveys of the zooplankton of the United States have not been undertaken so that biogeography and species diversity are poorly known. The rotifer communities of each lake can be reconstructed from figures and tables making this inventory an important benchmark for evaluating future regional environmental change.																			0003-9136					MAY	1990	118	3					283	302																WOS:A1990DG51400002

We measured the chemical composition of epilithon and its inorganic P uptake kinetics using isotope P-33 in three deep oligo- to mesotrophic post-mining lakes in April, July, and October 2019. Over the sampling period, epilithon biomass doubled, while the P content in biomass dropped to 60% of the April values, and the seasonal changes in P content expressed per epilithon area were only marginal and statistically not significant. High epilithic C:P molar ratios (677 on average) suggested strong P deficiency in all investigated lakes. Regarding the kinetic parameters of phosphorus uptake, maximum uptake velocity (V-max, seasonal range 1.9-129 mg P g OM-1 h(-1)) decreased by an order of magnitude from April to October, while half-saturation constant (K-S, seasonal range 3.9-135 mg P L-1) did not show any consistent temporal trend. Values of epilithic specific P uptake affinity (SPUA(E), seasonal range 0.08-3.1 L g OM-1 h(-1)) decreased from spring to autumn and were two to four orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding values for seston (SPUA(sest)), which showed an opposite trend. Considering our results, we suggest a possible mechanism underlying a stable coexistence of planktonic and epilithic microorganisms, with plankton prospering mostly in summer and autumn and epilithon in winter and spring season. Additionally, a phenomenon of reversible abiotic P adsorption on epilithon was observed.

The purpose was to obtain detailed information about the composition variations in the phytoplankton community during the serious drought in 2009 - 2010 and to determine the driving force for the succession of the dominant genera. A total of 147 phytoplankton species were identified during our investigation. Among the 7 main divisions, the maximum contribution (69%) belongs to the Chlorophyta division. The alternation of the dominant group was Cyanophyta, Chlorophyta, and Bacillariophyta. The weekly variations in cell abundance and biomass of the dominant phytoplankton genera were examined. A succession characterized by Psephonema and Asterionella (spring) -> Melosira (summer) -> Microcystis (autumn) -> Microcystis and Psephonema (winter) emerged from the monthly average biomass. Weekly variations in the Shannon Weaver index ranged between 0.269 and 2.183. Redundancy analysis results showed varied effects of environmental factors on the different phytoplankton dominant genera, with water temperature as the driving force for the seasonal succession of the dominant genera. The shift in succession pattern is induced by light intensity variation. In addition, the dominance of Psephonema in winter is the first report in Lake Erhai in recent years.					; Hu, Ming-Ming/AAX-4704-2020	Wang, Gaohong/0000-0001-5896-066X; 													1018-4619	1610-2304					2011	20	9					2221	2231																WOS:000294979300006

Seasonal patterns of pollen sedimentation in Lake MontcortSs (Central Pyrenees) and potential applications to high-resolution paleoecology: a 2-year pilot study	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Lakes with varved sediments are especially well suited for paleoecological study, from annual to even seasonal resolution. The interpretative power of such high-resolution paleoenvironmental reconstructions relies on the availability of modern analogs with the same temporal resolution. We studied seasonal pollen sedimentation in varved Lake MontcortSs, Central Pyrenees (Spain), as a modern analog for high-resolution reconstruction of Late Holocene vegetation and landscape dynamics. Seasonal samples were obtained from sediment traps that were submerged near the maximum water depth for a 2-year period (fall 2013 to fall 2015). Seasonal pollen sedimentation was compared with meteorological variables from a nearby weather station. Bulk pollen sedimentation, dominated by Pinus (pine) and Quercus (oak), followed a clear seasonal pattern that peaked during the spring/summer, coinciding with maximum temperature and precipitation, minimum relative humidity and moderate winds from the SSE. Pollen sedimentation lags (PSL) were observed for most pollen types, as substantial amounts of pollen were found in the traps outside of their respective flowering seasons. Two pollen assemblages were clearly differentiated by their taxonomic composition, corresponding to spring/summer and fall/winter. This pattern is consistent with existing interpretation of the sediment varves, specifically, that varves are formed by two-layer couplets that represent the same seasonality as pollen. We concluded that pollen sedimentation in Lake MontcortSs exhibits a strong seasonal signal in the quantity of pollen, the taxonomic composition of the pollen assembalges, and relationships between the pollen and meteorological variables. Thus, varved sediments provide a potentially powerful tool for paleoecological reconstruction at seasonal resolution. This method could be used not only to identify paleoenvironmental trends, but also to identify annual layers and therefore date sediments, even in the absence of evident sediment laminations. A satisfactory explanation of PSL will require further studies that examine internal lake dynamics and pollen production/dispersal patterns.					; Vegas-Vilarrúbia, Teresa/B-2973-2008; Cañellas-Boltà, Núria/ABF-9600-2021; Buchaca, Teresa/L-1679-2014; Sigro, Javier/L-2329-2017; Pérez-Zanón, Núria/ABE-8045-2021; Rull, Valentí/P-5402-2019	Vegas-Vilarrubia, Teresa/0000-0001-9136-136X; Trapote/0000-0003-1676-8842; Buchaca, Teresa/0000-0001-7933-8992; Sigro, Javier/0000-0003-0969-0338; Rull, Valenti/0000-0002-9961-105X; Perez-Zanon, Nuria/0000-0001-8568-3071													0921-2728	1573-0417				JAN	2017	57	1					95	108		10.1007/s10933-016-9933-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-016-9933-z													WOS:000392073600007

However, little is known about the function of hydrological factors in influencing the seasonal dynamics of plankton. We used multivariate and Partial Least Squares Path Modeling to analyze the seasonal variation in crustacean zooplankton and related environmental factors from winter 2009 to winter 2016 in Lake Poyang, the largest freshwater lake in China. We found a distinct seasonal pattern in zooplankton development, which deviated, in part, from the PEG model, as we found indications of (1) a weaker degree of food limitation in winter and spring, likely due to high concentrations of allochthonous sources caused by decomposition of seasonally flooded hygrophytes, also affecting sediment dynamics; (2) a peak in crustacean zooplankton biomass in summer when the water level was high (and predation was lower), and where horizontal transport of zooplankton from the littoral zone to the pelagic was possibleand (3) a higher predation pressure in autumn, likely due to a shrinking water volume that left the fish concentrated in less water. The majority of these differences can be attributed to the direct or indirect impacts of physical factor variation.

By the analysis of the synoptic data, we identified 309 dusty days in Western Iran during the period 2000-2016. A dusty day is diagnosed if under low horizontal visibility (< 1 km), the dust in suspension is reported at least once a day in at least three synoptic stations. We identified dust sources in the Middle East based on the analysis of the MOD04L2 data from MODIS, the backward HYSPLIT trajectory model, and synoptic conditions. The most influential sources affecting Western Iran are located on the shore and northwest of Lake Tharthar, Hour-al-Azim Marsh, the shore of Razzaza, Habbaniyah Lakes, and West Hammar Marsh, which contributed to 110, 79, 59, 56, and 51 dusty days, respectively. The fluctuation of the surface water area largely contributes to the variability of dusty days in Western Iran. Indeed, the peak dust activity in Western Iran was during the period 2008-2012 in response to the substantial shrinkage of the main water bodies in Iraq. The main sources of dust influencing Western Iran are located in northern and eastern Saudi Arabia in spring, Deir ez-Zur in Syria's Aleppo and Raqqa in summer, and Syria's Homs and Al-Hasakah in winter and spring. Sources of dust in Western Iraq and in most parts of entire Iraq have, respectively, led to the formation of summer and spring dust events in Western Iran. Decreased precipitation in the Middle East from autumn 2007 to 2012 and the occurrence of severe droughts have also contributed to the shrinkage of lakes and wetlands, as well as the reduced agricultural productivity in the Middle East, all of which contributed to the intensification of dust activity in Western Iran in recent decades.					alizadeh, omid/AAO-5922-2021; Darvishi Boloorani, Ali/AAA-9910-2022; Beyranvand, Azar/JAC-0498-2023	Alizadeh, Omid/0000-0003-4801-6338													2045-2322					SEP 27	2023	13	1							16158	10.1038/s41598-023-42173-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-42173-3								37758797					WOS:001099946000075

Ciliate numbers ranged from 3 to 47 cells ml(-1). At the thermocline and oxycline region, the highest ciliate numbers were observed in autumn, with Coleps hirtus as the dominant species. Maximum heterotrophic nanoflagellate abundance (1300 cells ml(-1)) was found in the epilimnion in winter spring, minimum numbers (66 cells ml(-1)) occurred in autumn. Bacteria ranged from 10(5) to 3.10(7) cells ml(-1) with highest numbers at the decline of the Peridinium gatunense bloom and the lowest during winter. Protozoa, especially ciliates, appeared to be important food sources for metazooplankton. Top-down control is an important factor determining the structure of the microbial loop in Lake Kinneret.																			0948-3055	1616-1564				FEB 13	1998	14	2					161	170		10.3354/ame014161	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame014161													WOS:000072138900007

Four immature and one adult individual were equipped with transmitters in Israel. Three of these pelicans did not migrate from Israel during the tracking period. One immature male pelican accomplished two spring migrations to Europe and an autumn migration back to Israel, where it over-wintered. Its northward routes passed through Lebanon, Syria, Turkey and Bulgaria and it arrived at the River Danube after three weeks. This individual's vast ranging areas in Europe during two consecutive summers included the Aegean Sea, Bulgaria, Greece and Romania, but excluded the Danube River breeding colony. One individual continued its migration to Africa. It reached the Sudd area in southern Sudan after two stops at Lake Nasser and in Jebel Aulia Dam on the White Nile. Its range in Africa included the Sudd, Lake Roseires on the Blue Nile, the lakes of the Ethiopian Great Valley and Lake Rudolf in Kenya. Although this information was obtained from a small number of individuals it is an essential addition to the body of knowledge required in order to establish a protection policy for this migratory species.

We attached satellite-tracked radiotransmitters to 34 adult females in 1996 and 1997 to refine our understanding of movements to and from the breeding ground in northern Quebec, Geese breeding near the: coasts of Hudson Bay and northern Ungava Bay migrated through western Quebec, southeastern Ontario, and central New York to wintering areas in the Chesapeake-Delaware Bay region of the Atlantic Coast. Geese nesting in the southern Ungava Bay region migrated through central Quebec to the Lake Champlain-Hudson River drainage area of eastern New York and the western section of the New England states. Their winter terminus was primarily north of 40 degrees latitude. Both fall and spring migrations were highly synchronized. Geese left the breeding range in late September and were not available for sport harvest in Canada and the United States until October. All birds were on their winter range by mid- to late October Spring migration began in late February from the Chesapeake-Delaware Bay region, with birds staving in central New York and southeastern Ontario during March and April. A major movement north occurred in early May 1997 and 1998, with birds arriving on their breeding grounds within 1-2 weeks. Limited opportunity for subsistence harvest was detected during spring and fall migration periods. Our data support the use of experimental hunting seasons in September and late winter to reduce numbers of resident Canada geese while minimizing the incidental harvest of AP geese.																			0022-541X					APR	2001	65	2					242	247		10.2307/3802903	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3802903													WOS:000168066600008

The results of diversity and community structure showed that the diversity of the AOA community in rhizosphere soil of Reeds was higher than that in non- rhizosphere soil in spring and lower than that in non-rhizosphere soil in summer and autumn. In summer, the diversity of rhizosphere soil of Karelinia caspica was higher than that of non-rhizosphere soil and lower than that of non-rhizosphere soil in spring and autumn. The diversity of rhizosphere soil of Halocnemum strobilaceum in 3 seasons was lower than that in non-rhizosphere soil. The diversity of rhizosphere soil of Salicornia was higher than that in non-rhizosphere soil in 3 seasons. In addition, the relative abundance of AOA in rhizosphere soil of 4 plants was higher than that in non-rhizosphere soil. The AOA community in all soil samples was mainly concentrated in Crenarchaeota and Thaumarchaeota. Redundancy analysis results showed salinity, soil water moisture, pH, and soil organic matter were important factors affecting the differentiation of AOA communities.																			0008-4166	1480-3275				APR	2021	67	4					271	280		10.1139/cjm-2020-0228	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjm-2020-0228								32991817					WOS:000637746000001

Methane-derived carbon contributions were estimated by a two-source mixing model using delta C-13 values of monthly particulate organic matter ( -29.5 to -20.8 parts per thousand) and methane-oxidizing bacteria (-85.7 parts per thousand). Large spatial and seasonal variability of methane-derived carbon contributions toC. plumosusand oligochaetes within the lake (0-38% and 0-32%, respectively) were observed, where contributions varied spatially along a gradient of sediment CH(4)concentration, but not dissolved oxygen. The results suggest that for bothC. plumosusand oligochaetes, spatial variabilities of the methane-derived carbon contributions are regulated by CH4. Seasonal variability of methane-derived carbon contributions toC. plumosusrevealed increases in summer and autumn following increases in CH4. Methane-derived biomass (methane-derived carbon% x biomass) ofC. plumosuswere also higher in summer and autumn, suggesting transfer of methane-derived carbon to higher trophic organisms may be larger during those seasons, and limited in winter and spring. Although oligochaetes did not show seasonal variability of methane-derived carbon contributions, they provided a consistent source of methane-derived biomass to higher trophic levels throughout the year. Our study demonstrates that two major macroinvertebrates complementarily contribute to fueling methane-derived carbon cycling through trophic transfer in a polymictic lake.					; Shinohara, Ryuichiro/I-3595-2014; Tsuchiya, Kenji/T-1541-2019	Matsuzaki, Shin-ichiro/0000-0003-2744-1343; Tsuchiya, Kenji/0000-0002-6644-1701; Shinohara, Ryuichiro/0000-0003-2716-3312; Kuwahara, Victor S./0000-0003-4171-3894; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				DEC	2020	65	12					3017	3031		10.1002/lno.11571	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11571		AUG 2020											WOS:000564004400001

However, the intensity of this effect can be influenced by the source of moisture, particularly in inland mountainous regions where the moisture sources are complex. Different combinations of moisture sources might affect the altitude effect. Focusing on the upper Shiyang River in the northern part of the Qilian Mountains in China, this study calculated the proportion of recycled moisture in precipitation and utilized the HYSPLIT model to determine the source of advective moisture. It explored the characteristics and mechanisms by which moisture sources affect the spatiotemporal variations in precipitation isotope effects within the study area. The findings indicated that: (a) The altitude effect follows a seasonal pattern: winter < autumn < spring < summer, with a reverse effect in winter. (b) As the contribution of recycled moisture to precipitation increases, the altitude effect of stable isotopes weakens, primarily due to the disruptive influence of recycled moisture on this effect. (c) The altitude effect of stable isotopes in precipitation is determined by the direction of the moisture source and its attributes. When the primary source of advective moisture runs perpendicular to the mountain range and the moisture migration speed is slow, the altitude effect is pronounced. Thus, although temperature directly causes the altitude effect, water vapor sources significantly influence it in inland mountainous regions.

Three types (shoreline reserves, natural and cut areas) around selected lakes were studied for seasonal use by moose using pellet-plot data supplemented by track counts and winter aerial surveys. Reserve areas had greater (P < 0.01) pellet-group densities than the natural and cut types during both winter periods. Results of aerial surveys corroborated pellet-group findings. No differenes (P > 0.05) in pellet-group densities or track counts were found among site types in the summer periods. Differences (P < 0.05) in track-plot crossings were observed among study lakes. Moose preference for shoreline reserves during winter appeared related to edges. Reserve types offered a greater amount of coniferous cover adjacent to an abundant source of browse than did natural and cut areas. Summer use by moose appears to be governed by availability of suitable aquatic feeding areas and terrestrial browse in adjacent cutovers.																			0022-541X	1937-2817					1983	47	3					673	685		10.2307/3808603	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3808603													WOS:A1983QZ57700009

The relative seasonal change in energy density (kcal/g wet weight) was similar in adults and immature fish, although immatures generally had lower caloric equivalents. Seasonal lows in caloric equivalents occurred in April for immature fish in their 1st yr (1.03 kcal/g) and in June for adults (1.30 kcal/g), whereas maxima were found in October for all age groups (2.30 kcal/g). Somatic energy losses during winter were 27% for adult females and 23% for males; spawning-related losses were higher (37% and 45%, respectively). Percent lipid followed the same seasonal trends as caloric equivalents with maxima in the fall (17% wet weight) and minima in late spring-summer (3-5%). Approximately 80% of gonad growth and maturation took place from April to late May when feeding was at a minimum. Energy requirements for gonad growth apparently came mainly from body lipid, although body protein also was used. Most body growth occurred in the fall. Seasonal increases and declines in growth were related to food availability, temperature and spawning. Annual die-offs correspond with seasonal energy lows, indicating that mortalities may be induced by insufficient feeding the previous fall.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1985	114	3					328	337		10.1577/1548-8659(1985)114<328:SEDOTA>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1985)114<328:SEDOTA>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1985ALC6400002
J	Bennion, H; Smith, MA				Bennion, H; Smith, MA			Variability in the water chemistry of shallow ponds in southeast England, with special reference to the seasonality of nutrients and implications for modelling trophic status	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The variability in water chemistry of samples taken on a monthly basis (October 1990-December 1991) from 31 shallow, artificial ponds in southeast England was examined. The survey revealed great within-year variation in the concentrations of nutrients. Total phosphorus (TP) concentrations displayed no overall marked seasonal pattern, although many sites experienced summer peaks with a simultaneous increase in soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations, indicating that sediment P release occurred. SRP and nitrate (NO3-N) concentrations displayed a marked seasonal pattern similar to that observed in deep, stratifying lakes, with 55% and 94% of the sites surveyed, respectively, experiencing a decline in concentrations in the spring, maintaining low levels throughout summer and the highest levels occurring in winter. Dissolved silica (SiO2-(Si) also displayed a marked seasonal distribution with a spring decline in concentrations associated with diatom growth, followed by an increase in the summer. The study demonstrated that intra-annual variability in nutrient concentrations is high and tends to be greatest in the most enriched waters. Thus, a high sampling frequency is required to provide representative annual mean data. Furthermore, annual means rather than winter-spring means provide more appropriate estimates of TP and SRP in these waters, owing to the importance of internal cycling of nutrients in summer. The findings are especially relevant to sampling strategy design and the averaging of seasonal water chemistry data for use in predictive models of lake trophic status.

J	Kilibarda, Z; Kilibarda, V				Kilibarda, Zoran; Kilibarda, Vesna			Seasonal geomorphic processes and rates of sand movement at Mount Baldy dune in Indiana, USA	AEOLIAN RESEARCH												Winds are very strong, frequent, and have high energy (annual DP similar to 800 VU) along the southern shores of Lake Michigan, allowing the coexistence of fixed and active dunes. Six years (2007-13) of monitoring Mount Baldy in the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore reveals that this is the most active coastal dune in the Great Lakes region. This paper documents aeolian processes and changes in the dune's morphology that occur temporarily, following storms, or seasonally, due to weather (climate) variations. Most of the sand transport in this area takes place during strong storms with gale force (>17.5 m/s) winds, which occur in the autumn and winter months. A single storm, such as the October 28-31, 2013 event, can contribute 25% of the annual sand transport and dune movement inland. In its most active year (June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012), Mount Baldy moved inland on average 4.34 m, with a maximum of 6.52 m along the blowout's axis (155 degrees azimuth). During this particularly active season, there were six storms with sustained gale force winds, winter air temperatures were warmer than average, and shelf ice on Lake Michigan lasted only one day. The dune is least active during the summer season, when the winds are weakest. The late fall and winter winds are the strongest. But in a typical year, most of the dune's advance inland takes place during the spring thaw when sand is released from over-steepened and lumpy slip face, allowing it to avalanche to the toe of the slip face. However, with a warming air temperatures, a reduction in the duration of winter shelf ice, and rising Lake Michigan levels, the annual rates of sand transport and dune movement may increase. The recent Mount Baldy management strategy, which includes planting vegetation and installing wind barriers on the dune's stoss side in an effort to fix the dune and stop its further movement inland, may potentially cause the destruction of the mobile sand, open dune habitat, resulting in the extinction of rare plants, insects, lizards, birds, and mammals.

The delta C-13 and delta N-15 isotopic ratios, physical-chemical parameters, nutrients and phytoplankton were analyzed ca. monthly over a hydrological year on the vertical profile at two stations (lacustrine and riverine). SPM quantity and composition were related to the hydrological annual dynamic. In Mediterranean reservoirs, water-level fluctuation is one of the most important stressors, largely dependent on the strong seasonality of climate and water exploitation for human uses. Mediterranean reservoirs show different phases during a hydrological year, alternating empty and low water level (summer-autumn), re-filling (winter-spring) and high water (spring-summer) phases. Isotopic ratios of C and N were similar on the vertical profile and at the two stations during the low water phase, but differed during the re-filling and high water phases. Significant correlations were found between delta N-15 and water level, and between delta C-13 and temperature in the surface layer at the lacustrine station. An unusual delta C-13 distribution along the water column during the re-filling phase was interpreted on the basis of phytoplankton species composition, mainly due by Gymnodinium uberrimum.					; Camin, Federica/C-3765-2008; Luglie, Antonella/M-4321-2015; Lugliè, Antonella/M-4321-2015	Camin, Federica/0000-0003-0509-6745; Luglie, Antonella/0000-0001-6382-4208; 													0003-4088	2100-000X					2016	52						401	412		10.1051/limn/2016029	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2016029													WOS:000392816000007

Understanding the migratory patterns of cyprinids is thus essential for their management and conservation. Gnathopogon caerelescens, a small cyprinid species endemic to Lake Biwa (Japan), is one of the most important targets of inland fisheries. However, their abundance has dramatically decreased. By using an extensive alizarin complexone-mark-and-recapture program for of G. caerelescens juveniles, together with the collaboration of commercial fishermen, this cyprinid fish was demonstrated as: (1) migrating from a nursery lagoon toward the main lake and moving along the near-shore from spring to autumn; (2) migrating from the near-shore shallow habitats to off-shore deep habitats from autumn to winter; and (3) migrating to a nursery lagoon from off-shore deep habitats from winter to spring. These results highlighted the importance of protecting individual spawning/nursery habitats, and maintaining connectivity between each spawning/nursery habitat and the lake system.					; Sato, Takuya/LVS-3420-2024	Kikko, Tekeshi/0000-0003-3156-9374; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				MAR	2024	81	3					311	325		10.1139/cjfas-2022-0207	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2022-0207		FEB 2024											WOS:001161520800001

The results showed that SPAH concentration ranged from 0.21 to 1.07 mu g/L, in descending order as follows, summer, autumn, spring and winter. Comparing with the situations before relocation, there was a significant decrease in Fluorene, Phenanthrene and Anthracene levels. The content of Banzo[a] pyrene was in high level. Relatively high 16 EPA-PAHs concentrations were observed at downstream sites suggesting that after the industrial relocation, residual 16 EPA-PAHs in soil and sediments could be desorbed and resuspended in water. From a global perspective, contamination of subsurface water PAHs can be categorized as moderate level. Source analysis suggested that without industrial waste input, pyrogenic soureces were the major contributors for PAHs pollution in winter. Petrogenic and pyrogenic inputs were equally important sources for PAHs pollution in other seasons. Due to incomplete combustion of wood and coal, ecological risk of Banzo[a] pyrene was high in the winter, indicating that to alleviate 16 EPA-PAH contamination, segmented remediation and energy structure adjustment would be equally important in urban industrial relocation areas.

Zooplankton is an important component of aquatic organisms and has important biological and economical significance in freshwater ecosystems. However, traditional methods that rely on morphology to classify zooplankton require expert taxonomic skills. Moreover, traditional classification methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive, which is not practical for the design of conservation measures and ecological management tools based on zooplankton diversity assessment. Methods. We used DNA metabarcoding technology with two different markers: the nuclear small subunit ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COI), to analyze 72 zooplankton samples collected in 4 seasons and 9 locations from the Sanmenxia Reservoir. We investigated seasonal changes in the zooplankton community and their relationship with water environmental factors. Results. A total of 190 species of zooplankton were found, belonging to 12 phyla, 24 classes, 61 orders, 111 families, and 174 genera. Protozoa, especially ciliates, were the most diverse taxa. Richness and relative abundance of zooplankton showed significant seasonal changes. Both alpha and beta diversity showed seasonal trends: the diversity in summer and autumn was higher than that in winter and spring. The zooplankton diversity was most similar in winter and spring. By correlating metabarcoding data and water environmental factors, we proved that water temperature, chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen and ammoniacal nitrogen were the main environmental factors driving the seasonal changes in zooplankton in the Sanmenxia Reservoir. Water temperature, followed by total nitrogen, were the most influential factors. This study highlights the advantages and some limitations of zooplankton molecular biodiversity assessment using two molecular markers.

J	Taylor, AH				Taylor, AH			North-south shifts of the Gulf Stream: Ocean-atmosphere interactions in the North Atlantic	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Year-to-year changes in the latitude of the north wall of the Gulf Stream are very similar to those seen in the abundances of zooplankton observed by the Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey around the British Isles and also to those in the abundance of zooplankton in Lake Windermere. These connections must reflect changing weather patterns across the North Atlantic. The index of Gulf Stream position was constructed from the north wall data by principal components analysis. The first principal component, the index used, has eigenvector coefficients that all have the same sign, and is a measure of the latitude of the whole of the north wall. However, the component may represent the occurrences of meanders that are extensive in space and time rather than displacements of the Gulf Stream as a whole. This principal component has been used to calculate weighted averages of monthly mean sea-level pressure and of monthly mean numbers of cyclone tracks in order to show the changes in weather patterns associated with displacements of the north wall. Northward displacements of the north wall were accompanied by significantly reduced cyclone numbers in the northernmost regions of the Atlantic (annually and in the autumn) and in spring, summer, and autumn, a region of reduced atmospheric pressure in the central Atlantic area 40 degrees-60 degrees N, 30 degrees-50 degrees W (locally significant). There was some tendency (not significant) for storm tracks to be deflected around the south side of this region. The pattern in winter is less clear and shows no statistical significance. Changes in the vicinity of the British Isles were generally too small to be statistically significant but were generally consistent with a lower frequency of storms in spring and autumn. As the biological changes appear to be caused by variations in the onset of thermal stratification during the spring they may be the result of relatively small changes in the atmospheric forcing. The atmospheric changes show no indications of the sources of the Gulf Stream displacements, the anomaly winds opposing the displacements. This may be because meanders of the Gulf Stream are not simply related to any single atmospheric variable. The clearest and most statistically significant meteorological signals were all well downstream from the north wall. Although the displacements of the north wall are caused by changing weather patterns over the North Atlantic, the Gulf Stream is also a region of strong heat transfers from the ocean to the atmosphere. Sawyer's criterion indicates that distortions of this heat source could cause noticeable disturbances to the atmospheric circulation over the North Atlantic. A numerical model based on the analytical model of Smagorinsky is used to investigate the perturbations of the zonal circulation that might be caused by displacements of this local heat source. The predictions are in agreement with the changes seen in the central Atlantic during summer, spring, and autumn (but not those during winter). In the region where the model predicts atmospheric pressure reductions should occur, there are no positive correlation coefficients between the position of the north wall and the surface atmospheric pressure but a significant excess of negative correlation coefficients compared with chance, and northward shifts of the Gulf Stream were accompanied by significant reductions in atmospheric pressure. It is therefore possible that displacements of the north wall could influence weather patterns further east. The model predicts that any changes over the European continental shelf will be weak. An accurate description of the dynamics of the Gulf Stream may be an important requirement of coupled ocean-atmosphere models.																			0899-8418					MAY	1996	16	5					559	583		10.1002/(SICI)1097-0088(199605)16:5<559::AID-JOC26>3.0.CO;2-Z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0088(199605)16:5<559::AID-JOC26>3.0.CO;2-Z													WOS:A1996UR64700005
J	POLLINGHER, U				POLLINGHER, U			PHYTOPLANKTON PERIODICITY IN A SUBTROPICAL LAKE (LAKE KINNERET, ISRAEL)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Lake Kinneret is a subtropical monomictic lake characterized by a Pyrrhophyta-Chlorophyta assemblage, supplemented by Cyanophyta in some years. Concerning their abundance and seasonal occurrence, the phytoplanktonic algae belong to two groups: algae appearing in quantity at a definite annual period and algae present throughout the year. Four stages of algal succession occur in the lake. There is a marked periodicity in the phytoplankton composition with a high standing stock in winter-spring, due to the dinoflagellate water-bloom, and a low one during the summer months, related to the high stability of summer stratification. The annual succession at the species level has been an almost constant event in the lake for many years. The increase in nutrient concentrations in 1973 and 1974 increased the diversity and abundance of algae (except Peridinium) but did not lead to significant changes in algal succession. Conversely, the decrease of the zooplankton grazing pressure in 1975 and 1976 facilitated the development of algal maxima during summer-fall. They were caused by nanoplanktonic forms, and they developed without additional enrichment of nutrients. The algal abundance and diversity decreased. The years 1981 and 1982 were characterized by both an increase in phosphorus and a decrease in zooplankton. These conditions favored the concomitant abundance of many species and an increase of non-Pyrrhophyta biomass.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				AUG 5	1986	138						127	138		10.1007/BF00027236	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00027236													WOS:A1986E070900010

SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS IN THE CHEMICAL CONSTITUENTS AND NUTRITIONAL VALUE OF THE ABOVE-WATER TISSUES OF WATER LETTUCE (PISTIA STRATIOTES L.) AT GIZA PROVINCE, EGYPT	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The current research examined the potential of P. stratiotes to accumulate inorganic and organic nutrients from contaminated watercourses in Egypt. It also aimed to determine whether the biomass of the plant can be safely used as animal feed. Plant and water samples were taken seasonally for a year at three different sites using three randomly assigned quadrats. There were significant seasonal differences in water pH, dissolved oxygen, transparency, and water temperature. The highest biomass (314.52 g DM/m(2)) was recorded during spring, while the lowest (35.38 g DM/m(2)) during winter. Winter contributed to the highest contents of N and P (4.09 and 0.62%), while summer had the highest Ca (2.46%), and spring had the highest of Mg and Na (1.23 and 2.65%). The highest Co, Fe, Ni, and Pb values (17.28, 2517.36, 18.99, and 48.57 mg/kg) were highest in summer. The highest levels of crude protein and carbohydrates (26.47 and 42.59%), and the greatest levels of digestible crude protein, digestible energy, metabolized energy, net energy, and gross energy (21.07%, 2.79 Mcal/kg, 2.29 Mcal/kg, 1.14 Mcal/kg and 405.97 Kcal/100 g) were recorded in winter. Summer is ideal for harvesting P. stratiotes for phytoremediation, while winter is suitable for animal feeding.					; Eid, Ebrahem/O-2723-2013; Hessini, Kamel/AAX-7227-2021; Dakhil, Mohammed/U-9249-2019; Galal, Tarek/AAF-7604-2019	Galal, Tarek/0000-0001-9847-1051; 													1589-1623	1785-0037					2024	22	5					4931	4950		10.15666/aeer/2205_49314950	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/2205_49314950		JUL 2024											WOS:001326912700001

Churchill (Manitoba, Canada) and wintering in Swan Lake (Missouri, USA), were studied during the different periods of its yearly life cycle. The lowest serum FFA level was noted during the spring premigratory phase (early March) at Swan Lake, and the highest during molt (early Aug.) at Ft. Churchill. Serum FFA level during the spring post-migratory period (early May at Ft. ChChurchill) was significantly higher than that during the spring premigratory period and the breeding period (early at Ft. Churchill). No significant difference in FFA levels was noted between the fall premigratory (early Sept. at Ft. Churchill) and the fall postmigratory (mid-Oct. at Swan Lake) periods. The significance of the seasonal variations in serum FFA level is discussed in relation to the cyclic physiological events taking place in the bird.																			0003-9799						1977	85	5					871	875		10.3109/13813457709053288	http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/13813457709053288								79367					WOS:A1977EV51100003

The islands were emptied of local rodents before the introduction took place. One of the populations died out due to predation by stoats (Mustela erminea) already during the first summer. The new population introduced in autumn either didn''t survive over the next winter. The island was recolonized by the bank vole during next summer. The other population on an island of 1.7 hectares survived from summer 1983 until 1986 and reached a peak density of 69 individuals in August 1985. The immigrant bank voles were not able to establish a population during the presence of grey-sided voles. The voles preferred moist oligo-mesotrophic habitat with hummocs of Ledun palustre together with Vaccinium myrtillus and V. uliginosum. This habitat is characteristic to northern Finland. In summer the breeding females were mutually amicable but territorial. Mature males behaved mutually aggressive but were not strictly territorial. Contrary to the north Finnish populations the introduced voles aggregated on most suitable overwintering habitats. In spring there were lots of signs of foraging on those areas. Dispersal of the voles to neighbouring islands was also observed. Characteristics of the social organization and habitat preference of the introduced populations are compared with other populations. The social organization of this population was quite flexible, too.																			0044-3468					DEC	1987	52	6					354	363																WOS:A1987L389900004

The Baltic cisco (Coregonus albula) normally spawns in late autumn, but in a few lakes in Northern Europe sympatric autumn and spring- or winter-spawners have been described. So far, the evolutionary relationships and taxonomic status of these main life history forms have remained largely unclear. With microsatellites and mtDNA sequences, we analyzed extant and extinct spring- and autumn-spawners from a total of 23 Swedish localities, including sympatric populations. Published sequences from Baltic ciscoes in Germany and Finland, and Coregonus sardinella from North America were also included together with novel mtDNA sequences from Siberian C.sardinella. A clear genetic structure within Sweden was found that included two population assemblages markedly differentiated at microsatellites and apparently fixed for mtDNA haplotypes from two distinct clades. All sympatric Swedish populations belonged to the same assemblage, suggesting parallel evolution of spring-spawning rather than secondary contact. The pattern observed further suggests that postglacial immigration to Northern Europe occurred from at least two different refugia. Previous results showing that mtDNA in Baltic cisco is paraphyletic with respect to North American C.sardinella were confirmed. However, the inclusion of Siberian C.sardinella revealed a more complicated pattern, as these novel haplotypes were found within one of the two main C.albula clades and were clearly distinct from those in North American C.sardinella. The evolutionary history of Northern Hemisphere ciscoes thus seems to be more complex than previously recognized.					; Palm, Stefan/MVX-7141-2025; Palkopoulou, Eleftheria/JMC-5245-2023	Palm, Stefan/0000-0002-9890-8265; 													2045-7758					NOV	2014	4	22					4346	4360		10.1002/ece3.1299	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.1299								25540695					WOS:000345316200013

The identity of the snail, deduced from its external characteristics and the genitalia, comes closest to Oxyloma retusum (Lea, 1834). The species has a semelparous life cycle. The snails that survive the winter grow and reproduce from late March until the end of June when they reach their maximum size and die off. Their offspring (the spring generation) grow throughout the spring and the summer and reproduce briefly near the end of August. In the fall, the survivors from the spring generation and their offspring hibernate from November until the end of March. Snails mate by shell-mounting. In 89% of pairs, mating was anatomically reciprocal. During Courtship, one snail climbs on the shell of a prospective mate and circles the shell to initiate mating. In mating pairs with a shell length difference of more than 1 mm, the smaller snail was always on top. This suggests that one function of shell-circling during courtship may be to help the top snail judge its potential partner's size.																			0740-2783					FEB 26	2010	28	1-2					113	120																WOS:000275235300010

Only a few species dominated the phytoplankton. A recurrent pattern was observed in the seasonal succession: in winter, total cell numbers were invariably low, but freshwater algae, sluiced into the Wadden Sea from Ijssel Lake, showed highest densities in winter. A diatom spring peak was observed around mid-April, followed by a Phaeocystis pouchetii peak about three weeks later. Later in summer usually two more diatom peaks were present. The exact timing of the spring peak varied from year to year, with the extremes being late March and early May. A relatively late spring peak usually coincided with a relatively high turbidity in the preceding winter. An increase in total cell numbers was found over the 17-year observation period. Diatoms decreased from 1969 to 1974 but have increased since then, reaching values above those of 1969 during recent years.

Autumn sea ice loss warms the troposphere and generates anticyclonic anomaly over the Arctic region 1 month later. Under the effects of synoptic eddy-mean flow interaction and anomalous upward propagated planetary wave 2, the Arctic anticyclonic anomaly strengthens and develops toward Greenland-Northern Europe, accompanied by a weakened stratospheric polar vortex. In winter, following intra-seasonal downward propagation of stratospheric anomalies, the Northern European positive geopotential height anomalies enhance and expand downstream within 7 days, favoring Arctic cold air east of Novaya Zemlya southward (the hyperpolar path) accumulating in Siberia around Lake Baikal. In the subsequent 2-3 days, these cold anomalies rapidly intrude western-central China and induce abrupt sharp cooling, thus more frequent extreme low temperature there. In contrast, the role of autumn Barents-Kara (BK) sea ice loss exhibits quite different features, mainly favoring northwestern, northeastern and eastern China to experience increased frequency of extreme low temperature in winter.					; Chen, Wen/G-6058-2011; Graf, Hans/GQQ-2206-2022	Wu, Bingyi/0000-0001-8434-0739; Chen, Wen/0000-0001-9327-9079; 													2169-897X	2169-8996				JUN 27	2023	128	12							e2023JD038547	10.1029/2023JD038547	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023JD038547													WOS:001022735500001
J	Scott, RW; Huff, FA				Scott, RW; Huff, FA			Impacts of the Great Lakes on regional climate conditions	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Estimates of lake-induced spatial changes of six climate variables (precipitation, mean minimum and mean maximum temperatures, cloud cover, vapor pressure, and wind speed) were derived for the entire Great Lakes basin. These patterns were estimated by a comparison of maps of each weather variable using: (1) all regional climate data, and (2) regional data when observations within an 80-km zone around the lakes were removed. Results generally confirm expectations and prior findings, but point to inadequacies in data collection that limit a highly precise analysis. Lake effects are most noticeable in precipitation and temperature and vary considerably by season, time of day, and lake size. Greatest lake influences are found near Lake Superior where up to 100% more precipitation falls downwind of the lake in winter compared to that expected without its presence. During summer, all lakes cause a downwind decrease in rainfall of 10% to 20%. Mean minimum temperatures in the basin are higher in all seasons and over all lakes. Lake-induced reductions in mean maximum temperatures in the region are observed during spring and summer. Effects on cloud cover are greatest during winter and show increases of approximately 25% in areas downwind of Lakes Superior and Michigan. Conversely, the cool summertime waters of Lakes Michigan and Huron reduce cloudiness roughly 10%. Variations in vapor pressure are consistent with observed changes in temperature. Amounts in winter are estimated to be 10% to 15% higher across the center of the basin, but decrease by roughly 5% to 10% at many lake shore sites in summer. Seasonal wind speed data were considered to lack an appropriate number of quality long-term climate stations to determine spatial lake effects. Surface elevations, increasing east of the basin, complicated detection of effects due solely to the lakes.																			0380-1330						1996	22	4					845	863		10.1016/S0380-1330(96)71006-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(96)71006-7													WOS:A1996WD85300007

Lake Nautajarvi's clastic-organic varves appear in X-ray images as a succession of dark and pate stripes, pale ones being the spring detrital minerogenic layers and dark ones organic matter laid down during the time of summer, autumn and winter ice cover. Owing to the sharp contrast of the minerogenic spring layer, a semiautomatic tree-ring width mid density measurement DendroScan system was applied to obtain seasonal/annual data of relative X-ray density. Mean density of BSEI was also acquired. Then BSEI were processed to produce black and white images, where white pixels represent the clay-rich sedimentary matrix and black pixels the particles in the matrix: silt- or sand-sized, terrigenous grains, authigenic particles and diatoms. Measurements of the size of the detrital particles forming the varves were obtained. For each varve, mean grey-level values in BSEI correlated well with the mean grey-level values of X-ray images, but grain size obtained on BSEI did not correlate with any parameters computed from X-ray radiography.

Total of 60 blue crab samples were caught and investigated monthly between June 2009 and May 2010. Concentrations of trace metals in tissues were measured by ICP-AES. Concentration of Cr, Fe, As and Hg were found higher in spring than other season while Cd, Zn, As, Hg and Se showed highest concentration in hepatopancreas. IMBI values in all tissues were higher on spring and summer. On the other hand IMBI values calculated were higher in shell than other tissues. Result of high IMBI values on spring can explain due to the fact that increasing MPI value of Cd, Pb, Fe and Zn on spring while high IMBI values on summer affected by high MPI value of Cd, Pb and Mn. Cd accumulation on autumn and spring also Pb accumulation on every season in blue crab were found higher than the European Units limits for human consumption in edible parts of the crab samples and posed a risk for human health.					genc, tuncer/ADC-6308-2022														0367-8318					JAN	2015	85	1					94	99																WOS:000348695800024

Diversity and spatial distribution patterns of the benthic macrofauna communities in the southeast of the Caspian Sea (Golestan Province- Iran) in relation to environmental conditions	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCES												Biodiversity and structure of the benthic macrofauna communities were studied in the southeast the Caspian Sea (Golestan Province - Iran) during one year from October 2014 to September 2015. Seasonal samplings were done at 6 stations in 3 transects. Depth, temperature, salinity, pH, E.C., total organic matter and grain size were measured. More than 4,037 individuals belonging to five orders, Polychaeta, Oligochaeta, Bivalvia, Diptera and Amphipoda, and eight families including Nereididae, Spionidae, Amphartidae, Tubificidae, Smelidae, Cardiidae, Chironomidae and Gammaridae were identified. In terms of total individuals, Streblospio gynobranchiata, Hypania invalida and Cerastoderma lamarcki, were the most abundant species, and Polychaeta were dominant in the research region. The highest density of all species was observed in autumn (1515 ind m(2)) and the lowest was observed in summer (698 ind m(2)). The maximum diversity, richness, and evenness were 1.36, 0.6 and 0.98, respectively. The results of distance-based redundancy analysis (db-RDA) showed that environmental factors such as salinity, depth and substrate type were all important in detecting the distribution pattern of macrobenthic species in the research region. The dominant species, S. gynobranchiata, was distributed in the areas with smaller grain size and higher TOM and muddy sediments and had the most correlation with salinity, temperature, pH and E.C. Species such as T fraseri. H. invalida and P. robustoides showed more dependency on TOM and mud factors in the spring and summer, while their dependency became lower in autumn and winter. Abra ovate was less influenced by all factors except the substrate.

Salinity ranges in summer from 20.permill. at the mouth to < 1.permill. at the head of the system. Arctic features include an ice cover lasting for .apprx. 8 mo. annually and water temperatures which fluctuate from -1.degree. C in winter to as high as 12.degree. C in late summer. Subsurface light is severely attenuated. Reactive phosphate varies from a spring high of 0.3 .mu.g atoms P/l to undetectable levels during summer. Nitrate is more abundant and silicate is consistently plentiful. Chlorophyll a reaches a maximum only occasionally > 3 mg/m3 in June and July, rising from undetectable levels in winter. Photosynthetic rates are low by all standards, and have not been measured at > 6.4 mg C/m2 per h in summer. Low levels of subsurface light and reactive phosphate and nitrate characterize this exceptionally oligotrophic arctic estuary.

Allometry of antennules was strongly cyclical, being positive in fall, winter and spring, but negative in early summer. Antennule allometry and other morphological variables (egg size, body size, antennule and mucro length) were all negatively correlated with temperature, but mucro allometry had a radically different pattern than the antennule-body size cyclomorphosis. Populations could be separated between lakes according to allometry of the mucrones, and mucro allometry was also negatively correlated with zooplankton population density. Morphological data from this study do not support serial replacement of morphotypes within lakes, and correlation with ecological parameters does not support the hypothesis that cyclomorphosis is caused by the presence of invertebrate predators.																			0142-7873	1464-3774					1983	5	5					713	722		10.1093/plankt/5.5.713	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/5.5.713													WOS:A1983RF62300007

Habitat selection by Dall's sheep is influenced by multiple factors including direct and indirect climate effects	PLOS ONE												Arctic and boreal environments are changing rapidly, which could decouple behavioral and demographic traits of animals from the resource pulses that have shaped their evolution. Dall's sheep (Ovis dalli dalli) in northwestern regions of the USA and Canada, survive long, severe winters and reproduce during summers with short growing seasons. We sought to understand the vulnerability of Dall's sheep to a changing climate in Lake Clark National Park and Preserve, Alaska, USA. We developed ecological hypotheses about nutritional needs, security from predators, energetic costs of movement, and thermal shelter to describe habitat selection during winter, spring, and summer and evaluated habitat and climate variables that reflected these hypotheses. We used the synoptic model of animal space use to estimate parameters of habitat selection by individual females and calculated likelihoods for ecological hypotheses within seasonal models. Our results showed that seasonal habitat selection was influenced by multiple ecological requirements simultaneously. Across all seasons, sheep selected steep rugged areas near escape terrain for security from predators. During winter and spring, sheep selected habitats with increased forage and security, moderated thermal conditions, and lowered energetic costs of movement. During summer, nutritional needs and security influenced habitat selection. Climate directly influenced habitat selection during the spring lambing period when sheep selected areas with lower snow depths, less snow cover, and higher air temperatures. Indirectly, climate is linked to the expansion of shrub/scrub vegetation, which was significantly avoided in all seasons. Dall's sheep balance resource selection to meet multiple needs across seasons and such behaviors are finely tuned to patterns of phenology and climate. Direct and indirect effects of a changing climate may reduce their ability to balance their needs and lead to continued population declines. However, several management approaches could promote resiliency of alpine habitats that support Dall's sheep populations.					; Aycrigg, Jocelyn/AAA-5719-2020	Wells, Adam/0000-0001-9675-4963; Aycrigg, Jocelyn/0000-0002-6511-7985; 													1932-6203					MAR 18	2021	16	3							e0248763	10.1371/journal.pone.0248763	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248763								33735234					WOS:000631029700094

We tracked the fish from aircraft to determine patterns of autumn migration to overwintering locations. During August or September in each area, fish left the small tundra streams where they were tagged and migrated into larger streams. Migration rates peaked at 5-6 km/d about 1 September and averaged 1 km/d. Fish in two river systems moved into adjacent rivers after passage through estuarine waters. Migration distances from spawning or summer feeding areas to overwintering sites were as great as 101 km. Potential overwintering areas determined from transmitter relocations included deep pools, spring-fed areas, and lakes. Management problems associated with these extensive seasonal migrations may include the maintenance of the species migratory circuit in a region that may face future development.																			0002-8487					NOV	1992	121	6					709	715		10.1577/1548-8659(1992)121<0709:AMAOOA>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1992)121<0709:AMAOOA>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1992KR62200002

A 900-yr diatom and chrysophyte record of spring mixing and summer stratification from varved Lake Mina, west-central Minnesota, USA	HOLOCENE												A high-resolution, independent pollen-inferred paleoclimate record and direct algal seasonality data from the actual time of sediment deposition are used to interpret the high-resolution diatom and chrysophyte record of varved Lake Mina, west-central Minnesota, USA during AD 1116-2002. This direct algal seasonality information was obtained by splitting varves into constituent winter-spring and summer lamina, and separately analyzing the siliceous algae in each layer. Analyses of integrated, continuous four-year diatom and chrysophyte samples from a sedimentary sequence show that the time period AD 1116-1478 (ie, the Atlantic-centered 'Medieval Climate Anomaly' (MCA)) was characterized by periods of vigorous and prolonged spring mixing, suggesting that ice-out occurred early. However, the warm summer temperatures in the MCA particularly in a massive drought spanning AD 1300-1400, frequently caused the lake to stratify strongly, leading to nutrient depletion. During AD 1478-1870 (ie, the Atlantic-centered 'Little Ice Age' (LIA)), Lake Mina was characterized by weak spring circulation and increasing nutrient depletion, suggesting late ice-out conditions. Strong summer stratification and/or nutrient depletion in both time periods is shown by the occurrence of the nutrient-poor oligotrophic taxon Cyclotella pseudostelligera. he diatom and chrysophyte assemblages of the period of Euro-American settlement AD 1870-2002 show higher nutrient availability and increased spring mixing intensity, as a result of forest clearance and increasingly earlier ice-out (documented in regional historical records).

During summer and winter stratification, the highest methanotrophic activities were in the metalimnion, where oxygen concentration was < 6 mmol m(-3). During an incomplete spring turnover and summer stratification period, 3-5 times more CH4 was consumed by methanotrophs in the water column than was released to the atmosphere. The highest CH4 effluxes (1.2-5.1 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) to the atmosphere Occurred during the autumnal turnover despite observed methanotrophic activity in the whole water column. In winter, the amount of CH4 consumed by methanotrophs (0.20 mol CH4 m(-2) during 6.5 months) was of the same order of magnitude as that during the ice-free period (0.22 mol CH4 m(-2) during 5.5 months), Annually similar to 80% of CH4 diffused from the sediment was consumed by methanotrophs in the water column, and only 20% (0.11 mol CH4 m(-2) yr(-1)) was released to the atmosphere. During the ice-free period, bacterial production measured as [C-14]leucine uptake showed a bell-shaped relation to CH4 concentration. The highest production was found in the metalimnion at CH4 concentrations ranging from 5 to 10 mmol m(-3). During summer stratification, net production of methanotrophs corresponded to 23-47% of total bacterial production, but during the autumn turnover, this proportion was higher (27-81%), indicating that methanotrophs offer a potentially significant Source of carbon to zooplankton in stratified humic lakes.

J	Harrison, SSC; Hildrew, AG				Harrison, SSC; Hildrew, AG			Patterns in the epilithic community of a lake littoral	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The algae and sedentary macroinvertebrates on the upper surface of stones from the littoral of Crosemere were investigated over 13 months. This lake is one of a series of eutrophic meres of glacial origin in the English Midlands. 2. Stones were taken from shallow and deep areas in the littoral and from areas shaded by bankside trees and those away from trees. This gave four habitat types: open/ shallow; open/deep; shade/shallow; shade/deep. Epilithic algae and sedentary macroinvertebrates from the upper surfaces of the stones were quantified monthly for each habitat type. 3. Chlorophyll a and ash-free dry mass both showed a strong seasonal pattern common to all habitat types, with a spring peak declining to a summer minimum, followed by a small autumn recovery, and a winter minimum. 4. In terms of percentage cover, Cladophora glomerata showed a markedly different pattern. There were strong differences between habitat types, with shaded stones from the shallows, in particular, having very sparse Cladophora cover. In the open, Cladophora cover was high in summer and low at other times. 5. The invertebrate community was dominated by retreat-dwelling larvae of the psychomyiid caddis, Tinodes waeneri, and four species of chironomids with tube-building larvae, Cricotopus sylvestris, Microtendipes pedellus, Glyptotendipes pallens and Endochironomus albipennis. For Tinodes, Cricotopus and Microtendipes, peaks of density occurred chiefly beneath trees in spring and summer. 6. The seasonal pattern of algal abundance showed little relationship with that of invertebrate biomass. The ratio of chlorophyll a to ash-free dry mass also declined in summer, despite the higher invertebrate biomass. This indicated that grazing was not the dominant factor diminishing algal abundance seasonally. It seems likely that algae were limited chiefly by physical factors, such as light and temperature, and by nutrients, particularly nitrates, which decline in summer in the epilimnion of the lake. 7. Grazing may have contributed to spatial patchiness of algae in summer, however, particularly that of Cladophora. The scarcity of Cladophora on shallow, shaded stones coincided with a high abundance of Tinodes on these stones in early summer. Riparian trees could thus have affected epilithic algae, not only by shading but also indirectly through the supply of grazers.																			0046-5070					MAY	1998	39	3					477	492		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1998.00296.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1998.00296.x													WOS:000073798300008

Impacts of Climate Change on Soil Erosion in the Great Lakes Region	WATER												Quantifying changes in potential soil erosion under projections of changing climate is important for the sustainable management of land resources, as soil loss estimates will be helpful in identifying areas susceptible to erosion, targeting future erosion control efforts, and/or conservation funding. Therefore, the macro-scale Variable Infiltration CapacityWater Erosion Prediction Project (VIC-WEPP) soil erosion model was utilized to quantify soil losses under three climate change scenarios (A2, A1B, B1) using projections from three general circulation models (GFDL, PCM, HadCM3) for the Great Lakes region from 2000 to 2100. Soil loss was predicted to decrease throughout three future periods (2030s, 2060s, and 2090s) by 0.4-0.7 ton ha(-1) year(-1) (4.99-23.2%) relative to the historical period (2000s) with predicted air temperature increases of 0.68-4.34 degrees C and precipitation increases of 1.74-63.7 mm year(-1) (0.23-8.6%). In the forested northern study domain erosion kept increasing by 0.01-0.18 ton ha(-1) year(-1) over three future periods due to increased precipitation of 9.7-68.3 mm year(-1). The southern study domain covered by cropland and grassland had predicted soil loss decreases of 0.01-1.43 ton ha(-1) year(-1) due to air temperature increases of 1.75-4.79 degrees C and reduced precipitation in the summer. Fall and winter had greater risks of increased soil loss based on predictions for these two seasons under the A2 scenario, with the greatest cropland soil loss increase due to increased fall precipitation, and combined effects of increases in both precipitation and air temperature in the winter. Fall was identified with higher risks under the A1B scenario, while spring and summer were identified with the greatest risk of increased soil losses under the B1 scenario due to the increases in both precipitation and air temperature.

We performed three series of field experiments at different times (late spring, summer and late summer) to examine the role of zooplankton constitution in the released nitrogen:phosphorus (N:P) ratio. We observed that changes in the zooplankton constitution over the annual cycle may change the nutrient supply ratio. In South Andes lakes, Boeckella gracilipes would decrease the P limitation, lowering the N:P ratio, whereas Bosmina longirostris tends to increase the N:P ratio and therefore increase the P limitation during summer.					; Balseiro, Esteban/Y-2743-2019	Modenutti, Beatriz/0000-0002-8683-5679; Balseiro, Esteban/0000-0002-5052-0587													0142-7873					JUL	1997	19	7					805	817		10.1093/plankt/19.7.805	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/19.7.805													WOS:A1997XK00500002

The 2007 sea ice minimum: Impacts on the Northern Hemisphere atmosphere in late autumn and early winter	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Over the past several decades, the minimum Northern Hemisphere summer sea ice extent has decreased substantially. We present an analysis of the influence of declining Arctic sea ice cover on the atmosphere, specifically during the autumn/early winter following an extreme summer minimum event. Using ensemble simulations from the Weather Research and Forecast model (v 3.0.1), we compare the atmospheric response for the case of the extreme sea ice minimum of 2007 to the corresponding response for the more typical ice conditions of 1984, the year with median ice extent for the 1979-2008 satellite era. Increased open water enhances heat and moisture flux from the Arctic Ocean to the atmosphere during autumn. We characterize the fluxes both horizontally and vertically and determine the spatial breadth of their influence. The atmospheric response is characterized by a strong increase in 2 m temperature and decrease in sea level pressure locally and by remote responses in the atmospheric circulation throughout the troposphere characterized by a quasi-barotropic ridge/trough signal in North America. The circulation anomalies drive remote anomalies of temperature and precipitation over eastern North America and the North Atlantic. Advectively driven temperature anomalies, in turn, cause surface flux anomalies over remote regions such as the Great Lakes and the Gulf Stream. The maximum response, as measured by difference in 2 m temperatures over the polar cap from 70 degrees N, occurs between 10 September and approximately 15 November. The persistence of the signal over a 2 month period implies the potential for seasonal predictability of the stronger atmospheric response features. In addition, we determine the significance of prominent features, finding 95% significance in some remote features as far away as the North Atlantic.

Over 17,000 dives were registered. The duration of the dives and diving patterns differed among individuals. The mean duration of dives increased from spring to autumn; e.g., in one individual the mean dive duration increased from 6 min in June to 10.5 min in October. The haul-out periods of one individual in May to early June made up 46.2% of its total activity budget, but in another individual in July to August the haul-out periods made up only 11% of the budget and the seal was submerged for 80% of the time. Periods of successive long duration dives (>10 min) were observed in three individuals in summer and autumn. The longest dive measured was 23 min. The duration of the periods containing long dives was often over three hours (maximum six hours) and the mean duration of the dives about 15 min. These long duration dives are assumed to be aerobic resting dives. Generally, the dives of the Saimaa ringed seal appear to be of longer duration than previously assumed.

Assessing the influence of stream flow and precipitation regimes on water quality of the major inflow stream of Wular Lake in Kashmir Himalaya	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Wular Lake in the Kashmir Himalayan part of the Indian subcontinent is facing severe eutrophication due to the enhanced nutrient loads from its catchment. For holistic management of this lake, quantifying the nutrient loads from all of its inflow streams is compulsory for establishing a scientific basis for managing its highest loading watersheds. The present work has been carried out in the Sukhnag stream and is one of the major inflow streams of the Wular Lake. The analyses presented hereof are the initial results of the comprehensive assessment taking place in all the other inflow streams of this lake. Here, we present an analysis of the 12-month water quality data of this stream at five different locations, whereof we have estimated the concentration and export coefficients of the nutrients and major ions and their relation with the discharge and precipitation regimes. The results revealed statistically significant relationship of stream flow with ortho-phosphorus, total phosphorus, NO3-N, Ca2+, Na+, total suspended solid (TSS), and total dissolved solid (TDS) and insignificant relationship with NO2-N, NH4-N, organic nitrogen, and total nitrogen. Seasonal variation in nutrient load and export coefficients showed a linear relationship with high concentrations during spring and summer and low concentrations during autumn and winter. Further, the results showed that this stream during the observational period loaded 0.15x10(8) g of ortho-phosphorus, 0.53x10(8) g of total phosphorus, 0.96x10(8) g of NO3-N, 0.05x10(8) g of NO2-N, 0.14x10(8) g of NH4-N, 0.61x10(8) g of organic nitrogen, 1.75x10(8) g of total nitrogen, 22.9x10(8) g of Cl-, 60.4x10(8) g of Ca2+, 13.4x10(8) g of Mg2+, 20.7x10(8) g of Na+, 4.88x10(8) g of K+, 112.2x10(8) g of TSS, and 435.5x10(8) g of TDS into the Wular Lake. Seasonally, spring contributed the maximum average loads of about 62.18 % followed by summer (18.86 %) while as winter and autumn contributed about 9.61 and 9.35 %, respectively. This analysis on the Sukhnag stream is the first and key step toward a complete nutrient load analysis of all the inflow streams of the Wular Lake.

J	Müller, H; Wünsch, C				Müller, H; Wünsch, C			Seasonal dynamics of cyst formation of pelagic strombidiid ciliates in a deep prealpine lake	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Population dynamics of the oligotrich ciliates Limnostrombidium viride and Pelagostrombidium fallax were recorded in prealpine Lake Constance, Germany, from February through November 1997. Simultaneously, their flask-shaped resting cysts were collected in sediment traps. We describe for the first time the resting stages of L. viride. Motile stages and cysts of this species were restricted to April/May, with a maximum flux rate of 2 x 10(4) cysts m(-2) d(-1). Pelagostrombidium fallax, a dominant species throughout the year, encysted in March to June and September to November. Maximum flux rates of 1.8 x 10(5) and 2.1 x 10(5) cysts m(-2) d(-1) were observed in spring and autumn, respectively. Mean flux rates were 4 x 10(4) cysts m(-2) d(-1) in spring and 3 x 10(4) cysts m(-2) d(-1) in autumn. In summer, cyst formation ceased over a period when water temperatures were >18 degrees C close to the lake surface. Encystment of P. fallax in spring was significantly negatively correlated with chlorophyll a.																			0948-3055	1616-1564				APR 30	1999	17	1					37	47		10.3354/ame017037	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame017037													WOS:000080660500004
J	CHANGNON, D; NOEL, JJ; MAZE, LH				CHANGNON, D; NOEL, JJ; MAZE, LH			DETERMINING CYCLONE FREQUENCIES USING EQUAL-AREA CIRCLES	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												This paper examines recent cyclone frequencies with a methodology that incorporates the use of 5 degrees latitude equal-area circles located in a grid for a region centered from 25 degrees to 70 degrees N and 60 degrees to 140 degrees W. Cyclones were counted in 82 equal-area circles for the period 1950-93 over North America. The grid of equal-area circles eliminated two related problems associated with conventional grid systems, area-inequality, and area-normalization, and allows for comparison of frequency counts among circles. An analysis of winter cyclones among four north-to-south circles on a meridian indicated latitudinal variability in year-to-year raw cyclone counts. Correlation coefficients developed from relating winter cyclone counts from one circle to another were less than +/-0.29, implying that the location of the axis of maximum winter cyclone frequency varies annually. Results revealed that winter and spring had the greatest number of cyclones and the southernmost position of the axis of maximum frequency. Summer and autumn had the smallest cyclone number and northernmost displacement of the axis of maximum frequency. The maximum frequency of cyclones extended eastward from the lee of the Rockies to the Great Lakes basin and off the Northeast coast. Temporal analyses identified that annual cyclone counts decreased from the early 1950s to the mid-1980s before reversing and increasing into the mid-1990s. Similar trends occurred in all four seasons and suggest that major shifts in the atmosphere's general circulation occur over multiple decades in all seasons.																			0027-0644					AUG	1995	123	8					2285	2294		10.1175/1520-0493(1995)123<2285:DCFUEA>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0493(1995)123<2285:DCFUEA>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1995RK48000002

The results showed that a total of 7 phylum 59 species of phytoplankton and 3 phylum 28 species of zooplankton were identified in the lake, and both the plankton density and biomass varied significantly in time and space scales. The significant variation of Protozoa density should be responsible to the inconsistency between the distributions of zooplankton density and biomass, as well as the lowest value of P-IBI in summer. The P-IBI values and therefore the health levels can be seasonally ranked as winter > autumn > spring > summer and found spatially increased along the flow direction. Based on the relationships between P-IBI and the environmental factors, ammonia nitrogen = 0.46 mg/L and Secchi depth = 63 cm were found as the environmental protection thresholds of planktonic biotic integrity for this freshwater lake ecosystem. The findings of the research may provide some guidance to the ecological monitoring and protection of freshwater lake.

Life cycles in the ground-beetle tribe Pogonini (Coleoptera, Carabidae) from the Lake Elton region, Russia	BACK TO THE ROOTS AND BACK TO THE FUTURE: TOWARDS A NEW SYNTHESIS AMONGST TAXONOMIC, ECOLOGICAL AND BIOGEOGRAPHICAL APPROACHES IN CARABIDOLOGY, PROCEEDINGS	Pensoft Series Faunistica				13th European Carabidologists Meeting	AUG 20-24, 2007	Blagoevgrad, BULGARIA					In 2006-2007, the main features of life cycles in seven species of the tirbe Pogonini in the semi-desert Lake Elton region, Russia were studied. Six species, Cardiaderus chloroticus, Pogonus transfuga, P. meridianalis, Pogonistes rufoaeneus, P. angustus and P. convexicollis, are spring breeders. Among them, P. transfuga, P. meridionalis and P. rufoaeneus are iteroparous while C. chloroticus, P angustus and P convexicollis are semelparous. The life cycles of all these species are monovariant monovoltine with spring or spring-summer reproduction and adult (immature or both immature and spent) hibernation. However, the life cycle in C. chloroticus is possibly bivoltine. In contrast, P. cumanus is an autumn-breeding iteroparous species, its life cycle being monovariant monovoltine with obligate larval hibernation and obligate adult aestivation, parapause. This is a surprising finding, because previously all Pogonini were considered to be "spring breeders" or "imaginal hibernators". Among the species studied, P transfuga and P meridionalis can be characterized as halophiles, because they live in habitats with moderate salinity All the other species are pronounced halobionts because, with rare exceptions only, they are restricted to high-salinity habitats. Parasitic mites of the family Podapolipidae were found on P. transfuga, P meridionalis, P cumanus and P rufoaeneus adults. Survival over winter and reproduction during a second season, together with the new generation specimens, is an important precondition for dispersal of Podapohpidae. On the other hand, this greatly restricts the range of their possible hosts.

J	Zimmerman, GS; Glanz, WE				Zimmerman, GS; Glanz, WE			Habitat use by bats in eastern Maine	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												We described habitat use by bats in Acadia National Park and adjacent sites in eastern Maine. We analyzed frequency of bat passes with Anabat bat detectors to evaluate habitat use at microsite, single patch, and multipatch spatial scales. Most bat captures (91%) were of the genus Myotis, and most of those (74%) were males. Bat activity was concentrated over ponds and along gravel roads at the single-patch scale, and near lakes at the multipatch scale from late spring to late summer. During the early autumn, bat activity decreased overall and was distributed more evenly among patch types. Although our ability to predict areas of high bat activity declined during early autumn, our data indicated that bats appeared to avoid wetlands and sites with dense trees. Management of bat habitat should be considered at multiple spatial and temporal scales. We also recommend that resource managers consider bats when making management decisions concerning lakes, ponds, and gravel roads because bat activity was high at these sites throughout the late spring and summer.																			0022-541X	1937-2817				OCT	2000	64	4					1032	1040		10.2307/3803214	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3803214													WOS:000165053000018

K.; Lee, Jiyoung; Liang, Song			Spatiotemporal variability and environmental factors of harmful algal blooms (HABs) over western Lake Erie	PLOS ONE												Over the past decades, numerous studies have been carried out in understanding causes of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) and their dynamics, yielding great knowledge in this field. Lake Erie, the fourth-largest lake of the five Great Lake, is among those highly vulnerable to the impacts of HABs and has received substantial attention from the public, water management sectors, and academic field. Building upon previous work, this study aims to characterize spatiotemporal variability of Chlorophyll a (Chl-a), which is an important indicator of HABs, and to explore relative importance of environmental factors associated with HABs in the west Lake Erie. Ten years of biweekly Chl-a information over western Lake Erie were derived from MERIS data at the pixel scale. Based on the MERIS-derived information high concentrations of Chl-a were observed in the south near shore area in spring and fall and in the west corner area of western Lake Erie in all three seasons except winter. Wavelet analysis suggested that the 0.5- and 1-year periods were dominant modes for the Chl-a series. The Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) analysis was performed to explore factors associated with the dynamics of Chl-a. The results suggested that overall both phenological (e.g. wind) and ecological (e.g. nutrient levels) factors exhibited significant correlations with the remotely-sensed imagery based observations of Chl-a despite spatial and temporal variations. The important phenological and ecological factors include solar radiation and wind speed in spring, water temperature, solar radiation, and total Kjeldahl nitrogen concentration in summer, wind speed in fall, and water temperature and streamflow in winter. Both consistency and differences of findings of the study with others in the region may suggest strengths and limitations of the remotely sensed imagery-based analysis, offering valuable information for future work.					; Tseng, Kuo-Hsin/NDT-1118-2025	Tian, Di/0000-0001-7752-947X; Tseng, Kuo-Hsin/0000-0003-3581-076X; Shum, C K/0000-0001-9378-4067													1932-6203					JUN 28	2017	12	6							e0179622	10.1371/journal.pone.0179622	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0179622								28658260					WOS:000404607900035
J	Celussi, M; Cataletto, B				Celussi, Mauro; Cataletto, Bruno			Annual dynamics of bacterioplankton assemblages in the Gulf of Trieste (Northern Adriatic Sea)	GENE												Bacterioplankton community diversity was investigated monthly in coastal waters of the Gulf of Trieste (NE Adriatic Sea) throughout 2003. Superficial bacterial assemblages of two differently freshwater influenced stations were studied using PCR-DGGE fingerprinting techniques. Bacterial genetic diversity of the sampled area, as estimates of the number of DGGE bands was high (36-64) compared to that reported in other studies employing this fingerprint technique. The similarity index (Sorensen Index) between assemblages showed a defined operational taxonomic units (OTUs) succession pattern in the more typically marine station with stable winter communities and quickly changing summer ones. On the contrary in the station affected by riverine inputs no clear pattern was detected. In both sites, according to cluster analyses performed on the DGGE banding pattern, three seasonal assemblages were identified: winter-spring, summer and fall. Sequence analysis of fifty-six among the brightest gel bands led to the observation of bacteria affiliated to Gram positive, Cyanobacteria, Cytophaga-Flavobacteria-Bacteroides (CFB) lineages and the alpha-, gamma- and delta- subdivisions of the Protcobacteria. Gamma-Protcobacteria constituted the main fraction (60%) of sequences in the more typically marine station, whereas the river-influenced station was characterised by more heterogeneous assemblages (39% alpha-Proteobacteria, 32% Flavobacteria).

J	MAIER, G				MAIER, G			THE LIFE-HISTORIES OF 2 TEMPORARILY COEXISTING, POND DWELLING CLADOCERANS	INTERNATIONALE REVUE DER GESAMTEN HYDROBIOLOGIE												Investigations on the life histories of two cladocerans, Moina brachiata and Daphnia obtusa, in a small, nearly temporary pond in South Germany revealed that M, brachiata is better adapted to fluctuating environmental conditions; the species dominated from May to October. D. obtusa was present in spring and autumn/winter but disappeared completely during the summer months. Both species coexisted for extended periods in spring and autumn; abundance of D. obtusa was generally by an order of magnitute lower. Four periods of low water level were slightly preceded by or coincided with a decrease of clutch size, a decrease of the proportion of egg bearing females indicating that both species suffered from food shortage. Laboratory investigations on life history parameters showed that the two species have different temperature tolerances and preferences. M. brachiata showed its highest reproductive success at 25 and 30-degrees-C but died at temperatures < 15-degrees-C and greater-than-or-equal-to 35-degrees-C. D. obtusa experienced a broader temperature range (2 to 25-degrees-C) but could not withstand temperatures greater-than-or-equal-to 30-degrees-C. Short term starvation periods (3d) caused the death of M. brachiata females, while D. obtusa soon recovered and reproduced when being refed. M. brachiata is a typical r-species with early reproduction, rapid development, high population growth rates and a high tendency to produce resting eggs; D. obtusa pursues more the concept of k-selection.																			0020-9309						1993	78	1					83	93		10.1002/iroh.19930780109	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19930780109													WOS:A1993LR15800005
J	Ferguson, SH; Elkie, PC				Ferguson, SH; Elkie, PC			Habitat requirements of boreal forest caribou during the travel seasons	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY												Understanding space-use patterns of highly mobile animals, such as woodland caribou, is required for ecosystem conservation. We tested for seasonal differences in migration habitat used by woodland caribou white travelling from winter to summer and summer to winter range in northwest Ontario, using radio-telemetry locations of 33 caribou collected from 1995 to 2000. Forest management guidelines in Ontario presume that woodland caribou select specific habitats during the migrating seasons including conifer dominated forests and waterways (rivers and takes). Results showed few differences between real travel routes and straight-line routes during both high movement periods (post-calving to late winter and late winter to calving). Caribou selected less deciduous forest than available during early winter and spring but contrary to expectations they did not use more open areas and waterways than available. Possible migration corridors, or habitat used during early winter and spring, were not distinguished by one particular habitat type, although caribou were more likely to avoid water and open areas, while using more conifer forests. They did not avoid disturbed habitat such as recently burnt or cut areas. There were some sex-specific differences with mates using deciduous forest more than females. Caribou did not choose more than expected of waterways such as chains of lakes or large rivers which, to some extent, run counter to management recommendations. Our findings should be considered when developing local forest management plans and designing harvest patterns with the intent to mitigate negative impacts on woodland caribou habitat.

Ecology under lake ice	ECOLOGY LETTERS												Winter conditions are rapidly changing in temperate ecosystems, particularly for those that experience periods of snow and ice cover. Relatively little is known of winter ecology in these systems, due to a historical research focus on summer 'growing seasons'. We executed the first global quantitative synthesis on under-ice lake ecology, including 36 abiotic and biotic variables from 42 research groups and 101 lakes, examining seasonal differences and connections as well as how seasonal differences vary with geophysical factors. Plankton were more abundant under ice than expected; mean winter values were 43.2% of summer values for chlorophyll a, 15.8% of summer phytoplankton biovolume and 25.3% of summer zooplankton density. Dissolved nitrogen concentrations were typically higher during winter, and these differences were exaggerated in smaller lakes. Lake size also influenced winter-summer patterns for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), with higher winter DOC in smaller lakes. At coarse levels of taxonomic aggregation, phytoplankton and zooplankton community composition showed few systematic differences between seasons, although literature suggests that seasonal differences are frequently lake-specific, species-specific, or occur at the level of functional group. Within the subset of lakes that had longer time series, winter influenced the subsequent summer for some nutrient variables and zooplankton biomass.					; Swann, George/B-2794-2011; Weyhenmeyer, Gesa/Y-6135-2019; Baulch, Helen/I-9529-2012; Bowman, Larry/GXI-0419-2022; Batt, Ryan/D-7690-2013; Granados, Ignacio/A-3737-2013; Carey, Cayelan/D-4874-2016; Stockwell, Jason/HSC-4786-2023; Nõges, Peeter/AAL-5343-2020; Montero, William/ABG-7984-2020; Sadro, Steven/AGC-7944-2022; Post, David/A-6987-2009; Rücker, Jacqueline/H-8994-2019; Felip, Marisol/G-2823-2016; Lottig, Noah/AAE-4650-2020; Catalan, Jordi/A-5420-2008; Noges, Tiina/AAL-5373-2020; McKay, Robert/P-3759-2017; O'Reilly, Catherine/AFZ-5813-2022; Timofeyev, Maxim/F-2071-2010; Higgins, Scott/F-5700-2016; Grossart, Hans-Peter/E-6705-2017; Silow, Eugene/C-2958-2011	Woo, Kara/0000-0002-5125-4188; Rucker, Jacqueline/0000-0001-6841-7724; Bowman, Larry/0000-0002-0816-6115; Toro Velasco, Manuel/0000-0002-4860-7229; Colom Montero, William/0000-0002-2035-2498; Granados, Ignacio/0000-0002-8669-6613; Lottig, Noah/0000-0003-1599-8144; Sadro, Steven/0000-0002-6416-3840; Batt, Ryan/0000-0002-7267-5395; Sharma, Sapna/0000-0003-4571-2768; Baulch, Helen/0000-0001-9018-4998; Gries, Corinna/0000-0002-9091-6543; Post, David/0000-0003-1434-7729; Hampton, Stephanie/0000-0003-2389-4249; Mackay, Anson/0000-0002-6328-769X; Catalan, Jordi/0000-0002-2934-4013; Powers, Stephen/0000-0001-6267-2644; McKay, Robert/0000-0003-2723-5371; Kehoe, Michael/0000-0002-5281-5821; Timofeyev, Maxim/0000-0002-5250-6818; Labou, Stephanie/0000-0001-5633-5983; Kahilainen, Kimmo/0000-0002-1539-014X; O'Reilly, Catherine/0000-0001-9685-3697; Swann, George/0000-0002-4750-9504; Higgins, Scott/0000-0001-9427-7024; Sterner, Robert/0000-0003-2292-6122; Silow, Eugene/0000-0002-7039-3220													1461-023X	1461-0248				JAN	2017	20	1					98	111		10.1111/ele.12699	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.12699								27889953					WOS:000390026200010

A total of 18 different fatty acids were determined in the composition of C. trutta. The variations in fatty acid composition of total lipid, triacylglycerol, and phospholipid were recorded throughout the seasons. The total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (M UFA) were the most important groups of total lipid. Total saturated fatty acid (SFA) and total MUFA were seen to increase from spring to summer while total PUFA decreased sharply from spring to summer. These seasons corresponded to the beginning and end of the reproduction period, respectively. The major fatty acids of total lipid in all seasons were C16:0, C18:1n-9, C20:4n-6, C20:5n-3, and C22:6n-3. In the present study, n-3/n-6 ratios of total lipid were 3.20, 4.11, 1.69, and 1.45 in spring, summer, autumn, and winter, respectively. MUFA and PUPA were the most important groups of triacylglycerols. Of these, the main fatty acids were found to be C16:0, C16:1n-7, C18:1n-9, and C20:5n-3. PUFA were determined to be the most important group of phospholipids. The major fatty acids identified in the phospholipid group were C16:0, C18:1n-9, C20:5n-3, C22:5n-3, and C22:6n-3 in all seasons. In conclusion, it was shown that the fatty acid compositions in the muscle of C. trutta was significantly influenced by the seasons and that, in light of their n-3/n-6 ratios, C. trutta should be considered a desirable food in the human diet.

Depth-dependent molecular composition and photo-reactivity of dissolved organic matter in a boreal lake under winter and summer conditions	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Transformations of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in boreal lakes lead to large greenhouse gas emissions as well as substantial carbon storage in sediments. Using novel molecular characterization approaches and photochemical degradation experiments we studied how seasonal patterns in water column stratification affected the DOM in a Swedish lake under early spring and summer conditions. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were consistently higher above the sediment when compared to surface waters throughout the sampling periods. Photobleaching alone could not explain this difference in DOC because the lake was covered by 40 cm-thick ice during late winter sampling and still showed the same DOC trend. The differences in the molecular diversity between surface DOM in winter and summer were consistent with ongoing photobleaching/ decarboxylation and a possible bacterial consumption of photo-products. Additional photo-degradation experiments using simulated sunlight showed a production of highly oxidized organic molecules and low molecular weight compounds in all late winter samples and also in the deep water sample in summer. In the surface summer DOM sample, few such molecules were produced during the photo-degradation experiments, confirming that DOM was already photobleached prior to the experiments. This study suggests that photobleaching, and therefore also the ice cover during winter, plays a central role in surface DOM transformation, with important differences in the molecular composition of DOM between surface and deep boreal lake waters. The release of DOC from boreal lake sediments also contribute to this pattern. Photochemical degradation of DOM may be more extensive following ice-out and water column turnover when non-light exposed and thereby photosensitive DOM is photo-mineralized. Hence, the yearly DOM photo-mineralization may be greater than inferred from studies of recently light-exposed DOM.

The results obtained were subjected to statistical analyses by employing SPSS software and p < 0.05 was accepted as significant value. In the statistical analyses, multiple comparisons tests were performed. The results showed that monounsaturated fatty acids levels were found to be higher than that of polyunsaturated fatty acids and saturated fatty acids in all seasons. Palmitic and stearic acid levels were the highest in ovaries (19.95% in winter and 7.79% in summer, respectively). Oleic and palmitoleic levels were at the highest levels in liver tissues (34.53% in summer and 18.37% in winter, respectively). Docosahexaenoic (C22:6 omega 3, DHA), eicosapentaenoic (C20:5 omega 3, EPA), eicosatrienoic acid, and arachidonic (C20:4 omega 6, AA) levels were at the highest level as 17.27, 2.54, and 8.41% in ovaries in the winter and 6.37% in muscle tissues in the spring, respectively. omega 3/omega 6 ratios were 0.62-0.98 in muscle, 1.54-2.82 in the liver, and 2.82-3.89 in the ovaries. From the point of total fatty acid variations, the highest variations were observed as follows: muscle in spring (26.73%), liver in winter (33.85%), and ovaries in winter 36.38%.

The As is of geothermal origin, and an acceptable explanation for the seasonal change has proved elusive. Data for As and Li concentrations from a monthly river water quality monitoring program, together with data from a recent study of suspended particulate material (SPM) and As in the lower catchment, have provided the basis for a new hypothesis; that the summer maximum in As concentration represents conservative behavior of the geothermal As from the Upper catchment, and the winter minimum is due to the combined effects of greater dilution of geothermal fluid flow in river waters, and a greater degree of As adsorption onto Fe oxide-rich, winter SPM. To test this hypothesis, in-river and experimental As adsorption onto SPM has been modeled using a diffuse layer, surface complexation model, assuming Fe oxide to be the only adsorbing Surface present. The model was able to reproduce the summer and winter seasonal variations in the degree of As adsorption onto SPM. However, during algal blooms in late summer and autumn, biological uptake by diatoms may also result in As removal from the water column.																			0097-6156		0-8412-3913-4				2005	915						253	266		10.1021/bk-2005-0915.ch018	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bk-2005-0915.ch018													WOS:000236279300018

Population dynamics and production of Jesogammarus annandalei, an endemic amphipod in Lake Biwa, were examined from April 1997 to June 1998. The life cycle of this species was 1 year with the new generation beginning in early autumn. They preferred low temperature (<12 degreesC) and their spatial distribution varied seasonally and accordingly. 2. In deep water, the abundance of J. annandalei ranged from 200 to 63 000 m(-2) and decreased towards summer and the biomass (0.01similar to3.6 g C m(-2)) was on average comparable that of zooplankton. The density was much higher than that recorded by a study conducted 35 years ago. 3. Individual growth rate of this amphipod was high in winter and spring but decreased in summer. Annual production of J. annandalei (6.2 g C m(-2) year(-1)) was only 2% of primary production but was at the higher end of the range reported for amphipods in oligo- and mesotrophic lakes. 4. These results are consistent with the view that Lake Biwa is becoming more eutrophic, with a consequent decrease in the abundance of predatory fish in the profundal zone.

Biological utilization of reactive Si occurred prior to stratification in late May or early June. A shift from a 100% diatom-dominated phytoplankton community in spring to .apprx. 12% diatoms in Aug. was attributed to the low dissolved Si values observed in the surface water (< 2 .mu.mol/l) during summer. The total amount of biologically active silicon (TBAS) for the lake was approximately 19 .mu.mol/l. Winter values were .apprx. 2 .mu.mol/l amorphous Si and .apprx. 17 .mu.mol/l reactive Si. During June-Aug. 80% of TBAS had been utilized by the diatom community, with only 20% remaining as reactive Si. Greater than 50% of TBAS was lost from the water column during spring and early summer, which was attributed to settling of diatom frustules and the sinking of zooplankton fecal pellets containing frustules. This Si was subsequently returned, in a soluble form, to the deep water during the fall. The amount of TBAS that was recycled was estimated to be 80-100%.																									1977	34	4					537	544		10.1139/f77-085	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f77-085													WOS:A1977DA61200010
J	Edwards, AC; Cook, Y; Smart, R; Wade, AJ				Edwards, AC; Cook, Y; Smart, R; Wade, AJ			Concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in streams draining the mixed land-use Dee Catchment, north-east Scotland	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. There is still some uncertainty about large-scale influences on nutrient budgets in rivers. In particular, reduced forms of nitrogen (N) in organic forms might represent a significant fraction of the soluble N present in headwater streams, but this is not well quantified. Nitrate increases in relative importance downstream within agriculturally dominated areas. Here we appraise variations in N dynamics for a representative temperate but upland river, the Dee. 2. In the Dee catchment, the source of organic N appears to vary seasonally. During summer under low flow conditions it originates primarily from in-stream biological production, while during the winter-spring period leaching from the plant-soil system would be the major contributor. 3. On any individual sampling day, a wide range of N:P ratios can occur in the catchment area. Generally the narrowest N:P ratios occur during the summer and early autumn, particularly for upland catchments dominated by semi-natural vegetation. It is possible that some of the tributaries and upper region of the main river may be limited by N during the summer. The interpretation of the N:P ratios depends greatly upon the potential biological availability of the organic N, which remains unknown. 4. Together, these data further illustrate that simple ideas about the relative limiting effects of N and P in temperate freshwaters may be misleading.

Seasonal variation in effects of urea and phosphorus on phytoplankton abundance and community composition in a hypereutrophic hardwater lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Urea accounts for half of global agricultural fertiliser applications, yet little is known of its role in eutrophication of freshwater ecosystems, nor how it interacts with phosphorus (P) in regulating phytoplankton composition, especially during spring and autumn. To identify when and how urea and P inputs interact across the ice-free period, we conducted seven monthly fertilisation experiments in 3,240-L mesocosms from ice-off to ice-formation in a hypereutrophic lake. In addition, we ran bioassays with ammonium (NH4+) to compare the effects of urea with those of NH4+, the immediate product of chemical decomposition of urea. Analysis of water-column chlorophyllaand biomarker pigments by high-performance liquid chromatography revealed that addition of inorganic P alone (100 mu g P L-1 week(-1)) had no significant impact on either algal abundance or community composition in hypereutrophic Wascana Lake. Instead, fertilisation with urea (4 mg N L-1 week(-1)) alone, or in concert with P, significantly (p < 0.05) increased algal abundance in spring and much of summer, but not prior to ice formation in October. In particular, urea amendment enhanced abundance of cryptophytes, chlorophytes, and non-diazotrophic cyanobacteria during April and May, while fertilisation in summer and early autumn (September) increased only chlorophytes and non-diazotrophic cyanobacteria. Comparison of urea mesocosms with NH(4)(+)bioassays demonstrated that urea lacked the inherent toxicity of NH(4)(+)in cool waters, but that both compounds stimulated production during summer experiments. This study showed that urea pollution can degrade water quality in P-rich lakes across a variety of seasonal conditions, including spring, and underscores the importance of quantifying the timing and form of N inputs when managing P-rich freshwaters.

Abundance of bacteria was determined using a combination of direct counting of 4, 6-diamidino-2-phenytindole and the phylogenetic diversity was determined in fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method with group-specific, fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide probes. The numbers of DAPI bacteria varied between 4.75 and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) demonstrated that Eubacteria constituted the majority of the whole bacterial population and their percentage share ranged from 59 to 75%. Abundances of alpha- beta-Proteobacteria and Cytophaga-Flavobacteria groups varied across seasons, layers, and lacustrine zones. The lowest number of alpha-Proteobacteria group bacteria was observed in spring (SM - 0.2 x 10(6), SW - 0.16 x 10(6) cells cm(-3)), whereas the highest in autumn (SM - 0.62 x 10(6), SW - 1.6 x 10(6) cells cm(-3)). The percentage share of these groups of bacteria in the Eubacteria domain was lower in spring (20-50%) than in summer and autumn (from 65 to over 80%). No fixed difference between the composition of SM and SW bacteria was noticed. Seasonally occurred changes are similar in both layers.

HYDROBIOLOGIA												Almost 95% of the entire population of the Siberian crane (Grus leucogeranus) winter in Poyang Lake, China, where they forage on the tubers of the submerged aquatic macrophyte Vallisneria spiralis. The Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River may possibly affect this food source of the Siberian crane by affecting the light intensity reaching the top of the V. spiralis canopy. In this study, the photosynthetically active radiation at the top of the V. spiralis canopy (PAR(tc)) in Lake Dahuchi was modeled from 1998 to 2006, and the potential impacts of changes in water level and turbidity on the underwater light climate of V. spiralis were analyzed. PAR(tc) was calculated from incident irradiance while the losses due to reflection at the water surface, absorption, and scattering within the water column were taken into consideration. The results indicated significant differences in PAR(tc) between years. Six years of water level and Secchi disk depth records revealed a seasonal switching of the lake from a turbid state at low water levels in autumn, winter, and spring to a clear state at high water levels during the monsoon in summer. The highest PAR(tc) occurred at intermediate water levels, which were reached when the Yangtze River forces Lake Dahuchi out of its turbid state in early summer and the water becomes clear. The intended operation of the Three Gorges Dam, which will increase water levels in May and June, may advance the moment when Lake Dahuchi switches from turbid to clear. We suggest that this might increase production of V. spiralis and possibly improve the food habitat conditions for wintering Siberian crane in Poyang Lake.					邬国锋/B-8735-2018; Skidmore, Andrew/C-7441-2011	Prins, Herbert/0000-0003-1131-5107; Skidmore, Andrew/0000-0002-7446-8429; de Leeuw, Jan/0000-0001-7020-2503; 													0018-8158					MAY	2009	623	1					213	222		10.1007/s10750-008-9659-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-008-9659-7													WOS:000263076300015

Patterns in spatial use of land-locked Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in a large lake	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Understanding the spatial use of reintroduced fish is useful for fisheries management and evaluating restoration success. Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) were reintroduced into Lake Ontario in the 1990s; however, the movement ecology of these land-locked fish is unknown. Using acoustic telemetry and Floy tag mark-recaptures, we examined seasonal home range and space use of Atlantic salmon in Lake Ontario. Hatchery-raised adult Atlantic salmon were tagged with acoustic transmitters (n = 14; 8 with depth sensors) or Floy tags (n = 1915) and released. Both acoustic telemetry and Floy tag recaptures (n = 90) indicated cross lake movements, and home ranges encompassed nearly the entire lake in summer but was smaller in winter. Movements were nearshore (<2 km from shore) from spring to summer at similar to 20 m bathymetric depths, with movements closer to shore in the fall, and further offshore (similar to 5.5 km from shore and 45 m bathymetric depths) in winter. Depth use was relatively shallow (<4 m) with occasional deeper dives (max = 28.5 m), and small diel vertical movements (1-5 m), moving deeper during daytime, consistent with ocean movements of Atlantic salmon. There appears to be spatial segregation among Atlantic salmon and other Lake Ontario salmonids, however, overlap likely occurs in nearshore waters during the spring. Wide-ranging movements of Atlantic salmon in binational (Canada/USA) waters reflects the importance of government agencies collaborating to ensure sustainable fisheries and the coordination of species restoration activities. This is the first study to provide detailed spatial use of Lake Ontario Atlantic salmon to assist in the management of this reintroduced species.

J	Obertegger, U; Borsato, A; Flaim, G				Obertegger, Ulrike; Borsato, Andrea; Flaim, Giovanna			Rotifer-crustacean interactions in a pseudokarstic lake: influence of hydrology	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Zooplankton abundance was related to hydrological and environmental variables in a hydrologically dynamic lake fed by a pseudokarstic aquifer. The study period (2002-2006) in Lake Tovel covered different hydrological situations with water residence time (WRT) having the lowest values in 2002 and the highest values in 2003. WRT was negatively correlated with silica concentrations and algal biovolume. Furthermore, the biovolume of small algae was highest in spring and summer, while large algae did not show any pattern. In multivariate analysis, high abundance of crustacean species in autumn and winter was positively related to WRT and negatively to algal biovolume, while high abundance of rotifer species in spring and summer was negatively related to WRT and positively to algal biovolume. With the exception of Keratella cochlearis and Gastropus stylifer, rotifers showed a pattern of crustacean avoidance, and three groups were distinguished: (i) Ascomorpha ecaudis and Polyarthra dolichoptera, (ii) Asplanchna priodonta and Synchaeta spp., and (iii) Filinia terminalis and Keratella quadrata. These groups were associated with different food sources and depths. We suggest that WRT influenced the rotifer-crustacean relationship by wash-out effects and competition for food resources. The dynamics of single rotifer species were attributable to specific feeding requirements and adaptations. In summary, WRT determined the platform for abiotic and biotic interactions that influenced population dynamics of crustaceans and rotifers.

The timing, magnitude and intensity of these events are very sensitive to changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, particularly across the boreal region where snowpacks are declining and summer droughts are increasing. It is important to understand how landscape characteristics modulate event-scale DOC dynamics in order to scale up predictions from sites across regions, and to understand how climatic changes will influence DOC dynamics across the boreal forest. The goal of this study was to assess variability in DOC concentrations in boreal headwater streams across catchments with varying physiographic characteristics (e.g., size, proportion of wetland) during a range of hydrological events (e.g., spring snowmelt, summer/fall storm events). From 2016 to 2017, continuous discharge and sub-daily chemistry grab samples were collected from three adjacent study catchments located at the International Institute for Sustainable Development-Experimental Lakes Area in northwestern Ontario, Canada. Catchment differences were more apparent in summer and fall events and less apparent during early spring melt events. Hysteresis analysis suggested that DOC sources were proximal to the stream for all events at a catchment dominated by a large wetland near the outlet, but distal from the stream at the catchments that lacked significant wetland coverage during the summer and fall. Wetland coverage also influenced responses of DOC export to antecedent moisture; at the wetland-dominated catchment, there were consistent negative relationships between DOC concentrations and antecedent moisture, while at the catchments without large wetlands, the relationships were positive or not significant. These results emphasize the utility of sub-daily sampling for inferring catchment DOC transport processes, and the importance of considering catchment-specific factors when predicting event-scale DOC behaviour.					; Higgins, Scott/F-5700-2016; Casson, Nora/P-1915-2018	Friesen-Hughes, Karl/0000-0003-4476-0100; Casson, Nora/0000-0002-0701-1816; Higgins, Scott/0000-0001-9427-7024													0885-6087	1099-1085				JUL	2021	35	7							e14279	10.1002/hyp.14279	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14279													WOS:000678409000029

The ponds were located below and above treeline at 600 m a.s.l., with 2-4 fold higher concentration of DOC below treeline. The concentration of DOC changed during the open-water season with highest values measured in mid-summer. Bacterial production, abundance, biomass were highest in mid-summer and correlated positively with the concentration of DOC. Quality indices of DOC showed that spring differed from the rest of the season. Highest specific UV-absorbance (SUVA) and humification index (HI), ratio a250/a265 and lowest fluorescence index (FI) were found during spring compared to summer and autumn, possibly indicating higher relative importance of allochthonous carbon during spring and a seasonal effect of photo-oxidation. According to Length Heterogeneity Polymerase Chain Reaction (LH-PCR) analyses, bacterial communities in spring were significantly different from those later in the season, possible due to the introduction of terrestrial bacteria associated with higher molecular weight material in spring DOC. Comparison between ponds situated above and below treeline revealed that bacteria were more abundant and productive at lower altitudes, which is probably connected to higher concentrations of DOC. The results also suggest that increased temperature and precipitation induced by global change and consequent higher allochthonous DOC runoff from the catchment could have a strong impact on biomass, productivity and community composition of micro-organisms in subarctic ponds and lakes.					; Cazzanelli, Matteo/AAG-5168-2021	Cazzanelli, Matteo/0000-0002-8203-1366; Tiirola, Marja/0000-0001-5589-3748; 													1015-1621	1420-9055				JUL	2012	74	3					513	525		10.1007/s00027-011-0244-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-011-0244-1													WOS:000305730500012

Influence of seasonal changes in runoff and extreme events on dissolved organic carbon trends in wetland- and upland-draining streams	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Dissolved organic carbon ( DOC) fluxes at eight headwater basins in south-central Ontario were strongly related to seasonal streamflow, and extreme events contributed to both interannual and intercatchment variability. Six catchments with high stream DOC and greater peatland coverage exhibited a different seasonal pattern of DOC concentration compared with two catchments with low DOC and less wetland influence. In wetland-dominated catchments, DOC concentrations decreased during fall wet-up and spring melt, and because of the dominance of the spring melt period in annual budgets, variations in spring flow explained 39%-48% of the intervariability in DOC concentration. Significant increases in average DOC concentration between 1980 and 2001 at all six wetland-dominated catchments were driven by relatively high DOC concentrations in the latter years of record, consistent with low spring flow in these years, and were not translated into greater DOC export to downstream lakes. Localized rainstorms in summer and fall resulted in differences in DOC export among adjacent catchments, and a single fall storm in September 1998 was only detected at one of six catchments draining into Harp Lake but accounted for one-quarter of the annual tributary DOC load to the lake.

Analysis of the Atmospheric Water Cycle for the Laurentian Great Lakes Region Using CMIP6 Models	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												This study evaluates the historical climatology and future changes of the atmospheric water cycle for the Laurentian Great Lakes region using 15 models from phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). While the models have unique seasonal characteristics in the historical (1981-2010) simulations, common patterns emerge in the midcentury SSP2-4.5 scenario (2041-70), including a prevalent shift in the precipitation seasonal cycle with summer drying and wetter winter and spring months, and a ubiquitous increase in the magnitudes of convective precipitation, evapotranspiration, and moisture inflow into the region. The seasonal cycle of moisture flux convergence is amplified (i.e., the magnitude of winter convergence and summer divergence increases), which is the primary driver of future total precipitation changes. The precipitation recycling ratio is also projected to decline in summer and increase in winter by midcentury, signifying a larger contribution of the regional moisture (via evapotranspiration) to total precipitation in the colder months. Most models (10/15) either do not represent the Great Lakes or have major inconsistencies in how the lakes are simulated both in terms of spatial representation and treatment of lake processes. In models with some lake presence, the contribution of lake grid cells to the regional evapotranspiration magnitude can be more than 50% in winter. In the future, winter months have a larger increase in evaporation over water surfaces than the surrounding land, which corroborates past findings of sensitivity of deep lakes to climate warming and highlights the importance of lake representation in these models for reliable regional hydroclimatic assessments.

Seasonal dynamics of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in littoral benthos in the upper Yenisei river	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												We studied composition and concentrations of fatty acids (FAs) in benthos from pebbly littoral region of the Yenisei River in a sampling site near Krasnoyarsk city (Siberia, Russia) for 1 year from March 2003 to February 2004. Special attention was paid to major long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) of the omega 3 family: eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5 omega 3) and docosahexaenoic acids (DHA, 22:6 omega 3). In phytobenthos, which was dominated by diatoms, the annual maxima of EPA and DHA pool occurred in spring and early summer. In zoobenthos, EPA and DHA pool peaked in autumn, due mainly to an increase of the biomass of dominant taxa (gammarids) and to a moderate increase of the PUFA content per body weight. Seasonal peaks of EPA in overwintering insect larvae (chironomids and caddisflies) generally coincided with those of biomass of these larvae, while there was no such trend for amphipods and oligochaetes. In spring and early summer, the main part of omega 3 PUFA, 40-97% of total amount, in the littoral region was contained in biomass of producers, i.e., benthic microalgae, and in autumn it was transferred to primary consumers-benthic invertebrates, which contained similar to 76-93% of total omega 3 PUFAs.

The spatial precipitation variability analysis shows an increasing gradient of precipitation from northeast to southwest in the study area. Annual, spring, summer, and winter precipitation present increasing trend, but autumn precipitation shows a decreasing trend in the last 50 years. It is also noted that the distribution of the intra-annual precipitation is very uneven, precipitation in rainy season (May-October) accounts for about 90 % of the total annual rain. Meanwhile, this research analyzes the spatial precipitation characteristic of the rainy season in 2013 (mainly from June to September). Based on the observed precipitation data and the meteorological station data, the rainy season precipitation that varies according to different topographic conditions is analyzed, and the regression model between recorded precipitation and geographical factors is built up too. The spatial distribution graph of the rainy season precipitation is generated on GIS platform by regression model and graphical features. This distribution shows a general northeast-southwest gradient of increasing rainy season precipitation in the study area and has detailed spatial precipitation characteristic along with altitude.

J	Cai, YF; Kong, FX				Cai, Yuanfeng; Kong, Fanxiang			Diversity and dynamics of picocyanobacteria and bloom-forming cyanobacteria in a large shallow eutrophic lake (lake Chaohu, China)	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The diversity and succession pattern of cyanobacteria, particularly picocyanobacteria and bloom-forming cyanobacteria, were examined monthly in a eutrophic lake (lake Chaohu) in China using a combination of light microscopy and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequence analysis. The results showed that both picocyanobacteria and bloom-forming cyanobacteria have high levels of diversity. Microcystis and Anabaena were the two predominant bloom-forming genera, and two obvious shifts occurred between them from spring to winter. Anabaena was dominant in spring, then it was rapidly replaced by Microcystis in summer and became dominant again in late autumn and early winter. Apart from water temperature, three forms of dissolved nitrogen (NO3-N, NO2-N, and NH4-N) were important driving factors for their seasonal succession, as demonstrated by redundancy analysis. Clone libraries and sequence analysis revealed that picocyanobacteria (mainly Synechococcus-like) are also important cyanobacteria members in lake Chaohu. All 8 picocyanobacterial phylotypes belonged to the Cyanobium clade. The phylotypes could be further grouped into at least 7 distinct clusters, and 4 of these clusters do not belong to any of the previously described clusters. Picocyanobacteria accounted for more than 70% (percentage in the clone library) in March and April but only accounted for less than 10% from June to October during the Microcystis bloom. The relative abundance of picocyanobacteria was positively correlated with the mass ratio of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus (r=0.965, P<0.01, n=10) and ammonium concentration (r=0.721, P<0.05, n=10).

Altaf; Champagne, Olivier; Chow-Fraser, Patricia; Martin-Hill, Dawn			Impacts of climate change on streamflow in the McKenzie Creek watershed in the Great Lakes region	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Introduction: This study explored streamflow dynamics of the McKenzie Creek watershed in Southern Ontario, Canada under a changing climate. The Creek is located in the southern portion of the Grand River watershed in the Great Lakes region and is an important water and ecosystem service provider for the Six Nations of the Grand River reserve, the largest (by population) Indigenous community in Canada and the fourth largest in North America.Methods: The Coupled Groundwater and Surface-Water Flow Model (GSFLOW) was used to simulate streamflow from 1951 to 2020 using observed gridded meteorological data from Natural Resources Canada (NRCANmet) and in situ data from Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC). Downscaled data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) for two Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) climate warming scenarios, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 were used to run GSFLOW for the historic (1951-2020) and projected (2021-2099) period.Results: Results suggested that streamflow in the McKenzie Creek will be significantly impacted by climate change in winter months when streamflow is projected to increase due to higher temperatures causing early melting of snowpack and increasing winter precipitation. Consequently, spring streamflow is expected to decrease and little or no change in streamflow in the summer and autumn. These changes in streamflow dynamics may lead to more flooding incidents in the winter, while at the same time, the region may face reduced water availability or dry conditions in late spring and summer due to warm temperatures.Discussion: This study provides important information about streamflow and hydrologic dynamics of this watershed that will help managers and planners to better manage water resources and be prepared to deal with climate change and its impacts on water availability and security not only for the Six Nations area but also for Southern Ontario which houses one-third of Canada's population.

The upper streams of the Kelan River are located on the southern slope of the Altay Mountains; they arise from small glacial lakes at an elevation of more than 2,500 m. The total water-collection area of the studied basin, from 988 to 3,480 m, is about 1,655 km(2). Almost 95 percent of the basin area is covered with snow in winter. The westerly air masses deplete nearly all the moisture that comes in the form of snow during the winter months in the upper and middle reaches of the basin. That annual flow from the basin is about 382 mm, about 45 percent of which is contributed by snowmelt. The mean annual precipitation in the basin is about 620 mm, which is primarily concentrated in the upper and middle basin. The Kelan River system could be vulnerable to climate change because of substantial contribution from snowmelt runoff. The hydrological system could be altered significantly because of a warming of the climate. The impact of climate change on the hydrological cycle and events would pose an additional threat to the Altay region. The Kelan River, a typical snow-dominated watershed, has more area at higher elevations and accumulates snow during the winter. The peak flow occurs as a result of snow-melting during the late spring or early summer. Stream flow varies strongly throughout the year because of seasonal cycles of precipitation, snowpack, temperature, and groundwater. Changes in the temperature and precipitation affect the timing and volume of stream-flow. The stream-flow consists of contributions from meltwater of snow and ice and from runoff of rainfall. Therefore, it has low flow in winter, high flow during the spring and early summer as the snowpack melts, and less flows during the late summer. Because of the warming of the current climate change, hydrology processes of the Kelan River have undergone marked changes, as evidenced by the shift of the maximum flood peak discharge from May to June; the largest monthly runoffs also have an increment of about 15 percent related to before 1980; April-June runoff increased from the 60 percent of the annual runoff before 1980 to nearly 70 percent after 1990. The long-term trend shows temperature and precipitation increased mainly in the winter, but the rainfall declined in summer; hydrological process is manifested by the rising runoff in May and decreasing in June. Warming and the increase of winter and spring snowcover would lead to increased snowmelt, increasing the spring-flood hazards and the maximum flood discharge with disastrous consequences. The changed hydrological patterns caused by climate change have already impacted the urban water supply and agricultural and livestock production along the river.																			1674-3822						2010	2	4					315	327																WOS:000422277600005

A total of 271 specimens of A. boyeri, 208 female and 63 male, mean (+/- SD) total length 8.4 +/- 2.2 cm (range 3.1-12.2 cm) and mean total weight 4.7 +/- 3.5 g (range 0.1-11.7 g) were examined between June 2008 and May 2009 at monthly intervals. In 33 fish no parasites were found. In the other fish, four parasite species were recorded: Diplostomum sp. (prevalence 39.13%, mean intensity 3.50 +/- 3.03); Tylodelphys clavata (prevalence 74.16%, mean intensity 10.41 +/- 14.89); Bothriocephalus cf. acheilognathi (prevalence 40.59%, mean intensity 31.83 +/- 57.74); and Eustrongylides excisus (prevalence 6.64%, mean intensity 1.16 +/- 0.39). The mean abundance of Diplostomum sp., T. clavata and E. excisus was higher during the winter and early spring months. In contrast, the mean abundance of B. cf. acheilognathi was higher in the summer and autumn months. This distribution of the parasites was related to a change in the environment of A. boyeri from the pelagic zone to deeper water at the end of autumn and a change in food supply.

Synoptic climatology and recent climate trends at Lake El'gygytgyn	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												We developed a synoptic climatology for Lake El' gygytgyn, Chukotka Russia, and explored modern climate trends affecting air temperatures there to aid in paleoclimate reconstructions of a 3.6 million-year-old sediment core taken from the lake. Our self-organized mapping (SOM) approach identified 35 synoptic weather patterns, based on sea level pressure, that span the range of synoptic patterns influencing the study domain over the 1961-2009 NCEP/NCAR analysis period. We found strong seasonality in modern weather patterns, with summer weather primarily characterized by weak low pressure systems over the Arctic Ocean or Siberia and winter weather primarily characterized by strong high pressure over the Arctic Ocean and strong low pressure in the Pacific Ocean. In general, the primary source of variation in air temperatures came from the dominant patterns in each season, which we identify in the text, and nearly all of the dominant weather patterns here have shown increasing temperatures. We found that nearly all of the warming in mean annual temperature over the past 50 yr (about 3 C) occurred during sub-freezing conditions on either side of summer (that is, spring and fall). Here we found that the most summer-like weather patterns (low pressures to the north) in the shoulder seasons were responsible for much of the change. Finally, we compared the warmest 15 yr of the record (1995-2009) to the coolest (1961-1975) and found that changes in thermodynamics of weather were about 3 to 300 times more important than changes in frequency of weather patterns in controlling temperature variations during spring and fall, respectively. That is, in the modern record, general warming (local or advected) is more important by orders of magnitude than changes in storm tracks in controlling air temperature at Lake El'gygytgyn. We conclude with a discussion of how these results may be relevant to the paleoclimate reconstruction efforts and how this relevancy could be tested further.

Altaf; Coulibaly, Paulin; Gachon, Philippe			Evaluating the Dependence between Temperature and Precipitation to Better Estimate the Risks of Concurrent Extreme Weather Events	ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY												Precipitation and temperature are among major climatic variables that are used to characterize extreme weather events, which can have profound impacts on ecosystems and society. Accurate simulation of these variables at the local scale is essential to adapt urban systems and policies to future climatic changes. However, accurate simulation of these climatic variables is difficult due to possible interdependence and feedbacks among them. In this paper, the concept of copulas was used to model seasonal interdependence between precipitation and temperature. Five copula functions were fitted to grid (approximately 10 km x 10 km) climate data from 1960 to 2013 in southern Ontario, Canada. Theoretical and empirical copulas were then compared with each other to select the most appropriate copula family for this region. Results showed that, of the tested copulas, none of them consistently performed the best over the entire region during all seasons. However, Gumbel copula was the best performer during the winter season, and Clayton performed best in the summer. More variability in terms of best copula was found in spring and fall seasons. By examining the likelihoods of concurrent extreme temperature and precipitation periods including wet/cool in the winter and dry/hot in the summer, we found that ignoring the joint distribution and confounding impacts of precipitation and temperature lead to the underestimation of occurrence of probabilities for these two concurrent extreme modes. This underestimation can also lead to incorrect conclusions and flawed decisions in terms of the severity of these extreme events.					; Arain, M./ABA-9750-2020; Hussein, Wazneh/AAZ-3790-2020	Gachon, Philippe/0000-0002-0711-0822; Wazneh, Hussein/0000-0002-6586-6804; Arain, M.

Three main periods of protozoan development were observed, in early April, early May, and ill July. On the basis of the seasonal dynamics,. it appeared that the early spring development of protozoa was probably not controlled by resources or predators. The second protozoan development was progressively controlled by the increase of metazooplankton density that led to the clear water phase characterised by very low protozoan densities and biomasses. A summer development of protozoa was possible thanks to the development of bacteria and moderate inetazooplankton densities due to the appearance of non-edible algae. Prorodontida, Halterlida and Strombidilda were the dominant ciliates in the upper part of the water column. A development of Tintinnida was moreover observed in spring whereas Philasterida and Sessilida developed in winter and summer. Ciliates occupied the entire water column in spring and were concentrated in the epilimnion and the metalimnion during the summer period where they fed on bacteria and algae.

Seasonal Translocations of Nitrogen and Phosphorus in Two Lobelian Lakes in the Vicinity of Bytow, (West Pomeranian Lake District)	POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES												The aim of this paper was to determine the nutrient translocations between different chemical forms (mineral and organic), as well as between different parts of a lake system (pelagic and benthic; epi- meta- and hypolimnion) in an annual cycle. Nitrogen and phosphorus content in lakes Jelen and Maly Borek were estimated in monthly intervals (except periods of ice cover). In both lakes the biggest amounts of pelagic P and N were recorded in autumn. With the beginning of the growth season the quick decrease of P-total in both lakes was observed, attributed to the sedimentation of the particulate organic material. At the end of spring phosphorus resources dropped by about 50%, and the biggest reduction was observed in epilimnion. Translocations of nitrogen during the vegetative period were poorly synchronized with phosphorus translocations. N-total stocks in water column during spring were increasing or stable. The increase was especially intensive in lake Jelen and was associated with cyanobacterial nitrogen fixation. This process was stopped and nitrogen resources started to decrease when phosphorus resources attained a minimum level. In the second half of summer (before autumn overturn) the amounts of N and P started to increase, due to enhanced migration of nutrients from sediments. During the winter period extensive nitrification was manifested by the downfall of ammonium and simultaneous growth of nitrate stocks. The lakes differ substantially in such features as the levels of ammonium concentration, rate of phosphate and ammonium accumulation in hypolimnion, or intensity of nitrogen fixation. Symptoms of internal loading with phosphorus and extensive nitrogen fixation were found in lake Jelen, one of the clearest lakes in Poland.																			1230-1485						2009	18	5					827	836																WOS:000271005300009

Additionally, we assessed the changes in DO stratification over the past 61 years (1953-2013) based on our empirical models and long-term air temperature and transparency data. The DO concentration never fell below 2 mg/L, the critical value for anoxia, and the DO depth profiles were closely linked to the water temperature depth profiles. In the stable stratification period in summer and autumn, the significant increase in CDOM in the metalimnion explained the decrease in DO due to the oxygen consumed by CDOM. Well-developed oxygen stratification was detected at the three sites in spring, summer and autumn and was associated with thermal stratification. Oxycline depth was significantly negatively correlated with daily air temperature and thermocline thickness but significantly positively correlated with thermocline depth during the stratification weakness period (July-February). However, there were no significant correlations among these parameters during the stratification formation period (March-June). The increase of 1.67 degrees C in yearly average daily air temperature between 1980 and 2013 and the decrease of 0.78 m in Secchi disk depth caused a decrease of 1.65 m and 2.78 m in oxycline depth, respectively, facilitating oxygen stratification and decreasing water quality. Therefore, climate warming has had a substantial effect on water quality through changing the DO regime in Lake Qiandaohu. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Knapton, RW; Petrie, SA; Herring, G				Knapton, RW; Petrie, SA; Herring, G			Human disturbance of diving ducks on Long Point Bay, Lake Erie	WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN												Excessive human disturbance can have detrimental effects on waterfowl foraging efficiency and body fat acquisition and can ultimately reduce the carrying capacity of migrational staging areas. We monitored the influence of human activities on staging waterfowl on the Inner Bay at Long Point, Lake Erie during spring (92 hours) and fall (108 hours) of 1993, Mixed-species flocks of diving ducks (Aythya spp.) were the most frequently disturbed waterfowl group. Disturbance rates were greater in spring than fall, but number of birds disturbed was considerably greater in fall (P<0.05). This was because birds tended to be concentrated in a few locations during fail, such as the middle of the bay ia no-hunting sanctuary in Call), and disturbances often elicited a response from entire flocks. Although results were insignificant, diving ducks tended to fly farther and spend more time in flight following fall disturbances. Birds disturbed in spring followed a response A model; they flew away from the disturbance but promptly resumed feeding once the disturbance (primarily commercial fishing boats) had passed. Some birds disturbed in fall followed a response B model; they flew away from the foraging area and probably discontinued feeding, although daily rates of disturbance were low (primarily by hunting boats). Providing refuges in portions of the Inner Bay that restricted or banned boat traffic during peak migration would probably increase the suitability of Long Point as a staging area for diving ducks. Reductions in disturbance would be particularly beneficial in spring, because females must acquire body fat for reproduction and migration at a time when ice cover and winter senescence often limit availability of food resources.

Samples were collected quarterly at four sites (River Mouth, Meiliang Bay, Cross Area, and Lake Center) from August 2006 to April 2007. Results showed that Microcystis dominated total phytoplankton abundance at the four sites in all seasons except winter. The average annual abundance of Microcystis was relatively high at River Mouth and Meiliang Bay, reaching 81.22 x 10(6) and 61.32 x 10(6) cells/L, respectively. For temporal variations, Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H') according to DGGE profile revealed the richness of Microcystis in summer (H' = 1.375 +/- 0.034) and winter (H' = 1.650 +/- 0.032) was lower than that in spring (H' = 2.078 +/- 0.031) and autumn (H' = 2.365 +/- 0.032) (P < 0.05). While for spatial variations, the richness of Microcystis at River Mouth (H' = 2.015 +/- 0.074) was higher than at other sites during four seasons (P < 0.01). Very few differences of Microcystis diversity in the same season were observed among the other three sites (P > 0.05). Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was performed to elucidate the relationships between Microcystis operational taxonomic units (OTUs) composition and the environmental factors. Results of CCA revealed that temperature was strongly positively correlated with the first axis (r = 0.963), while TSS was negative correlated with the second axis (r = -0.716). Phylogenetic tree based on the sequencing results of target bands on DGGE gel indicated that samples collected in summer and winter constituted two separated clusters.					; zhang, min/IYI-9869-2023; Cao, Huansheng/C-2182-2015	TAN, Xiao/0000-0003-3109-9114; , Min/0000-0002-8130-5214; 													1001-0742	1878-7320					2009	21	7					892	899		10.1016/S1001-0742(08)62359-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-0742(08)62359-1								19862953					WOS:000267908700005
J	Ma, BJ; Wang, Y; Jiang, P; Li, SY				Ma, Bingjie; Wang, Yang; Jiang, Ping; Li, Siyue			The Influence of Seasonal Variability of Eutrophication Indicators on Carbon Dioxide and Methane Diffusive Emissions in the Largest Shallow Urban Lake in China	WATER												Eutrophication is prevalent in urban lakes; however, a knowledge gap exists regarding eutrophication influences on carbon dynamics in these ecosystems. In the present study, we investigated the carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) concentration and diffusion fluxes in Lake Tangxun (the largest shallow Chinese urban lake) in the autumn and winter of 2022 and spring and summer of 2023. We found that Lake Tangxun served as a source of GHGs, with average emission rates of 5.52 +/- 12.16 mmol CO2 m-2 d-1 and 0.83 +/- 2.81 mmol CH4 m-2 d-1, respectively. The partial pressure of dissolved CO2 (pCO2) (averaging 1321.39 +/- 1614.63 mu atm) and dissolved CH4 (dCH4) (averaging 4.29 +/- 13.71 mu mol L-1) exceeded saturation levels. Seasonal variability was observed in the pCO2 and dCH4 as well as CH4 fluxes, while the CO2 flux remained constant. The mean pCO2 and dCH4, as well as carbon emissions, were generally higher in summer and spring. pCO2 and dCH4 levels were significantly related to total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and ammonium-nitrogen (N-NH4+), and N-NH4+ was a main influencing factor of pCO2 and dCH4 in urban eutrophic lakes. The positive relationships of pCO2, dCH4 and trophic state index highlighted that eutrophication could elevate CO2 and CH4 emissions from the lake. This study highlights the fact that eutrophication can significantly increase carbon emissions in shallow urban lakes and that urban lakes are substantial contributors to the global carbon budget.					; Li, Siyue/E-8297-2012	Wang, Yang/0000-0003-1625-2651; Li, Siyue/0000-0002-3097-6819														2073-4441				JAN	2024	16	1							136	10.3390/w16010136	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16010136													WOS:001140691900001

The responses of nutrient concentrations, plankton, macrophytes and macrozoobenthos to a reduction in external nutrient loading and to contemporary climatic change were studied in the shallow, moderately flushed Lake Muggelsee (Berlin, Germany). Weekly to biweekly data from 1979 to 2003 were compared with less frequently collected historical data. 2. A reduction of more than 50% in both total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) loading from the hypertrophic (1979-90) to the eutrophic period (1997-2003) was followed by an immediate decline in TN concentrations in the lake. TP concentrations only declined during winter and spring. During summer, phosphorus (P) release from the sediments was favoured by a drastic reduction in nitrate import. Therefore, Muggelsee acted as a net P source for 6 years after the external load reduction despite a mean water retention time of only 0.1-0.16 years. 3. Because of the likely limitation by P in spring and nitrogen (N) in summer, phytoplankton biovolume declined immediately after nutrient loading was reduced. The formerly dominant cyanobacteria (Oscillatoriales) Limnothrix redekei and Planktothrix agardhii disappeared, but the mean biovolume of the N-2-fixing species Aphanizomenon flos-aquae remained constant. 4. The abundance of Daphnia spp. in summer decreased by half, while that of cyclopoid copepod species increased. Abundances of benthic macroinvertebrates (mainly chironomids) decreased by about 80%. A resource control of both phytoplankton and zooplankton is indicated by significant positive correlations between nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton biovolume and between phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass. 5. Water transparency in spring increased after nutrient reduction and resulted in re-colonisation of the lake by Potamogeton pectinatus. However, this process was severely hampered by periphyton shading and grazing by waterfowl and fish. 6. Water temperatures in Muggelsee have increased in winter, early spring and summer since 1979. The earlier development of the phytoplankton spring bloom was associated with shorter periods with ice cover, while direct temperature effects were responsible for the earlier development of the daphnid maximum in spring.

The dietary contribution of MOB is known to be maximized in the autumn overturn period or winter in eutrophic dimictic lakes due to the increase of MOB biomass following the supply of oxygenated water, but in polymictic lakes, such seasonal variability has not been revealed. We investigated the seasonal patterns of larval delta C-13 and methane concentrations in the sediment of a eutrophic polymictic lake, Izunuma, Japan. Larval delta C-13 decreased in late summer and autumn. Methane concentrations above a 6 cm depth peaked in late summer or autumn, while those in the 10-11- and 20-21-cm layers peaked in October. Negative correlations between methane concentrations in the 5-6/10-11-cm layers and larval delta C-13 were found. This suggests that an increase in the supply of methane stimulated the activity of MOB in a polymictic lake, where water above the lake bottom rarely became anoxic because of frequent overturn, thus increasing the dietary contribution of MOB to larval chironomids.

The nets were fished simultaneously and in the same habitats (within 15-20 m of each other). The mean catch per unit effort (CPUE) was significantly higher (36.7 vs. 19.1 fish net-night(-1)) for hoop nets than for frame nets (P < 0.05). Hoop nets caught significantly more (P < 0.05) fish than frame nets in summer (44.0 vs. 14.7 fish net-night(-1)), but both gear types were equally effective during autumn, winter, and spring. Fish caught by both gear types encompassed the same size ranges but frame nets caught significantly larger (P < 0.05) fish (mean total length (TL), 154 mm; SD, 34 mm; N=3321; range, 73-392 mm) than hoop nets (mean TL, 139 mm; SD, 20 mm; N=4040; range, 76-386 mm). For each gear type, the mean CPUE was similar between seasons, except in summer when hoop nets caught more fish (P < 0.05). We believe using frame nets as the sole gear for crappie stock assessment could result in an underestimate of the year-class strength of younger fishes.																			0165-7836					DEC	1993	18	3-4					231	240		10.1016/0165-7836(93)90155-Z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0165-7836(93)90155-Z													WOS:A1993MT23900006

The distribution of the species is patchy; numbers reach a maximum at 1.5 m in the soft bottom in front of the macrophyte zone. Nine instars (the 9th being the adult stage) can be separated by length measurements. The 1st 2 instars were observed only between the carapace valves of the adults; the 3rd instar is the 1st that lives freely in the sediment. Five to 6 instars (including adults) were always present. All the changes in the population structure took place in summer: reproduction starts in early June, has its maximum in July-Aug. and ceases in Sept. The maximum number of embryos observed within a single adult was 11; the highest mean number of embryos per adult during the reproductive season was 7.8 in 1975 and 6.3 in 1976. In summer 1975, the maximum reproductive rate (embryos produced/adult per day) was 0.20 and in 1976 0.16. No changes in the population structure were observed during the long, cold winter period. The life cycle of this species in Paajarvi is at least 3-4 yr.																			0003-455X	1797-2450					1979	16	1					28	35																WOS:A1979GX04100003

In total, 11 species were recorded, including six (6 genera) cladoceran and five (5 genera) copepod species. The crustacean zooplankton densities ranged from 24.3 to 155.4 ind./L. In winter and spring, the large-bodied cladoceran Daphnia galeata dominated the crustacean plankton community. In summer and autumn, when the colonial or filamentous algae dominated the phytoplankton communities, the small-bodied species (e.g. B osmina fatalis, Ceriodaphnia quadrangular, and Mesocyclops leuckarti) replaced the large-bodied ones. One-way ANOVA and redundancy analysis revealed that community structure was dependent upon total nitrogen, total phosphorus, water temperature, transparency, and the biomass of small algae. The variation in both phytoplankton structure and environmental variables were important factors in the seasonal succession of crustacean zooplankton structure in Erhai Lake.																			0254-4059	1993-5005				SEP	2014	32	5					1074	1082		10.1007/s00343-014-3204-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-014-3204-5													WOS:000340879900012

Fish reproductive phenology shifts with increasing temperature and year	BIOLOGY LETTERS												Temperate fishes often spawn in response to environmental cues, such as temperature, thereby facilitating larval emergence concurrent with suitable biotic and abiotic conditions, such as plankton blooms. Climatic changes may alter the reproductive phenology of spring- and autumn-spawning freshwater fish populations. Such effects may depend on the sensitivity of reproductive phenology to ambient temperatures. We applied a meta-analysis approach to test whether annual temperature and year affected fish reproductive phenology. Based on preliminary tests in walleye (Sander vitreus) and Lake Constance whitefish (Coregonus arenicolus), we hypothesized that increasing temperature would promote earlier spring-spawning and later autumn-spawning. We found spawning was significantly earlier in the spring and later in the autumn. We found that migration of autumn-spawning species occurred earlier with warmer temperatures, implying that with increasing temperatures, migrating autumn-spawning species will increase residence time in tributaries. We also found that spring-spawning fishes reproduced earlier in more recent years, while we observed no significant effect in autumn-spawners. Spring- and autumn-spawning fishes displayed interannual variation in spawning dates (mean range of 34.4 and 27.0 days over 33.9 years, respectively), with spring-spawning fishes displaying a significantly broader range in spawning dates.					; Selz, Oliver/AAH-7732-2020	Warren, Les/0000-0002-1022-9592; Tellier, Joshua/0000-0002-0971-5155; Koenigbauer, Scott/0000-0003-0203-5576; 													1744-9561	1744-957X				JAN 8	2025	21	1							20240240	10.1098/rsbl.2024.0240	http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2024.0240								39772916					WOS:001391821600001

How winter conditions affect spring phytoplankton in subtropical lakes without winter ice cover is, however, largely unknown. In this study, covering 26 years, we elucidated the effects of both climate conditions and nutrient levels in winter on the phytoplankton community (expressed as Morpho-Functional Groups) in spring in Lake Taihu, a large shallow subtropical lake in China. During this period, wind speed declined significantly in both winter and spring from 1992 to 2017 and the sunshine hours increased slightly from 2000 to 2017. The biomass of eight dominant phytoplankton groups showed increasing trends from 1992 to 2017, while it declined for one group, which mainly included filamentous green algae such asUlothrixsp. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) results indicated that wind speed and sunshine duration in winter and spring were the most important factors affecting the spring phytoplankton community in Lake Taihu. Also, partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM) suggested that the spring phytoplankton community was strongly affected by winter conditions. Our study indicated that the "climate memory" effects on phytoplankton, resulting from winter and acting on the following spring, not only occur in north temperate winter ice-covered shallow lakes but also in subtropical lakes without ice-covered in winter.

Sacrower See is a dimictic, 38 m deep, hypertrophic lowland lake (29.5 m a.s.l.). We identified distinct seasonal and interannual changes of diatom assemblages for the studied period. Diatoms showed a typical seasonal succession for temperate, dimictic, and eutrophic lakes. Stephanodiscus parvus, S. hantzschii, S. neoastraea, and S. alpinus had high accumulation rates during winter and spring, whereas species of the genera Stephanodiscus, Fragilaria, and Nitzschia were the predominant diatoms during summer and autumn. In a Canonical Correspondence Analysis, precipitation, air and water temperatures, epilimnetic calcium, pH, and total phosphorus concentrations together explained 70% of the variance of the diatom data. Interannual variability in the diatom assemblages during the two sampled years mainly seems to reflect changes in the total phosphorus concentration and temperature and secondarily the onset of the growing season and of stratification.					; Kirilova, Emiliya/C-2517-2011; Lotter, Andre/C-3477-2008; Zolitschka, Bernd/P-1487-2019; Heiri, Oliver/JCE-4598-2023; Lotter, Andre F./C-3477-2008	Ohlendorf, Christian/0000-0003-3794-7313; Zolitschka, Bernd/0000-0001-8256-0420; Heiri, Oliver/0000-0002-3957-5835; Lotter, Andre F./0000-0002-2954-8809													0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2008	614	1					159	170		10.1007/s10750-008-9504-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-008-9504-z													WOS:000259569000015

Our research on a small winterkill lake in northern Wisconsin indicates that fishes common in winterkill lakes have behavioral adaptions for tolerating or avoiding winter hypoxia. We examined the distribution of fishes within the lake during one winter (December through May), and fish migrations into and out of the lake for two consecutive years. As DO within the lake declined in late fall, adult-sized fishes of four species, brook stickleback, finescale dace, redbelly dace, and fathead minnow, moved to the ice-water interface where DO levels were highest. Stickleback, and to a lesser extent, fathead minnows, also moved toward the more highly oxygenated water near the inlet. During the first year, young-of-the year fishes of blacknose shiner. Iowa darter, redbelly dace, and fatheat minnow, avoided hypoxic conditions by emigrating from the lake via the outlet stream in late fall and early winter while DO within the lake was still relatively high. Blacknose shiner, redbelly dace, and fathead minnow returned to the lake in spring. Almost no fishes were trapped leaving the lake in the second fall-winter season. Central mudminnows neither moved to ice-water interface nor emigrated from the lake as DO dropped. Mudminnows survive winter hypoxia by breathing oxygen-containing bubbles trapped beneath the ice. These relatively simple behavioral adaptation allow fishes to survive or avoid hypoxic conditions lethal to other species and may help explain the consistency in fish communities of winterkill lakes.																			0378-1909	1573-5133					1985	14	4					241	250		10.1007/BF00002627	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00002627													WOS:A1985AWL7500001

Baiyangdian Lake is generally in a state of mesotrophication, and some areas are slightly eutrophic; the degree of eutrophication is higher in the summer and autumn than in the spring. The lake water at the inlet is eutrophic and polluted, with an inferior water quality. Heavy metals are almost not detected in Baiyangdian Lake. The heavy metal pollution indices of Nanliuzhuang and Caiputai are slightly higher than those of other areas. The ecological risk quotient of petroleum is high. The comprehensive ecological risk of the Baiyangdian Lake is at Level 4, owing to the continuous development of aquaculture and tourism in recent years. We should start the monitoring, management, and strengthening of water quality supervision to achieve the ecological and environmental planning goals of Baiyangdian Lake.					; shi, longyu/E-5345-2017; Chen, Dingkai/GRY-1798-2022	He, Sinan/0000-0003-4064-5463; 														2073-4441				NOV	2022	14	21							3352	10.3390/w14213352	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14213352													WOS:000882274100001
J	Kamenik, C; Schmidt, R				Kamenik, C; Schmidt, R			Chrysophyte resting stages: a tool for reconstructing winter/spring climate from Alpine lake sediments	BOREAS												Chrysophyte algae produce siliceous resting stages (stomatocysts) that are indicators of past environmental conditions. The objective of this study was to assess their strength for climate reconstructions. Stomatocysts were collected using sediment traps exposed in 45 mountain lakes (1502-2309 m a.s.l., Austrian Alps). Bihourly water-temperature measurements were used to determine dates of freezing and break-up, spring and autumn mixing. Canonical correspondence analyses revealed that the stomatocyst assemblages were related to the dates of ice break-up and spring mixing. The two dates are controlled by winter/spring air temperature. We developed a weighted averaging-partial least squares (WA-PLS) stomatocyst/date-of-spring-mixing regression and calibration model (R-boot(2) = 0.85), and reconstructed 'dates of spring mixing' for Jezero v Ledvici (1824 m a.s.l., Slovenian Alps) from AD 1842 to 1996. Sample-specific standard errors of prediction corresponded to 0.6 degrees C - 1.0 degrees C. Despite dating uncertainties and poor fits of fossil assemblages with the training set, reconstructed 'dates of spring mixing' were significantly correlated with the mean March-April air temperature, which is known to drive break-up dates. Furthermore, the record was in agreement with glacier advances during the Little Ice Age.																			0300-9483	1502-3885				NOV	2005	34	4					477	489		10.1080/03009480500231468	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03009480500231468													WOS:000233566000008
J	HENDRICKS, SP; WHITE, DS				HENDRICKS, SP; WHITE, DS			SEASONAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL PATTERNS IN SURFACE-WATER, SUBSURFACE HYPORHEIC, AND RIPARIAN GROUND-WATER IN A TEMPERATE STREAM ECOSYSTEM	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Relationships among stream surface water (9-km reach), substream hyporheic water (10-m pool-riffle-pool reach), and riparian groundwater (single site) biogeochemical patterns were examined in four seasons (1989-1990) in a temperate stream ecosystem (Michigan, USA). Surface water concentrations of chloride, dissolved organic carbon (DOG), and chlorophyll-a exceeded those of groundwater during most sampling periods. Groundwater and hyporheic concentrations of silica (SiO2), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), nitrate+nitrite (NO3-N), and ammonium (NH4-N) were generally higher than in surface water, particularly during summer. Hyporheic temperatures exhibited sharpest gradients with depth and distance downstream beneath a study riffle during summer and winter. Biologically reactive solutes (SRP, NO3-N, NH4-N, and DOC) generally decreased with depth and increased with distance beneath the riffle during summer and winter as well. Hyporheic patterns were indistinct or more variable during spring and fall and were attributed, in part, to the breakdown of thermal gradients within the bed, similar to seasonal lake turnover (mixis). Similarities between longitudinal/depth gradients in hyporheic patterns and longitudinal stream channel patterns for SiO2 and Cl (the more conservative solutes) indicated potential cumulative groundwater discharge effects through successive hyporheic zones over stream distance. Relationships between hyporheic patterns, stream channel patterns, and the biologically reactive solutes (SRP, NO3-N, NH4-N, DOC) were less clear because of potential biotic or abiotic uptake at the sediment-water interface. Groundwater-surface water interaction within a hyporheic zone forms a complex system structured not only by hydrologic forces but also by seasonal changes in temperature and discharge.																			0003-9136					OCT	1995	134	4					459	490																WOS:A1995TE86900004
J	Wallenstein, MD; McMahon, SK; Schimel, JP				Wallenstein, Matthew D.; McMahon, Shawna K.; Schimel, Joshua P.			Seasonal variation in enzyme activities and temperature sensitivities in Arctic tundra soils	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Arctic soils contain large amounts of organic matter due to very slow rates of detritus decomposition. The first step in decomposition results from the activity of extracellular enzymes produced by soil microbes. We hypothesized that potential enzyme activities are low relative to the large stocks of organic matter in Arctic tundra soils, and that enzyme activity is low at in situ temperatures. We measured the potential activity of six hydrolytic enzymes at 4 and 20 degrees C on four sampling dates in tussock, intertussock, shrub organic, and shrub mineral soils at Toolik Lake, Alaska. Potential activities of N-acetyl glucosaminidase, beta-glucosidase, and peptidase tended to be greatest at the end of winter, suggesting that microbes produced enzymes while soils were frozen. In general, enzyme activities did not increase during the Arctic summer, suggesting that enzyme production is N-limited during the period when temperatures would otherwise drive higher enzyme activity in situ. We also detected seasonal variations in the temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of soil enzymes. In general, soil enzyme pools were more sensitive to temperature at the end of the winter than during the summer. We modeled potential in situ beta-glucosidase activities for tussock and shrub organic soils based on measured enzyme activities, temperature sensitivities, and daily soil temperature data. Modeled in situ enzyme activity in tussock soils increased briefly during the spring, then declined through the summer. In shrub soils, modeled enzyme activities increased through the spring thaw into early August, and then declined through the late summer and into winter. Overall, temperature is the strongest factor driving low in situ enzyme activities in the Arctic. However, enzyme activity was low during the summer, possibly due to N-limitation of enzyme production, which would constrain enzyme activity during the brief period when temperatures would otherwise drive higher rates of decomposition.

J	SIMENGANDO, T				SIMENGANDO, T			POPULATION-DYNAMICS OF AUTOTROPHIC PICOPLANKTON IN RELATION TO ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS IN A PRODUCTIVE LAKE	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Spatial and seasonal fluctuations in autotrophic picoplankton (APP) abundance in a eutrophic, dimictic lake (Lake Aydat, France) were measured concurrently with a variety of environmental variables. Cell number ranged from 0.03 to 2.36x10(6) cells . ml(-1) (highest concentrations were > 5-fold higher than in oligotrophic lakes) and averaged 24 +/- 7% of total picoplankton abundance (APP + heterotrophic bacteria). APP abundance (1) peaked in spring simultaneously with heterotrophic flagellate and ciliate densities, (2) decreased during the nitrogen-limited and summer stratification period, and (3) increased with fall turnover. In summer-autumn, the contribution of single-cell eukaryotic (up to 66%) and colonial prokaryotic (18%) forms to total abundance peaked in the bottom waters. Multivariate regression analyses suggest that > 40% variance in APP number changes may be explained by ciliate abundance (at 0-4 m depth-range), heterotrophic flagellate number and oxygen concentration (5-9 m), and ciliate carbon biomass (10-14 m). The model accounting for changes in heterotrophic bacterial abundance (5-9 m) indicates chlorophyll a concentration (r(2)=58%) and ciliate abundance (r(2)=34%) as dominant covariates. The data presented here suggest that micrograzers control APP abundance in Lake Aydat.

Pigmented and nonpigmented flagellate abundances were positively correlated with each other in samples spanning a year, but were not significantly correlated to the same physical parameters (temperature, oxygen, light). The highest density of nonpigmented flagellates (> 1 x 10(4) ml-1) was found in spring 1986 at the surface, although most abundance peaks ranged from 4 to 7 x 10(3) cells ml-1 and occurred in the metalimnion during summer stratification. Abundances of pigmented flagellates (AF + MF) were greatest (9 x 10(3) cells ml-1) in surface waters in early spring and late fall when the lake was not stratified. Up to 38% (avg 10%) of all pigmented flagellates at any depth also ingested particles, while the percentage of HF that were identified as bacterivores ranged from 30 to 100%. In situ grazing rate measurements indicated strong seasonal differences in the relative grazing impact of pigmented and nonpigmented flagellates, with HF dominating grazing on picoplankton except in winter.

J	Rikardsen, AH; Thorpe, JE; Dempson, JB				Rikardsen, AH; Thorpe, JE; Dempson, JB			Modelling the life-history variation of Arctic charr	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												A model based on proximate considerations of life histories of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, was examined for its applicability to fit the variation in life-history of wild Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus, based on a qualitative assessment of information related to growth and lipid dynamics of Arctic charr. The original salmon model is discussed in context of modifications required to account for added complexities in the life history of Arctic charr in relation to anadromy versus residency. A study from North Norway shows that individual charr that emigrate from the lakes to the sea, maintain a high growth rate in the lake in late summer and early autumn compared with resident fish. Their relatively low lipid level in autumn combined with a high rate of change of lipid during winter was associated with postponement of maturation in the anadromous individuals. Individuals that remain resident in the lake arrested growth in autumn. Their high lipid level in autumn combined with a low rate of change of lipid during winter was associated with maturation the following summer, without emigration from freshwater. Results from this and other related studies show similarities with the model derived from lipid and growth dynamics of Atlantic salmon. The adjusted charr model illustrates possible proximate explanations for the high variation in life-history strategies of Arctic charr. However, the model does not account for the characteristic return migration of immature charr into freshwater several weeks after their entry to the sea. The proximate physiological stimulus for this movement of immature fish is not entirely clear.																			0906-6691					DEC	2004	13	4					305	311		10.1111/j.1600-0633.2004.00070.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.2004.00070.x													WOS:000225078400008

The effect of grazing by bean geese (Anser fabalis) on winter wheat was studied for four consecutive years near Lake Takern, an important stopover area in southern Sweden, which attracts tens of thousands of geese. Yield in grazed and ungrazed plots (exclosures) were compared in nine fields. There were no consistent differences between grazed and ungrazed plots. The four winters were milder than usual, which probably favoured survival and growth of the wheat. It is suggested that grazing during short periods in autumn and spring is less harmful than grazing in wintering areas.

Total heavy metals concentration of Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd and Pb showed a significant seasonal variation in the sediment. Therefore, the average total metals concentration of Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd and Pb was 61.95, 529.95, 28.03, 64.95, 351.22, 10.29, 1.38 and 56.30 mg/kg for spring; 66.78, 501.22, 30.55, 67.72, 326.42, 10.91, 0.89 and 58.12 mg/kg for summer; 64.87, 472.80, 24.09, 66.26, 323.40, 5.51, 0.64 and 58.68 mg/kg for autumn; 82.36, 1589.05, 27.27, 82.64, 369.31, 11.79, 0.60 and 562.24 mg/kg for winter, respectively. Temporal metals speciation indicates a considerable seasonal variation of metal fraction concentrations. Igeo values have indicated considerable seasonal variation of pollution sources in the sediment of YLC. The temporal pollution load index indicates that winter sediment has the highest pollution load than other seasons.					; Uddin, Mohammad Mazbah/ABC-9557-2020; Huang, Lingfeng/G-4587-2010	Uddin, Mohammad Mazbah/0000-0003-2318-8002; 													0275-7540	1029-0370				OCT 21	2022	38	9					801	822		10.1080/02757540.2022.2117310	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02757540.2022.2117310		SEP 2022											WOS:000851585200001

The two morphs are reproductively isolated in time and place of spawning, and are referred to as the littoral and profundal morphs (L-morph and P-morph) according to their spawning habitats. Fish were sampled monthly (ice-free season) or bimonthly (winter) using gillnets in the main lake habitats. The spatial range of the P-morph was restricted to the profundal zone throughout the whole annual period. The L-morph in contrast utilized all main habitats, exhibiting distinct seasonal and ontogenetic variations in habitat distribution. In the spring, the whole L-morph population was located along the bottom profile of the lake, in profundal and littoral habitats. During summer and autumn, habitat segregation occurred between different life-stages, juveniles mainly utilizing the profundal, pre-adults the pelagic and adult fishes the littoral zone. During winter the whole population was assembled in the littoral habitat. The L-morph also had large seasonal and ontogenetic variations in their feeding ecology, with littoral zoobenthos, zooplankton and surface insects being important prey. The P-morph had a narrower diet niche mainly consisting of chironomid larvae and other profundal zoobenthos. Hence, the two Arctic charr morphs exhibited a consistent resource differentiation during all annual seasons and throughout their life cycles, except for a dietary overlap between P-morph and juvenile L-morph charr in the profundal during summer. The findings are discussed in relation to resource polymorphism and incipient speciation.

J	Tonetta, D; Petrucio, MM				Tonetta, Denise; Petrucio, Mauricio Mello			Seasonal changes in primary production and respiration in a subtropical lake undergoing eutrophication	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The balance between gross primary production (GPP) and respiration (R) is frequently used to estimate the role of lakes in the carbon cycle. Seasonal changes in the carbon cycle of subtropical lakes are often underestimated, but changes in meteorological and limnological characteristics often follow the well-defined climatic seasons. Based on 1 year's free-water dissolved oxygen and temperature measurements, we investigated the seasonal changes in primary production and respiration in subtropical Peri Lake in Southern Brazil, which is currently undergoing eutrophication. We expected that periods of high light availability and temperature would lead to a net autotrophic condition. Furthermore, we explored the seasonal coupling between GPP and R, expecting that different sources of organic matter would have different effects on the metabolic rates. We found that Peri Lake was predominately net heterotrophic (GPP < R). GPP was high during summer and autumn and low in winter, as was R, coinciding with the seasonal changes occurring in light and temperature. Light conditions were of essential importance for the variations in GPP, while respiration was fueled by both autochthonous and allochthonous organic matter. Constant external input of organic matter resulted in a generally low coupling between GPP and R. A tighter coupling between GPP and R was observed in spring as a result of higher productivity, while a decoupling in autumn was due to intensified allochthonous organic matter runoff caused by rainfall and wind. We found that higher productivity rates in summer did not shift the system to an autotrophic condition and that Peri Lake functioned as a carbon source, light and organic matter being the prime drivers for the metabolic rates.

Four species of helminth parasites were recorded in 98 out of 134 fish: Gyrodactylus gobii Shul'man, 1953; Bothriocephalus acheilognathi Yamaguti, 1934; Ligula pavlovskii Dubinina, 1959; Eustrongylides excisus Jagerskold, 1909. They were evaluated with respect to seasons and host size. While G. gobii appeared to infect the gills and the skin of host fish, B. acheilognathi established itself in the intestines, and E excisus and L. pavlovskii in the body cavity. A total of 789 specimens of G. gobii were detected especially on smaller host fish during the spring period (prevalence 25.3%, mean intensity 23.21 +/- 9.17 specimens/fish). Although 184 B. acheilognathi appeared on host fish of various sizes and in all seasons, the mean intensity of infection was relatively low (prevalence 34.3%, mean intensity 3.98 +/- 3.15 specimens/fish). Concerning L. pavlovskii, the second cestode species, only 9 parasites were found in medium-sized host fish during the summer, autumn and winter (prevalence 3.7%, mean intensity 1.60 +/- 0.89 specimens/fish). A total of 108 parasite specimens of E. excl. sus was found on 40 host fish in the summer and autumn (prevalence 29.8%, mean intensity 2.70 +/- 2.29 specimens/fish).

Abundance was also evaluated on a smaller scale during June 2000 at 4 nearshore and 4 offshore stations in southeastern Lake Michigan. For large-scale sampling, the abundance of M. relicta did not differ among locations in the spring. In the summer and autumn the abundance of M. relicta was similar among offshore stations with the exception of one station each season; for nearshore stations, abundance was generally highest off Pentwater, Michigan. The abundance of mysids was not consistently high for central or southern basin sites, although overall biomass was higher in the southern basin each season. Abundance of Mysis was positively correlated with bottom depth, but not with bottom water temperature, surface water temperature, or mean chlorophyll concentration. Within the smaller region in southeast Lake Michigan, the abundance of M. relicta differed among locations for both nearshore and offshore stations. Brood size and size of reproductive females did not differ among lake wide locations, but the proportion of females with broods and the size distribution of M. relicta did.					; Fahnenstiel, Gary/ABD-6133-2020	Vanderploeg, Henry/0000-0003-1358-8475; Pothoven, Steven/0000-0002-7992-5422; 													0018-8158					JUL	2004	522	1-3					291	299		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000029982.52263.c0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000029982.52263.c0													WOS:000221806500017
J	Hu, KX; Lu, RY; Wang, DH				Hu, Kaixi; Lu, Riyu; Wang, Donghai			Seasonal climatology of cut-off lows and associated precipitation patterns over Northeast China	METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS												Cut-off lows (COLs) are significantly associated with many convective events and anomalous regional climate in the Northeast China. By using 49-year NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data, COL events are detected and tracked by an objective and automatic method based on synoptic concept model. Based on this dataset and daily rain-gauge records in Northeast China during 1979-2005, seasonal climatology of COLs and associated precipitation patterns over Northeast China are investigated. Most COLs have a short lifetime of less than a week and have a spatial size ranging from 500 to 1,000 km, with slight seasonal differences. Temporal variation of COL occurrence exhibits a seasonal cycle, with a peak in summer, and considerable interannual variability. The COLs tend to occur more frequently over the northern Northeast China Plain, and the center for maximum frequency shows a zonal oscillation, with an extension to continent in summer and a shift to western North Pacific coast in winter. Most COLs form to the east of Lake Baikal and decay over the western North Pacific coast. COLs are apt to move along east or southeast passages around the year, and tracks are relatively more complicated in warm seasons. About a quarter of annual mean precipitation over Northeast China is associated with COLs. Moreover, COL-associated precipitation contributes greatly to total precipitation in northern and northwestern parts of Northeast China, and the ratios of COL contribution are stronger during spring and autumn than in summer.

J	Pedersen, NL; Sand-Jensen, K				Pedersen, Niels Lagergaard; Sand-Jensen, Kaj			Temperature in lowland Danish streams: contemporary patterns, empirical models and future scenarios	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Continuous temperature measurements at I I stream sites in small lowland streams of North Zealand, Denmark over a year showed much higher summer temperatures and lower winter temperatures along the course of the stream with artificial lakes than in the stream without lakes. The influence of lakes was even more prominent in the comparisons of colder lake inlets and warmer outlets and led to the decline of cold-water and oxygen-demanding brown trout. Seasonal and daily temperature variations were, as anticipated, dampened by forest cover, groundwater input, input from sewage plants and high downstream discharges. Seasonal variations in daily water temperature could be predicted with high accuracy at all sites by a linear air-water regression model (r(2) : 0.903-0-947). The predictions improved in all instances (r(2) : 0-927-0-964) by a non-linear logistic regression according to which water temperatures do not fall below freezing and they increase less steeply than air temperatures at high temperatures because of enhanced heat loss from the stream by evaporation and back radiation. The predictions improved slightly (r(2): 0.933-0-969) by a multiple regression model which, in addition to air temperature as the main predictor, included solar radiation at un-shaded sites, relative humidity, precipitation and discharge. Application of the non-linear logistic model for a warming scenario of 4-5 degrees C higher air temperatures in Denmark in 2070-2100 yielded predictions of temperatures rising 1.6-3.0 degrees C during winter and summer and 4.4-6.0 degrees C during spring in un-shaded streams with low groundwater input. Groundwater-fed springs are expected to follow the increase of mean air temperatures for the region.

J	Ozseker, K; Eruz, C				Ozseker, Koray; Eruz, Coskun			Pollution Assessment of Toxic Metals in Representative Limnetic Ecosystem Sediments in the Southeastern Black Sea, Turkey	CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER												In this study, the natural and anthropogenic toxic metal pollution, and the general characteristics of lake sediments are investigated spatially and temporally. Three lakes are chosen in 2014 according to their origin from the Southeastern Black Sea-Sera Lake, Uzungol Lake, and Borcka Dam Lake. Four sampling campaigns are conducted during the four seasons: spring, autumn, winter, and summer. The elements lead (Pb), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), nickel (Ni), and arsenic (As) are selected for investigation. The highest average toxic concentrations of Cu (498.46 mu g g(-1)), Pb (185.60 mu g g(-1)), and As (18.74 mu g g(-1)) were found in Borcka Dam Lake; however, those of Zn (435.00 mu g g(-1)) and Ni (143.42 mu g g(-1)) are found in Sera Lake. The highest metal concentrations are observed in autumn. Metal concentrations are determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The potential ecological risk index (RI) and geoaccumulation index (I-GEO) values are calculated for assessing sediment pollution. The assessment of sediments according to their potential ecological risk to the aquatic environment reveal that Cu contamination is a moderate risk in Borcka Dam Lake. According to I-GEO classifications, the highest I-GEO values are found in Borcka Dam Lake in autumn. Accordingly, the study area is determined to be highly contaminated with Cu and Pb. Cu and Pb can be considered as major contributors to ecological risk in these Southeastern Black Sea lakes.

J	ROYLE, RN; KING, RJ				ROYLE, RN; KING, RJ			THE PHYTOPLANKTON OF LAKE LIDDELL, NEW-SOUTH-WALES - CHLOROPHYLL-A CONCENTRATIONS, SPECIES SEASONAL SUCCESSION, AND COVARIATION WITH NUTRIENTS	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Samples of the phytoplankton in a freshwater lake, Lake Liddell, New South Wales (Lat: 32-degrees 22' S, Long. 150-degrees 1' E) were collected every 4 weeks between October 1987 and November 1988. Chlorophyll a concentrations ranged from 1.8 mug l-1 to 9.1 mug l-1 and were positively correlated with the following nutrient parameters: total and nett mass additions of nitrate/nitrite-N and total-N, total additions of Kjeldahl-N, and nett mass addition N-P ratios. There was no correlation between lake nutrient concentrations and chlorophyll a. Factors other than nutrient concentrations appeared to be effecting chlorophyll a concentrations as summer levels were low despite nutrient concentrations being at a maximum. In spring and summer the phytoplankton was dominated by chlorophytes, with dinoflagellates and diatoms most abundant in autumn. During winter cyanobacteria were the most abundant. The relative abundance of chlorophytes was positively correlated with in lake nitrate/nitrite-N concentrations whereas the relative abundance of cyanobacteria was negatively correlated with this parameter. Based on chlorophyll a concentrations and the phytoplankton flora Lake Liddell can be classified as mesotrophic.																			0018-8158					OCT 5	1992	245	1					41	52		10.1007/BF00008727	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008727													WOS:A1992KA38200004
J	Marsh, P; Onclin, C; Neumann, N				Marsh, P; Onclin, C; Neumann, N			Water and energy fluxes in the lower Mackenzie Valley, 1994/95	ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN												The 1994/95 water year in the lower Mackenzie Valley was an extraordinary year hydrologically, with the important winter to summer transition being the earliest on record. Unlike more temperate areas, the northern water year is dominated, to a great extent, by this onset of spring which results in the melting of nearly half of the annual precipitation over a period of a few weeks, initiates the thawing of the river and lake ice and the soil active layer, and marks the beginning of the evaporation season. An early winter to summer transition occurred at two small research basins in the Inuvik area and at the East Channel of the Mackenzie River Delta. At the research basins, for example, the spring of 1994/95 had the earliest onset of continuous above-freezing air temperatures, removal of the snow cover, and initiation of runoff. Consideration of the entire water year at the research basins demonstrates that rain and snow were nearly equal in magnitude, evaporation exceeded runoff, and the annual change in storage was negative to near zero. This negative change in storage was related to the long, snow-free evaporation season, above-average air temperatures, and below-normal precipitation. The unusual winter to summer transition on the Mackenzie River in the eastern portion of the Mackenzie Delta was, in many ways, even more remarkable than that in the research basins. Earlier work had suggested that the timing of the spring breakup was very consistent from year to year. An analysis of the timing of breakup from the early 1960s to the late 1990s, however, shows a trend towards earlier spring breakup, with the mean for the 1990s being nine days earlier than that for the 1960s, and with the 1995 breakup being the earliest on record. Such an early breakup is not only an indication of warm local conditions, but of warm temperatures and an early runoff event over the more southerly areas of the Mackenzie basin. A companion Mackenzie Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment study illustrates the importance of a high pressure circulation pattern centred east of the basin to this early melt event.																			0705-5900	1480-9214				JUN	2002	40	2					245	256		10.3137/ao.400211	http://dx.doi.org/10.3137/ao.400211													WOS:000176257600012
J	Siegwald, L; de Jong, C				Siegwald, Laura; de Jong, Carmen			Anthropogenic Impacts on Water Quality in a Small, Forested Mountain Catchment: A Case Study of the Seebachle, Black Forest, Southern Germany	SUSTAINABILITY												The aims of this case study are to assess water quality in a small, forested mountain catchment in the Black Forest, forming part of a National Park and Natura 2000 zone. Field work was carried out in the catchment of the Seebachle torrent, a small headwater basin of the River Acher, a confluent of the Rhine, in Southern Germany between late winter and early summer of 2018. The catchment has a diverse natural setting of water bodies, including springs, torrents, and a lake, and is impacted by anthropogenic activities such as summer tourism, winter sports, two quarries, road traffic, and an isolated construction site. Physio-chemical and bacterial water samples were obtained at 10 measurement sites, including a spring, a lake (Mummelsee), a fountain, artificial and natural snow on and next to a ski run (Seibelseckle), artificial ditches and parking lots draining the ski run, and the Seebachle torrent above two granite mines. Samples were either taken directly on site or analyzed in corresponding hydrology and hospital microbiology laboratories. Water of the Seebachle is oxygen-rich, peaty, and mostly acidic, but the pH varies between 4.1 and 9.5 throughout the catchment, inclining towards acid in the fountain and below the ski run and towards alkaline in the lake. Conductivity is spatially highly variable, reaching the most elevated values below the ski run and its parking lot (149 mu S/cm). A high density of bacteria including enterobacteria was detected at nearly all sites. Human pathogenic bacteria were found below and surrounding the ski run, at parking lots draining the ski run, as well as at the lowest site during the mid-spring campaign. They were also detected in the touristically highly frequented lake and in the spring feeding the lake during the end-of-spring campaign. Whilst most physico-chemical parameters followed a similar pattern and fell within good to very good EU drinking water quality status, the lake turbidity levels (19.2 NTU) by far exceeded norms after ice thawing. The most contaminated site in terms of bacteria and turbidity (5.2 NTU), ammonium nitrogen (0.18 mg/L), and total nitrogen (5.06 mg/L) was the spring feeding the Mummelsee draining the construction site of a new restaurant. These field analyses show that the water quality of a virtually uninhabited, natural headwater catchment is strongly interconnected and can degrade both by direct and indirect impacts of overtourism.						de Jong, Carmen/0000-0001-8152-6052														2071-1050				NOV	2020	12	21							9022	10.3390/su12219022	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12219022													WOS:000589266200001
J	Bai, YH; Huang, TL; Miao, WM				Bai, Yunhao; Huang, Tinglin; Miao, Weiming			Spatio-temporal dynamics of phytoplankton in a diversion reservoir and the major influencing factors: taxonomic versus functional groups classification	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Identifying factors affecting phytoplankton dynamics is crucial to the management of aquatic ecosystems. A lot of scholars have conducted intensive studies on phytoplankton in lake or reservoirs, but not many studies have been conducted on diversion reservoirs. To explore the seasonal and spatial variation of phytoplankton communities and their relationship with environmental factors in the context of water diversion, a case study was carried out at XiKeng (XK) reservoir in South China. In this study, month-by-month water samples and phytoplankton were collected from this reservoir from December, 2021, to July, 2022. The results showed that the phytoplankton community was characterized by significant spatial and temporal variations. There were significant differences in phytoplankton abundance and structure in the reservoirs in terms of time. The abundance of phytoplankton cells and the proportion of Cyanobacteria in the reservoir showed a trend of increasing from autumn to spring and then decreasing from spring to summer, while the functional group evolved from S1 in autumn to SN in spring and summer. The abundance of phytoplankton was influenced by the dynamic water division and the characteristics of the reservoir itself, resulting in a spatial distribution characteristic of AIII > AII > AI. Water temperature (WT) and nutrients were the key factors driving the changes in phytoplankton abundance and community structure in the reservoir. These findings will deepen our understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of phytoplankton community structure in diversion reservoirs and provide a basis for freshwater water ecological management strategies.

Feeding habits of Engraulis anchoita (Hubbs & Marini, 1935) larvae in coastal waters off Buenos Aires Province, Argentina	LATIN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC RESEARCH												The diet of Engraulis anchoita larvae (Hubbs & Marini, 1935) was analyzed using samples collected once a month at a permanent coastal station off Buenos Aires Province, Argentina (Station EPEA), from March 2000 to April 2001. A total of 869 individuals were examined. Eggs (54.05%), copepod nauplii (10.13%), and copepodites (11.82%) were the dominant prey items. The feeding index varied from 1.69 to 40.48%, without showing a clear seasonal pattern. Correlations between predator size and prey size were determined and the results showed significant relationships (P < 0.01) in all cases. In spring and summer, the larvae were small in size, corresponding to first-feeding larvae (< 6.9 mm length) and preyed mainly on small organisms from < 45 to 134 mu m width. In autumn and winter, the size of the larvae increased (7.0-19.9 mm length), and they fed mainly on larger prey, from 135 to 279 mu m width.																			0718-560X	0717-7178					2011	39	1					16	24		10.3856/vol39-issue1-fulltext-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3856/vol39-issue1-fulltext-2													WOS:000288178700002

First, the LAB composition of four fish species, silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) and deepbodied crucian carp (Carassius cuvieri), were analyzed in July and December 2001. In all these species, the predominant LAB was Lactococcus lactis in July and Lactococcus raffinolactis in December, strongly suggesting that the predominant intestinal LAB of fish in Lake Kasumigaura is L. lactis in summer and L. raffinolactis in winter, irrespective of fish species. Next, a yearlong analysis of changes in LAB composition was performed in common carp from April 2002 to March 2003. The predominant LAB was L. lactis in summer when water temperatures were above 20 degreesC, and L. raffinolactis in winter, when temperatures ranged between 4 and 10 degreesC. The change in the predominate LAB occurred in spring and autumn when water temperatures were between 13 and 17 degreesC. During these intermediate periods, LAB composition was variable. The change in predominant LAB was revealed to be due to the difference in the growth profile of the two species: L. lactis grew faster at above 20 degreesC, but at lower temperatures, L. raffinolactis grew successfully. RAPD analysis of isolated strains revealed that L. lactis strains in common carp intestine were limited to a few strains throughout the seasons but L. raffinolactis strains were diverse.

The Impact of Climate Change on the Productivity of the Aboveground Mass of Steppe Plants on Vodnyi Island of Manych-Gudilo Lake of the Rostovskii Reserve	ARID ECOSYSTEMS												The effect of climate changes on productivity of the aboveground phytomass of steppe plants on Vodnyi Island of Manych-Gudilo Lake in the Rostovskii Reserve was analyzed. In the period 1991-2022, the mean annual temperature in the study area increased, on average, by 0.07 degrees C/year, and the annual precipitation decreased by 1.93 mm/year. The de Martonne aridity index decreased significantly (by 1.16 per year, on average), which indicated arid warming. Temperatures increased in all seasons, while precipitation shifted from summer and autumn to winter and spring against the background of a general decrease. The structure of the vegetation cover was dominated by grasses, the share of which averaged 62%. The effect of precipitation on the total productivity of the phytomass was the leading one and amounted to 51.3%. The overall decrease in precipitation favored a decrease in the phytomass of the studied plant groups, except for cereals, the productivity of which became greater with an increase in precipitation in winter and spring. These changes resulted in a further increase in the proportion of grasses in the plant cover of steppes on Vodnyi Island and to a decrease in the participation of other families. The revealed climatic trends will contribute to a drop in the productivity of the aboveground phytomass of steppes on Vodnyi Island, of grasses, in particular.

Lake Yangzong water quality parameters and nutrients, including water temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, conductivity, Chlorophyll-a, phycocyanin, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP), were monitored in different seasons from 2015 to 2021. Based on the monitoring data, the temporal and spatial variations of various parameters were analyzed. The results showed that Lake Yangzong is a warm monomictic lake. The Pearson correlation coefficient and correlation analysis showed water quality parameters were significantly correlated and probably affected by temperature. Cyanobacteria were at risk of blooming in spring and autumn. The contents of TN and TP in winter were significantly higher than in summer, especially TN, with both reaching a peak at the epilimnion and hypolimnion in December 2020 (TN = 1.3 mg/L, TP = 0.06 mg/L). We also observed a dual risk of endogenous release and exogenous input. Therefore, strengthening the supervision for controlling eutrophication caused by human activities and endogenous release is urgently needed.					; Xu, Weidong/AAX-7370-2021; Li, Donglin/KOC-3211-2024	Donglin, Li/0000-0003-4126-4136; Zhang, Yang/0000-0002-1082-6661; Zhang, Hucai/0000-0001-7733-2036														2073-4441				SEP	2022	14	17							2732	10.3390/w14172732	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14172732													WOS:000851706500001

The concentrations of Hg species in the summer campaign were significantly higher (p<0.01, generally 2 to 3 times higher) than those in the winter and spring campaigns, and no statistical differences were found between the same parameters for the latter two campaigns (p>0.05). Ancillary parameters including suspended particulate matter (SPM), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), temperature (T), dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, nitrate (NO3-) and chloride (Cl-) were also measured. During the sampling campaign in July 2006, average values for SPM, DOC, T, and NO3- were all higher compared to the other two campaigns, which suggested a similar seasonal trend between these parameters and Hg species. Seasonal variability may be related to increased runoff. High runoff volume due to abundant precipitation in the summer carried Hg-laden particulates into the reservoir, whereas there was less precipitation in the winter and spring when Hg levels were lower. Increased agricultural activity in the summer season also increased Hg levels in Puding Reservoir. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Three types of movement were identified: wide-ranging covering much of the lake, localised within the littoral, and migratory towards river mouths before spawning. Maximum swimming speeds up to 2.27 km h(-1) were observed, and speeds of 0.5 km h(-1) over several hours were recorded for two fish tracked in the limnetic zone. Adult rainbow trout inhabited littoral areas through winter and spring, with most shifting to a limnetic habitat in summer and early autumn. We suggest that the wide-ranging limnetic lifestyle is in response to opportunities for feeding on ichthyoplankton, notably larval bullies and galaxiids. Some individuals remained in littoral areas throughout the year, apparently having adopted a benthic/nearshore feeding strategy. As winter approached several fish moved towards the mouths of inflowing streams, before undertaking spawning migrations.																			0028-8330					DEC	1995	29	4					493	503		10.1080/00288330.1995.9516682	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1995.9516682													WOS:A1995TQ82200005

Twenty-four provided data useful in understanding post-fledging movements, 12 from Magadan, 7 from Amur, four from Kamchatka, and one from Sakhalin. At this time (27 January 1999), we are still receiving information from six birds. Fledging occurred in August and early September. At least 20 fledglings moved to pre-migration sites for 1-4 weeks. This behavior was most obvious for birds whose natal ranges were coastal. Eagles raised on large rivers and Lakes tended to wander along rivers prior to the onset of a definite migratory push. Nineteen birds were followed south, 16 made it to wintering areas. Eagles took 5-116 days to reach their initial wintering destinations. Migration rate averaged 51.3 km/day (SD = 56.0). Most birds from Magadan and Amur migrated down the western edge of the Okotsk Sea, and birds reared in Kamchatka eventually moved onto the Kuril Islands. Two birds were tracked from fledging into their second autumn migration. They moved northward from the wintering grounds in the second and third week of April. Summering areas were south of natal areas, and both had early and late summering areas.																									2000							83	90																WOS:000090024500008

An empirical model relating methane formation to temperature and sediment depth, derived from the laboratory incubations, reproduced the measured daily ebullition from winter to midsummer, although late summer and autumn simulated ME exceeded the observed ME.

The ionic composition resembled that of precipitation (Na > Ca > Mg > K and Cl > SO4 > HCO3). The seasonal pattern of total-CO2 and PO4 was regulated by internal processes and maximum concentrations as a result of decomposition processes occurring during summer stagnation. NO3 concentrations showed the opposite pattern and were relatively high from late autumn through spring and were extremely low during summer. Total-P and PO4 increased during summer due to release from the sediment. The phytoplankton biomass of surface water was low. The water chemistry suggested a shift from N-limitation of phytoplankton during summer to P-limitation at other seasons. Maximum algal concentrations occurred at 6 m during summer, probably due to a supply of nutrients (especially NH4) from deeper layers. Phytoplankton productivity was often bimodal, with an upper maximum at depths of 0 or 2 m and a 2nd maximum at 6 m.

River inflow and N-fixation during 1990 were minimal allowing internal nutrient cycling to be more closely studied. Nutrient cycling was strongly affected by seasonal thermal stratification that was typical for a warm monomictic lake. Concentrations of nitrate, phosphate, and silicate in surface waters were highest during winter mixing and decreased rapidly in the spring due to a diatom bloom. Maximum average chlorophyll concentration in surface waters was 2.7 +/- 1.2 mug l-1 and occurred in April while surface nutrients were being depleted. In contrast to chlorophyll, maximum particulate carbon in surface waters occurred in July-August when areal productivity was highest (367-398 mg C m-2 day-1). Concurrent with spring nutrient depletion in surface waters was increasing N-deficiency in the plankton. After the spring bloom dissipated in May, particulate matter (POM) became increasingly N-deficient reaching maximum elemental C:N of > 18 during summer-fall. Profiles of the C:N ratio of POM were nearly constant with depth for individual sampling dates suggesting that the residence time of POM in the water column was short (< 1 month). While surface waters were nutrient depleted during summer stratification, nutrient concentrations of bottom waters progressively increased, presumably through the oxidation of POM sinking to the bottom (103 m). Converting the rate of oxygen depletion in bottom waters to carbon equivalents of POM suggests that 42% of mean annual phytoplankton production in overlying waters during 1990 was mineralized in bottom waters.																			0018-8158					OCT 30	1992	246	3					213	229		10.1007/BF00005699	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00005699													WOS:A1992KB85000004
J	Liu, L; You, XY				Liu, Lei; You, Xue-yi			Water quality assessment and contribution rates of main pollution sources in Baiyangdian Lake, northern China	ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW												Water quality of Baiyangdian Lake is very important for maintaining ecosystem functions. It is spatially het-erogeneous and temporally variable influenced by multiple factors. However, the evolution mechanism of water quality in the lake remains unclear. In this study, water quality index (WQI), multivariate statistical methods and absolute principal component score-multiple linear regression (APCS-MLR) model were applied to assess water quality of the lake and parse main pollution sources. One year (2017-2018) dataset of seven water quality parameters measured in 28 sample sites were analyzed. The results indicated that water quality in summer was relatively poor, and WQI values were relatively high in autumn. Discriminant analysis showed that both standard mode and stepwise mode correctly classified >86.5% of cases. According to results of principal component analysis/factor analysis, three principal components in cluster 1 and cluster 2 in four seasons could explained >80.5% of the total variances, respectively. Besides, water quality variations were mainly related to natural factor, sediment release, domestic sewage, livestock breeding, rainfall runoff and decomposition of reed and lotus. Through APCS-MLR model, the order of contribution of domestic sewage to COD was autumn>-spring>summer>winter. Spatially, it was western region>eastern region and northern region>southern region, respectively. Nutrients mainly came from sediment release, rainfall runoff and decomposition of reed and lotus. The average contribution rates of the pollution sources were between 20% and 31%, respectively. This study systematically found the tempal-spacial deterioration degree and main influence factors of water quality, and the contribution rates of main pollution sources to different lake areas in four seasons. The outcomes provide the theory and methodology basis for water environment management.																			0195-9255	1873-6432				JAN	2023	98								106965	10.1016/j.eiar.2022.106965	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2022.106965		NOV 2022											WOS:000883716500004

Soil moisture control over autumn season methane flux, Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Accurate estimates of annual budgets of methane (CH4) efflux in arctic regions are severely constrained by the paucity of non-summer measurements. Moreover, the incomplete understanding of the ecosystem-level sensitivity of CH4 emissions to changes in tundra moisture makes prediction of future CH4 release from the Arctic extremely difficult. This study addresses some of these research gaps by presenting an analysis of eddy covariance and chamber measurements of CH4 efflux and supporting environmental variables during the autumn season and associated beginning of soil freeze-up at our large-scale water manipulation site near Barrow, Alaska (the Biocomplexity Experiment). We found that the autumn season CH4 emission is significant (accounting for 21-25% of the average growing season emission), and that this emission is mostly controlled by the fraction of inundated landscape, atmospheric turbulence, and the decline in unfrozen water during the period of soil freezing. Drainage decreased autumn CH4 emission by a factor of 2.4 compared to our flooded treatment. Flooding slowed the soil freezing process which has implications for extending elevated CH4 emissions longer into the winter season.

J	Nukapothula, S; Chen, CQ; Wu, J				Nukapothula, Sravanthi; Chen, Chuqun; Wu, Jie			Long-term distribution patterns of remotely sensed water quality variables in Pearl River Delta, China	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Pearl River Delta (PRD) is the third largest and one of the most productive Deltas in south China, where long-term monitoring and its assessment of water quality are necessary to understand the distribution patterns to infer the coastal zone management. The studies on long-term monitoring in water quality variable concerning the changing climate and anthropogenic effects can be made possible by continuous coverage of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. This study attempts to study the long-term trends, quantitative measurements, and assessment of water quality variables including total suspended solids (TSS), diffuse attenuation coefficient for downwelling irradiance at 490 nm (K-d (490)), and sea surface temperature (SST) using 8-day composite and monthly data products of MODIS data for the period between July 2002 and August 2018 in the turbid waters of the PRD. Monthly products are used to quantify the variability of these water quality properties on long-term climatology, seasonal and as well as spatial distributions to interannual time scales. We observed a decreasing trend of TSS and K-d (490) between 2002 and 2018, though not significant, whereas, an increasing trend of SST has recorded for the PRD region during the same time. Seasonal patterns of TSS, K-d (490) and SST showed significant differences between the seasons. The high values of TSS (> 15 gm(-3)) and K-d (490) (> 2 m(-1)) were found in summer, autumn followed by winter, and low values (< 0.5 gm(-3) and 0.1 m(-1)) in spring. Consequently, high SSTs were noticed in the in summer-Autumn season and low SSTs in winter. The spatial concentrations of TSS, K-d (490) and SST were found high in the northern region and low values in the offshore and the southern part of the PRD. The increased values of TSS and K-d (490) in summer can be attributed to the high amount of precipitation, and strong monsoonal winds lead to the significant amounts of highly turbid waters in the water column. Based on the MODIS derived time series of TSS and K-d (490), a significant correlation with wind speed was found between these variables, suggesting a critical role of precipitation, river discharge and wind forcing in the variability of ocean variables in the PRD region.																			0272-7714	1096-0015				MAY 31	2019	221						90	103		10.1016/j.ecss.2019.02.038	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2019.02.038													WOS:000467668900011

Seasonal and spatial variability of sediment bacterial communities inhabiting the large shallow Lake Balaton	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Seasonal studies of surface sediment bacterial communities, from two basins with differing trophic states within Lake Balaton (Hungary), were carried out using molecular (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, DGGE) and cultivation-based techniques. The presence of polyphosphate accumulates was tested using Neisser staining, and phosphatase activity was investigated on organic phosphorus (P) compound. Aerobic viable cell counts were significantly higher in the eutrophic than mesotrophic basin in each season. The lowest viable counts were observed in the autumn and the highest in spring and summer month in both basins. The DGGE fingerprints of the samples reflected that the composition of sediment bacterial communities in the two basins were distinct in spring and summer, and similar in autumn, but similarly diverse in all seasons. On the basis of partial 16S rDNA sequences, the 216 strains were affiliated with six major bacterial lineages: Firmicutes; Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria. Common species characterized from both basins constituted up to 66% of all identified phylotypes. Strains related to Bacillus sp. were dominant in all but one sample. Isolates affiliated with Aeromonas sp. prevailed in the sample taken from the mesotrophic basin in spring. The majority of the strains showed excess poly-P accumulation. Association of Neisser staining and phosphatase activity test results suggested that excess poly-P accumulation serves as P storage for sediment bacteria. Our study implied the importance of Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Aeromonas species in benthic bacterial P retention.					; Borsodi, Andrea/H-1148-2017	Bernadett, Khayer/0000-0003-3484-9232; Borsodi, Andrea/0000-0002-3738-7937													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR	2011	663	1					217	232		10.1007/s10750-010-0574-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0574-3													WOS:000286393300015

The sites were characterized by relatively high and low mussel densities. The following variables were measured: ash-free dry weight (AFDW) per unit shell length (SL), lipid content and classes, carbon content, and nitrogen content. Mussels from the high-density site had a lower AFDW. SL relationship, lower lipid content, and a lower C:N ratio than mussels from the low-density site. Seasonal trends in these variables were consistent between sites and years. AFDW:SL, lipid, and carbon content were highest in the spring and then declined to minimum levels in late summer/fall. The mean seasonal decline in weight from spring to late summer for a standard 15-mm mussel was 60%. This decline was greater than might be expected from gamete release alone and was likely a result of nutritional stress from warm summer temperatures and limited food supplies. Between 1990 and 1991, the mean AFDW of a 15-mm mussel declined 34% and 50% at the high- and low-density site, respectively. However, when C:N ratios and lipid levels in 1990 and 1991 were compared, C:N ratios were only lower in fall 1991 compared to fall 1990, and lipid levels for the 2 years were generally similar.																			0380-1330						1993	19	3					541	552		10.1016/S0380-1330(93)71240-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(93)71240-X													WOS:A1993MB67500006

Kriging interpolation, principal component analysis and Piper and Gibbs charts were used to analyze the hydrochemical characteristics and genesis of Bosten Lake in summer and autumn. The following are the main conclusions: (1) In summer and autumn, the hydrochemistry of the lake follows the order of SO42- > Cl- > HCO3- > Na+ > Mg2+ > Ca2+ > K+. (2) The concentrations of TDS, Ca2+, Na+, Mg2+, Cl- and HCO3- in Bosten Lake increased significantly in autumn. Ion concentrations in most of the Little Lake District were higher than those in the Great Lake District. (3) In summer, ion correlation was strong, the evaporation effect was strong and the TDS contribution rate was high. Evaporation was weak in autumn, and Mg2+ and Ca2+ contributed more. (4) The hydrochemical type (SO4 center dot Cl-Na center dot Mg) was the same in both seasons; in summer, the Great and Little lakes were mainly characterized by evaporation and crystallization; in autumn, evaporation crystallization was dominant in the Great lake. (5) The ions mainly came from the dissolution of gypsum, salt rock, calcite, etc. Cationic alternating adsorption occurred in summer.																				2071-1050				MAR	2023	15	5							4139	10.3390/su15054139	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15054139													WOS:000946885100001

Effects of 21st century climate change on seasonal flow regimes and hydrologic extremes over the Midwest and Great Lakes region of the US	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Analyzing future changes in hydrologic extremes such as floods, low flows, and soil moisture extremes is important because many impacts on ecosystems and human systems occur during extreme events. To quantify changes in hydrologic extremes, this study conducts hydrologic modeling experiments over 20 Midwestern watersheds using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model forced by historical observed datasets and future projections from statistically downscaled Global Climate Model (GCMs) simulations. Our results show that peak daily streamflow at the 100-yr reoccurrence interval will increase ( +10-30%) in most watersheds by 2080s due to significant increases in precipitation (P) and increasing P as rainfall during winter and spring seasons. The simulations also show strong shifts towards earlier peak flow timing (up to a month), especially in strongly snowmelt-dominated watersheds. These effects are linked to strong decreasing trends in maximum Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) with warming, which are simulated over essentially the entire domain. Projected changes in 7-day extreme low flows are smaller in magnitude ( - 10-+10%) with some what larger decreases simulated at the end of century; however, the timing of extreme low flows is projected to shift from winter/spring to summer and fall in strongly snowmelt-dominated watersheds in the northernmost parts of the domain. Extreme low soil moisture increases over most of the domain in the future projections up to the 2050s, but by the 2080s there are more widespread decreases in extreme low soil moisture, especially in the northernmost parts of the domain.

The lake experienced drastic changes in physicochemical conditions since its creation in 2003. Monthly phytoplankton communities were characterized between 2006 and 2011. A two-dimensional solution of nonmetric multidimensional scaling clearly delineated four groups of distinct phytoplankton community structure. Indicator species analysis showed that Group I (2006-2008) was characterized by mainly nanoplankton including Chromulina pygmaea. Group II (2009) was characterized by nonmotile, unicellular, elongated, or filamentous taxa, which are resistant to grazing pressure due to their large size. Group III (winter-early spring since 2010) was characterized by many motile taxa. The most characteristic taxa in Group IV (summer-autumn since 2010) were the flagellate algae. Seasonal variation in phytoplankton community was highest after 2010. Changes in phytoplankton communities may closely reflect rapid changes in lake environmental conditions such as desalination and nutrient enrichment.

Effect of Hartha and Najibia power plants on water quality indices of Shatt Al-Arab River, south of Iraq	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The main object of this research is to assess the water quality of Shatt Al-Arab River and its suitability for various purposes near power plants (Hartha and Najibia) through physical and chemical analysis [temperature, pH, EC, Cl-, Na+, K+, Ca+2, Mg+2, HCO3 (-), NO3 (-), SO4-2, Fe+, total alkalinity, total hardness, biological oxygen demand (BOD5), NH4 (+), and NO2 (-)] using water quality index (WQI), organic pollution index (OPI), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), and percentage of sodium ion (Na%) during the dry season (August, 2016) and the wet season (January, 2017). WQI of Shatt Al-Arab falls under very poor quality during summer season, while it ranges from very poor quality to unsuitable for drinking purposes during winter season. There is a clear effect of power plants on water quality. Hartha and Najibia power plants contribute to the deterioration of water quality by increasing the percentage ratio of WQI near these plants by 13.22 and 9.69%, respectively, compared to the north sites of these plants during summer season. The percentage ratios of increased WQI near Hartha and Najibia power plants compared to the north sites of these plants are 17.93 and 15.92%, respectively, during winter season. Water quality of Shatt Al-Arab falls under a high level of organic pollution during the summer and winter seasons. There is a slight effect by the power plants on the OPI. Hartha and Najibia power plants contributed to the change of the OPI by 10% compared to the north site of Hartha power plant. According to the comparison between the SAR values which represent the suitability of water for serve irrigation purposes and SAR values of Shatt Al-Arab, all sites lie in the first class (excellent). According to Na+%, the type of surface water in the studied area lies in good class during winter season and permissible class during summer season.

Effects of Latitude, Season, and Temperature on Lake Sturgeon Movement	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Ecologists have a limited understanding of the rangewide variation in movement behavior in freshwater fishes, but recent expansion of biotelemetry allows biologists to investigate how fish movement can help to predict behavioral shifts in response to changing environments. The Lake SturgeonAcipenser fulvescensis a wide-ranging, migratory, coolwater species, making it a candidate species for studying patterns in movement ecology. We conducted a literature review and meta-analysis of seasonal movement data compiled from 38 Lake Sturgeon telemetry studies in North America to build an understanding of spatiotemporal variation in movement behavior. Lake Sturgeon movement studies were underrepresented for low-latitude populations in the Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio/Tennessee River basins. Highest movement usually occurred during spring spawning migrations, whereas other populations exhibited their highest movement in the fall, potentially in order to overwinter near spawning grounds. Our meta-regression analysis indicated that latitude or summer maximum temperature best predicted standardized mean difference between spring and summer movement in Lake Sturgeon populations across the species' range. Our results suggest that Lake Sturgeon populations at lower latitudes and those that experience warmer summer temperatures have lower summer movement relative to spring movement. Managers may use this information to prioritize actions promoting the conservation of seasonally important habitats for the continued recovery of migratory coolwater fish (e.g., Lake Sturgeon) that potentially experience stressful thermal conditions.

In this study, the temporal dynamics of the cyanobacterial community structure in Dianshan Lake were investigated using molecular techniques in order to identify important abiotic factors influencing such dynamics. Whole-cell PCR analysis showed that cyanobacteria were more abundant in spring and summer than in autumn and winter. This result was further supported by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profile analysis. Microcystis was observed to be the dominant species of cyanobacteria in Dianshan Lake. Approximately 50 % of cyanobacteria species were influenced by abiotic parameters, such as temperature, orthophosphate, and total phosphorus. The significant correlation between the temporal dynamics of the cyanobacterial community structure and abiotic factors suggests that temperature and phosphorus are essential parameters influencing the dynamic changes of algal blooms in Dianshan Lake.

J	Rodriguez, P; Pizarro, H				Rodriguez, Patricia; Pizarro, Haydee			Phytoplankton productivity in a highly colored shallow lake of a South American floodplain	WETLANDS												We described phytoplankton productivity in a floodplain wetland of the Lower Parana River, Argentina. Four samplings encompassing periods of high and low water levels were conducted in a highly colored shallow lake. Photosynthesis-irradiance (P-E) curves and the areal photosynthetic rate (P-A) were estimated following the C-14 assimilation technique. Likewise, physical and chemical variables and phytoplankton composition, density, and chlorophyll a concentration were measured. Phytoplankton assemblages shifted from cyanobacteria blooms in summer to cryptophycean dominance in winter, and co-dominance of cryptophytes and chlorophytes in autumn. Assimilation number P-max ranged from 3-7.8 mu g C (mu g Chl a h)(-1) and peaked in early summer (low water level) when water color was highest, suggesting that phytoplankton productivity was not depressed by the high content of colored humic acids. Photosynthetic efficiency (alpha) ranged from 0.021-1 mu g C ( mu g Chl a h)(-1) mu mol photons(-1) m(2) s and reached its maximum value during winter even when the assemblage, dominated by cryptophyceans, did not achieve light saturation. In early and late summer and in autumn, optimal irradiance (E-opt) ranged from 544-1,397 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1). The highest P-A (207 mg C m(-2) h(-1)) was registered in late summer (high water level) when the lowest mean irradiance (E-mean) was observed (341 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)). The lowest PA (28 mg C m(-2) h(-1)) occurred in winter when E-mean was maximum (1,432 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)). Our results indicate that productivity was similar to those recorded for other latitudes and appeared not limited by the humic content of the water because phytoplankton was dominated by algae well-adapted to low light conditions.

J	Kajak, Z; Prus, P				Kajak, Z; Prus, P			Seasonal and year-to-year variation of numbers of Chironomus plumosus L. and Tubificidae in a lowland reservoir:: Regularities, causes, mechanisms	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												During 9 years of studies very regular Chironomus population dynamics was stated in a eutrophic, lowland dam reservoir. There were usually two peaks of the abundance: the higher one at spring (up to 80 thousands ind. m(-2)) and the much lower in autumn. The duration of the spring Chironomus generation was about 3 weeks. The constant presence of young larvae during the summer did not result in the high total abundance of larvae, mainly due to the strong predation of fish and swallows on various stages of Chironomus. The smaller predators pressure in the spring (due to fish breeding) and in the autumn (due to lower temperatures) resulted in the mentioned two peaks. The spring peak abundance was positively correlated with the chlorophyll concentration in water (feeding resource for larvae) and negatively with the water flow. There was also negative correlation of the water flow and the chlorophyll concentration, as well as abundance of Chironomus and Tubificidae during the vegetation season (April-October). Tubificidae correlated strongly positively with the spring Chironomus numbers (with a month lag).

We found the haul-out activity patterns to vary seasonally. Our results show that during the ice-covered winter period before the seals start their annual molt, the peak in haul-out generally occurs at midnight. Similarly, during the postmolt season of summer and autumn when the lake is free of ice, the haul-out is concentrated in the early hours of the morning. In contrast, over the spring molting period, Saimaa ringed seals tend to haul out around the clock. The spring molt is also the only period when a slight difference in haul-out behavior between the sexes is observed, with females having a haul-out peak at nighttime while the males have a less visible diel pattern. According to our results, the diel haul-out patterns of Saimaa ringed seals are similar to the ones of marine ringed seals. Gathering information on haul-out activity is important in order to safeguard the natural patterns of Saimaa ringed seals in areas that are prone to disturbance from human activities.

With the onset of thermal stratification in spring, gasvacuolated phototrophic bacteria rose from the sediment concomitant to the development of the anoxic sulfide containing hypolimnion. The reducing conditions at the sediment surface led to the disintegration of aggregates which contained phototrophic bacteria and insoluble oxidized iron and manganese compounds. Mass development of phototrophic bacteria occurred at the chemocline and was mainly due to multiplication of Thiopedia rosea and Amoebobacter purpureus during summer stratification. Growth of these purple sulfur bacteria was primarily light limited. Green photosynthetic bacteria developed above (Chloronema) or under (Pelochromatium consortium) the layer of Chromatiaceae at the end of summer stratification. During fall overturn oxygenated water caused the oxidation of reduced sulfur-, Fe- and Mn-compounds the oxidized products of which precipitated. Phototrophic bacteria and particulate organic matter became coprecipitated with the minerals and stayed over winter at the sediment surface.																			0003-9136					OCT	1990	119	4					369	392																WOS:A1990FU56400001
J	BURCH, MD				BURCH, MD			ANNUAL CYCLE OF PHYTOPLANKTON IN ACE LAKE, AN ICE COVERED, SALINE MEROMICTIC LAKE	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The annual cycle of phytoplankton in saline, meromictic Ace Lake (68.degree.28.4''S,78.degree.11.1''E) in the Vestfold Hills, Antarctica, was studied from January, 1979 to January 1980. Ace Lake has permanent gradients of temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and hydrogen sulphide, and is ice covered with up to 2 m of ice for 10-12 months each year. The phytoplankton community had low diversity, consisting of only four species, all flagellates-a prasinophyte Pyramimonas gelidicola McFadden et al., a cryptophyte of the genus Cryptomonas, an unidentifield colourless microflagellate, and an unarmoured dinoflagellate. These were restricted to the oxic zone of the lake from the surface to 10 m. The phytoplankton had a cycle of seven months of active growth over spring and summer. Low numbers of cells survived in the water column over winter. Spring growth was initiated below the ice by increased light penetration through the ice into the lake, enhanced at the time by the removal of surface snow which accumulated on the ice over winter. Peak phytoplankton biomass production was by the shade adapted P. gelidicola and occurred at the interface of the oxic and anoxic zones where substantial nitrogen as ammonia is found. The three dominant phytoplankton species distinct vertical stratification over the oxid zone. This stratification was not static and developed over spring as the flagellates migrated to preferred light climate zones. Mean cell volume of two of the flagellates varied significantly over the year. Minimum volumes were recorded in winter and volume increased progressively over spring to reach maximum mean cell volume in summer. Mean cell volume was positively correlated with light intensity (maximum ambient PAR at the respective depth for date of sample). Low cell volume in winter may be related to winter utilization of carbohydrate reserves by slow respiration, and may represent a survival mechanism.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				AUG 15	1988	165						59	75		10.1007/BF00025574	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00025574													WOS:A1988Q014900008
J	Van Buskirk, J				Van Buskirk, Josh			CHANGES IN THE ANNUAL CYCLE OF NORTH AMERICAN RAPTORS ASSOCIATED WITH RECENT SHIFTS IN MIGRATION TIMING	AUK												Recent changes in the timing of spring migration associated with climate change are occurring in hundreds of species of Northern Hemisphere birds. Much less is known about effects on autumn migration, especially for birds of prey. I studied simultaneous changes in spring and autumn phenology using data from 14 raptor species at two bird observatories on the shore of Lake Superior, North America. Median migration date advanced by 0.13 days.year(-1) in spring and was delayed by 0.23 days.year(-1) in autumn, with significant heterogeneity among species. Long-distance migrants were observed late in spring and early in autumn and showed less phenological change during autumn than short-distance migrants. The migratory period has become more extended, especially for short-distance migrants. Opposite responses during the two seasons had the effect of extending time spent to the north of the study area, by up to 30 days in some species since the early 1970s. These phenological shifts-potentially related to climate change-are causing dramatic changes in the annual cycle of North American raptors; whether these are beneficial or detrimental is unknown.

J	Horn, H; Paul, L; Horn, W; Petzoldt, T				Horn, Heidemarie; Paul, Lothar; Horn, Wolfgang; Petzoldt, Thomas			Long-term trends in the diatom composition of the spring bloom of a German reservoir: is Aulacoseira subarctica favoured by warm winters?	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Long-term data on the meteorology, hydrology, physicochemistry and plankton of a reservoir and its tributaries in SE Germany run from 1976 until now. This dimictic reservoir changed from mesotrophic to eutrophic in the 1970s, remained eutrophic in the 1980s and returned to the mesotrophic state after a sharp reduction in P loading in 1990. 2. Phytoplankton biomass reaches an annual maximum in spring and consists almost entirely of diatoms. While Asterionella formosa was dominant until 1990, Aulacoseira subarctica became more frequent at the end of the 1990s and was particularly abundant in years with short winters. 3. Statistical analyses suggested that these changes were triggered primarily by the mild winters that were frequent after 1988. Climate-related hydrophysical variables and the initial biomass of the diatoms at the beginning of the year, considered as an 'inoculum', were identified as most important. These variables explained 39% of the total variance of the relative abundance, whereas the change in trophic conditions was responsible for about 20%. 4. The absolute and relative abundance of A. subarctica was positively related to short ice cover, early ice-out and a long-lasting spring circulation. Owing to its physiological traits, and particularly its ability to survive under low-light conditions, A. subarctica benefitted from short, mild winters. Under such conditions, it could sustain or establish a high initial biomass, whereas the concentrations of the other diatoms decreased over winter. However, this advantage may be lost if further warming causes an early onset of summer stratification. Because of its low population growth rate and requirement for high turbulence, A. subarctica needs long, cold springs to exploit the improved starting conditions and to become abundant. 5. In contrast to A. subarctica, A. formosa required a substantial soluble reactive phosphorus supply to compete successfully. The eutrophic conditions until 1990 were the prerequisite for its mass growth under low-light and low-temperature conditions during the spring. After reduction in P concentration from 1990, A. formosa declined and other diatom species became more abundant. 6. These other diatoms may be viewed as 'stopgaps' when conditions were not favourable for A. subarctica or A. formosa. Diatoma elongatum exploited brief circulation periods in years with low P loading. Synedra acus and Fragilaria crotonensis, because of their poor competitive ability at low light intensity, reached high density in the upper water column in the transitional period between spring circulation and summer stratification. 7. Our study suggests that climate-related variables have crucial impacts on the spring phytoplankton dynamics of deep stratified waterbodies. They can mask the consequences of changes in the trophic conditions and, corresponding to the functional traits of the different phytoplankton species, also decisively control their relative abundances. In this reservoir, the warmer winters and prolonged spring circulations did not only lead to high phytoplankton biomass (despite considerably reduced nutrient loads) but also cause a marked shift in the diatom assemblage during the spring bloom.

J	DICKMAN, M				DICKMAN, M			SEASONAL SUCCESSION AND MICROLAMINA FORMATION IN A MEROMICTIC LAKE DISPLAYING VARVED SEDIMENTS	SEDIMENTOLOGY												In a small meromictic lake near Toronto, Canada, a mass mortality of photosynthetic bacteria followed the ventilation of the chemocline during fall (autumn) and resulted in 3.8 g m-2 day-1 of organic matter being deposited as a dark layer in sediment traps which were suspended in the permanently anaerobic zone. This mass mortality of photosynthetic bacteria occurred in late autumn following the annual thermal destratification of the lake''s mixolimnion. Wind mixing during this period of homeothermy resulted in the introduction of low levels of dissolved O2 into the lake''s chemocline. The ensuing mass mortality of photosynthetic bacteria resulted in the release of elemental S as the S-rich bacteria decomposed and sank to the bottom of the lake. The ferrous ions in the water below a depth of 15 m in Crawford Lake reacted with this S to form black ferrous sulfides and pyrite which formed a dark microlamina on the lake floor. Each dark microlamina was overlain by a light colored (calcite-rich) layer which was deposited each spring and summer during the 3 yr of this study. The mechanism of microlamina formation elucidated here is based on the examination of biweekly sediment trap information. This approach has permitted an explanation of the mechanisms by which specific events such as calcite precipitation and phytoplankton seasonal succession are transcribed into the sediment record.																			0037-0746	1365-3091					1985	32	1					109	118		10.1111/j.1365-3091.1985.tb00495.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3091.1985.tb00495.x													WOS:A1985ADW0800007
J	Wang, J; Sheng, YW; Gleason, CJ; Wada, Y				Wang, Jida; Sheng, Yongwei; Gleason, Colin J.; Wada, Yoshihide			Downstream Yangtze River levels impacted by Three Gorges Dam	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Changes in the Yangtze River level induced by large-scale human water regulation have profound implications on the inundation dynamics of surrounding lakes/wetlands and the integrity of related ecosystems. Using in situ measurements and hydrological simulation, this study reveals an altered Yangtze level regime downstream from the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) to the Yangtze estuary in the East China Sea as a combined result of (i) TGD's flow regulation and (ii) Yangtze channel erosion due to reduced sediment load. During the average annual cycle of TGD's regular flow control in 2009-2012, downstream Yangtze level variations were estimated to have been reduced by 3.9-13.5% at 15 studied gauging stations, manifested as evident level decrease in fall and increase in winter and spring. The impacts on Yangtze levels generally diminished in a longitudinal direction from the TGD to the estuary, with a total time lag of similar to 9-12 days. Chronic Yangtze channel erosion since the TGD closure has lowered water levels in relation to flows at most downstream stations, which in turn counteracts the anticipated level increase by nearly or over 50% in winter and spring while reinforcing the anticipated level decrease by over 20% in fall. Continuous downstream channel erosion in the near future may further counteract the benefit of increased Yangtze levels during TGD's water supplement in winter and accelerate the receding of inundation areas/levels of downstream lakes in fall.

They are vital water sources, serving various purposes, from farmland irrigation to domestic and industrial use. Unfortunately, anthropogenic activities have influenced these "rivers," negatively impacting water quality and ecological functions; however, there is limited research on their ecological status. Thus, this study assessed the zooplankton community structure and developed the zooplankton index of biotic integrity (Z-IBI) to evaluate the ecological status. Samples were collected and analyzed seasonally in 2019. Generally, 159 zooplankton species belonging to 85 genera, 55 families, and 3 phyla were identified, dominated by Rotifer and Protozoa, followed by Arthropoda (groups of Copepod and Cladocera). The zooplankton density varied from 0.00 to 126.04 ind L-1, with averages of 19.49 ind L-1, 31.40 ind L-1, and 20.38 ind L-1 in Changwang, Meishe, and Wuyuan, respectively. The zooplankton density varied seasonally as summer > spring > winter > autumn. Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) indicated a significant seasonal difference (R = 0.070, p < 0.001) in zooplankton community but not spatially (R = 0.004, p = 0.413). Thus, SIMPER revealed that Brachionus forficula, Didinium nasutum, Keratella valga, Nauplius, and Polyarthra vulgaris contributed to the seasonal differences. The redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed environmental factors, including total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), chemical oxygen demand (CODMn), dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, pH, Chl-a, and electrical conductivity (EC) influenced zooplankton species. The Z-IBI was established using Zooplankton abundance, Protozoa abundance, Copepod abundance, Cladoceran biomass %, and Shannon-Wiener diversity index. Based on Z-IBI evaluation, ecological status was "moderate" in Changwang and Wuyuan, while it was "low" in Meishe. Seasonally, the ecological status in autumn was better than in summer and spring. The Z-IBI showed that parameters, including pH, EC, CODMn, TN, TP, and Chl-a, decreased with improving water quality, while water transparency increased with improved water quality. Thus, the "rivers" ecological status could be adequately assessed using the Z-IBI to guide their water quality monitoring and management.

The delta(13)C(CH4) value varied widely downward in vertical profile of about 3 meters, from about 4.5 parts per thousand/m (late summer 1993) to about +2.5 parts per thousand/m (late winter), Likewise, the production rate gradually decreased downwards ceasing at depth of about 1-3 meters. These vertical variations apparently are due not to temperature or oxidation effect, but rather to higher gradient of downward decrease of production rate via acetic acid fermentation than that via the CO2-H-2 pathway. The downward increase of delta(13)C(CH4) value in winter, late autumn and, at greater depths, in late summer may be a consequence of C-13 isotope enrichment of the residual pool of precursors of methane (predominantly CO2).																					90-5410-942-4				1998							325	328																WOS:000073721700075

In summer and autumn, a remarkable level of themocline was shown between depths of 10 and 30m, and the water temperature range was more than 15 degrees C at the top of this and less than 5 degrees C at the bottom. During the night many Salmonidae were dispersed in the surface layer (summer: 10-40m, autumn: 20-30m) of the whole lake area, and in the daytime ascend to a shallower layer (summer: 3-20m, autumn: 10-20m). But during the day, their number was very small compared with the night-time. The reason for this was estimated as horizontal maldistribution. In winter, the water temperature was stabilized at 5.2 degrees 5.4 degrees C in all layers, and Salmonidae were dispersed in the bottom layer (100-172m) around the deep area of the lake during the day, and were dispersed in the surface layer (20-60m) of the whole lake area at night.																			0021-5392					NOV	1993	59	11					1813	1821																WOS:A1993MW45900001

Spawning phenology of the white bream (Blicca bjoerkna) in "Dnieper-Orylskiy" Natural Reserve in relation to seasonal temperature dynamic	BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY												This paper examines the relationship between climatic conditions and the phenology of spawning of the white bream Blicca bjoerkna (Linnaeus, 1758) in natural habitats of the "Dnipro-Orilskiy" Nature Reserve. The characteristic of spawning distribution is symmetric, as the asymmetry coefficients do not significantly differ from zero. The distribution of the timing of spawning and its duration are also characterized by excesses, which do not significantly differ from zero alternatives. Analysis of meteorological data for the period of study allowed us to determine the trends in temperature variation, which correlate with the temperature of the water. Spawning events in any given year take place entirely within an upward temperature progression that can be accurately described by a linear equation in the form: Y = b vertical bar a . x, where Y - ten-day average temperature; x - the order of decades for I-VI months of the year, a and b - the parameters of the equation. The same equation can be used to describe downward movements in the temperature for decades during the VII-XII months of the year. Regression parameters and coefficients of determination have the following environmental sense. For the ascending temperature branch the regression coefficient b will decrease in proportion to the increase in the contrast between winter and summer temperatures. Due to the fact that linear approximation is a certain generalization of the sinusoid natural course of temperature, it should be borne in mind that the highest summer temperatures are close to the change in direction in the course of temperature from increase to decrease. Therefore, the coefficient b will largely depend on the minimum winter temperatures and should be interpreted as a marker of the coldness of the winter. This interpretation is all the more justified because we are concerned here with assessment of the impact on fish spawning, and the processes that precede spawning events clearly have importance for their explanation. Changes in the direction of the course of temperature which occur after spawning and have no value in explaining spawning. If we consider coefficient b beyond the environmental context, then certainly this figure depends on the coldness of the winter and equally on the warmness of the summer. Similar considerations lead us to interpret the coefficient b of a descending branch as a marker of the warmness of the summer. Comparison of the ascending temperature branch of the current year and the descending branch of the previous year gives the coefficient of correlation between these parameters of linear regression r = -0.10, P = 0.39. This result confirms our assumption that the coefficient b of a descending branch is a marker of the warmness of summer, because if it were a marker of the coldness of a winter, then the coefficient of correlation parameters for the temperature course that are common for this winter would be statistically significant. In addition, the absence of connections indicates that these coefficients provide independent and additional information about the weather conditions. Coefficient a for the ascending branch characterizes the rate of warming during the spring, ie the rate of onset of summer, and for the descending branch -the rate of cooling in the fall, that is the speed of the onset of winter. The linear model reflects the general trend of warming in spring and cooling in autumn. In reality, the course of temperature change is by its nature a complex oscillatory process. Therefore the coefficient of determination of linear regression indicates the extent of correspondence of the real process to the linear model. Significant deviations from the general trend lead to a reduction in the coefficient of determination. These variations are the result of processes of sharp warming, alternating with periods of abrupt cooling. The more such events occur, the smaller the coefficient of determination. Thus, to describe the timing of spawning events we can examine the impact on them of such factors as regression model parameters for the current year for the ascending branch of temperature changes and parameters for the model of the previous year for the descending branch of temperature changes. As a result of our studies, we found that during the period 1997-2015 the typical course of temperature during the year is characterized by two branches: ascending and descending. The data obtained support the hypothesis that the onset of the various phases of spawning (the beginning of spawning, the end of spawning, spawning duration) is explained by temperature variation of the current year up to the spawning event and by temperature variation in the preceding year. The timing of the spawning of B. bjoerkna can be described at a statistically significant level by multidimensional factors reflecting the peculiarities of weather conditions and habitat type. The colder the previous summer and the winter of the current year and the fewer variables there are in the course of temperature, the later spawning occurs. The warmer the previous summer and the colder the winter of the current year, the later the spawning ends. Temperature variability in the course of temperature contributes to an earlier completion of spawning. There is a strong correlation between the beginning and the end of the spawning season so the impact of environmental factors at the beginning of spawning is also reflected in the timing of the end of spawning. The influence of conditions in the current year on the end of spawning is conditioned by the timing of the onset of spawning and the impact of weather conditions of the previous year on the end of spawning has independent significance.

Modeling the effect of invasive quagga mussels on the spring phytoplankton bloom in Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The disappearance of the spring phytoplankton bloom in Lake Michigan has been attributed in some studies to the direct effect of quagga mussel filter-feeding. We applied a biophysical model to test whether the observed reduction in the spring bloom can be explained by direct effects of quagga mussel grazing. We developed a 1-D column biological model that simulated light and temperature limitation on phytoplankton growth, vertical mixing, and grazing by zooplankton and quagga mussels. We applied the 3-D finite volume coastal ocean model (FVCOM) to provide vertical mixing, with two scenarios of atmospheric forcing: (a) North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) and (b) station interpolation using the Natural Neighbor Method. Simulated development of the spring bloom and formation of the deep chlorophyll layer in the early summer stratified period were consistent with observations. Increased strength of winter stratification (surface <4 degrees C) in 1997 (cold spring) increased chlorophyll concentrations during March and April, compared to 1998, by reducing light limitation (reduced mixed-layer depth). Simulations with NARR forcing produced high-biased chlorophyll, resulting from low-biased wind speed and spring mixed layer depth. Simulated mussel filter feeding strongly reduced phytoplankton abundance when the water column was mixed to the bottom, but had little effect during periods of summer and winter stratification. These model simulations highlight the sensitivity of both phytoplankton growth and the impact of profundal quagga mussel filter-feeding to vertical mixing and stratification, which in turn is controlled by meteorological conditions.

Screening of Epiphytic Algae on the Aquatic Plant Phragmites australis inhabiting Tigris River in Al-Jadria Site, Baghdad, Iraq	BAGHDAD SCIENCE JOURNAL												The present work included qualitative study of epiphytic algae on dead and living stems, leaves of the aquatic plant Phragmitesaustralis Trin ex Stand, in Tigris River in AL- Jadria Site in Baghdad during Autumn 2014, Winter 2015, Spring 2015, and Summer 2015. The physical and chemical parameters of River's water were studied (water temperature, pH, electric conductivity, Salinity, TSS, TDS, turbidity, light intensity, dissolve oxygen, BOD5, alkalinity, total hardness, calcium, magnesium and plant nutrient). A total of 142 isolates of epiphytic algae were identified. Diatoms were dominant by 117 isolates followed by Cyanobacteria (13isolates), Chlorophyta (11 isolates) and Rhodophyta (1 isolate), Variations in the isolates number were recorded on different parts of macrophyte host as well as, indifferent seasons. Eight new algal isolates (Achnanthesexigue var. heterovalvata Krasske, Navicula exilissima Grunow, Navicula falaisiensis var lanceola Grunow, Navicula microcephalo Grunow, Pleurosigma obscurum W. Smith, Stauroneis amphioxys var. amphioxys Gregory, Stenopterobia intermedia Lewis and Audouinella hermannii Roth).were identified as new records.

These 29 pesticides include 4 carbamates, 2 benzimidazoles, 6 neonicotinoids, 2 organophosphates, 9 triazoles, and 6 others. Of the 29 pesticides analyzed, 18 were present in every sample taken from the Huangpu River. The concentration of target pesticides in water samples ranged from < LOQ (for buprofezin in summer, autumn, and winter) to 607.30 ng L-1 (for carbendazim in spring). From the source (i.e., Taihu Lake) to the estuary of the Huangpu River, with the exception of isocarbophos and isoprothiolane (gradual decrease), the spatial variation of target pesticide concentrations firstly exhibited an increasing trend and then a decreasing trend. Peak spatial variation was seen in metropolitan area, which is closely related to the type of land use and the discharge of tributaries. In addition, the total summed concentration of the 29 pesticides during winter (1037.60 ng L-1) was higher than summer (788.82 ng L-1) in rural and metropolitan areas. For the ecological risk assessments of fish, daphnia, and green algae, the triazoles, carbamates, neonicotinoids were risk-dominant pesticides, respectively. Notably, carbendazim had a 100% detection frequency and the highest concentration of the 29 pesticides analyzed, indicating its high consumption in the Huangpu River basin. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

This study applied temperature models to locate sites of groundwater discharge and quantify the magnitude and direction of seepage flux. The contaminant levels and spatial distributions, seasonal seepage flux distributions and the conductivity were investigated. The arsenic concentration of the water spring was 1481.9 mu g L-1, and as the distance from the water spring increased, the arsenic concentration in the overlying water, pore-water and surface sediments decreased. Herein, the temperature models of McCallum and Bredehoeft were applied to estimate the lakebed vertical seepage flux in groundwater-surface water exchange systems during a period of 30-day in summer and winter. An upward flow of groundwater discharge was observed near the water spring, with the value of some sites over 10 cm day(-1), and a downward flow was observed with increasing distance from the water spring in summer. Additionally, a slight upward flow was observed in winter. The arsenic levels, spatial distributions and the conductivity in monitoring sites were closely related to the seepage flux. The application provided a scientific basis for the prediction of groundwater-surface water exchange in deep plateau-lake and was a further development in temperature models. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Trin. ex Stewdel], especially the old ones, on the occurrence of mycoflora species in different trophic seasons in the water of 4 trophically different water bodies. The seeds and snake exuviae were used as bait. In the spring, diatoms were the predominant group of algae forming the periphyton on old reed stalks, green algae predominated in the summer, and cyanobacteria in the autumn. During the seasons studied, in the water from Lake Blizno equal numbers of mycoflora species were noted inside the control containers and in those with reed-periphyton. In water from the other 3 water bodies completely different results were obtained. In the spring and autumn, a smaller number of mycoflora species grew inside the containers with reed-periphyton. However, during the summer the number of mycoflora species was higher in the Biala river water (control) as compared to the containers with reed-periphyton; in the other 2 water bodies the findings were the opposite. As known, all algae, including the periphyton constituents, excrete many different organic substances into the environment. Some of them are a medium for various hydrobionts, while others inhibit the growth of aquatic organisms including mycoflora species.

Previous studies in riparian areas have shown that microbial communities are capable of degrading herbicides faster in forest soils than in pasture soils. This study tested the influence of age of riparian forests on herbicide degradation in the soil. Active and total fungal and bacterial biomasses and mineralization of atrazine (2 chloro-4 [ethylamino] -6 [isopropylamino]-S-triazine) and 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxy-acetic acid) in the litter and top 10 cm of mineral soil were measured in forests 20-40, 60-90, and 120-300 years old on three riparian sites in autumn, winter, spring, and summer. Active and total fungal and active and total bacterial biomasses did not differ in the top 10 cm of mineral soil regardless of forest age. In litter, total bacterial biomass also did not differ with forest age throughout the year, but in spring and autumn, active bacterial biomass was greater in old-growth than in second- or young-growth litter samples, as were both active and total fungal biomasses. Atrazine mineralization in litter did not differ with forest age or season, but in mineral soil it was greater in old-growth than in second-or young-growth forest samples in all seasons. Mineralization of 2,4-D in litter was greater in old- and second-growth forest samples than in young-growth samples, except in winter; and in mineral-soil, it was greater in old-growth samples than in those from both younger forest types. Results indicate that microbial communities in old-growth riparian areas have a greater capacity to degrade herbicides than do such communities in second-or young-growth forests. Management of riparian forest to long rotations may tend to increase herbicide degradation and protection of lakes and streams.																			0929-1393					JUN	1995	2	2					77	84		10.1016/0929-1393(94)00046-A	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0929-1393(94)00046-A													WOS:A1995RK12900002

The analysis of the stomach content of 179 individuals (25 to 56 mm standard length [SL]) showed a diet dominated by cyclopoid copepods (43.8%) and chironomid larvae (39.1%). Diet in relation to size and sex of the fish was dominated by copepods in autumn and winter and by chironomid larvae during spring. Diet overlap (Schoener's index) was significant (greater than or equal to60%) between fish size-classes in January, March and April and between sexes for most sampling months. The average size of prey consumed was independent of fish mouth size. The feeding strategy of the threespine stickleback shifted from opportunist in winter to specialist in spring.																			0906-6691					DEC	2001	10	4					191	197		10.1034/j.1600-0633.2001.100401.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-0633.2001.100401.x													WOS:000173979100001

As a result of such loading, summer total P concentrations approach or exceed 100 .mu.g P l-1. Most of the summer loading of P is thought to have been released directly from the rich, flocculent sediment in the mid and northern part of the lake as a result of high pH (up to 10) related to phytoplankton photosynthesis. The lake also supports a dense submersed macrophyte crop (areal weighted mean dry weight of .apprx. 220 g m-2) composed primarily of Elodea densa. Although excretion of P from healthy E. densa was minimal, the potential contribution of P indirectly from sediment via macrophyte uptake and subsequent decomposition in the winter was on the order of 200-400 kg yr-1 or .apprx. 25-50% of the external loading. Nevertheless, loading of P during predrawdown summers is thought to have originated largely as a direct release from sediment due to high pH. Estimates of sediment P release determined from laboratory experiments, mass balance and core analyses ranged from 2.2-5.6 mg m-2 day-1. As a component of the restoration program, the lake (mean depth of 2 m) was drawn down nearly 2 m for 4 mo. during the summer and fall of 1979. The lake''s trophic status was expected to improve due to sediment consolidation and/or macrophyte reduction. The drawdown resulted in an 84% reduction in macrophyte biomass in 1980 but minimal sediment consolidation (0.1 m). Winter decomposition of the much smaller macrophyte crop, apparently provided insufficient P in the spring to stimulate phytoplankton and to enrich midlake sediments, which has probably occurred in previous years. Low water column pH during the postdrawndown summer of 1980 resulted from relatively low rates of plankton photosynthesis. During the summer of 1980 internal loading of P was reduced and total P remained below 50 .mu.g l-1.																			0043-1354	1879-2448					1982	16	6					911	919		10.1016/0043-1354(82)90022-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(82)90022-7													WOS:A1982NS97200022
J	Jassby, AD; Goldman, CR; Reuter, JE; Richards, RC				Jassby, AD; Goldman, CR; Reuter, JE; Richards, RC			Origins and scale dependence of temporal variability in the transparency of Lake Tahoe, California-Nevada	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Secchi depth has been measured in Lake Tahoe an average of every 12 d since July 1967. Because of the unusual clarity of the lake, Secchi depth measurement is responsive to small changes in light-attenuating particles, and the record exhibits strong variability at the seasonal, interannual, and decadal scales. Using recently developed methods of applied time-series analysis, the mechanisms of change were delineated at each scale, The seasonal pattern is a bimodal one, with two minima at approximately June and December The June minimum is due mostly to cumulative discharge of suspended sediments following melting of the snowpack. The December minimum is probably a result of mixed-layer deepening as the thermocline passes through layers of phytoplankton and other light-attenuating particles that reach a maximum below the summer mixed layer. The interannual scale exhibits two modes of variability, one during the weakly stratified autumn-winter period and the other during the more stratified spring-summer period. The first mode is a result of variable depth of mixing in this unusually deep lake, while the second results from year-to-year changes in spring runoff. A decadal trend also exists (-0.25 m yr(-1)), resulting from accumulation of materials in the water column. It is not vet understood, however, how much of this change is due to phytoplankton or recent phytoplankton-derived materials and how much is due to other materials such as mineral suspensoids. Based on the available measurements and physical considerations, both categories may play a significant role.																			0024-3590					MAR	1999	44	2					282	294		10.4319/lo.1999.44.2.0282	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1999.44.2.0282													WOS:000079309300005

Daily journal entries recorded both qualitative direct (e.g. temperature, cloud cover) and indirect (e.g. animal migration, ice activity) weather conditions, A hierarchical coding scheme was developed through content analysis that classified the entries into exclusive and unique categories. Monthly, seasonal and annual weighted averages were calculated for the post journals and culminated in a seasonal warm/cold index representing periods of normal and extreme weather conditions for the three post locations. Temperature readings taken by the HBC at Frances Lake from December 1842 to May 1844 were used to validate the index's reliability by comparison with climate normal data from a nearby Environment Canada weather station. Results show that 9 out of the 14 extreme seasons captured by the index were mild winters. The only prolonged period of extreme weather was a colder than normal six month period from the spring to the late fall of 1849.																					978-90-481-2827-3				2009							209	229		10.1007/978-90-481-2828-0_13	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-90-481-2828-0_13	10.1007/978-90-481-2828-0												WOS:000274229900013

Three parasite species were identified in the host fish species: Gyrodactylus elegans, Nordmann, 1832; Dactylogyrus extensus Mueller ve Van Cleave, 1932 (Monogenoidea, Plathelminthes); Bothriocephalus acheilognathi, Yamaguti, 1934 (Cestoidea, Plathelminthes). From these species, G. elegans was found on the gills of 2 fish (% 2.8, 5.0 parasite/fish) and on the fins of 16 fish (% 22.5, 7.6 parasite/fish). D. extensus was found on the gills of 65 fish (% 91.5, 22.1 parasite/fish). B. acheilognathi was found in the intestine of 10 host fish (% 14.0, 10.8 parasite/fish). D. extensus was the dominant species found on the host fish. The highest infection rate and mean parasite was in winter and minimum value was in summer and spring. The smaller common carp have more infection rate than larger common carp specimens by D. extensus. G. elegans was found on middle size fish's fins in spring, on the gills in winter. The infection rate occurred by B. acheilognathi was more common in small and middle size host fish species in winter than in spring and summer.

Influences of seasonality and habitat quality on Great Lakes coastal wetland fish community composition and diets	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Great Lakes coastal wetlands (GLCW) have been severely degraded by anthropogenic activity over the last several decades despite their critical role in fish production. Many Great Lakes fish species use coastal wetland habitats for spawning, feeding, shelter, and nurseries throughout the year. The goal of our study was to compare GLCW fish community composition in the spring, summer, and fall months and investigate how water quality relates to fish diversity, the presence of functional groups, and juvenile fish diets. We summarized fish data collected from GLCW across the basin and used the coastal wetland monitoring program's water quality-land use indicator to quantify water quality. Basin-wide, we found taxonomic and functional group differences in community composition among three sampling seasons, as well as across the range of water quality. Water quality was positively associated with the abundance of small cyprinids and the relative abundance of some habitat and reproductive specialists. Seasonal differences were also observed for many of these functional groups, with more temperature- and pollution-sensitive fishes captured in the spring and more nest-spawning fishes captured in the summer and fall. In our diet study, we found that age-0 fish primarily consumed zooplankton in the fall, whereas age-1 fish primarily consumed macroinvertebrates in the spring. Moreover, wetland quality was positively associated with trichopteran prey abundance. We concluded that taxonomic and functional composition of fish communities in GLCW vary markedly with respect to water quality and season. Thus, a full understanding of communities across a gradient of quality requires multi-season sampling.					; Ciborowski, Jan/AAC-8247-2019; Kowalski, Kurt/GXZ-5008-2022; Cooper, Matthew/J-4420-2014	Brady, Valerie/0000-0002-2575-1017; Kowalski, Kurt/0000-0002-8424-4701; Dumke, Joshua/0000-0003-0555-1568; Diller, Sara/0000-0003-1502-0074; Uzarski, Don/0000-0002-7184-6156; Ciborowski, Jan/0000-0002-6588-0366; Ruetz, Carl/0000-0002-9336-5118; 													0923-4861	1572-9834				JUN	2022	30	3					439	460		10.1007/s11273-022-09862-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11273-022-09862-8		MAY 2022											WOS:000798394200001
J	Wahl, B; Peeters, F				Wahl, Bernd; Peeters, Frank			Effect of climatic changes on stratification and deep-water renewal in Lake Constance assessed by sensitivity studies with a 3D hydrodynamic model	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The implications of climatic change on Lake Constance are studied by long-term hydrodynamic model simulations. In contrast to earlier studies that mostly have applied one-dimensional models, this investigation utilizes a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model and thus profits from the advantages of a spatial representation of lake bathymetry and hydrophysical processes. Model adaptation and validation are based on half a century of vertically resolved temperature recordings (1961 to 2011). Three different horizontal grid layouts are used to test the sensitivity of the thermal stratification and effective vertical turbulent diffusivities (D-eff(V)) determined with the heat-budget method to grid resolution. D-eff(V) calculated from observations and from simulations with different grid resolutions agree rather well. However, in the deep water simulated D-eff(V) are overestimated if the basin is resolved only by few grid cells. The investigation of the effect of climatic changes on Lake Constance is focused on the effects of altered air temperatures and wind velocities on deep-water renewal. Numerical tracers are used as indicators of the winter vertical transport and mixing. Effects on stratification and mixing strongly depend on the seasonal course of the climatic changes. Warmer winter temperatures result in reduced deep-water exchange and more frequent years with incomplete mixing. Increased air temperatures in summer have almost no effect on deep-water renewal in winter but increase water-column stability during summer and autumn. Increased wind speeds influence vertical mixing and surface heat fluxes and cause higher deep-water temperatures if wind speeds are higher during the summer.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				MAY	2014	59	3					1035	1052		10.4319/lo.2014.59.3.1035	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2014.59.3.1035													WOS:000339904300031

The specific activity of (U-238, Th-232 and K-40) natural radionuclides have been measured using the Gamma Spectrometry analysis with HPGe detector. The measured average activity concentration of these radionuclides in the studied samples were (11.9 +/- 1.00, 7.80 +/- 1.08 and 211 +/- 3.41) Bq/kg in spring; (9.23 +/- 1.19, 7.66 +/- 0.977 and 181 +/- 3.06) Bq/kg in summer; (12.7 +/- 1.52, 8.16 +/- 1.04 and 188 +/- 3.10) Bq/kg in autumn; (11.91 +/- 1.55, 9.13 +/- 1.03 and 219 +/- 3.04) Bq/kg in winter.

J	Radke, RJ; Eckmann, R				Radke, RJ; Eckmann, R			First-year overwinter mortality in Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis L.) -: Results from a field study and a simulation experiment	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												The importance of overwinter mortality of 0+ perch (Perca fluviatilis L.) in central European lakes was estimated using a stochastic simulation model. The probability of overwinter mortality of a perch cohort was calculated by using a model developed for yellow perch (P. flavescens Mitchill). Winter duration from a long-term data set and the length of perch at the end of the first year from five lakes were used as input data. After 1000 simulation runs, the total extinction of a cohort in the lakes studied was never predicted. Mortality rates of more than 0.5 were only predicted in two of the five lakes, and rates of more than 0.3 in these two lakes were predicted in approximately 10% of all cases. For two consecutive winters differing in duration, the length-frequency distributions of Of perch in the autumn and following spring were compared by a graphical method. No significant size-dependent mortality of smaller individuals could be detected in any of the populations studied. Simulated spring length-frequencies were derived from observed autumn length distributions by the same model that was used for the stochastic simulation. These simulated and the empirical spring length-frequency distributions were not identical. The differences between the two distributions were attributed to growth, which occurred between the sampling dates. The results from the simulation and the analysis of the empirical data suggest that high overwinter mortality caused by starvation is rare in central European lakes.																			0906-6691					JUN	1999	8	2					94	101		10.1111/j.1600-0633.1999.tb00059.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.1999.tb00059.x													WOS:000080471600006
J	Zhang, RN; Zhang, RH; Zuo, ZY				Zhang, Ruonan; Zhang, Renhe; Zuo, Zhiyan			Impact of Eurasian Spring Snow Decrement on East Asian Summer Precipitation	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												In this study, the relationship between Eurasian spring snow decrement (SSD) and East Asian summer precipitation and related mechanisms were investigated using observational data and the Community Atmospheric Model, version 3.1 (CAM3.1). The results show that a west-east dipole pattern in Eurasian SSD anomalies, with a negative center located in the region between eastern Europe and the West Siberia Plain (EEWSP) and a positive center located around Baikal Lake (BL), is significantly associated with East Asian summer precipitation via triggering an anomalous midlatitude Eurasian wave train. Reduced SSD over EEWSP corresponds to anomalously dry local soil conditions from spring to the following summer, thereby increasing surface heat flux and near-surface temperatures. Similarly, the increase in SSD over BL is accompanied by anomalously low near-surface temperatures. The near-surface thermal anomalies cause an anomalous meridional temperature gradient, which intensifies the lower-level baroclinicity and causes an acceleration of the subtropical westerly jet stream, leading to an enhanced and maintained Eurasian wave train. Additionally, the atmospheric response to changed surface thermal conditions tends to simultaneously increase the local 1000-500-hPa thickness, which further enhances the Eurasian wave train. Consequently, significant wave activity flux anomalies spread from eastern Europe eastward to East Asia and significantly influence the summer precipitation over China, with more rainfall over northeastern China and the Yellow River valley and less rainfall over Inner Mongolia and southern China.

Chesapeake Bay bacterioplankton exhibited a repeatable annual pattern and strong seasonal shifts. In winter, the bacterial communities were dominated by Alphaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria, whereas in summer, the predominant bacteria were members of Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria, Planctomycetes, and Bacteroidetes. Phylotypes of Alphaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria present in warm seasons were different from those in cold seasons. Relatively stable communities were present in summer-fall across the sampling years, whereas winter communities were highly variable interannually. Temporal variations in bacterial communities were best explained by changes of chlorophyll a (Chl a) and water temperature, but dissolved oxygen, ammonia, nitrite and nitrate, and viral abundance also contributed significantly to the bacterial seasonal variations.					; Kan, Jinjun/C-5252-2011; Crump, Byron/ABF-3711-2020; Chen, Feng/P-3088-2014	Crump, Byron/0000-0001-7062-1273; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				SEP	2006	51	5					2157	2169		10.4319/lo.2006.51.5.2157	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2006.51.5.2157													WOS:000240673800020
J	LIAW, WK; MACCRIMMON, HR				LIAW, WK; MACCRIMMON, HR			ASSESSMENT OF PARTICULATE ORGANIC-MATTER IN RIVER WATER	INTERNATIONALE REVUE DER GESAMTEN HYDROBIOLOGIE												Particulate organic matter in a downriver riffle of the Grand River, the largest Canadian Great Lakes tributary, was studied between June 1970 and April 1972. In winter and spring, concentrations of particulate organic matter (1.0-26.2 mg/l) varied with river flow. High summer levels (3.4-12.7 mg/l) were attributable to high autochthonous primary production. Mean chlorophyll a concentration in summer (29.8 mg/m3) was nearly 15 times higher than in winter and 8 times the spring mean level. High algal cell counts (15,000-19,000 cells/l) also occurred in summer. Autochthonous and allochthonous contributions to the total particulate organic C input to the river in summer were estimated by daily organic input and river flow relationships, C to chlorophyll a and to pheopigments ratios. The allochthonous source accounted for 21.5% of the total organic C while the autochthonous contributed the remaining 78.5%. The latter included living algae (23.0%), senescent plant material (30.3%) and detritus (25.2%, including microbes). A new approach was established whereby the various components of particulate organic matter in river water can be indirectly partitioned and their biomass estimated by using quantitative relationships among readily obtainable parameters of river flow, standing biomass, chlorophyll a and pheopigments.																			0020-9309						1977	62	4					445	463		10.1002/iroh.1977.3510620401	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.1977.3510620401													WOS:A1977EC95400001
J	ADALSTEINSSON, H				ADALSTEINSSON, H			ZOOPLANKTON AND ITS RELATION TO AVAILABLE FOOD IN LAKE MYVATN	OIKOS												Lake Myvatn [Iceland] is a eutrophic lake, divided into 3 basins, and with a mean depth of about 2 m. Because of the shallow nature of the lake, sediment is often suspended and may dominate quantitatively over phytoplankton. Among phytoplankton, chrysomonads dominate in winter, being replaced after ice-break by diatoms, which are followed by a new peak of chrysomonads. Anabaena flos-aquae (Lyngb.) Breb. dominates during summer, and diatoms again during autumn. Among the zooplankton, Cyclops nauplii and large rotifers dominate in spring, being replaced by small rotifers in early summer. Daphnia longispina Mull. is monocyclic, with a peak in July-Aug. The species is replaced in the shallowest basin by rotifers. The parthenogenetic generation of Daphnia was kept at a low level in 1973, presumably by low spring temperatures. The sexual generation was delayed in time by this factor, but the abundance was not significantly lower than normal. C. cf. abyssorum Sars is dicyclic in the lake, with the 1st generation appearing in spring, and the 2nd in July-Aug. The reproduction of the 2nd generation was negatively influenced by the Daphnia population in 1973. The total production of zooplankton was 30-100 g fresh wt m-2 in the different basins. Between-year fluctuations in the Daphnia population influenced the total production considerably. Phytoplankton biomass was on an average 2-2.5 times higher, and production 10-20 times higher than the corresponding values for zooplankton. The differences in species composition among the 3 basins are discussed, and 3 causes for this seem probable, i.e., the bloom of Anabaena, fish predation, and the disturbance caused by sediment suspension.																			0030-1299	1600-0706					1979	32	1-2					162	194		10.2307/3544226	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3544226													WOS:A1979HJ61200010

We were interested also in inferring the main pollutants through a phytoplankton functional trait characterization and assessing the phytoplankton groups which may influence the Qr index final estimations. Monthly sampling of environmental variables and phytoplankton were done in three sites (S1, S2, and S3). Phytoplankton was classified according to Reynolds Functional Groups (RFG) and water quality estimation was performed using the Qr index. Principal coordinates (PCO) and PERMANOVA were applied to identify the main pollutants through the RFG. RFG linkage to Qr values was assessed by general linear models (GLM). "Moderate" water quality was found in S1 the whole year, in all sampling stations during the winter, and in summer-autumn in S2. "Regular" water quality was found in S3 during the summer-autumn, and S2-S3 during the spring. S1 and S2 showed eutrophic, standing, or mix waters whereas S3 had high organic matter content and eutrophic conditions. Despite some RFG (X-1 and MP) being linked to high Qr values and some other (M, S1 and Z) to low, their dominance did not influence water quality estimation performed by the Qr. We conclude that the Qr index was useful for assessing the water quality. Though RFG were valuable for inferring eutrophication, organic pollution, and mixing, but their dominance does not necessarily have a direct effect on the final Qr estimation.					; Frau, Diego/V-2613-2019	Frau, Diego/0000-0002-7000-8863; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				NOV	2019	191	11							681	10.1007/s10661-019-7849-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-019-7849-6								31656998					WOS:000500792600001

They sustain subsistence fishing during the upstream migration. However, during the winter, local Inuit fishers have been unsuccessful in catching Arctic char in this lake, but catches do resume in late spring. The Kangirsuk hunters and fishers' association, Uumajulirijikkut Kangirsumi, initiated a telemetry study to assess (1) if the Arctic char were overwintering in the lake and (2) if the fish behavior during winter and spring was linked to environmental characteristics (temperature, oxygen, or ice). Eight Arctic char were tagged with acoustic transmitters during their upstream migration, and passive receivers were deployed throughout the lake continuously for 2 years. Five of the tagged fish overwintered in the lake, where they remained inactive for approximately 8 months. The difficulty of catching them in winter is likely due to their low activity level combined with the large areas of littoral zones (selected habitat) in this lake. A significant increase in the activity level of the tagged Arctic char occurred simultaneously with the onset of snowmelt runoff until the complete mixing of the lake. Char left the lake at peak discharge, coinciding with the ice breakup at the lake outlet. The results of this collaborative research, led by the community with locally grounded questions, align with and complement the observations of fishers. Despite the limited number of tagged fish due to community concerns about animal well-being, the results illustrate different migration patterns within this population and shed light on the environmental triggers that lead to the resumption of char activity in spring.

This study aims to investigate the dietary composition of Mongolian saiga, and livestock, and assess their seasonal dietary overlap. Microhistological analysis was conducted on feces samples from Mongolian saiga (n = 124) and livestock (n = 476) collected in spring, summer, autumn, and winter of 2023-2024. Saiga diets comprised 48 plant species from 21 genera, while livestock diets varied by species: goats consumed 37 species from 18 genera, sheep 36 from 18, camels 28 from 13, and horses 23 from 11. Saiga exhibited mixed feeding habits (25-75% grasses), whereas sheep, goats, and camels were primarily browsers (< 25% grasses), and horses were grazers (> 75% grasses). The saiga's diet showed greater species richness, dietary diversity, and niche breadth compared to livestock, likely due to their free-ranging behavior, while livestock diets are managed by herders. Among ruminants (saiga, sheep, and goats), dietary overlap was greater than with pseudo and non-ruminants (camels and horses), reflecting similarities in digestive systems. Overlap between saiga and livestock was highest in spring and autumn, aligning with herders' seasonal movement patterns. The saiga's adaptive ability to utilize a diverse range of plant resources, which helps in reducing dietary overlap and competition with livestock, provides critical insights for conserving this endangered population as less likely to compete with livestock on diet.

J	CHENEY, C; HOUGH, RA				CHENEY, C; HOUGH, RA			FACTORS CONTROLLING PHOTOSYNTHETIC PRODUCTIVITY IN A POPULATION OF CLADOPHORA-FRACTA (CHLOROPHYTA)	ECOLOGY												C. fracta is the dominant filamentous alga in the littoral zone of Shoe Lake, Oakland County, Michigan [USA]. Seasonal and diurnal in situ productivity studies were combined with perturbations of several environmental parameters conducted in situ and in the laboratory to determine the factors that control primary productivity in this population. In situ net photosynthetic C fixation ranged from 0.26 to 5.39 mg .cntdot. g-1 .cntdot. h-1, with seasonal maxima in spring and fall and diurnal patterns generally, but not always, correlating with daily insolation patterns. P and N were above limiting concentrations throughout the year and C. fracta was unresponsive to experimental P and N enrichments. The seasonal productivity correlated most strongly with total alkalinity (inorganic C content) and pH, and experimental enrichment of inorganic C stimulated photosynthesis during the summer. C. fracta was characterized in the laboratory as basically a C3 plant on the basis of very low levels of C4 acids in early 14C photosynthetic products and light saturation of photosynthesis below 30 klx. In situ experiments showed oxygen inhibition of photo-synthesis, but photorespiration was not directly demonstrable by evaluation of 14CO2 release, and the CO2 compensation point was low. Release of organic photosynthate was stimulated by high oxygen, but the effect was maximal during spring and fall growth peaks rather than in the summer. Optimal photoperiod was experimentally determined to be relatively short (8 h), which correlated with the fall and spring maxima in productivity and C availability. Temperature in situ was below the experimentally determined optimum for photosynthesis in both spring and summer, and was associated with daily patterns of photosynthesis more closely than with the seasonal pattern. Epiphytic flora on C. fracta reduced organic C release to a small extent and contributed to a slight enhancement of community productivity. The productivity of C. fracta during the ice-free growing season in Shoe Lake appears to be limited principally by inorganic C and by oxygen inhibition of photosynthesis. C. fracta competes significantly on the basis of rapid growth capability early in the season coincident with maximal C availability and later possibly by minimization of photorespiration.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1983	64	1					68	77		10.2307/1937330	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1937330													WOS:A1983QA56800009

Lake Zabinskie, a eutrophic hardwater lake located in northeastern Poland (Masurian Lake District), provides a unique environment for the investigation of processes that lead to varve formation. During a two-year observation period we investigated limnological and hydrochemical conditions within the water column, recent sediment fluxes and laminations preserved in the sediments of this lake to understand the relationship between the lake water properties and the sediment formation processes. We demonstrate that dimictic to meromictic mixing patterns may occur in Lake Zabinskie, depending on the meteorological conditions. Regardless of the water mixing pattern, the lake was stratified during much of the year which led to significant differences between surface and near-bottom water environments. The hypolimnion was characterized by higher conductivity and anoxic conditions with only short periods of available oxygen, which created conditions ideal for the formation and preservation of biogenic varves in Lake Zabinskie. The material collected from the sediment trap revealed notable changes in sediment fluxes with characteristic spring maxima and, optionally, a second late fall maxima. Considerable variability was also observed for the fluxes of total organic carbon, biogenic silica and calcite. Microscopic investigation of the topmost sediments revealed a complex structure of the varves showing a distinct spring calcite lamina followed by several fine calcite laminae interbedded with diatom-rich laminae and, finally, by an organic-rich lamina with minerogenic admixtures deposited during winter. This seasonal variability was also reflected in the chemical composition inferred from high-resolution XRF measurements which allowed for the recognition of individual seasons within one varve. A characteristic annual succession of elemental composition followed a distinct pattern: spring was marked with a silica peak followed by a major calcium peak; during summer and fall minor calcium peaks occurred as well as maxima in iron and sulphur; winter was characterized by a peak in potassium. This study shows the potential that the sediment record from Lake Zabinskie has as high-resolution paleoenvironmental archive.

DISTRIBUTION OF MIGRATORY LANDBIRDS ALONG THE NORTHERN LAKE HURON SHORELINE	WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												The distribution of landbirds during migration in forested landscapes of eastern North America is poorly known. We describe (1) the distribution of landbirds in northern white cedar (Thuja occidentalis) dominated forests as a function of distance from northern Lake Huron in Michigan during spring and autumn migration, and (2) discuss factors that may affect the distribution of these migrants. Both long- and short-distance migrants in spring and fall were concentrated within 0.4 km of the Lake Huron shoreline. This pattern was particularly pronounced during spring when aquatic-hatched insects such as midges and their predators (e.g., spiders) are most common and occur in largest numbers near the shoreline. Both long- and short-distance migrant abundance was associated with midge abundance, after controlling for date, during spring migration but not during fall migration. Migrants may concentrate near the shoreline because of the barrier effect of Lake Huron and relatively abundant food resources, especially during spring migration. Terrestrial habitats adjacent to bodies of water, where aquatic-dependent invertebrates are relatively abundant may provide important stopover sites for landbird migrants. Our results suggest coastal areas within the Great Lakes region provide critical stopover habitat for landbird migrants and should be a focus of conservation efforts, especially given the increasing development pressure that threatens these areas.

In this study, we investigated burrow temperatures of platypuses (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) living at a sub-alpine Tasmanian lake. Nine individual platypuses were equipped with time-depth recorders with integrated temperature sensors measuring ambient temperature. Burrow temperatures were recorded in two minute intervals for a total of 61 resting periods (duration: 5.45 to 27.20 hours) and were averaged over the period of resting. Mean burrow temperatures were 17.5 and 14.2degreesC (SD=2.76 and 0.89, respectively, n=9) in summer and winter, respectively, and ranged between 12.2 and 22.8degreesC for individual resting periods. In winter, burrow temperatures were held fairly constant over the resting period while in summer larger variations were observed. Burrow temperature in winter was found to be up to 18degreesC higher than outside air temperature.																			0370-047X					FEB 20	2004	125						273	276																WOS:000222698900023

Reproductive strategies of Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus (L.) forms in Kiryalta lakes, Transbaikalia, Russia	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The divergence of reproductive strategies is an important development toward intraspecific diversification. We describe contrasting spawning patterns of parapatric and sympatric Arctic charr forms in two interconnected lakes Kiryalta-3 and Kiryalta-4 in Transbaikalia for comparison to charr reproduction in nine more lakes of this region. In each Kiryalta lake, two charr forms (small and large) differing in growth and diet are present, in Kiryalta-3 they are morphologically more distinct than in Kiryalta-4. In Kiryalta-3, the spawning of the small form was recorded in autumn and spring suggesting two subpopulations; spawning time of the large form is unknown. In Kiryalta-4, both forms spawn in autumn. Overall, reproductive patterns of Transbaikalian charr vary greatly in spawning time, duration, location, depth, and bottom substrate. Different populations and sympatric forms spawn in early or late autumn, spring, summer, or during more than one season, including the littoral or profundal zone, over rocks or silt, and from 1-2 weeks to at least 7 months. Peak spawning time difference between sympatric forms can reach up to 5 months, and is correlated with morphological and genetic differences. Diversification of reproductive strategies largely contributed to the emergence of exceptionally high diversity of Transbaikalian charr.

Forty years later a draw down of groundwater table and peat soils degradation resulted in damage to agricultural crops and increase of nutrient fluxes to the down stream located Lake Kinneret. A reclamation project was implemented, including the construction of the new Lake Agmon wetlands. Agmon is utilised for drainage water removal and for eco-tourism. The ecology of Lake Agmon has been studied since 1994. Submerged macrophytes, started to grow in the lake during spring-summer and die-back in the fall. The maximal phosphorus stock in macrophytes tissues is similar to the phosphorus load in the lake water in fall when submerged vegetation decomposes. Most of the phosphorus load in the water during summer-fall is plant mediated phosphorus which is transferred from the sediments to the water by plants through uptake and incorporation during the onset of growth and released during die-back and decomposition. Summer phosphorus removal is crucial for Lake Kinnneret water quality protection, especially aimed at prevention of cyanobacteria blooms in summer. Macrophyte harvesting may reduce phosphorus stocks in lake Agmon serving as a manageable tool to improve water quality.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV 15	2003	506	1-3					803	809		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008602.77264.8c	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008602.77264.8c													WOS:000188455600104

Fishing activities were carried out using fishing gear with three spinner colours (yellow, blue or red), three hook sizes (No. 2: 2 cm; No. 3: 3 cm; or No. 4: 4 cm) and in different seasons (spring, summer, autumn or winter) by three anglers. At the end of the study, 336 rainbow trout, 13.2-56.5 cm in length and 28.6-2,174.6 g in weight, were caught. The most efficient season for catching fish was in the winter. The mean catch per unit effort (CPUE) values for red, blue and yellow coloured spinners were 0.108, 0.051 and 0.036, respectively. The mean CPUE values for No. 2, No. 3 and No. 4 hooks were 0.049, 0.088 and 0.066, respectively. The mean yield per unit effort (YPUE) for No. 2, No. 3 and No. 4 hooks were 9.88, 24.13 and 19.78, respectively (p < 0.05). In conclusion, we recommend using No. 3-sized hooks in the winter season for maximum fishing efficiency of rainbow trout in Karakaya Dam Lake.

Stable isotopic fingerprint of a hyporheic-hypolentic boundary in a reservoir	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Stable isotopes of H2O are used to de. ne the hyporheic-hypolentic boundary in Ledbetter Creek as it discharges to Kentucky Lake, a constructed reservoir in western Kentucky, USA. High-resolution (centimeter-scale) sample collection and analysis were utilized to determine one-dimensional variations in delta H-2 and delta O-18 of H2O and chloride (Cl-) across the boundary. During reservoir low stand in winter, the hyporheic-hypolentic zone contains water from Ledbetter Creek and groundwater separated by an interface at similar to 10 cm below the channel bottom. Following reservoir-stage increase in spring and summer, water from Kentucky Lake infiltrates into the hyporheic-hypolentic zone to a depth of at least 18 cm below the channel bottom. Reservoir-stage decline in autumn causes source-water mixing, largely obscuring the hyporheic-hypolentic boundary. Stable isotopes provide an effective complement to conventional tracers for delineation of water masses within the hyporheic-hypolentic zone.

A total of 52 species were recorded, of which one species was a resident, 34 were winter visitors, and 17 were passage migrants. Species richness was highest in November. Passage migrants mainly occurred in October, November, and April, and they stayed longer at the lake during their autumn migration than during the spring migration. The seasonal distribution pattern of total numbers of all waterbirds was bimodal. One peak occurred between late December and early January, and the other in middle March. The seasonal distribution patterns of 15 common species have been classified a. bimodal, unimodal, or irregular. The numbers of five common species were variable in middle winter, and their numerical Change in contiguous weeks were more than 30%, suggesting that local movements might be frequent.

Phytoplankton chlorophyll a content was also determined. Eighty-seven fungal species, including 71 fungus-like organisms (Straminipila) and 16 species of true fungi were identified. Most species were found in the river Narew upstream of the reservoir, the fewest inside it. The latter finding can be correlated with cyanobacterial blooming recurring every year. The greatest number of species developed in the spring months, the smallest in the summer period. The surface layer of the reservoir was poorer in species than its deeper layers. Moreover, 6 rare species were detected, including Aphanodictyon apiculatum which is recorded for Poland for the first time.

Monthly average of phytoplankton density was 2.3 +/- 1.1 center dot 10(3) cells/ml, with a biovolume 0.6 +/- 0.6 mm(3)/l in which no seasonality was found in the abundance. A seasonal pattern was observed in the taxonomic composition: in spring and summer the centric diatom Cyclotella distinguenda reached 90% of the total biomass, whilst cryptophyceae (Cryptomonas spp. and Plagioselmis nannoplanctica) and crysophyceae (Chromulina sp. and Mallomonas spp.) were the dominant populations in autumn and winter. Richness per sample ranged between 16 and 25 taxa and this richness was not related to the nutrient availability. Diversity was constant and low (0.5 bits/cell) due to the presence of dominant species. The average gross production, meassured at 0.5 and 3 m of depth in June 2013, ranged 0.008 - 0.029 mg O-2/l h; and the respiration of the entire plankton community ranged 0.002 - 0.012 mg O-2/l h. The average density of zooplankton community was 59 +/- 98 individuals/l, and the biomass value was 2.9 +/- 4.1 mu g DW (dry weight)/l. The zooplankton abundance was seasonal, with higher values in autumn and winter. The copepod Cyclops abyssorum was the dominant population in autumn and spring, during the mixing cycle of the lake. During the stratification period, Rotifera was the dominant group. 25 taxa of zooplankton were determined with a diversity ranging 0.21-1.46 bits/ind dependent of the evenness, which covaried with the phytoplankton availability. Dynamics of phytoplankton and zooplankton were outdated, showing its own pattern of predator-prey. A canonical correspondence analysis related plankton populations with the environment (69% of the variance explained by the 3 first axis). The first axis segregated a community related to high temperatures and nitrogen concentration against a community less abundant in a cold and transparent lake. Regarding the littoral microzoobenthos, 29 species were described (13 cladocera and 16 copepoda, some of them to be very rare); with higher richness and diversity during spring. Spatially, the lake littoral area was strongly heterogeneous on microcrustaceans richness and diversity, including in adjacent locations, and it must be highlighted the elevated value of these littoral wetlands as a important reservoir of exclusive species. Finally, Laguna de Somolinos appears to be more diverse than similar lakes in the Iberian Peninsula, with a high species turnover rate throughout the year.																					978-84-00-10443-6; 978-84-00-10442-9				2018	46						135	158																WOS:000637015500009

Chlorophyll a and phytoplankton production data indicated phosphorus (P) limitation in spring, nitrogen (N) and P co-limitation in summer, and no N or P limitation in autumn. Heterotrophic bacterial abundance, dissolved organic carbon levels, and plankton respiration were not stimulated by nutrient enrichment. Autotrophic biomass and production, but not heterotrophic biomass or respiration, were seasonally stimulated by the availability of P and/or N. Such imbalance between autotrophic and heterotrophic processes may contribute to the accumulation of phytoplankton biomass during the growing season. Cyanobacterial abundance in the lake increased from 22% of the plankton biomass in the spring when the TN:TP ratio was high to 68% in the autumn when the TN:TP ratio was low, suggesting that P availability helps drive a seasonal succession towards cyanobacterial dominance.

J	Wang, XL; Wan, H; Swail, VR				Wang, XL; Wan, H; Swail, VR			Observed changes in cyclone activity in Canada and their relationships to major circulation regimes	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												This study assessed the climate and trend of cyclone activity in Canada using mainly the occurrence frequency of cyclone deepening events and deepening rates, which were derived from hourly mean sea level pressure data observed at 83 Canadian stations for up to 50 years (1953-2002). Trends in the frequency of cyclone activity were estimated by logistic regression analysis, and trends of seasonal extreme cyclone intensity, by linear regression analysis. The results of trend analysis show that, among the four seasons, winter cyclone activity has shown the most significant trends. It has become significantly more frequent, more durable, and stronger in the lower Canadian Arctic, but less frequent and weaker in the south, especially along the southeast and southwest coasts. Winter cyclone deepening rates have increased in the zone around 60 degrees N but decreased in the Great Lakes area and southern Prairies-British Columbia. However, extreme winter cyclone activity seems to have experienced a weaker increase in northwest-central Canada but a stronger decline in the Great Lakes area and in southern Prairies. The results also show more frequent summer cyclone activity with slower deepening rates on the cast coast, as well as less frequent cyclone activity with faster deepening rates in the Great Lakes area in autumn. Cyclone activity in Canada was found to be closely related to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Overall, cyclone activity in Canada is most closely related to the NAO. The simultaneous NAO index explains about 44% (41%) of the winter (autumn) cyclone activity variance in the east coast, 31% of winter cyclone activity variance in the 60 degrees-70 degrees N zone, and 17% of autumn cyclone activity variance in the Great Lakes area. Also, in several regions (e.g., the east coast, the southwest, and the 60 degrees-70 degrees N zone) up to 15% of the seasonal cyclone activity variance can be explained by the NAO/PDO/ENSO index one-three seasons earlier, which is useful for seasonal forecasting.																			0894-8755	1520-0442				MAR 15	2006	19	6					896	915		10.1175/JCLI3664.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI3664.1													WOS:000236765500002

FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												In this study concentrations of heavy metals, such as, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Ph and Zn were determined in water, sediment. sago pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus L.) and muscle, liver and gill of freshwater fish (Capoeta capoeta umbla) collected seasonally from three selected sites of Hazar Lake. The heavy metal concentrations obtained from water samples were low. Among the metals, the highest concentrations in water samples were found for Fe. In the sediment samples, the highest concentration was recorded for Mn and the lowest for Pb in all seasons and sites. The metal concentrations determined in sago pondweed varied seasonally. The highest levels of Fe. Mn and Zri values in sago pondweed were in spring. Heavy metal concentrations varied significantly depending on the type of the tissue and season. The highest metal concentrations were found in liver, followed by gill and muscle. Heavy metal levels in tissues of freshwater fish C c. umbla were increased in summer and winter, while were decreased in autumn and spring. The present study shows that precautions need to be taken in Hazar Lake in order to prevent heavy metal pollution that can occur in the future.																			1018-4619	1610-2304					2009	18	4					511	518																WOS:000266029000019

Most records had a sample resolution between approximately 150 and 300 yr. Based on characteristics of past and modern diatom responses to possible climate variables, we interpreted changes in Stephanodiscus suzukii flux (SVF) to reflect changes in phosphorus levels, which reflect, in turn, summer precipitation levels; changes in Aulacoseiva nipponica flux (AVF) reflect winter vertical lake-water mixing induced by winter temperatures and snowfall levels. Thus, changes in total planktonic diatom flux reflect a combination of summer precipitation, winter temperature, and snowfall values. During the 140-101 ka interval, changes in S. suzukii productivity at a millennial timescale may correspond to changes in summer rainfall in central Japan. The disappearance of A. nipponica during the same period could indicate weaker vertical mixing, possibly caused by increased temperatures and decreased snowfall levels in winter. During the 101-70 ka interval, the AVF record shows levels near or above those observed in present times, indicating that winter water temperatures fell within the optimal range for A. nipponica to prosper. Generally low AVF values during the 70-7 ka interval indicate weak winter vertical mixing and cold winters. The many intervals with low PVF values during the same period suggest decreased summer precipitation levels. Between 7 and 0 ka, PVF, SVF, and AVF records show levels near or above those of the present, suggesting winter temperatures favorable for A. nipponica growth, and snowfall and summer precipitation levels probably similar to or above those currently recorded.					; Kuwae, Michinobu/AAG-3846-2020; Tsugeki, Narumi/AAV-2862-2021	Kuwae, Michinobu/0000-0002-7747-5421; Tsugeki, Narumi/0000-0003-1236-906X; 													0921-2728					JUL	2004	32	1					19	39		10.1023/B:JOPL.0000025284.96452.26	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:JOPL.0000025284.96452.26													WOS:000220995200002

This study shows how a stock-recruitment model can be used to assess the effects of drought on fish survival, using data from a long-term study of a sea-trout population. Droughts were severest in the summers of 1976, 1983, 1984 (also severe spring drought) and 1995, and less severe in summer, but followed by autumn droughts in 1969, 1989 and 1993. 2. The Ricker curvilinear model significantly fit (P < 0.01) the relationship between initial egg density and survivor density for: parr aged 0+ years sampled in late May or early June, and late August or early September; parr aged 1+ years sampled in late May or early June, and late August or early September; spawning females and their total egg production. These analyses provided strong evidence for density-dependent population regulation and also identified extreme outliers, all these being for year-classes affected by the summer droughts. 3. The variable effects of the seven summer droughts were quantified by expressing the difference between each pair of observed and expected values as a percentage (with 95% CL) of the expected value predicted from the Ricker model. The 1969 drought continued with an autumn drought and reduced the density of 1 + parr (1968 year-class), but had no long-term effects on female or egg densities. The 1983, 1984 (plus spring drought) and 1989 droughts reduced 0+ (1983, 1984 and 1989 year-classes) and 1+ (1982, 1983 and 1988 year-classes) parr densities, and led to low densities of returning females and their eggs from the 1982, 1983, 1988 and 1989 year-classes. The 1976 summer drought, and 1993 summer and autumn droughts had little effect on parr densities, but in the long term produced low densities of returning females and their eggs from the 1975 and 1992 year-classes. The 1995 drought reduced 0+ (1995 year-class) and 1+ (1994 year-class) parr densities, but its long-term effects cannot be evaluated until more data are available. 4. Reduced densities of returning females and their eggs were associated with 1+ parr being subjected to droughts; possible reasons for-this are discussed, including growth retardation.

A consequence of chlorination is the formation of trihalomethanes (THM). The aim of this investigation was to determine their levels in the Athens water supply system over a period of time. The sources for this system are the lakes Marathon and Iliki and a number of boreholes. Because of the high bromide concentration, bromoform is the dominant THM formed. Samples from different points of the Galatsi Treatment Plant (GTP) and the distribution network of Athens were taken and analysed for THMs. It was shown that the THM concentrations were lower in the spring and winter than in the summer and autumn. All THM levels measured were lower than the EPA standard. It was also shown that when the water supply from the boreholes was stopped, the concentration of the brominated halomethanes decreased. Bearing in mind that the boreholes were the main source of bromide ions, this behavior was expected.

MERCURY IN ABIOTIC MATRICES OF CLEAR LAKE, CALIFORNIA: HUMAN HEALTH AND ECOTOXICOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Mercury (Hg) from Hg mining at Clear Lake, California, USA, has contaminated water and sediments for over 130 years and has the potential to affect human and environmental health. With total mercury (TotHg) concentrations up to 438 mg/kg (dry mass) in surficial sediments and up to 399 ng/L in lake water, Clear Lake is one of the most Hg-contaminated lakes worldwide. Particulate Hg in surface water near the mine ranges from 10 000 to 64 000 ng/g; TotHg declines exponentially with distance from the Sulphur Bank Mercury Mine. From 1992 to 1998, no significant long-term trends for TotHg or methylmercury (MeHg) in sediments or water were observed, but peaks of both TotHg and MeHg occurred following a 1995 flooding event. Sediments and water exhibit summer/fall maxima and winter/spring minima for MeHg, but not TotHg. Sediment TotHg has not declined significantly a decade after remediation in 1992. At the mine site, aqueous TotHg reached 374 000 ng/L in unfiltered groundwater. Pore water sulfate in sediments varies seasonally from 112 mg/L in summer/fall (when Hg methylation is highest) to 3300 mg/L in winter. While TotHg is exceptionally high in both sediments and water, MeHg is substantially lower than would be expected based on the bulk Hg loading to the lake and in comparison with other sites worldwide. Total mercury in Clear Lake water does not exceed the Safe Drinking Water Act criteria, but it sometimes greatly exceeds human health criteria established by the Great Lakes Initiative, U. S. Environmental Protection Agency water quality guidelines, and the California Toxics Rule criterion. Methylmercury concentrations exceed the Great Lakes Initiative criterion for MeHg in water at some sites only during summer/fall. Relative to ecological health, Clear Lake sediments greatly exceed the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's benthic fauna Sediment Quality Guidelines for toxic effects, as well as the more concensus-based Threshold Effects Concentration criteria. Based on these criteria, Hg-contaminated sediments and water from Clear Lake are predicted to have some lethal and sublethal effects on specific resident aquatic species. However, based on unique physical and chemical characteristics of the Clear Lake environment, MeHg toxicity may be significantly less than anticipated from the large inorganic Hg loading.					; Eagles-Smith, Collin/T-8580-2019	Eagles-Smith, Collin/0000-0003-1329-5285; 													1051-0761					DEC	2008	18	8			SI		A128	A157		10.1890/06-1477.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/06-1477.1								19475922					WOS:000262606500009
J	HALSEY, TG				HALSEY, TG			AUTUMNAL AND OVER-WINTER LIMNOLOGY OF 3 SMALL EUTROPHIC LAKES WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO EXPERIMENTAL CIRCULATION AND TROUT MORTALITY	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												The autumnal and over-winter limnological characteristics of 2 small eutrophic lakes differed considerably from those of a 3rd eutrophic lake; all were close to each other in the southwest interior of British Columbia. Thermal and chemical stratification was well defined in Marquette and Corbett lakes because local topography provided protection from wind action; stratification in the more exposed Courtney Lake was ill defined. Average wind velocities during summer and autumn on Courtney Lake were 4.3 times as great as, and more unidirectional than, those on Corbett Lake and probably Marquette. Complete natural autumnal oxygenation and circulation in Courtney Lake provided comparatively high concentrations of dissolved O2 which permitted the over-winter survival of Salmo gairdneri and Richardsonium balteatus. Although Marquette and Corbett lakes were isothermal in the late autumn, O2 concentrations were well below saturation levels and circulation was probably incomplete. Consequently O2 depletion during winter was severe and S. gairdneriand Salvelinus fontinalis were subject to over-winter mortality. Experimental circulation of Corbett Lake, just prior to ice cover, confirmed the hypothesis that incomplete autumnal oxygenation is a cause of "winter kill" of fishes. Artificial autumnal circulation of the lake provided an O2 concentration sufficient to prevent over-winter fish mortality. However, over-winter mortality of the entire fish population did occur in the control lake, Marquette (incomplete autumnal oxygenation) but not in Courtney Lake (complete autumnal oxygenation).																									1968	25	1					81	+		10.1139/f68-007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f68-007													WOS:A1968A451800007
J	Clarke, LR; Bennett, DH				Clarke, LR; Bennett, DH			Seasonal zooplankton abundance and size fluctuations across spatial scales in Lake Pend Oreille, Idaho	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												We studied seasonal zooplankton community dynamics along spatial scales in Lake Pend Oreille, Idaho in 1997-1998 to determine if zooplankton community changes brought about by establishment of Mysis relicta in the 1970's persist-today, and to relate zooplankton length and abundance fluctuations to zooplanktivory. Long-term trends in zooplankton species composition and relative abundance, as well as seasonal patterns of species succession are apparently unchanged since M. relicta establishment. Cladoceran zooplankters became abundant earlier in the spring and remained abundant later into autumn in 1998 than in 1997. Fluctuations in zooplankton lengths and abundance were more pronounced along horizontal gradients extending from littoral to pelagic zones than along-vertical gradients extending downward from the surface, and these fluctuations were more pronounced in 1998 than in 1997. Zooplankton length variability along spatial scales occurred most often in late spring/early summer, and in autumn. The trends we observed are consistent with prior speculation that zooplanktivory by M. relicta structures the Lake Pend Oreille zooplankton community, although abiotic factors may also explain our results.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				JUN	2003	18	2					277	290		10.1080/02705060.2003.9664494	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2003.9664494													WOS:000182685800012

This study was conducted to obtain information on spatial-temporal distribution and major sources of pollutants in an urban lake (Yushan Lake, Ma'anshan City, China). The integrated multivariate statistical approaches, including Pearson correlation analysis, cluster analysis (CA) and principal component analysis (PCA) were utilized to analyze the lake water quality in spring, summer, autumn and winter during 2019. CA revealed the spatial and seasonal variation of lake water quality as well as the correlated parameters. PCA provided the pollution sources via figuring out the predominant factors explaining over 70% of the total variation of the variables. Based on the result of the present study, those sites with significant water pollution as well as the corresponding parameters were identified. Subsequently, the strategy, against specific pollution source was offered to improve the lake water quality.																			1944-3994	1944-3986				NOV	2021	239						137	149		10.5004/dwt.2021.27715	http://dx.doi.org/10.5004/dwt.2021.27715													WOS:000738808400013
J	TRESSLER, WL; AUSTIN, TS; ORBAN, E				TRESSLER, WL; AUSTIN, TS; ORBAN, E			SEASONAL VARIATION OF SOME LIMNOLOGICAL FACTORS IN IRONDEQUOIT BAY, NEW-YORK	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												A limnological investigation of Irondequoit Bay, a closed-in area of Lake Ontario near Rochester, N. Y., was made between Aug. 15, 1939 and June 13, 1940. No O2 was present during the summer in the deepest part of the lake (20 m.) below 10 m. depth. O2 again became scarce during the winter in the bottom regions, a phenomenon which together with other factors showed extreme eutrophy. Free CO2 was present in extremely high concns. at the stagnation periods in early fall and late winter. Mean alkalinity was correlated with conductivity; very marked increases toward the bottom in alkalinity were observed in Aug. and March. Mean organic P showed a definite correlation with mean organic matter. Specific conductivity was unusually high (600 units). Macroplankton was very abundant during the year except during a short period in Jan. and Feb. Microplankton was very abundant during the sum-mer and spring but became very scarce during the winter months. Particulate organic matter followed the plankton counts very closely and varied inversely with the transparency. Winter stagnation in Irondequoit Bay is believed to result from pollu-tion entering by way of Irondequoit Creek and from large quantities of decomposing material on the bottom. Pollution in Irondequoit Bay is not believed to be serious enough to do more than increase plankton growth. Stagnation conditions would probably be improved if a fairly deep channel were to be cut from the Bay to Lake Ontario.																			0003-0031	1938-4238					1953	49	3					878	903		10.2307/2485215	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2485215													WOS:A1953YC95400015

The antiphase variation in TBSA, accounting for 44% of the total years, has a dipole structure in autumn, which prolonged into the following winter. The persistent antiphase TBSA associated diabatic forcing, disturbances and transient eddies favor a double wave train structure spanning the TP (east of Baikal) and North Atlantic from autumn to winter. Amid the wave train, the circulation anomalies over the North Atlantic extract more energy from the basic flow due to the seasonal increase in the westerly jet, which further evolves into the winter NAO pattern. Our results provide new insights into the formation and projection of winter NAO from the perspective of subtropical and extratropical Eurasia snow.					; Duan, Anmin/AAJ-5389-2020; Hu, Jun/LLM-2082-2024; Liu, Shizuo/AAE-7915-2019; Zhang, Chao/MCX-9290-2025	Hu, Jun/0000-0002-0458-5996; Zhang, Chao/0000-0001-6888-1885; Liu, Shizuo/0000-0001-8309-0731													0094-8276	1944-8007				AUG 28	2023	50	16							e2023GL104754	10.1029/2023GL104754	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023GL104754													WOS:001057745900021

In the present study, the spawning rhythms of 12 females were individually monitored from April 20 to December 30, 1987 in tanks under natural conditions. Daily spawning was observed during the period from May to late July and from late August to the end of November. No spawning was observed during late July to late August and in December. Four females which were caught and reared in a stock tank until April matured and spawned daily in the spring spawning season. However, they all died during or after the spring spawning season. Two females caught in spring spawned daily in both the spring and autumn spawning seasons. The largest number of eggs spawned from one female was 32,000/day, and the average number during both spawning seasons was 7,200/day. One of the females repeated spawning 138 times during June 13 to November 26 except during late July to late August. The onset time of spawning ranged between 1600-2000 h.																			0021-5392					OCT	1991	57	10					1865	1870																WOS:A1991HY18200009
J	Toivonen, J; Österholm, P; Fröjdö, S				Toivonen, Janne; Osterholm, Peter; Frojdo, Soren			Hydrological processes behind annual and decadal-scale variations in the water quality of runoff in Finnish catchments with acid sulfate soils	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												In this study we assess long- and short term temporal variations in the impact of acid sulfate (a.s.) soils on river water quality. We demonstrate how such variations depend on changes in hydrological conditions driven by land use, meteorological variations and potential changes in climate with important implications on mitigation strategies, water ecology and utilization of water resources. Quality of river water discharging into the Larsmo-Oja Lake in Midwestern Finland was studied by using long term water data collected during 1963-2009. Acid sulfate soils are extremely acidic soils (pH <4) that are known to discharge very large amounts of acidity and metals into recipient water courses, and this was also evident in the study area where extreme acidic events have occurred frequently. Looking at the whole study period, there was an abrupt and consistent decline in pH in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the main river (Esse River) that coincided with extensive drainage works that dropped the ground water level, enabling oxidation of sulfidic soils and transport of acidity to the rivers. Since then, there is a trend of decreasing acidic events and rising pH values, probably due to a continuous depletion of the acidic pool in the existing a.s. soils. In the short run, water quality varied greatly due to varying hydrological conditions between seasons and years. Generally, the impact from a.s. soils was highest during high runoff in autumn and spring, and therefore, neutralization of acidity in discharge water by liming would at such occasions be very demanding. The relationship between the runoff and water quality was, however, somewhat different during different seasons. As expected, dry summers (low ground water levels) were found to increase the impact from a.s. soils in the subsequent autumn, but only if runoff was high. Towards the end of the study period winters tended to become warmer with higher runoff and spring floods tended to occur earlier. Thus, events with bad water quality during the winter months have become more common and acidic spring surges occur earlier. Seen from the data in this study, it is obvious that potential changes in the future climate will have significant consequences on the impact from a.s. soils on water courses. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Patterns of Molt in Long-tailed Ducks (Clangula hyemalis) during Autumn and Winter in the Great Lakes Region, Canada	WATERBIRDS												Molt and migration can coincide in Arctic nesting waterfowl because they have little time between fledging and the severe weather that precipitates migration. Objectives were to observe how patterns in autumn and winter molt by Long-tailed Ducks (Clangula hyemalis) were influenced by nutrient reserves or seasonal life-cycle events. Molt scores and nutrient reserves were determined for birds salvaged during autumn 2011 (n = 79) and collected during winter 2002-2004 (n = 255). Differences in molt among sex-age classes and correlation between molt and nutrient reserves were determined. It was predicted that adult females and juveniles of both sexes suspended molt during autumn migration to limit energetic overlap; however, greater molt in juveniles during autumn than winter was detected. Correlation between molt and nutrient reserves were not detected. Molt was less in adult males than females and juveniles during winter, which may suggest that the effects of reproduction (females) and growth (juveniles) extended their molt into winter. Observed molt patterns are consistent with fixed cues associated with the timing of seasonal life-cycle events of this species. This could have important implications in understanding the life-cycle events of Long-tailed Ducks and provide novel explanations of seasonal molt.

The highest growth rates were achieved in the 1st mo. of life, but in comparison with other populations of G. aculeatus growth was slow during the autumn and ceased during the winter. But in spring and early summer there was a spurt in the growth rate. Laboratory studies provided regression models for the prediction of the rate of food consumption from measurements of growth. The estimates of the consumption rate indicated the effect of the growth in body size and seasonal variations during the 1st yr of life. A fish of mean length in the population consumed 3150 mg of food in a year in which it grew from 65.8 to 552.0 mg, with an overall gross growth efficiency of 15.4%. The integration of laboratory and field studies to obtain reasonable estimates of the rate of food consumption by fish throughout their 1st yr of life was illustrated.																			0022-1112	1095-8649					1982	21	1					95	105		10.1111/j.1095-8649.1982.tb02827.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1982.tb02827.x													WOS:A1982NY40200010

Samples were monthly taken using a Go-Flo sampler at 6 sites including lake center during April, 1991 to March, 1992. Dissolved nitrous oxide in the lake water samples was measured by an automatic analyzer consisting of purge and trap system and GC-ECD detector. The concentrations in surface water at lake center ranged from 9 nM to 21 nM and there was no large vertical difference. On the other hand, those at the inner-most part of Takahamairi Bay, where heavy blooming of cyanobacteria occurs every summer, ranged from 13 nM in summer to 63 nM in autumn. The variation pattern that nitrous oxide concentrations in Takahamairi Bay were high in autumn to winter and low in summer was similar to that of nitrate-nitrogen concentration. The present results show that nitrous oxide concentrations in surface lake waters at all sites in this lake were supersaturated or at least equilibrated, and suggest that nitrous oxide may be being produced in many eutrophic shallow lakes, even though anaerobic layer is not formed in summer, and that they can be one of the natural nitrous oxide emission sources.

Importance of Dense Aquatic Vegetation in Seasonal Phosphate and Particle Transport in an Agricultural Headwater Stream	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Agricultural headwater streams and ditches commonly host dense stands of aquatic vegetation that grow and decay over seasons and exert physical and biological controls on the transport of nutrients from cropland to larger rivers. This study examined changes in the transport of phosphorus (P) in an agricultural drainage ditch in the Maumee River Basin (Ohio, USA) by conducting constant rate injections of a novel tracer mixture (conservative salt [Cl as NaCl], dissolved P [KH2PO4], and a fluorescent fine particle) in spring, summer, and fall. We quantified transport behavior for solutes and particles using a traditional transient storage modeling framework consisting of mobile and immobile storage zones connected by a first-order exchange rate constant. Transient storage was greatest during the spring, when thicker vegetation caused more pooling and flow stagnation, and decreased through fall, as vegetation thinned. Soluble P uptake lengths were 8.7 times longer in fall than spring, likely due to declines in biological uptake rates with colder temperatures and immobile zone storage with thinning vegetation. Particle capture lengths also decreased by a factor of 4.3 from fall to spring. With the increasing eutrophication of Lake Erie and waterbodies around the world that lie downstream from agricultural landscapes, it is beneficial to understand nutrient transport across watersheds, including small agricultural streams. This study highlights the physical and biological roles that aquatic vegetation plays in small agricultural streams by creating seasonally variable immobile zones that slow the flow of nutrients, providing surface area for biofilms, and capturing particles that bind nutrients.

Migration Chronology of Waterfowl in the Southern High Plains of Texas	WATERBIRDS												Migration chronology was quantified for 15 waterfowl species on 58 playa wetlands in the Southern High Plains of Texas from February 2004 through April 2006. Abundance of each species was estimated on playas once every two weeks during the nonbreeding season (16 August to 30 April); presence of ice was also recorded, Dabbling ducks were most common (N=250.668) and most tended to exhibit either a bimodal migration pattern (lower abundance in winter than during fall and spring passage) or a unimodal pattern (one defined peak). Abundance of the most common dabbling ducks was skewed toward late winter and spring. Most species of diving ducks (N = 15,128) tended to exhibit irregular migration patterns. Canada Geese (both Branta canadensis and B. hutchinsii, N = 15, 347) had an abundance pattern that gradually increased, peaking in midwinter, and then decreased, which is typical for a terminal wintering area. Ice was most common on playas during the first half of December, which coincided with the lowest winter abundance in dabbling ducks. Data from this study will support management efforts focused on playa wetlands, including the development of population goals and habitat objectives that span the entire non-breeding season.																			1524-4695	1938-5390				SEP	2008	31	3					394	401		10.1675/1524-4695-31.3.394	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/1524-4695-31.3.394													WOS:000261043500011

Patterns and drivers of seasonal succession and vertical distribution in the rotifer community of Lake Ontario in 2018	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Rotifers are among the most abundant zooplankters in lakes yet are often overlooked, and limited information is available on their seasonal and spatial distribution within the Laurentian Great Lakes. Herein, we present data on the seasonal succession of the Lake Ontario rotifer community, with samples collected from April to October 2018 as part of the bi -national inter -agency Cooperative Science and Monitoring Initiative. All sites had epilimnetic samples, but several sites included meta- and hypolimnetic samples. Prior to and during stratification, rotifers were most abundant in the epilimnion and differences in community composition with depth were minor. Mean epilimnetic rotifer density peaked in August (average 330 L -1 ) when surface water temperature was highest. Seasonal succession included a spring dominated by Synchaeta to the co -dominance of Conochilus and Keratella in early summer and the eventual dominance of Keratella during late summer through fall. Model selection found temperature and Bythotrephes to be key factors influencing overall rotifer abundance as well as genera-specific abundances. The best models for specific genera varied and included Secchi depth, chlorophyll, Cercopagis , Diacyclops, and Daphnia . Rotifers reached their highest proportion of total zooplankton epilimnetic biomass in early summer at 11 %. Analysis of seasonal patterns in 2018 suggest rotifer data collected by the Great Lakes biological monitoring program in April and August represents spring and summer through fall communities but not the June community which was different from other seasons.

The observed physicochemical values were analyzed by statistical (discriminant analysis) and arithmetic (WQI) methods to ascertain sources and levels of pollution. Discriminant analysis helped to access the contribution of each physicochemical parameter in water quality in the context of sampling sites (spatial) and seasons (temporal) to discriminate pollution loading between sites and as well as seasons. Factors such as temperature, alkalinity, ammoniacal nitrogen, total phosphorous, and orthophosphorous exhibited a strong contribution in the discrimination of sampling sites, while factors such as temperature, alkalinity, hardness, BOD, nitrate nitrogen, and total phosphorous exhibited a strong contribution in the discrimination of sampling seasons. The WQI values for four sampling sites were calculated and indicated that the water at Site I was the most contaminated followed by Site IV, while Site III was the least contaminated.

Succession of phytoplankton assemblages in response to large-scale reservoir operation: a case study in a tributary of the Three Gorges Reservoir, China	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The Three Gorges Dam (TGD) has greatly altered ecological and environmental conditions within the reservoir region, but it is not known how these changes affect phytoplankton structure and dynamics. Here, a bimonthly monitoring program was implemented from 2007 to 2009 to study the impact of damming on phytoplankton assemblages in the backwater area of the Pengxi River (PBA). By application of the phytoplankton functional group (C strategists, competitive species; S strategists, stress-tolerant species; R strategists, rapid propagation species), seasonal changes in phytoplankton relative to environmental variations were evaluated using ordination analysis. Seasonal patterns of phytoplankton dynamics were detected during this study, with CS/S strategists causing algal blooms from mid-spring to early summer, CS/CR strategists often observed during flood season, and CS strategists dominant during mid-autumn. CR/R groups dominated during winter and caused algal blooms in February. Our results indicated that phytoplankton assemblages were directly related to reservoir operation effects. Generally, the TGD had a low water level during flood season, resulting in a relatively short hydraulic retention time and intensive variability, which supported the cooccurrence of CS and CR species. During the winter drought season, water storage in the TGD increased the water level and the hydraulic retention time in the PBA, enabling R/CR strategists to overcome the sedimentation effect and to out-compete S/CS species in winter. As expected, these diversity patterns were significantly correlated with the hydraulic retention time and nutrient limitation pattern in the PBA. This study provides strategic insight for evaluating the impacts of reservoir operations on phytoplankton adaptation.

J	Carlson, E; Paddock, RW; Janssen, J				Carlson, Erik; Paddock, Robert W.; Janssen, John			Seasonal offshore/inshore migration of round gobies	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Since the invasion of round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus) to Lake Michigan, they have become integrated into both nearshore and offshore food webs. Round gobies can be found in relatively shallow water (<20 m) during summer, but nearly disappear from these depths in early fall. They have been collected, occasionally, offshore in depths greater than 70 m during warm seasons. These observations and other anecdotal evidence suggest that round gobies migrate offshore during fall and return to nearshore water in spring. To study this, a remotely operated vehicle was used to conduct video transects at various depths. Sampling showed that round gobies migrated away from the shallowest (10 m) site in early October, with larger gobies moving offshore first, and were almost exclusively found deeper than 20 m by November. Round gobies remained offshore (>30 m) until mid-May, when they began the return to nearshore habitat. The cues to start offshore and return migrations were not the focus of this project, but fall offshore migrations coincided with decreasing temperatures nearshore in fall, and in spring, the offshore movement of the thermal bar.

Adult alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) and age-a coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) exhibited pronounced seasonal changes in lipid content. Adult alewives averaged 7.4% lipid, on a wet weight basis, during spring (May), 2.6% in slimmer (July), and 12.2% in fall (late September through October). Spring lipid concentration was low in age-2 coho salmon, averaging only 1.9%, then increased to 7.8% during summer and decreased to 4.5% by fall. In contrast, lipid content in adult bloater (Coregonus hoyi) was relatively constant with respect to season, ranging between 10.6% and 12.4% during the year. Lipid concentration increased with fish size for all species except rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax). Although deepwater sculpin (Myoxocephalus thompsoni) were considerably larger than slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus) (mean total length of 117 mm vs 68 mm), mean lipid content of deepwater sculpin (7.6%) was only slightly higher than that for slimy sculpin (6.6%). Comparison of lipid concentrations from this study with previous studies indicated that lipid concentration in lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) and alewives in Lake Michigan did not change significantly from 1969-1971 to 1994-1995. Lipid concentration in large (about 250 mm total length) adult bloaters near Saugatuck (along the southeastern shore of the lake) decreased from 23.3% in 1980 to 11.9% in 1986, but showed no significant change between 1986 and 1994-1995.																			0380-1330						2000	26	4					427	444		10.1016/S0380-1330(00)70706-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(00)70706-4													WOS:000166155600008

As knowledge about the European long-tailed duck's life cycle and movement ecology is limited, we investigate its year-round spatiotemporal distribution patterns. Specifically, we aimed to identify the wintering grounds, timing of migration and staging of this population via light-level geolocation. Results Of the 48 female long-tailed ducks tagged on Kolguev Island (western Russian Arctic), 19 were recaptured to obtain data. After breeding and moulting at freshwater lakes, ducks went out to sea around Kolguev Island and to marine waters ranging from the White Sea to Novaya Zemlya Archipelago for 33 +/- 10 days. After a rapid autumn migration, 18 of 19 birds spent their winter in the Baltic Sea and one bird in the White Sea, where they stayed for 212 +/- 3 days. There, they used areas known to host long-tailed ducks, but areas differed among individuals. After a rapid spring migration in mid-May, the birds spent 23 +/- 3 days at sea in coastal areas between the White Sea and Kolguev Island, before returning to their freshwater breeding habitats in June. Conclusions The Baltic Sea represents the most important wintering area for female long-tailed ducks from Kolguev Island. Important spring and autumn staging areas include the Barents Sea and the White Sea. Climate change will render these habitats more exposed to human impacts in the form of fisheries, marine traffic and oil exploitation in near future. Threats that now operate in the wintering areas may thus spread to the higher latitude staging areas and further increase the pressure on long-tailed ducks.					; Quillfeldt, Petra/A-9549-2009; Karwinkel, Thiemo/GLU-6609-2022; Pollet, Ingrid/O-5031-2019; Glazov, Petr/AAE-4780-2019; Loshchagina, Julia/P-7648-2015	Loshchagina, Julia/0000-0002-8662-0723; Quillfeldt, Petra/0000-0002-4450-8688; Glazov, Petr/0000-0003-3462-7031; Kruckenberg, Helmut/0000-0003-3840-1240; Karwinkel, Thiemo/0000-0001-6433-3013; 														1472-6785				MAY 25	2020	20	1							31	10.1186/s12898-020-00299-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12898-020-00299-2								32450835					WOS:000537115700001
J	Ji, LQ; Fan, K				Ji, Liuqing; Fan, Ke			Interannual linkage between wintertime sea-ice cover variability over the Barents Sea and springtime vegetation over Eurasia	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												The rapid loss of Arctic sea-ice could cause climate changes in the Northern Hemisphere, especially in the middle and high latitudes. In this study, the interannual linkage between winter (December-January-February) sea-ice cover over the Barents Sea (SICBS) and spring (April-May-June) vegetation greenness over Eurasia, as well as the possible mechanisms of this teleconnection are investigated. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from the advanced very high resolution radiometer is used as the proxy of vegetation greenness. During 1982-2015, the winter SICBS is significantly correlated with the spring NDVI over Eurasia (NDVIEA). The positive (negative) winter SICBS anomalies tend to increase (decrease) the spring NDVIEA. The results show that the increased winter SICBS corresponds to higher winter surface air temperature and soil temperature over most parts of Eurasia, and in turn, corresponds to less winter snow cover and less snow water equivalent. The persistent less and thinner snow cover from winter to spring over Eurasia, especially over Western and Central Siberia, tends to induce increased surface air temperature through decreased surface albedo and less snowmelt latent heat. Subsequently, the increased surface air temperature corresponding to increased SICBS contributes to higher vegetation greenness over Eurasia in spring and vice versa. The ensemble simulations from the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 further confirm the associated possible physical mechanism. Meanwhile, the variability of the SICBS shows good seasonal persistence from winter to spring. The increased spring SICBS also leads to the changes in climate conditions that are favorable for increased NDVI near Lake Baikal.					; Fan, Ke/AAJ-2315-2020; Ji, Liuqing/JDW-8730-2023	Ji, Liuqing/0000-0002-0435-256X; 													0930-7575	1432-0894				NOV	2019	53	9-10					5637	5652		10.1007/s00382-019-04884-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-019-04884-0													WOS:000493469900028

J	Enz, CA; Heller, C; Müller, R; Bürgi, HR				Enz, CA; Heller, C; Müller, R; Bürgi, HR			Investigations on fecundity of Bythotrephes longimanus in Lake Lucerne (Switzerland) and on Niche Segregation of Leptodora kindti and Bythotrephes longimanus in Swiss lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												In Lake Lucerne, Switzerland, the predaceous cladocerans Leptodora kindti and Bythotrephes longimanus segregate along spatial and temporal dimensions. In spring (April-May/June), Bythotrephes longimanus occurs below 0-20 m, while Leptodora is absent. In summer and early autumn (July-September/October), when Leptodora dominates during daytime in the 0-20 m depth, Bythotrephes longimanus also lives in deeper zones. Food competition and fish predation pressure may be the cause of differences in ecology of Leptodora and Bythotrephes acquired during evolution. Due to its transparency and tolerance of higher temperature, Leptodora could avoid fish predation and, therefore, competes with Bythotrephes longimanus successfully. In addition, the differences between the two species may account for the spatial and temporal niche segregation in oligotrophic Swiss Lakes. But spatial niche segregation is less important in mesotrophic lakes with high prey density than in oligotrophic lakes with low prey density. In small, eutrophic lakes importance of temporal niche segregation also decreases, and Bythotrephes is seldom or not present. The preference of Bythotrephes to live in deeper water to avoid fish predation during summer may be the cause of its difficulties to establish itself in small and eutrophic lakes with high prey densities, where the hypolimnion is missing or anoxic. In the spring, Bythotrephes exhibits r-strategy (smaller body size and a higher fecundity), the female is already fertile after the first molt. In the summer, a K-strategy prevails (larger body length and lower fecundity than in the spring), and female Bythotrephes are fertile only after the second molt. Shortage of prey (biomass of Bosmina and Daphnia decreased after June especially in the surface layers) and the maximum fish predation pressure in summer may change the life strategy of Bythotrephes: while fecundity decreases from generation to generation, body length increases. Enhanced prey densities (e.g. during mesotrophic conditions in L. Lucerne) lead to larger individuals in summer and autumn.																			0018-8158					NOV	2001	464	1-3					143	151		10.1023/A:1013947419138	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1013947419138													WOS:000173512200017

Improved water quality in Ohio tributaries to Lake Erie: A consequence of conservation practices	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Sediment is an important pollutant for Lake Erie and its tributaries, both as a carrier of other substances, particularly phosphorus, and as a pollutant in its own right. Environmental managers have called for major reductions in sediment and phosphorus loadings from Lake Erie tributaries. In this study, thirty-year datasets (Water Years 1975-2004) with daily resolution are analyzed to identify and interpret trends in suspended sediment and particulate phosphorus concentrations and loads in two major US tributaries to Lake Erie. The Maumee and Sandusky Rivers in agricultural northwest Ohio show continual decreases in concentrations and loads throughout this period. The greatest decreases are observed in summer and fall and under low flow conditions, whereas the smallest decreases are observed in the spring and under high flow conditions. Analysis of concentration-flow relationships indicates that these changes are not due to weather but reflect the successful use of agricultural practices to reduce erosion and prevent sediment loss. Opportunities for further reductions in suspended sediment and particulate phosphorus loads and concentrations lie in better management of sediment losses during winter and spring.																			0022-4561					MAY-JUN	2009	64	3					200	211		10.2489/jswc.64.3.200	http://dx.doi.org/10.2489/jswc.64.3.200													WOS:000267138100008

As decomposers and producers in lake ecosystems, the overlying water bacterioplankton communities play an important role in maintaining material circulation and energy flow. However, the response mechanism of their composition to eutrophication remains unclear. This research sampled the overlying water of Sancha Lake, a typical sub-deep-water lake in Southwest China, at nine different sampling sites in April (spring) and November (autumn) 2017. High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene and molecular ecological network approach are used to analyze the structure and network topology of bacterioplankton community and the response mechanism of key species to eutrophication in the overlying water of Sancha Lake. The results show that the bacterial species diversity is abundant, belonging to 55 phyla, 64 classes and 732 genera. Pseudomonadota, Actinomycetota and Bacillota are the dominant phyla, while Pseudomonas and Bacillus are the dominant genera. The relative abundance of bacterial groups in the overlying water in spring and autumn has significant seasonal differences (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). There are seasonal differences between spring and autumn in bacterioplankton community structure in the overlying water (P < 0.01). The bacterioplankton community structure is mainly influenced by phosphorus, permanganate index (CODMn), dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH. In spring and autumn, the overlying water bacterioplankton communities are mainly affected by deterministic processes and random processes, respectively. In spring and autumn, there are more positive interactions than negative interactions among bacterioplankton in the overlying water. The closeness of the overlying water bacterioplankton network is higher in spring than in autumn, and the interaction degree of the components of the overlying water bacterioplankton network is higher in autumn than in spring. The key species in the spring bacterioplankton molecular ecological network are Methylobacter, Candidatus Magnetoovum, Pseudomonas and Thiobacillus. In autumn, Methylacidimicrobium, Thiothrix and Clostridium are found. The relative abundance of key species is positively correlated with soluble reactive phosphate (SRP) content in spring, but negatively correlated with SRP content in autumn. The results of this research indicate that the bacterioplankton community in the overlying water of Sancha Lake is abundant in diversity, and its composition and structure changes are dynamic responses to the changes of eutrophication environmental factors, and the key species of bacterioplankton may play an important role in the phosphorus cycle of eutrophication.

J	Jorgensen, JC; Kitchell, JF				Jorgensen, JC; Kitchell, JF			Growth potential and host mortality of the parasitic phase of the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) in Lake Superior	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Landlocked Lake Superior sea lampreys (Petromyzon marinus) cause a significant but uncertain amount of mortality on host species. We used a sea lamprey bioenergetics model to examine the scope of host sizes vulnerable to death as a consequence of sea lamprey feeding and incorporated the bimodal lake-ward migration of parasitic sea lampreys. At their peak feeding rate and maximum size (P = 1.0, proportion of maximum consumption), spring migrants were capable of killing lean lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) hosts <= 2.0 kg, which was larger than fall migrants (1.8 kg). Spring migrants feeding on Pacific salmon (coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch), Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), and steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss)) killed hosts <= 2.0 kg, but fall migrants killed hosts as large as 2.8 kg. Although there is no direct empirical evidence, bioenergetics modeling suggests that it is plausible that some of the largest sea lampreys in Lake Superior spent more than one summer as parasites. Two-summer parasites readily attained sizes of sea-run adult anadromous sea lampreys and killed hosts from 3 to > 5.5 kg in size. The maximum upper limit number of 2-kg hosts killed by two-summer parasites was nearly twice that of one-summer parasites.

J	Wan, Y; Ruan, XH; Zhang, YP; Li, RF				Wan, Yu; Ruan, Xiaohong; Zhang, Yaping; Li, Rongfu			Illumina sequencing-based analysis of sediment bacteria community in different trophic status freshwater lakes	MICROBIOLOGYOPEN												Sediment bacterial community is the main driving force for nutrient cycling and energy transfer in aquatic ecosystem. A thorough understanding of the community's spatiotemporal variation is critical for us to understand the mechanisms of cycling and transfer. Here, we investigated the sediment bacterial community structures and their relations with environmental factors, using Lake Taihu as a model system to explore the dependence of biodiversity upon trophic level and seasonality. To combat the limitations of conventional techniques, we employed Illumina MiSeq Sequencing and LeFSe cladogram to obtain a more comprehensive view of the bacterial taxonomy and their variations of spatiotemporal distribution. The results uncovered a 1,000-fold increase in the total amount of sequences harvested and a reverse relationship between trophic level and the bacterial diversity in most seasons of a year. A total of 65 phyla, 221 classes, 436 orders, 624 families, and 864 genera were identified in the study area. Delta-proteobacteria and gamma-proteobacteria prevailed in spring/summer and winter, respectively, regardless trophic conditions; meanwhile, the two classes dominated in the eutrophication and mesotrophication lake regions, respectively, but exclusively in the Fall. For LEfSe analysis, bacterial taxon that showed the strongest seasonal or spatial variation, majority had the highest abundance in spring/summer or medium eutrophication region, respectively. Pearson's correlation analysis indicated that 5 major phyla and 18 sub-phylogenetic groups showed significant correlation with trophic status. Canonical correspondence analysis further revealed that porewater NH4+-N as well as sediment TOM and NOx-N are likely the dominant environmental factors affecting bacterial community compositions.

Macrozoobenthos of Danubian Lake Yalpug (Odessa region, Ukraine)	UKRAINIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The taxonomic composition and quantitative characteristics of the macrozoobenthos of the largest lake in Ukraine Yalpug, were studied. In 2006-2012 some 396 samples of macrozoobenthos were collected on the littoral and sublittoral of Lake Yalpug. 183 species and subspecies of Spongia, Hydrozoa, Turbellaria, Annelida, Crustacea, Insecta, Gastropoda, and Bivalvia were found. All the species were found on the littoral, while in the sublittoral - only 47 species. For the first time, we discoeverd 46 species for the lake zoobenthic fauna. Ponto-Caspian faunal complex was represented by 19 species. The littoral species number had changed from 63 species in the upper reaches to 160 in the lower reaches of the lake. In littoral habitat the number and biomass increased from winter to summer, and in the sublittoral habitat the abundance increased from winter to summer, whereas the biomass - from winter to autumn. The most abundant were oligochaetes and chironomids, the maximum biomass was registered for molluscs. During the growing season, the average abundance and biomass of macrozoobenthos in the littoral area were 2482 ind./m(2) and 117.0 g/m(2) respectively; in sublittoral area - 1600 ind./m(2) and 121.0 g/m(2) respectively.																			2520-2138						2017	7	3					160	168		10.15421/2017_65	http://dx.doi.org/10.15421/2017_65													WOS:000418742000022

This study aimed to determine the sources and sinks of SO42- in lakewater using S and O stable isotope analysis. Water samples were collected from 5 sampling points along the Sulejow Reservoir (central Poland) on 5 separate sampling campaigns (spring 2005, summer 2005, winter 2006, spring 2006 and summer 2006) applying a diel sampling strategy. Pronounced spatial, seasonal and diurnal variations were found in SO42- concentration (from 10.3 to 36.2 mg L-1) and in their S (delta S-34 from 2.1 parts per thousand to 5.4 parts per thousand) and O isotopic composition (delta O-18 from 2.8 parts per thousand to 10.6 parts per thousand). Sulphate isotopic signature has been applied to define the fluxes of SO42- by means of the isotopic mass balance and thus identify "missing" fluxes. A significant seasonal input Of SO42- from the direct catchment was found during the spring, whereas this input appeared to be fairly negligible in summer. Moreover, an additional SO42- flux from mobilisation of reduced S compounds stored in the sediments was identified, especially during periods of elongated water retention time. Pronounced diurnal variation was observed for delta O-18 (SO42-) (Up to 4 parts per thousand) in all seasons except winter, which is probably caused by dynamic biochemical red-ox reactions and intensive mixing processes of SO42- originating from different sources.

W05204	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												[1] Shasta lake, in northern California, has recently experienced reduced cold water storage, making it difficult to meet downstream temperature objectives for endangered winter-run chinook salmon spawning habitat. This study used a novel of time series analysis to examine the causes,timing,and predictability of cold water storage in Shasta Lake. This analysis detected two independent modes of variability in Shasta lake cold ater storage. The first mode, representing variability during February - July and describing 64% of the overall variability in cold water storage, was negatively correlated with both the preceding year's late summer hypolimnetic discharges and that spring's air temperatures. A second mode, representing December - January and describing an additional 24% of variability, was negatively correlated with Shasta lake fall water temperatures and winter air temperatures and positively correlated wit winter inflows. These results suggest hypolimnetic discharges, air and water temperatures, and inflows act in concert to determine cold water storage in Shasta Lake. These results also suggest water column mixing should be promoted during the cold midwinter period and thermal stratification should be promoted the remainder of the year to minimize surface warming of the entire water column.					; Brett, Michael/A-2066-2010	Brett, Michael/0000-0002-8796-9863; 													0043-1397	1944-7973				MAY 21	2004	40	5							W05204	10.1029/2003WR002669	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2003WR002669													WOS:000221614800001

Therefore, we conducted a four-season environmental survey of Xincun Lagoon from 2016 to 2017, selected 10 eutrophication-related parameters, and determined the eutrophication status of the lagoon using eutrophication index assessment. Principal component analysis identified salinity, temperature, nutrient salts (active phosphate and inorganic nitrogen), and chlorophyll a as the main factors controlling the eutrophication characteristics of Xincun Lagoon. Further analysis revealed that the degree of eutrophication outside Xincun Lagoon was lower than that within the lagoon and the degree of eutrophication along the south coast was lower than that along the north coast. Eutrophication was the highest in fall, followed by winter, spring, and summer. Nutrient inputs and other contaminants from terrestrial and marine culture represent the main causes of lagoon eutrophication.

J	Lamoureux, SF; Gilbert, R				Lamoureux, SF; Gilbert, R			A 750-yr record of autumn snowfall and temperature variability and winter storminess recorded in the varved sediments of Bear Lake, Devon Island, Arctic Canada	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												The varve record from High Arctic, proglacial Bear Lake reveals a regionally coherent hydroclimatic signal as well as complexities due to changing hydroclimatic and limnologic conditions. Varve formation is strongly dependent on underflows that exhibit variability in strength during the past 750 yr. Periods with reduced underflow sedimentation and accumulation rates fail to produce varves in the distal part of the lake. Isolated coarse silt and sand grains occur in 80% of the varves and are interpreted to be niveo-aeolian in origin. Coarse (>500 mum) sand grains deposited on the lake ice by strong winter winds are notably less common since A.D. 1850, likely due to reduced storminess. Regression of the varve thickness record with meteorological records indicates high correlations with autumn (September and October) temperatures and total monthly snowfall. These correlations are best at times when underflow activity is sufficiently strong to produce varves throughout the lake. The close association with warmer temperatures and snow-bearing synoptic systems moving north in Baffin Bay suggests that the primary climate signal in the varves is varying autumn snow pack that controls nival discharge in the following year. The similarity between the other records of melt season temperature and sea-ice cover and the Bear Lake record suggests that summer and autumn conditions were generally similar across the Baffin Bay region through much of the last millennium.

Intensive feeding activity seemed to occur from 1900 to 0500 h during early spring and from noon to well after dusk during late spring. Considerable feeding activity was noticed during most of the day in the summer. Peamouth seem to actively feed only at night in the fall.																			0047-8539						1981	15	1					120	126																WOS:A1981NK29600023

Sub-decadal- to decadal-scale climate cyclicity during the Holsteinian interglacial (MIS 11) evidenced in annually laminated sediments	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												To unravel the short-term climate variability during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 11, which represents a close analogue to the Holocene with regard to orbital boundary conditions, we performed microfacies and time series analyses on a similar to 3200-yr-long record of annually laminated Holsteinian lake sediments from Dethlingen, northern Germany. These biogenic varves comprise two sub-layers: a light sub-layer, which is controlled by spring/summer diatom blooms, and a dark sub-layer consisting mainly of amorphous organic matter and fragmented diatom frustules deposited during autumn/winter. Time series analyses were performed on the thickness of the light and dark sub-layers. Signals exceeding the 95% and 99% confidence levels occur at periods that are near-identical to those known from modern instrumental data and Holocene palaeoclimatic records. Spectral peaks at periods of 90, 25, and 10.5 yr are likely associated with the 88-, 22- and 11-yr solar cycles, respectively. This variability is mainly expressed in the light sub-layer spectra, suggesting solar influence on the palaeoproductivity of the lake. Significant signals at periods between 3 and 5 yr and at similar to 6 yr are strongest expressed in the dark sub-layer spectra and may reflect an influence of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) during autumn/winter. Our results suggest that solar forcing and ENSO/NAO-like variability influenced central European climate during MIS 11 similarly to the present interglacial, thus demonstrating the comparability of the two interglacial periods at sub-decadal to decadal timescales.

Seasonal changes in N-cycling functional genes in sediments and their influencing factors in a typical eutrophic shallow lake, China	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												N-cycling processes mediated by microorganisms are directly linked to the eutrophication of lakes and ecosystem health. Exploring the variation and influencing factors of N-cycling-related genes is of great significance for controlling the eutrophication of lakes. However, seasonal dynamics of genomic information encoding nitrogen (N) cycling in sediments of eutrophic lakes have not yet been clearly addressed. We collected sediments in the Baiyangdian (BYD) Lake in four seasons to explore the dynamic variation of N-cycling functional genes based on a shotgun metagenome sequencing approach and to reveal their key influencing factors. Our results showed that dissimilatory nitrate reduction (DNRA), assimilatory nitrate reduction (ANRA), and denitrification were the dominant N-cycling processes, and the abundance of nirS and amoC were higher than other functional genes by at least one order of magnitude. Functional genes, such as nirS, nirK and amoC, generally showed a consistent decreasing trend from the warming season (i.e., spring, summer, fall) to the cold season (i.e., winter). Furthermore, a significantly higher abundance of nitrification functional genes (e.g., amoB, amoC and hao) in spring and denitrification functional genes (e.g., nirS, norC and nosZ) in fall were observed. N-cycling processes in four seasons were influenced by different dominant environmental factors. Generally, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) or sediment organic matter (SOM), water temperature (T) and antibiotics (e.g., Norfloxacin and ofloxacin) were significantly correlated with N-cycling processes. The findings imply that sediment organic carbon and antibiotics may be potentially key factors influencing N-cycling processes in lake ecosystems, which will provide a reference for nitrogen management in eutrophic lakes.

Drivers and mechanisms of harmful algal blooms across hydrologic extremes in hypereutrophic grand lake st marys (Ohio)	HARMFUL ALGAE												Grand Lake St. Marys (GLSM) is a large, shallow, hypereutrophic lake situated in an agricultural watershed with high-nutrient, non-point source runoff. The resulting harmful algal blooms (HABs) are typically dominated by Planktothrix, which can produce microcystin, a potent cyanobacterial toxin that has varied in concentration over the past decade. Some drivers of bloom biomass and toxicity in GLSM are described, but recent years (2019-2022) have exhibited anomalous combinations of winter ice cover and spring runoff, suggesting that additional factors contribute to variability in HAB severity and toxicity. 2020 and 2022 were typical water years, with normal tributary runoff volumes occurring primarily in late winter and spring after either little to no ice cover (2019-2020) or heavy/prolonged ice cover (2021-2022). However, 2021 exhibited prolonged winter ice and low winter/spring runoff. 2020 and 2022 were typical bloom years, with near monoculture, Planktothrixdominated biomass (11 to 405 mu g/L total chlorophyll) and high total concentrations of microcystins (<0.3 to 65 <mu>g/L). However, the first half of 2021 exhibited lower biomass (18 to 65 mu g/L chlorophyll a) and toxin concentrations (0.4 to 2.0 mu g/L). While biomass returned to bloom levels when external tributary loading increased, ammonium uptake and regeneration rates and microcystin concentrations remained low throughout 2021 (in contrast to other years). Overall, potential ammonium uptake rates strongly correlated with chlorophyll and microcystin concentrations (Bayesian R2 = 0.59; 95% CI = 0.44 to 0.65). Phytoplankton diversity was higher in 2021 than other years, especially in spring/early summer, with increased dinoflagellates and diatoms in spring, followed by a mixed cyanobacterial assemblage in summer. These results suggest that lower external nutrient loads can drive immediate positive impacts on water quality, such as reduced HAB biomass and toxicity and higher phytoplankton diversity, even in hypereutrophic, shallow lakes.

Consequently, climate change has become a significant focus of the scientific community. The middle reaches of the Yangtze River Basin (MYRB) contain abundant water resources and is an area with intensive human activities; it is not only the center of social and economic development in China but also the region with the highest frequency of drought and flood disasters. This study analyzed the spatiotemporal characteristics of several climate change indicators, including temperature, precipitation, and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), in the MYRB during 1961-2017, using principal component analysis (PCA). The main results are as follows: (1) mean temperature, monthly air temperature sum, precipitation sum, maximum daily precipitation, and number of days with precipitation exceeding 30 mm were the primary variables that experienced variations in the MYRB; (2) the average temperature during spring and autumn and precipitation intensity in summer increased significantly in the MYRB, primarily in the east and the north. Increased aridity during spring, autumn, and winter was apparent in the MYRB; and (3) changes in the distribution of temperature and the intensification of drought were the principal variables that changed across the study period in the Hanjiang River Basin, while the dominant variables in Dongting Lake Basin and Yichang to Hukou Basin were precipitation regime and temperature-related indicators. The results of this study can improve our understanding of how climate change affects the MYRB, allowing the development of mitigation measures for meteorological disasters.					cai, wei/JPY-3260-2023														0177-798X	1434-4483				JAN	2023	151	1-2					449	465		10.1007/s00704-022-04283-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-022-04283-2		NOV 2022											WOS:000886852900001

Using mathematical statistical analyses, Piper diagrams, and Gibbs diagrams, this study analyzed the spatiotemporal variations of the hydrochemistry and the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of the Kashi River in Ili (Xinjiang, China) to investigate their characteristics and environmental importance. Runoff samples were collected in the mountainous area of the Kashi River from December 2017 to November 2018. Results showed that the runoff water type of the Kashi River is Ca2+-HCO3- and the spring water type is Ca2+-HCO3--SO42-. The main factors controlling the hydrochemical composition of runoff were rock weathering. Under the influence of supply sources and water conservancy facilities, the hydrochemistry and stable isotopic characteristics of the runoff showed evident spatiotemporal variation. The hydrochemical and stable isotopic values of runoff in winter and spring were lower and more consistent in comparison with those in summer and autumn. The characteristics of the spatial variations of hydrochemical and stable isotopic values in runoff differed with elevation. The supply sources in the Kashi River in different seasons were determined by analyzing the temporal variation characteristics of the hydrochemistry and stable isotopes of runoff.					; Feng, XianCheng/ODL-7018-2025	Yang, Yuhui/0000-0001-6411-6385; feng, xian cheng/0000-0002-9758-529X; 													0269-4042	1573-2983				MAR	2022	44	3					799	816		10.1007/s10653-021-00959-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-021-00959-2		JUN 2021						34061305					WOS:000656771600003

Annual and daily production rates were calculated for foliage (by species), male cones, and structural material (bark, twigs). Annual litter fall weights were typical of those measured in other boreal regions and were correlated with stand basal area. Seasonal patterns in daily production rates suggested that three classes of control factors were involved in determining litter fall rates within a stand. Random factors, such as weather, and chronic factors, such as insect or disease activity, controlled foliage and structural litter through most of the year. Predictable seasonal factors relating to plant physiological state controlled autumn foliage litter fall in deciduous and most coniferous species and production of male cone litter in early summer.																			0045-5067	1208-6037				AUG	1986	16	4					772	777		10.1139/x86-137	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x86-137													WOS:A1986D643000014
J	Sinyukovich, VN; Chernyshov, MS				Sinyukovich, V. N.; Chernyshov, M. S.			Water regime of lake Baikal under conditions of climate change and anthropogenic influence	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Based on water level data, we have studied some specifics of the water regime in Lake Baikal associated with the warming climate, which has intensified since the early 1970s. We have also addressed the overregulation of the lake after the construction of the Irkutsk Hydroelectric Power Station (IHPS). We have estimated the influence of climate on the water regime of the lake through observing the change in the surface water inflow from the watershed basin and the characteristics of runoff from the three largest Baikal rivers: the Selenga, the Upper Angara and the Barguzin. A decrease in the runoff of these rivers during the intensification of warming reduced the surface water inflow into the lake, causing a decrease in level between 1976-1981 and 2014-2017. Notably, the spring flood on the rivers during climate warming becomes shorter and is characterized by a decrease in the maximum water discharges, contributing to the slowdown of the filling of Lake Baikal during spring and summer. Contrastingly, in the winter, river runoff and the lake inflow increase with the rise in air temperature. However, this increase depends on the runoff of rivers during the previous summer and autumn. This runoff determines the formation of groundwater reserves that serve as the main source of riverine water in the winter. We have suggested the possible decrease in runoff during the years of the air temperature rise due to an increase in evaporation. Warming also contributes to the increase in evaporation from the watershed of Lake Baikal, as well as the rate of decline in its water level, which reaches 10-15 cm per month in November and December. The backwater from the dam of the IHPS has been observed in Baikal since the autumn of 1958; it has caused an increase in the lake level by an average of 0.79 m. Within the year, there was an alignment of outflow from the lake through the Angara River, and in periods with low water level, it was kept at a minimum value of 1300 m(3)/s for a long lime in order to maintain the Baikal water level. Using indirect data, we have investigated the fluctuations in water level of Lake Baikal between 1729 and 2017, which indicates its potential increase at a rate of 1 cm per 10 years. The changes in the Baikal water regime determine the restructuring of various processes inside the water body and are important for the ecosystem of the lake.																			1040-6182	1873-4553				JUL 30	2019	524				SI		93	101		10.1016/j.quaint.2019.05.023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2019.05.023													WOS:000487671100012
J	Saffel, PD				Saffel, PD			Influence of spring runoff and water temperature on hatch date and growth of age-0 largemouth bass in a Montana reservoir	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												Largemouth bass are a popular sport fish in Montana and the Northwest, however, maintaining quality angling is difficult. Montana is at the northern extent of the largemouth bass range and low water temperatures may limit recruitment by reducing the size fish attain entering the winter season. Little is known about how different flow and temperature regimes influence hatch date and growth of largemouth bass in a northern reservoir environment. Such information is important for predicting good year classes or planning population enhancement measures. Two years with disparate hydrographs and water temperature regimes were compared from a Montana reservoir. High flows and low water temperatures occurred in 1997 whereas the converse happened in 1998. Age-0 largemouth bass were sampled throughout the summer and fall of both years to estimate hatch date, growth rate, body condition, and length entering the winter season. The median hatch dates were in mid-July and 5 d earlier in 1998 than in 1997. Hatching began 12 d earlier in 1998. Spawning and hatching were controlled by spring runoff and were later than reported for lakes elsewhere in northwest Montana. Growth rate was higher in 1998 (0.76 mm/d) than 1997 (0.46 mm/d) from the date mean lengths were -50 mm to early October. Higher growth rates and longer lengths were achieved by hatching early in a year with high water temperature. Length entering into winter was greater in 1998, averaging 87 mm versus 64 turn in 1997. Body condition was similar between years. Growth of age-0 fish appeared to cease by early October of both years. Growth rate had a greater effect on length of largemouth bass entering into winter than length of growing season.																			0029-344X					WIN	2003	77	1					25	35																WOS:000181606700005

Over a period of 10 years (1987-1996). Little Gulls and Bonaparte's Gulls (Larus philadelphia) were counted as they flew over the Niagara River. Niagara-on-the-Lake. to their nocturnal roost in Lake Ontario to document the timing of migration and to monitor gull numbers. Counts generally began in October or November (range 3 October - 21 November) and continued until the fly-past ceased for winter: counting was resumed in early spring to document spring migration return dates. Altogether. 768 Little Gulls were counted and the vast majority (64.9%) of these were in the 1994/1995 (214) and 1995/1996 (285) seasons. This was not due to variation in coverage: in 1994/1995 no counts were made in the autumn season and were made only from 13 January to I May (n = 11). In the seasons for which coverage was similar there was a marginally significant increase in numbers of Little Gulls counted during the spring season, whereas there was a decrease in autumn counts. A comparison of Little Gull counts made at the Niagara River with those made at other staging areas in Ontario indicated that the Niagara River and Long Point may be the most important staging areas on the continent. Recant declines at Long Point coincide with an increase on the Niagara River. suggesting that preferred feeding areas have changed.

J	Sagarika, S; Kalra, A; Ahmad, S				Sagarika, Soumya; Kalra, Ajay; Ahmad, Sajjad			Evaluating the effect of persistence on long-term trends and analyzing step changes in streamflows of the continental United States	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Streamflow is a very good indicator of long-term hydroclimatic changes. From a water management perspective, the identification of gradual (trend) and abrupt (shift) changes in streamflow are important for planning purposes. This study investigated the detection of comprehensive change, gradual and abrupt, in 240 unimpaired streamflow stations, categorized according to the hydrologic regions in the continental United States. The changes in streamflow volume were analyzed for water-year, autumn, winter, spring, and summer from 1951 to 2010, a 60-year period. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall test, with variations accounting for short term and long-term persistence, was used to evaluate the trends; the non-parametric change-point Pettitt test was used to evaluate the shifts. The field significance was evaluated using the Walker test. The trend results indicated increasing streamflow patterns in the majority of the eastern U.S. regions - the Upper Mississippi, Missouri, Great Lakes and Texas Gulf were field significant - and dominant decreasing streamflow trends in the Pacific Northwest region. The use of different Mann-Kendall test helped in evaluating the spatial distribution of short-term and long-term persistence and their effect on trends. The Pettitt test analysis indicated that statistically significant shifts occurred during the early 1970s and late 1980s. Similar to the trend results, the Midwest as well as the central and southern U.S. had significantly increasing shifts; the Pacific Northwest, Tennessee (winter season only), and South-Atlantic Gulf (spring season only) had decreasing shifts in streamflow. The findings may assist water managers in better planning and management of water resources under climate variability and change. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Chrysophyte cyst-inferred variability of warm season lake water chemistry and climate in northern Poland: training set and downcore reconstruction	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Chrysophyte cyst assemblages from sediment trap and surface sediment samples of 50 lakes in northern Poland were related to environmental variables using multivariate numerical analyses (DCA, CCA). Water electric conductivity, total nitrogen, total phosphorous, turbidity, and cation and anion compositions (Ca2+, HCO3 (-)) accounted for significant and independent variations in the chrysophyte cyst assemblages. The first canonical axis was related to the gradient of Ca2+ while the second axis was correlated with total nitrogen. A quantitative transfer function was then developed to estimate Ca2+ (log(10) transformed) from modern chrysophyte cyst assemblages using weighted-averaging regression with classical deshrinking. The bootstrapped regression coefficient () was 0.68, with a root-mean square error of prediction of 0.143 (log(10) units). The calibration model was applied to a varved sedimentary sequence (AD 1898-2010) from Lake A >> abiA"skie, Masurian Lakeland (NE Poland). Observational data from this lake show that the Ca2+ variability in the epilimnion depends on the efficiency of Ca2+ scavenging by CaCO3 precipitation in early summer, which in turn is a function of water column stratification, temperature and the wind regime from late spring to early fall. The spring-fall wind regime drives the water column mixing.

Growth and Survival of Sea Lampreys from Metamorphosis to Spawning in Lake Huron	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Larval Sea Lampreys Petromyzon marinus live burrowed in stream bottoms and then metamorphose into their parasitic stage. Among larvae that metamorphose in a given year (i.e., parasitic cohort), autumn out-migrants (October-December) to the Laurentian Great Lakes can feed on fish for up to 6 months longer than spring out-migrants (March-May), which overwinter in streams without feeding. We evaluated whether the season of out-migration affected growth or survival of newly metamorphosed Sea Lampreys in Lake Huron. Newly metamorphosed individuals (n = 2,718) from three parasitic cohorts were netted during their out-migration from Black Mallard Creek, Michigan, to Lake Huron during autumn 1997 through spring 2000; each out-migrant was injected with a sequentially numbered coded wire tag and was released back into the creek. After up to 18 months of feeding in the Great Lakes, 224 (8.2%) Sea Lampreys were recaptured (in 1999-2001) as upstream-migrating adults in tributaries to Lakes Huron and Michigan. Recovery rates of autumn and spring out-migrants as adults were 9.4% and 7.8%, respectively, and these rates did not significantly differ. Overwinter feeding (i.e., as parasites) by autumn out-migrants did not produce adult mean sizes greater than those of spring out-migrants. Because we detected no growth or survival differences between autumn and spring out-migrants, the capture of newly metamorphosed Sea Lampreys at any point during their out-migration should provide equal reductions in damage to Great Lakes fisheries. The absence of a difference in growth or survival between autumn and spring out-migrants is an aspect of Sea Lamprey life history that yields resiliency to this invasive parasite and complicates efforts for its control in the Great Lakes.

The relationship between thermal physiology and lampricide sensitivity in larval sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus)	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The sensitivity of larval sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) to the lampricide 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol (TFM) varies with season, with highest sensitivity in spring and tolerance increasing by 2-to 3-fold in the mid-late summer. Until recently, the physiological basis for these differences was unresolved. Using previously published and unpublished findings, we illustrate how the acute toxicity of TFM (12-h LC50, 12-h LC99.9) changes with season in two populations of larval sea lamprey collected through the spring, summer and fall from Deer Creek and the Au Sable River, Michigan, U.S.A. Our findings reveal that the greater TFM tolerance of larval sea lamprey in the summer is most closely related to increases in water temperature. Although the energy reserves (glycogen, lipid) and body condition of larval sea lamprey may be lower in the spring after overwintering, these physiological indices have little impact on TFM sensitivity. We therefore conclude that water temperature, rather than energy stores or body condition, explains the greater tolerance of sea lamprey to TFM in the summer. We propose that as water temperature increases through the spring and summer, and approaches the thermal optima of larval sea lamprey, their metabolic rate and capacity to detoxify TFM increases, which slows the rate at which TFM accumulates in the body, despite concurrent increases in TFM uptake rate. We therefore recommend that water temperature be considered when planning and executing lampricide applications to mitigate temperature-induced increases in sea lamprey tolerance to TFM that could undermine sea lamprey control efforts in the Great Lakes.

Lake waters which have low concentrations of major anions and cations (total = 49 mu M) overturn every February-March, ventilating the bottom waters and enriching the surface waters with nutrients. Surface waters cool down to 6.5 degrees C by late winter and then warm steadily to 26 degrees C by late summer, while temperatures in deep waters range between 6.5 and 10.0 degrees C throughout the year. When the seasonal thermocline develops, the dissolved oxygen profiles exhibit a subsurface maximum in the thermocline, while in the hypolimnion water, the content varies seasonally from 11.5-12.0 ppm (350-375 CIM) in March to 0.5-1.7 ppm (16-56 mu M) in late autumn. Surface nitrate concentrations vary markedly with season, from < 0.15 mu M in summer to 5.7 mu M in early March, whilst the bottom water concentrations range from 13.5-14.0 mu M in late autumn to 5.7 mu M after the winter overturn. Phosphate concentrations are always less than 0.1 mu M throughout the entire water column. Subsurface chlorophyll-a maximum descends in late summer to 20-25 m depths, where the Light intensity is less than 1% of the surface value. Below 10-15 m depths, corresponding to the upper thermocline, primary productivity is very low. The range was from 35 to 93 mg C/m(2) day(-1) during 1989-1991, consistent with the values in other oligotrophic lakes.

Spatial ecology of reintroduced walleye (Sander vitreus) in Hamilton Harbour of Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Many coastal embayments in the Laurentian Great Lakes have been subjected to extensive human physical modification and pollution that has led to the loss of freshwater biodiversity. For example, Hamilton Harbour is a large coastal embayment situated at the western end of Lake Ontario, with a long history of industrial and urban development that has resulted in the loss and degradation of aquatic habitat and the extirpation of several fish species. To restore the fish community in Hamilton Harbour, several attempts have been made to increase apex predator biodiversity by reintroducing native walleye (Sander vitreus). To assess how reintroduced (i.e., stocked) walleye use Hamilton Harbour, we used acoustic telemetry to characterize the residency of individuals within the boundaries of the harbour as well as their seasonal space use, with a focused interest on the spring spawning period. During the 1 yr tracking period tagged walleye spent an average of 357 days (range 135-365 days) within the harbour. Most individuals (12/15) remained within the harbour during the entire spring spawning period, and over half of the tagged fish departed (n = 7) at the end of summer and beginning of fall. Core use areas appeared to gradually shift more easterly as the seasons progressed from winter to summer. Results from this study indicate that stocked fish are resident within Hamilton Harbour for most of the year, including the reproductive period, which suggests that stocking efforts to re-establish walleye populations may be an effective restoration strategy if recruitment is successful.

The results show that the wind direction in Dianshan Lake varies with seasons; the main wind direction is ESE in summer and autumn, and is NNW in winter and spring. Wind has great effects on the circulation patterns of the lake. In the case of no wind, the lake is mainly influenced by the upstream and downstream flows. River flow enters into the lake during flood tide, while the lake discharges during ebb tide, and there is no circulation occurred; the clockwise and counterclockwise circulations are generated respectively in the north and south of the lake under southeast wind, and similarly for northwest wind only the circulation directions are opposite. Upon different wind and flow fields, cyanobacterial boom is drifting to the windward lakeshore, and is prone to form the algae accumulation area.																			1660-9336		978-3-03785-486-0				2012	212-213						327	331		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.212-213.327	http://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.212-213.327													WOS:000316717000059

The research covers habitat use, migration patterns, and breeding behaviors, tracking 19 birds captured at breeding colonies in Poland. To capture the birds and fit transmitters, we selected representative locations: islands in dam reservoirs, gravel pits, rivers, and lakes. Mediterranean Gulls nested mainly in colonies of Black-headed Gulls (Chroicocephalus ridibundus). By tracking birds with transmitters, we identified nine additional breeding sites within Poland, the Czechia, and Germany. We determined the mean length of phenological periods: breeding (76, April 10-June 26), autumn migration (11, June 26-July 7), winter (261, July 5-March 23), and spring migration (18, March 23-April 10). According to residence sites analysis, cropland was the most frequently used habitat during breeding (52.9%), while the open sea was predominant in winter (25.8%). We identified key wintering areas: the English Channel, the Utrecht-Antwerpen area, the North Sea coast, and the Irish Sea coast. One individual wintered along the coast of Portugal and near Malaga in Spain. An interesting discovery was the longer spring migration than autumn what involved visits to multiple potential breeding sites, leading to the mapping of a network of potential breeding areas. This underscores the need for proactive habitat protection and comprehensive conservation strategies. Given the Mediterranean Gull's migratory behavior and lifecycle, the study advocates for it as a model for conserving migratory waterbirds.

Every year the study area was composed of water influenced by the Soya Warm Current Water in the late spring to late autumn, and by the East Sakhalin Current Water, a cold current, in the late autumn to spring. Nutrient concentrations were low in the warm-current period and high in the cold-current period. Large (>10 mu m) phytoplankton blooms were observed from April to May every year. The maximum chlorophyll a concentrations in the blooms were generally 10-30 mg/L; the concentrations in the blooms were up to thirty times higher than the values in non-spring blooms. Remarkable decreases were found in nutrient concentrations with the progress of the spring bloom; nitrate was considered to be a limiting nutrient in the spring bloom. Large phytoplankton were dominant during the post-bloom to the late autumn in low-nutrient conditions, whereas phytoplankton were dominated by smaller (<10 mu m) ones during the late autumn to pre-bloom in high-nutrient conditions.																			0021-5392	1349-998X					2018	84	2					241	253		10.2331/suisan.17-00041	http://dx.doi.org/10.2331/suisan.17-00041													WOS:000429211800007

Seasonality of pCO2 in a hard-water lake of the northern Great Plains: The legacy effects of climate and limnological conditions over 36 years	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Biogeochemical processes are active year-round in ice-covered lakes, such that processes in one season can affect limnological conditions in subsequent seasons. However, the extent and nature of these legacy effects are poorly understood, particularly for the CO2 content of lakes and when considering gas exchange with the atmosphere. Here, we used a unique 36-yr dataset of weekly limnological measurements of Buffalo Pound Lake in the northern Great Plains to assess seasonal changes in CO2 concentration and flux and determine how dependent lake pCO(2) is on limnological conditions of previous seasons. We found that the lake was a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere (mean 18.5 +/- 7.4 mol CO2 m(-2) yr(-1)), with spring potentially accounting for the majority (similar to 64% +/- 20%) of CO2 efflux, assuming ice in spring was permeable to gas exchange (32.9% +/- 19.8% if not). Analysis with generalized additive models (GAMs) demonstrated that current and antecedent seasonal conditions combined to explain 72.6% of deviance in spring pCO(2), but that the strength of model predictions and the importance of antecedent conditions diminished in GAMs of summer (43.6%) and fall (23.3%) CO2 levels. This research suggests that pCO(2) is regulated by a combination of coeval and historical environmental conditions and shows that quantification of seasonal and annual fluxes requires a mechanistic understanding of the legacy effects of preceding time intervals.					; Simpson, Gavin/KFQ-1110-2024; Leavitt, Peter/A-1048-2013	Finlay, Kerri/0000-0001-6835-8832; Simpson, Gavin/0000-0002-9084-8413; Leavitt, Peter/0000-0001-9805-9307													0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2019	64			1	SI		S118	S129		10.1002/lno.11113	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11113													WOS:000456164100011

Recent accelerated warming of the Laurentian Great Lakes: Physical drivers	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The primary drivers of the recent accelerated warming of the Laurentian Great Lakes from 1982 to 2012 are explored through observations, remote sensing, and regional climate model experiments. The study focuses on the abrupt warming from 1997 to 1998 as a proxy for the long-term warming trend. The lake surface warming has been heterogeneous in both space and time, ranging from moderate warming in late spring over the southern lakes and shallow areas of the northern lakes to strong warming in mid-summer over the northern, deep lake areas. The greatest lake warming between 1997 and 1998 occurs over the deepest areas of Lake Superior during mid-summer, primarily arising from enhanced heat accumulation during the mild winter of 1997/1998 and amplified by greater incoming surface solar radiation and air temperature during the spring of 1998, according to model experiments. The mild winter condition, together with the increased solar radiation and air temperature during spring, causes an earlier onset of springtime stratification, resulting in enhanced heat absorption by surface water and thereby contributing to lake surface warming during the subsequent summer in 1998 compared with 1997. In contrast, the modest peak warming over southern lakes and shallow areas of northern lakes from 1997 to 1998 is a rapid response to synchronous increases in solar radiation and air temperature during May between the 2 yr. Changes in antecedent wintertime lake ice cover are found to have played only a minor role in the accelerated warming trend of the Laurentian Great Lakes.

A detailed understanding of its intra-annual environmental variations under the broader context of global climate change is a fundamental basis for effective environmental management and the sustainable use of ecological resources. However, current research on this subject remains limited. In this study, the macrozoobenthic communities of Nakaumi Lake were investigated using a multi-index assessment approach, taking into account the lake's hydrological characteristics. This allowed evaluating seasonal environmental changes and identifying potential ecological risks. The obtained findings reveal that the macrozoobenthic community structure exhibits marked seasonal variation. Diversity peaks during the winter and spring, while it declines notably in the summer and autumn. Spatial differences in diversity levels across different lake regions are primarily attributed to habitat fragmentation driven by varying hydrological conditions. Overall, Nakaumi Lake is subject to significant environmental stress, and seasonal hydrological dynamics can cause abrupt shifts in community composition, thereby undermining the resilience of its aquatic ecosystem.																			2299-8993						2025	26	12								10.12911/22998993/208350	http://dx.doi.org/10.12911/22998993/208350													WOS:001584748600008

The main aim of this paper is to investigate the seasonal and vertical variability of AVS in the sediments of Taohua River, Guilin, China. By means of acidification - gas blowing, the AVS content of 11 surface sediment samples, collected respectively in April, August and December 2004, was determined to identify the seasonal effect. Three sediment cores were collected from different depth and analyzed in order to reveal the vertical distribution of AVS. Our results indicate that the AVS mean value is 0.6068 mu mol/g (dry sediment) in April, 31.3297 mu mol/g (dry sediment) in August, and 0.5727 mu mol/g (dry sediment) in December, respectively, showing that the AVS content reaches the highest in Summer, lowest in Winter, and intermediate value in Autumn and Spring. The AVS concentration also varies with depth: it increases with depth at beginning, and then drops down as the depth continuously becomes greater.																			2151-7614		978-1-4244-4713-8				2010																								WOS:000397260200122
J	Næsje, TF; Saksgård, R; Jensen, AJ; Sandlund, OT				Næsje, TF; Saksgård, R; Jensen, AJ; Sandlund, OT			Life history, habitat utilisation, and biomass of introduces Mysis relicta	LIMNOLOGICA												Life history, habitat utilisation, and biomass of benthic and pelagic opossum shrimp (Mysis relicta) were studied in the oligotrophic Lake Jonsvatn, central Norway. Sampling in the pelagic zone was done by means of a closing zooplankton net; in the benthic zone by means of a benthic beam trawl. M. relicta had a mixed one or two year life cycle. In the autumn, the proportion of mature females and males were larger in the pelagic than in the benthic habitat. Copulation took place in late autumn, and the first females with eggs occurred in November. In February, the first juvenile M. relicta were released in the benthic habitat. In May and July, however, juveniles were found in large numbers in all parts of the lake. The length distribution of M. relicta indicates that juveniles partly segregate between benthic and pelagic habitats. Both juvenile and adult M. relicta performed vertical diel migrations in the pelagic habitat. In the benthic habitat, diel vertical migrations along the bottom were not as pronounced as vertical migrations in the pelagic habitat. In the benthic habitat, major migrations were performed only by adults in the autumn. Our results indicate that the light intensity in the green part of the spectrum gives the proximate cue for regulation of vertical distribution of M. relicta. The mean total biomass varied between 288 and 1576 kg dry weight, corresponding to 23.2-127.1 mg dry weight m(-2) surface area. M. relicta had smallest biomass during late spring/early summer and largest biomass during autumn and early winter. Estimated pelagic biomasses were largest in February, August, October and November, while benthic biomasses were largest in May and July. Estimated biomass of pelagic M. relicta during autumn was approximately 1/10 of the estimated biomass of zooplankton in this lake.

Seasonal migration and fine-scale movement of invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) in a Great Lakes tributary	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												To determine whether invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) from Lake Ontario were establishing a year-round population in a tributary stream or migrating to the lake, we assessed population and individual movement patterns using mark-recapture assessment generated from weekly backpack electrofishing from May until November 2016. Round goby abundance was low in spring, peaked in summer and decreased again in autumn, suggesting seasonal inward stream migration and outward migration back to the lake. Adult round goby movement patterns were positively associated with changes in water temperature, but this was not the case for juveniles. Juveniles displayed a preference for shallow, upstream habitats. Observations of reproductive individuals coupled with a peak in juvenile abundance following the peak in adult abundance indicate that the tributary was used for reproduction and recruitment. The individual movement was primarily upstream in spring, and there was little net movement in summer, likely during reproduction. Downstream movement occurred in autumn over a short time period, suggesting rapid outmigration to the lake. The combined observations of seasonal population structure and individual movement suggest that tributary streams connected to large, infested waterbodies can be used for round goby reproduction and recruitment, rather than year-round residence. This study provides evidence of round goby seasonal migration and their individual movement patterns within tributary streams, which complements an earlier study in Lake Erie tributaries and may be a common occurrence in other Great Lakes tributaries.																			0906-6691	1600-0633				APR	2019	28	2					200	208		10.1111/eff.12443	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12443													WOS:000461901300002

Seasonal Differences in Taxonomic Diversity of Rotifer Communities in a Hungarian Lowland Oxbow Lake Exposed to Aquaculture Effluent	WATER												With the intensification of aquaculture technologies, the amount of feed input and waste material is increasing, creating potentially negative impacts on freshwater habitats receiving effluent from such systems. Changes in biodiversity of zooplankton communities is often used to assess the effects of such impacts. Rotifers are suitable for bioindication of water quality due to their fast reaction to environmental changes. We examined seasonal changes in the diversity of rotifer communities along a 3.5 km section of the biggest oxbow lake in the Tisza River basin, Hungary, that received inflow from an intensive tank-based aquaculture farm. We detected a species-rich rotifer community with 26 species. Using the Renyi one-parameter diversity index families, we found that biodiversity increased away from the point of inflow in spring, but after a summer transition period the situation became partially reversed during autumn. At the beginning of the study period, the nutrient-rich effluent strengthened the dominance of common species, which decreased but did not disappear in summer. In autumn, the extra nutrient input delayed the decline of the rotifer community at the point of effluent.					; Lövei, Gabor/B-7763-2008; Körmöczi, László/E-1725-2011; Lovei, Gabor/B-7763-2008	Eva, Kerepeczki/0000-0003-1689-2763; Lovei, Gabor/0000-0002-6467-9812														2073-4441				MAY	2020	12	5							1300	10.3390/w12051300	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12051300													WOS:000555915200079

Distribution of Metals in Water, Bottom Silt, and on Suspensions in the Arms of the Selenga Delta	CHEMISTRY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT												Distribution of heavy metals in water, bottom silt, and on suspensions in the mouth area of the river and in the arms of the Selenga delta has been investigated. It has been found that significant part of Pb and Cu is sorbed on suspension. Cu, Fe, and Mn content in the water of the arms before the confluence into Lake Baikal increases in the spring and exceeds the admissible concentration limit for fish-economic water bodies. The analysis of seasonal dynamics of the content of elements in water demonstrates that maximal content of Pb, Zn, Cu, Fe, and Mn in water is observed in the spring and in winter; in the rest of the time of year, it flattens at a level of minimal autumn values.

J	SARVALA, J				SARVALA, J			COMPLEX AND FLEXIBLE LIFE-HISTORY OF A FRESH-WATER BENTHIC HARPACTICOID SPECIES	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												The life history of the benthic harpacticoid Paracamptus schmeili (Crustacea: Copepoda) in the oligotraphic lake Paajarvi, South Finland, was described from quantitative field data of all developmental stages. The generation time of P. schmeili was exceptionally long for a meiobenthic animals and varied with depth from 1 year in the littoral (depths of 1 and 2 m) to 2 years in the upper profundal (13 and 14 m), and to 3 years in the lower profundal (40 m). In the littoral, egg-bearing females were found from April to October, with peaks in spring and late summer, while in the profundal a single summer egg peak was present. In the littoral and in the lower profundal there were three, in the upper profundal probably four, simultaneous parallel cohorts over-wintering as adults, medium-sized (at 13 m also large) copepodids and medium-sized nauplii. Reproductive isolation of the parallel cohorts was possible at all depths. The between-depth variation in the life history of P. schmeili was probably mainly a phenotypic response to the changing level and seasonal course of temperature of food supply. Growth and reproduction were confined to summer months, and the lengthening generation times with depth accompanied decreasing summer temperatures. The cessation of growth in winter was probably due to a shortage of food, which may also have accentuated the size differences of the over-wintering groups through intraspecific competition.

Road Salt Impact on Lake Stratification and Water Quality	JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING-ASCE												Runoff from roadways on which road salt (NaCl) has been applied for driving safety in winter can form a saline water layer at the bottom of a lake, pond, reservoir, or river impoundment. Natural vertical mixing of lentic surface water bodies can be hindered by the presence of a benthic saline layer and thereby affect lake water quality and ecology. To study the formation and disappearance of the saline layer, temperature and specific conductance profiles were measured intermittently over two years (2007, 2008) and at high frequency during one year (2009) in an urban lake of the northern temperate region (Tanners Lake, Oakdale, Minnesota). Erosion of the saline layer in the spring occurred only in year 2007. In years 2008 and 2009, the saline layer persisted throughout the summer only to be removed during fall turnover when thermal stratification was at a minimum. In all three years, salinity dominated density stratification after ice-out, but was quickly overtaken by temperature stratification as the epilimnion warmed. The deterministic, unsteady dynamic one-dimensional (1D) lake temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) model MINLAKE was modified by including vertical salinity gradients, and it was used to simulate summer stratification and mixing dynamics in Tanners Lake. The daily adjustment of the hypolimnetic eddy diffusion as a function of lake number was an important component in the developed model. This addition allowed mixing in the hypolimnion to be stronger in the fall and spring when the lake stratification was weaker than in the summer after thermal stratification formed. Model results of dissolved oxygen in the water column demonstrated that the saline benthic layer can prevent dissolved oxygen from reaching lake sediments. The adverse consequences of dissolved oxygen depletion on phosphorus recycling from the sediments, benthic microbial communities, and fish habitat are well known. Overall, the results show how salinity from road salt applications can influence water quality and natural mixing in urban lakes. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0000590.

Here, the hourly cyanobacterial bloom intensity (CBI) index, a proxy for the intensity of surface cyanobacterial biomass, was obtained from the geostationary satellite sensor Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) over the years 2011-2018. Generalized additive model was applied to determine the responses of monthly and hourly CBI to the perturbations of meteorological factors, water stability and nutrients, with variation partitioning analysis used to analyze the relative importance of the three groups of variables to the inter-monthly variation of diurnal CBI in each season. The effects of environmental factors on surface cyanobacterial blooms varied at different timescales. Hourly CBI increased with increasing air temperature up to 18 & DEG;C but decreased sharply above 18 & DEG;C, whereas monthly CBI increased with increasing air temperature up to 30 & DEG;C and stabilized thereafter. Among all the environmental factors, air temperature had the largest contribution to the intra-daily variation in CBI; water stability had the highest explanation rate for the inter-monthly variation of diurnal CBI during summer (42.3 %) and autumn (56.9 %); total phosphorus explained the most variation in monthly CBI (18.5 %). Compared with cyanobacterial biomass (CB) in the water column, high light and low wind speed caused significantly lower CBI in July and higher CBI in November respectively. Interestingly, cyanobacterial blooms at the hourly scale were aggravated by climate warming during winter and spring but inhibited during summer and autumn. Collectively, this study reveals the effects of environmental factors on surface cyanobacterial blooms at different timescales and suggests the consideration of the hourly effect of air temperature in short-term predictions of cyanobacterial blooms.

We use data from Direcci & oacute;n General de Aguas de Chile during the period of 1989-2024 to analyze the behavior of limnological parameters and trophic condition in the lake. Four seasonal linear regression models were developed by us, using a set of water quality variables that explain the values of phycocyanin pigment in Lake Villarrica. In the first case, we related chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) to phycocyanin, expecting to find a direct relationship between both variables, but this was not fulfilled for all seasons of the year. In the second case, in addition to Chl-a, we included water temperature, since this parameter has a great influence on the algal photosynthesis process, and we obtained better results. We discovered a typical seasonal variability given by temperature fluctuations in Lake Villarrica, where in the spring, summer, and autumn seasons, conditions are favorable for algal blooms, while in winter, the natural seasonal conditions do not allow increases in algal productivity. For a third case, we included the turbidity variable along with the variables mentioned above and the statistical performance metrics of the models improved significantly, obtaining R2 values of up to 0.90 in the case of the model for the fall season and a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.04 mu g/L. In the last case used, we added the variable dissolved organic matter (MOD), and the models showed a slight improvement in their performance. These models may be applicable to other lakes with harmful algal blooms in order to alert the community to the potential toxicity of these events.					; Frappart, Frédéric/AAB-8558-2019; Duran Llacer, Iongel/AAE-4362-2021; Bustos Usta, David/ABE-3683-2021	Duran Llacer, Iongel/0000-0003-3290-4947; Rodriguez Lopez, Lien/0000-0002-0550-0253; Bravo, Lisandra/0000-0003-3588-6115; Bustos Usta, David Francisco/0000-0001-6431-9203; Frappart, Frederic/0000-0002-4661-8274														2073-4441				DEC	2024	16	24							3708	10.3390/w16243708	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16243708													WOS:001386567200001

A total of 1473 fishes were examined. Young tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus, croaker, Bairdiella icistia, and mudsucker, Gillichthys mirabilis, were found infected by ectoparasites. Some persistent foci of fish infestations were found around the perimeter of the lake. The diversity of parasites was limited to three protozoan species, Amyloodinium ocellatum (Dinoflagellida), Ambiphrya ameiuri (Peritricha), Cryptobia branchialis (Bodonida: Kinetoplastida), and two metazoans, the monogeneans Gyrodactylus olsoni and G. imperialis. Both A. ocellatum and A. ameiuri infested fish from spring through fall. The greatest infestations occurred in summer (29-40degreesC) in the case of A. ocellatum and in spring and autumn (22-27degreesC) in the case of A. ameiuri. High parasite loads caused severe damage to such respiratory organs as gills and skin. They may depress respiration and osmoregulation and, in combination with other environmental factors, cause fish suffocation and death. These parasites may play a major role in juvenile fish mortality.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				DEC	2001	466	1-3					195	208		10.1023/A:1014555904968	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1014555904968													WOS:000174354200018

Differences in the Effects of Storms on Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) in Boreal Lakes during an Early Summer Storm and an Autumn Storm	WATER												In boreal lakes, increased precipitation events have been linked to increased concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), however the effects of seasonal differences on DOC and how this may impact storm response remain unclear. We evaluated DOC concentration and a set of DOC quality metrics during an early summer storm and an autumn storm on a suite of six lakes in Acadia National Park in Maine, USA. to better understand differences in seasonal storm responses. Our results revealed differences in the response of DOC quality metrics to an early summer versus an autumn storm, with changes in DOC quality metrics varying by storm and lake features. During the early summer storm, we observed greater changes in various DOC quality metrics in deep lakes with longer residence times, whereas during the autumn storm, lakes with large watershed area to lake area ratios experienced the greatest changes. Land cover was highly correlated with changing DOC quality metrics in the early summer storm but did not play a significant role in the autumn storm response. Our research provides evidence of seasonal differences in the effects of storms on boreal lakes, which are ultimately mediated by a combination of lake and watershed characteristics as well as seasonal differences in climate such as solar radiation and antecedent weather conditions.

J	Francisco, P; Tourenq, JN				Francisco, P; Tourenq, JN			The draining of a large reservoir considered as an experimental biomanipulation. First results: Fish control on the structure and biochemical composition of plankton	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The structural evolution of zooplankton and the biochemical composition of plankton in Lake Pareloup (Department of Aveyron, France) was studied for a two year periods : during the progressive draining of this reservoir in 1993, and during the recolonisation phase in 1994. The planktonic crustacean are essentially composed of Daphnia longispina, Ceriodaphnia quadrangula, Bosmina longirostris, Cyclops vicinus vicinus, Acanthocyclops robustus and Eudiaptomus vulgaris. The Cladocerans dominated the population during winter and in early spring 1993. In 1994, their development was maximal during May and they remained proportionally well represented in summer. The Cyclopoids constituted the main part of the community in june 1993 as well as at the beginning of the recolonisation phase (autumn winter 1993-1994). The maximum average crustacean density (67 ind./lit) was observed in October 1993 just after the water filling. The potential impact of the zooplankton on the phytoplanktonic community reveals the preponderant role of small grazers from January to June 1993. However, large grazers with an average of 67 % of the potential volume of filtered water represented the prime regulators of algal populations from October to June 1994. The average biomass in spring 1993 was about 59 mu g DW/liter whilst the one recorded from the same season in 1994 was about 103 mu g DW/liter. A significant increase of lipid and protein content of plankton was noted in 1994. The decrease of the control effected by planktophagous fish, eliminated during the draining of the reservoir (80 tons) explains the variations of structure and biochemical composition of the planktonic population.																			0003-4088						1997	33	2					121	133		10.1051/limn/1997008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/1997008													WOS:A1997XF49300007

Temporal trends in Mysis relicta abundance, production, and life-history characteristics in southeastern Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The density and life history characteristics of Mysis relicta were evaluated at a 110-m and 45-m station in southeast Lake Michigan during spring, summer, and fall for two time periods, 1995-2002 and 2007-2008. Mysis were more abundant during 1995-2002 than 2007-2008 for all seasons and depths, with average declines across seasons of 81% at 45 m and 70% at 110 m. Offshore densities of Mysis in 2007-2008 were similar to published densities within the same region during 1985-1989, but under differing ecosystem conditions (e.g. higher fish biomass and primary production in the 1980s). Growth averaged 0.032 +/- 0.002 mm/day in both 1995-2002 and 2007-2008, and the proportion of females with broods (overall 7%) did not differ between time periods. Mean brood size adjusted for length did not differ between 1995-2002 (17 +/- 0.6) and 2007-2008 (15 +/- 1.3). The mean length of reproductive females was higher in 2007-2008 (17 +/- 0.2) than during 1995-2002 (16 +/- 0.1). New recruits (<= 4 mm) were collected during each season for each time period, but were lower in abundance in 2007-2008 than in 1995-2002. During spring, there was a significant relationship between offshore water column chlorophyll concentration and Mysis recruit abundance, but not during summer/fall. Declining spring chlorophyll levels may be altering food availability for small mysids in spring, and the decline of the benthic macroinvertebrate Diporeia may be increasing fish predation pressure on Mysis despite declining planktivore abundance.

Thiamine and Fatty Acid Content of Lake Michigan Chinook Salmon	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Nutritional status of Lake Michigan Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) is inadequately documented. An investigation was conducted to determine muscle and liver thiamine content and whole body fatty acid composition in small, medium and large Chinook salmon. Muscle and liver thiamine concentrations were highest in small salmon, and tended to decrease with increasing fish size. Muscle thiamine was higher in fall than spring in large salmon. The high percentage of Chinook salmon (24-32% in fall and 58-71% in spring) with muscle thiamine concentration below 500 pmol/g, which has been associated with loss of equilibrium and death in other Great Lake salmonines, suggest that Chinook appear to rely less oil thiamine than other Great Lakes species for which such low concentrations would be associated with thiamine deficiency (Brown et al. 2005b). A positive correlation was observed between liver total thiamine and percent liver lipids (r = 0.53, P < 0.0001, n = 119). In medium and large salmon, liver lipids were observed to be low in fish with less than 4,000 pmol/g liver total thiamine. In individuals with greater than 4,000 pmol/g liver thiamine, liver lipid increased with thiamine concentration. Individual fatty acids declined between fall and spring. Essential omega-3 fatty acids appear to be conserved as lipid content declined. Arachidonic acid (C20:46), all essential omega-6 fatty acid was not different between fall and spring, although the sum of omega-6 (Sw6) fain, acids declined over winter. Elevated concentrations of saturated fatty acids (sun?) were observed in whole body tissue lipid. In summary, thiamine, a dietary essential vitamin, and individual fatty acids were found to vary in Lake Michigan Chinook salmon by fish size and season of the year.																			0380-1330					DEC	2008	34	4					581	589																WOS:000262663900002

The researched reservoirs - re-opened, dredged, with a sluice, natural open, natural semi-open, and natural closed - differed in degree of succession and type of connection with the relevant river. In order to determine the dependency of macrozoobenthos structure on type of oxbow lake and season, multivariate regression and classification tree method (MR&CT), and indicator species analysis were applied. The tree obtained revealed that the natural, semi-open oxbow lake differed distinctly from the others and was a favorable habitat for Diptera (mainly - Chironomidae larvae), Bivalvia, and Gastropoda. The latter taxon turned out to be an indicator for summer, while Insecta and Bivalvia dominated in spring and fall. Meliorated oxbow lakes (re-opened, dredged, with a sluice) were characterized by balanced density of all the macrozoobenthos organisms and the lack of indicator taxa. In turn, high trophy was indicated by Oligochaeta abundant in natural open and natural closed oxbow lakes, and in a reservoir with a sluice.					; Strzelczak, Agnieszka/B-5671-2011	Obolewski, Krystian/0000-0003-1308-4015; Obolewski, Krystian/0000-0001-9361-0286; Strzelczak, Agnieszka/0000-0002-3024-2225													1730-413X						2008	37	3					97	104		10.2478/v10009-008-0009-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10009-008-0009-x													WOS:000267220400009

Model skill was assessed by comparison to satellite-derived Chl a and field-measured water quality variables. We evaluated model sensitivity to scenarios of varying mussel filter feeding intensity, tributary phosphorus loads, and warm vs. cool winter-spring climate scenarios. During the winter-spring phytoplankton bloom, spatial patterns of Chl a were controlled by variables that influenced surface mixed layer depth: deep mixing reduced net phytoplankton growth through light limitation and by exposing the full water column to mussel filter feeding. Onset of summer and winter stratification promoted higher surface Chl a initially by increasing mean light exposure and by separating the euphotic zone from mussels. During the summer stratified period, areas of relatively high Chl a were associated with coastal plumes influenced by tributary-derived nutrients and coastal upwelling-downwelling. While mussels influenced spatial and temporal distribution of Chl a, lake-wide, annual mean primary production was more sensitive to phosphorus and warm/cool meteorology scenarios than to mussel filter feeding scenarios. Although Chl a and primary production declined over the quagga mussel invasion, our results suggest that increased nutrient loads would increase lake-wide productivity even in the presence of mussels; however, altered spatial and temporal patterns of productivity caused by mussel filter feeding would likely persist.					; Anderson, Eric/JYO-8924-2024	Anderson, Eric/0000-0001-5342-8383; Elgin, Ashley/0000-0001-5728-9843; Rowe, Mark/0000-0002-0852-3346													0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2017	62	6					2629	2649		10.1002/lno.10595	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10595													WOS:000415930800020

The phytoplankton responsible for these blooms are diverse. Different species of bloom-forming algae have distinct characteristics and hazards, and therefore need different treatment methods. An accurate and quick determination of the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of different algal species is crucial for lake ecological restoration. Based on the differences in remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) of various typical algae species in eutrophic lakes (including Microcystis aeruginosa, Aphanizomenon sp., and Pseudanabaena sp. in Cyanobacteria and Chlorella sp. and Scenedesmus quadricauda in Chlorophytes), difference index and algae distinguishing index were developed to differentiate algae species. A validation, using an independent dataset from an indoor experiment and in-situmeasured and satellite-image-derived Rrs, showed that the algorithm can provide reliable results (overall accuracies of 81.97%, 81.25%, and 60.42%, respectively). According to Ocean and Land Color Instrument images of Lake Taihu in the period of 2016 to 2020, Microcystis was the dominant algae, followed by Pseudanabaena and Aphanizomenon. The dominance of the two types of Chlorophytes was less pronounced. The proportion of Microcystis as the dominant algae was highest in summer, while the proportion of Pseudanabaena peaked in winter. The proportion of Aphanizomenon varied slightly throughout the year, while the proportion of the two Chlorophytes peaked in winter. In terms of spatial distribution, the patterns in spring and autumn were relatively similar. In summer, approximately 80% of the lake was dominated by Microcystis. In winter, Chlorella and Scenedesmus were more prevalent along the southeastern shore of Lake Taihu. The construction and application of this model can provide a technical support for prediction and prevention of blooms in inland lakes.

Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, has the longest uninterrupted ice records available for any lake in North America dating back to 1855. These records extend back prior to any reliable air temperature data in the midwestern region of the U.S. and demonstrate significant warming of approximately 1.5-degrees-C in fall and early winter temperatures and 2.5-degrees-C in winter and spring temperatures during the past 135 years. These changes are not completely monotonic, but rather appear as two shorter periods of climatic change in the longer record. The first change was between 1875 and 1890, when fall, winter, and spring air temperatures increased by approximately 1.5-degrees-C. The second change, earlier ice breakup dates since 1979, was caused by a significant increase in winter and early spring air temperatures of approximately 1.3-degrees-C. This change may be indicative of shifts in regional climatic patterns associated with global warming, possibly associated with the 'Greenhouse Effect'. With the relationships between air temperature and freeze and break up dates, we can project how the ice cover of Lake Mendota should respond to future climatic changes. If warming occurs, the ice cover for Lake Mendota should decrease approximately 11 days per 1-degrees-C increase. With a warming of 4 to 5-degrees-C, years with no ice cover should occur in approximately 1 out of 15 to 30 years.

The physico-chemical habitat template for periphyton in alpine glacial streams under a changing climate	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The physico-chemical habitat template of glacial streams in the Alps is characterized by distinct and predictable changes between harsh and relatively benign periods. Spring and autumn were thought to be windows of favorable environmental conditions conducive for periphyton development. Periphyton biomass (measured as chlorophyll a and ash-free dry mass) was quantified in five glacial and three non-glacial streams over an annual cycle. One glacial stream was an outlet stream of a proglacial lake. In all glacial streams, seasonal patterns in periphyton were characterized by low biomass during summer high flow when high turbidity and transport of coarse sediment prevailed. With the end of icemelt in autumn, environmental conditions became more favorable and periphyton biomass increased. Biomass peaked between late September and January. In spring, low flow, low turbidity, and a lack of coarse sediment transport were not paralleled by an increase in periphyton biomass. In the non-glacial streams, seasonal periphyton patterns were similar to those of glacial streams, but biomass was significantly higher. Glacier recession from climate change may shift water sources in glacier streams and attenuate the glacial flow pulse. These changes could alter predicted periods of optimal periphyton development. The window of opportunity for periphyton accrual will shift earlier and extend into autumn in channels that retain surface flows.

Effect of a flood event on the dynamics of phytoplankton and biogeochemistry in a large temperate Australian lagoon	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												In episodically driven estuaries, nutrient delivery is typically confined to sporadic flow events, followed by intense biogeochemical recycling of nutrients. We document the response of a temperate lagoon system with episodic winter-or spring-dominated catchment inflows (Gippsland Lakes, southeast Australia) to a flood event. High winter inflows resulted in high surface-water concentrations of inorganic nitrogen (IN; NO2- + NO3- + NH4+) relative to reactive phosphorus (RP) with an IN : RP ratio > 100. This resulted in a rapid diatom and dinoflagellate bloom, which collapsed as water column nutrients were exhausted. Increased carbon delivery to the sediment stimulated benthic respiration and depleted bottom-water oxygen, which led to a large release of RP from the sediments, decreasing the IN : RP ratio in the bottom water to similar to 6. Strong stratification of the water column allowed the accumulation of RP in the bottom water over spring and into summer. Mixing of RP from the bottom water over summer triggered the development of a Nodularia spumigena Mertens bloom. As such, the nutrient supply for the Nodularia bloom was through a biogeochemical filter that strongly favored N-2-fixing cyanobacterial blooms by reducing IN : RP ratios through a combination of sediment denitrification and release of stored phosphorus from within the sediment. These observations lead us to the paradoxical conclusion that high nitrogen loading over winter contributed to severe nitrogen limitation over summer, and highlight the importance of controlling both nitrogen and phosphorus loading to estuaries.

Widespread Moulin Formation During Supraglacial Lake Drainages in Greenland	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Moulins permit access of surface meltwater to the glacier bed, causing basal lubrication and ice speedup in the ablation zone of western Greenland during summer. Despite the substantial impact of moulins on ice dynamics, the conditions under which they form are poorly understood. We assimilate a time series of ice surface velocity from a network of eleven Global Positioning System receivers into an ice sheet model to estimate ice sheet stresses during winter, spring, and summer in a similar to 30 x 10 km region. Surface-parallel von Mises stress increases slightly during spring speedup and early summer, sufficient to allow formation of 16% of moulins mapped in the study area. In contrast, 63% of moulins experience stresses over the tensile strength of ice during a short (hours) supraglacial lake drainage event. Lake drainages appear to control moulin density, which is itself a control on subglacial drainage efficiency and summer ice velocities. Plain Language Summary Moulins are the conduits that allow water melting on the surface of the Greenland Ice Sheet to drain to its base and cause the ice to flow faster. Forming a moulin in Greenland requires a crack on the surface that becomes filled with enough water to drive the crack all the way through the ice. However, a large fraction of moulins in Greenland form away from the ice sheet's crevasse fields, making their formation a mystery. We forced a model of ice sheet flow to match measurements of the ice speed measured by GPS every 2 h. At most of the moulin locations in the area studied, the stresses predicted by the model were too small to fracture the ice and allow moulins to form during winter, spring, and most of summer. However, fracturing did occur at most moulin locations when large lakes on the surface of the ice drained catastrophically to the bed over a few hours. These rare and brief lake drainages must be the cause of most of the moulins, and they therefore have a lasting impact on the flow of water into the ice sheet and the changes in the flow of the ice this causes.

However, understanding of how the synergistic effects of hydrological connectivity and nutrient thresholds collectively drive fish community succession remains fragmented, particularly in large systems like the Changjiang River-Shijiu Lake continuum. Here, this study employed comprehensive eDNA metabarcoding (180 samples across 15 sites) for the first seasonal monitoring in this system, overcoming traditional survey limitations in dynamic habitats and enabling non-invasive monitoring in "Yangtze Protection" no-fishing zones. Key findings reveal: (1) Significant seasonal distribution patterns, with peak richness in summer (37 taxa) and lowest in autumn (22 taxa); 13 core taxa persisted year-round, while 35 were season-specific. (2) Diversity indices (Shannon: 2.41 +/- 0.43; Simpson: 0.83 +/- 0.11) were highest in summer (P < 0.01). (3) Hydrological connectivity drove spatial heterogeneity; a 3.75-m winter water-level decline significantly altered communities (Adonis, R-2 = 0.21, P < 0.05). (4) COD was the key annual driver (9.64-15.36 %), while TDN (15.41 %) and NH3-N (15.38 %) were primary summer-limiting factors. The results elucidate synergistic regulation of fish communities by hydrological rhythms and nutrient thresholds, advocating for seasonal connectivity maintenance (winter habitat preservation) and nutrient control targets (summer TDN < 0.8 mg/L) to conserve biodiversity in connected floodplain systems. These findings elucidate synergistic hydrological-nutrient regulation of fish communities, advocating seasonal connectivity maintenance (e.g., winter habitat preservation) and targeted nutrient control (e.g., summer TDN reduction) to safeguard biodiversity in connected river-lake ecosystems.																			0025-326X	1879-3363				JAN	2026	222		1						118656	10.1016/j.marpolbul.2025.118656	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2025.118656		SEP 2025						40945186					WOS:001573037600001

J	Yao, HX; Scott, L; Guay, C; Dillon, P				Yao, Huaxia; Scott, Lem; Guay, Christiane; Dillon, Peter			Hydrological impacts of climate change predicted for an inland lake catchment in Ontario by using monthly water balance analyses	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Potential hydrological impacts of climate change on long-term water balances were analysed for Harp Lake and its catchment. Harp Lake is located in the boreal ecozone of Ontario, Canada. Two climate change scenarios were used. One was based on extrapolation of long-term trends of monthly temperature and precipitation from a 129-year data record, and another was based on a Canadian general circulation model (GCM) predictions. A monthly water balance model was calibrated using 26 years of hydrological and meteorological data, and the model was used to calculate hydrological impact under two climate change scenarios. The first scenario with a warmer and wetter climate predicted a smaller magnitude of change than the second scenario. The first scenario showed an increase in evaporation each month, an increase in catchment runoff in summer, fall and winter, but a decrease in spring, resulting in a slight increase in lake level. Annual runoff and lake level would increase because the precipitation change overrides evaporation change. The second scenario with a warmer, drier climate predicted a greater change. and indicated that evaporation would increase each month, runoff would increase in many months, but would decrease in spring, causing the lake level to decrease slightly. Annual runoff and lake level would decrease because evaporation change overrides precipitation change. In both scenarios, the water balance changes in winter and spring are pronounced.

Samples included: precipitation, throughfall, lakewater, shallow groundwater and inlet and outlet streams. The delta-S-34 of sulphate in precipitation ranged from + 6.41 parts per thousand. in winter to + 3.88 parts per thousand in summer, the higher winter values attributed to seasonal differences in the kinetic and equilibrium isotope fractionation during oxidation of atmospheric sulphur dioxide to sulphate. The delta-S-34 in rain samples and in pine and spruce throughfall were similar, indicating no gain of sulphur from the trees. In the inflowing stream, the delta-S-34 value increased as discharge decreased, from + 5.57 parts per thousand in spring to + 26.21 parts per thousand in summer, indicating bacterial sulphate reduction. The fluctuations in the inlet water were damped by the lake and in the outlet water, only a small decrease in the delta-S-34 value during spring discharge was observed. During winter 1988-89, the near surface waters in the lake showed the same delta-S-34 as snow indicating that meltwater governs the isotopic composition. During the winter, the delta-S-34 in the near bottom waters increased while oxygen decreased due to bacterial sulphate reduction in the sediments. This also caused an increase in the alkalinity in the near bottom waters. Based on the delta-O-18 data the water within the watershed is derived largely from meteoric water. During spring discharge, meltwater governs the inflow and outflow stream while additional groundwater influences occurred during the drier period. Most sulphur is derived from atmospheric deposition and the delta-S-34 in sulphate increased during passage through the watershed due to bacterial sulphate reduction.																			0018-8158					JUL 17	1992	235						205	217		10.1007/BF00026213	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00026213													WOS:A1992JM30800019

Total mercury concentrations in liver and muscle of European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus (L.)) in a subarctic lake - Assessing the factors driving year-round variation	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Subarctic lakes are characterised by extreme seasonal variation in light and temperature which influences growth, maturation, condition and resource use of fishes. However, our understanding of how seasonal changes affect mercury concentrations of fishes is limited. We conducted a year-round study (3 ice-covered months, 3 open-water months) with open-water inter-annual aspect (3 years: samples from August/September), focusing on total mercury (THg) concentrations and ecological characteristics of a common freshwater fish, European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus (L.)) from a subarctic lake. We measured THg concentrations from tissues with fast (liver, n = 164) and moderate (muscle, n = 225) turnover rates, providing information on THg dynamics over different temporal scales. In both tissues, lipid-corrected THg concentrations were highest in winter (liver: 1.70 +/- 0.88 mu g/g, muscle: 0.24 +/- 0.05 mu g/g) and lowest in summer (liver: 0.87 +/- 0.72 mu g/g, muscle: 0.19 +/- 0.04 mu g/g). THg concentrations increased in winter following the summer-autumn dietary shift to pelagic zooplankton and starvation after spawning. Whitefish THg concentrations decreased towards summer, and were associated with consumption of benthic macroinvertebrates and subsequent growth dilution. Mercury bio-accumulated in both tissues with age, both showing the strongest regression slopes in winter and lowest in summer. THg concentrations in liver and muscle tissue were correlated throughout the year, however the correlation was lowest in summer, indicating high metabolism during somatic growing season in summer and growth dilution. Multiple linear regression models explained 50% and 55% of the THg variation in liver and muscle both models dominated by seasonally-variable factors i.e. sexual maturity, delta C-13, and condition factor. Seasonally varying bioaccumulation slopes and the higher level of intra-annual variation (21%) in whitefish THg concentration in muscle than the inter-annual accumulation (8%) highlight the importance of including seasonal factors in future THg studies.

However, despite the greater logistic problems of Working in the Antarctic there is a much greater data base on these systems compared to the Arctic. Arctic lakes have more complex plankton communities comparable to those seen in lower latitudes. Antarctic lakes have truncated food chains with no fish, few or no zooplankton and a dominance of the microbial loop. Generally primary production is higher in the Arctic and this is largely attributable to higher temperatures in these systems and a longer growing season. Despite a more favourable light climate in their water columns Antarctic lakes are usually extremely unproductive. Survival strategies also differ and this is related to the time available for growth in the summer. The Antarctic summer is very short and the most successful organisms function throughout the year, so that they enter the summer as actively growing populations. Mixotrophy is an important strategy among the protozoa. Year round data sets show that in Antarctica productivity continues through the winter months. In snow-covered Arctic lakes no significant activity is apparent during winter, and even in spring light attenuation though snow and ice-cover is so high that primary production is not measureable. The limited evidence suggests that in the Arctic organisms,shut down' their activity during winter. The Antarctic is facing elevated UV radiation in spring in summer, and both polar regions are suffering the impact of global warming. The impacts of these changes need to be assessed. The future offers great opportunities to apply remote sensing to limnological investigations, the application of e-science and the exploitation of the biotechnological potential of polar micro-organisms.																					90-5782-079-X				2003							321	329																WOS:000183287900050

We measured biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) via incubation assays and DOM composition using optical indices on 11 dates in three Lake Superior tributaries. Percent BDOC (%BDOC) and BDOC concentrations were seasonally synchronous across these watersheds, despite that they vary in size by orders of magnitude (1.7 to 3400km(2)). Relative to %BDOC, BDOC concentrations were more tightly constrained among sites on any given date. BDOC also varied within seasons; for example, %BDOC on two different dates in winter were among the highest (29% and 54%) and lowest (0%) values observed for each site (overall %BDOC range: 0 to 72%). DOM composition varied the most among tributaries during a summer storm event when BDOC (both as percent and concentration) was elevated but was remarkably similar among tributaries during fall, spring, and winter. Multivariate models identified humic-like and tryptophan-like fluorophores as predictors of %BDOC, but DOM composition only described 21% of the overall variation in %BDOC. Collectively, these three rivers exported similar to 18GgCyr(-1) as DOC and similar to 2GgCyr(-1) as BDOC, which corresponded to 9 to 17% of annual DOC exported in biodegradable form. Our results suggest much of the C exported from these northern temperate watersheds may be biodegradable within 28days and that large pulses of labile DOM can be exported during storm events and spring snowmelt.

While the seasonal storage pool is an important part of urban stormwater management, optimizing the ecological dynamics of its water ecosystem is of great significance for maintaining the quality of the regional water environment. Currently, the majority of research on seasonal rivers focuses on the exploration of ecological restoration programs and governance evaluation research. As a result, there is relatively little research on the ecosystem restoration of species change process and community change law. This study used the AQUATOX ecological modeling technique to simulate and forecast the seasonal dynamics of aquatic biological communities in the recently built terraced storage ponds in the upper reaches of the Shuifu River. The study's findings showed that the simulated and real observed values of the water quality indicators were highly consistent, and the model's fitting efficiency, which varied from 0.73 to 0.98, showed that the simulation results and the real situation agreed well. Subsequent investigation revealed that if the transfer ponds are run until 2026, the aquatic biomass increases by 0.02-16.24%. The summer and fall seasons showed a larger biomass than the winter and spring months between 2023 and 2026. Additionally, seasonal fluctuations had a substantial impact on the impoundment's biodiversity. In particular, populations of phytoplankton and zooplankton rise quickly in the spring, reach their maximum in the summer and then progressively decline in the fall and winter. Despite their relative stability, fish populations did exhibit minor seasonal variations. Redundancy analysis revealed that the primary drivers affecting the seasonal succession of the biological community in the storage pond were environmental parameters such as water temperature (WT), five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN). Therefore, a scientific foundation for the logical optimization of the water ecosystem function of the urban seasonal storage pond is provided by the targeted optimization of these environmental factors to support the stable and healthy development of the water ecosystem of the storage pond. This is crucial for advancing the sustainable management of the urban water environment.

To illustrate the temporal and spatial variation in the main colony characteristics for Microcystis and their key environmental factors in Lake Taihu, an annual investigation of the size, morphospecies and viability (the viable cell rate) of Microcystis colonies was performed in this study from 2020 to 2021. The average colony diameter ranged from 81.12 to 499.54 mu m at all sites during this investigation. The average colony diameter of the whole lake in spring and in late autumn to early winter was higher than that in other times. Microcystis flos-quae, Microcystis aeruginosa, Microcystis novacekii and Microcystis wesenbergii were the main dominant morphotypes, which was mainly affected by pH, TDP and temperature. Although no significant correlation was found between colony viability and environmental factors, the temporal difference in colony viability was remarkable. Colony viability in autumn (mainly October and November), spring (March and April), and July was lower than that in other times.					; yu, yang/HIZ-9682-2022	Yang, Zhen/0000-0001-8514-1977; 													1386-2588	1573-5125				MAR	2023	57	1					53	63		10.1007/s10452-022-09992-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-022-09992-4		NOV 2022											WOS:000882204500002
J	Xiao, MZ				Xiao, Mingzhong			Quantifying spatiotemporal influences of climate index on seasonal extreme precipitation based on hierarchical Bayesian method	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Quantifying spatiotemporal influence of climate index on extreme precipitation will help to better understand the variability of extreme precipitation. The extreme precipitation is usually influenced by different climate indices, and mutual offset is unavoidable to occur, thus the rotated empirical orthogonal function was used to identify the different influences of climate indices on extreme precipitation in space and time. The variation of extreme precipitation in data-scarce region is also concerned, hence, an improved spatiotemporal regional frequency analysis model was further developed, therein the identified spatiotemporal influences of climate indices on extreme precipitation were quantified using Bayesian hierarchical method. In this study, the in situ seasonal maximum one-day precipitation amount (Rx1day) was used to represent seasonal precipitation extremes from 1957 to 2010 in the Poyang Lake basin, and spatiotemporal influences of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) on seasonal Rx1day were quantified. Results indicated that the seasonal Rx1day was influenced by different climate indices in the Poyang Lake basin, ENSO tends to affect spring and autumn Rx1day, IOD tends to affect summer Rx1day, and NAO tends to affect spring and winter Rx1day. The response of extreme precipitation on climate index is varied in different regions, and this was well distinguished and verified, such as negative ENSO (in the same year) events tends to cause spring Rx1day slight decrease in the southern part of the basin while increase about 15% in the northern part with center around the Poyang lake.

J	Marvin-DiPasquale, M; Agee, JL				Marvin-DiPasquale, M; Agee, JL			Microbial mercury cycling in sediments of the San Francisco Bay-Delta	ESTUARIES												Microbial mercury (Hg) methylation and methyhmercury (MeHg) degradation processes were examined using radiolabled model Hg compounds in San Francisco Bay-Delta surface sediments during three seasonal periods: late winter, spring, and fall. Strong seasonal and spatial differences were evident for both processes. MeHg production rates were positively correlated with microbial sulfate reduction rates during late winter only. MeHg production potential was also greatest during this period and decreased during spring and fall. This temporal trend was related both to an increase in gross MeHg degradation, driven by increasing temperature, and to a build-up in pore water sulfide and solid phase reduced sulfur driven by increased sulfate reduction during the warmer seasons. MeHg production decreased sharply with depth at two of three sites, both of which exhibited a corresponding increase in reduced sulfur compounds with depth. One site that was comparatively oxidized and alkaline exhibited little propensity for net MeHg production. These results support the hypothesis that net MeHg production is greatest when and where gross MeHg degradation rates are low and dissolved and solid phase reduced sulfur concentrations are low.																			0160-8347					DEC	2003	26	6					1517	1528		10.1007/BF02803660	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02803660													WOS:000188745200013

PH and acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) were measured monthly the first 14 mo and semi-annually afterwards. Sample collection and analysis were performed by volunteers. The majority of surface waters in Massachusetts were found to be sensitive to possible long term acidification, with 63% exhibiting ANC less than 200-mu-eq L-1 and 22% with ANC less than 40-mu-eq L-1. Seasonal patterns in ANC were observed, the median ANC being 384-mu-eq L-1 in summer/fall and 134-mu-eq L-1 in winter/spring. Geographical differences were also found across the state: the streams and lakes with lowest pH and ANC were located in the southeastern and north-central parts of the state, while the most alkaline surface waters were found in the western-most part of the state, which is the only area of the state with significant limestone deposits.																			0049-6979					JUL	1992	63	3-4					237	251		10.1007/BF00475492	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00475492													WOS:A1992HY92100002
J	Simmonds, RL; Zale, AV; Leslie, DM				Simmonds, RL; Zale, AV; Leslie, DM			Physical and biological factors affecting seasonal Double-crested Cormorant densities on Oklahoma reservoirs	COLONIAL WATERBIRDS												We censused Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) on 8 reservoirs in north-central and northeastern Oklahoma from October 1992 through April 1994, excluding the months when the species was absent from the area (generally May-August). We used simple and multiple regression to identify physical and biological factors associated with seasonal densities of Double-crested Cormorants on reservoirs. Densities of Double-crested Cormorants varied between years and among reservoirs; they were absent during at least 1 census period, typically winter, on 5 of the 8 reservoirs. Densities of Double-crested cormorants were higher in 1992-93 than in 1993-94, which appeared to be related to low temperatures in 1993-94 that froze some study reservoirs and limited feeding opportunities. Size of a reservoir, the area of its drainage basin, and availability of forage fish were associated positively in simple regression models (adjusted r(2) = 0.215-0.471) with densities of Double-crested Cormorants in autumn 1992 and winter 1993. The density of boat ramps, an index of human disturbance, was correlated negatively in simple regression models with density of Double-crested Cormorants in autumns 1992 and 1993 and spring 1993, but only 4.4-13.5% of the variability in cormorant density was accounted for by density of boar ramps. Multiple regression models in autumn 1992 and winter 1993, both of which included size of the reservoir, accounted for 51.9% and 60.4% of the variability in densities of Double-crested Cormorants, respectively. Although we identified what appeared to be fundamental associations of physical and biological factors with densities of Double-crested Cormorants, they should be viewed as foundations for future hypotheses regarding habitat selection during migration and winter residency.																			0738-6028						1997	20	1					31	40		10.2307/1521761	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1521761													WOS:A1997WW85700005
J	Chen, NC; Wang, SQ; Zhang, X; Yang, SB				Chen, Nengcheng; Wang, Siqi; Zhang, Xiang; Yang, Shangbo			A risk assessment method for remote sensing of cyanobacterial blooms in inland waters	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The widespread occurrence of Cyanobacterial blooms (CABs) in inland waters is a typical and severe challenge for water resources management and environment protection. An accurate and spatially continuous risk assessment of CABs is critical for prediction and preparedness in advance. In this study, a multivariate integrated risk assessment (MIRA) method of CABs in inland waters was proposed. MIRA was simplified with the trophic levels, cyanobacterial and other aquatic plant condition using remote sensing indexes, including the Trophic State Index (TSI), Floating Algae Index (FM) and Cyanobacteria and Macrophytes Index (CMI). First, the dates of risk assessment were carefully selected based on TSI. Then, we obtained the trophic levels, cyanobacterial, and other aquatic plant condition of water using TSI, CMI and FM on the selected date, and further scored them pixel by pixel to quantify the risk value. Finally, the risk of CABs in water was accurately assessed based on the pixel risk value. Based on Landsat 8 OLI dataset, MIRA was executed and validated in three different lakes of Wuhan urban agglomeration (WUA) with different trophic states. The results demonstrated that the risk of CABs in Lake LongGan was overall higher than that in Lake LiangZi and Lake FuTou. And the risk of CABs in the east part of Lake LongGan was higher than the other parts. Seasonally, the risk level ranking in Lake LiangZi was the highest in summer, while lowest in winter. However, the seasonal risk ranking was spring, summer, autumn, and winter in Lake LongGan. Based on the comparisons with monthly water quality classification data and results of the existing study, including trophic level. ecology risk, and algal extent, the MIRA method was valuable for accurate and spatially continuous identifying the risk of CABs in inland waters with potential eutrophication trends.

Glochidia development took place from June to August and they were fully developed when the water temperature began to fall in autumn. The glochidia were stored in the gill blades to be released in spring. All four fish species, the perch, roach, pike and ruffe, were infected in spring. The prevalence of infection of the perch was high throughout the infection period whereas the roach had a high prevalence of infection only at breeding season. The larger roach were infected more often than smaller ones.						Jokela, Jukka/0000-0002-1731-727X													0003-9136					JAN	1991	120	3					345	355																WOS:A1991EX90500006

Like other tropical lakes, the annual heat budget of Lake Zapotlan is very low. Lake temperature (correlated with both atmospheric longwave radiation and water back radiation), wind strength (correlated with solar shortwave radiation, and runoffs (correlated with atmospheric longwave radiation, water back radiation, precipitation on lake and lake temperature) produce lake mixing during three seasons: winter, spring and summer. When fall begins, as the net surface heat flux diminishes and rainfall ends, the epilimnion is slightly cooled since this layer receives colder, denser runoff. This small difference in temperature causes the water column to stratify in an unstable manner. The alternating episodes of mixing and stratification significantly affect the nutrient cycle and the dynamics of the food chain.					de Anda, José/HTS-2413-2023															2521-9766				MAY-JUN	2007	41	4					447	458																WOS:000247200400008

The winter rotifer assemblage was dominated by Polyarthra dolichoptera, both in abundance and in biomass. Synchaeta verrucosa and Keratella quadrata were the sub-dominants. Thus, winter rotifer community had low diversity and high dominance of a few species. This pattern probably refers to the period of extreme environmental conditions where the rotifer assemblage is composed of few well-adapted species, and the low diversity here was not indicating instability of community structure, but the scarcity of suitable niches. These community structure indices indicate that the winter rotifer assemblage of L. Vrtsjarv was very similar to autumn assemblage, but very different from the spring one. In winter, small raptors were the most important functional group. The second place is occupied by larger raptors. Marginal role of fine particle sedimentators, absence of suckers and high proportion of large raptors were contrasting features of the winter trophic structure in comparison with the other seasons. Changes have taken place in the winter rotifer assemblage in L. Vrtsjarv in 1990-2007. Against the background of diminishing rotifer abundance, the dominant species has become even more prevalent, and the diversity of the winter rotifer assemblage has decreased. Shifts in the community trophic structure were also observed.

J	Wang, RX; Yang, XJ				Wang, Rongxing; Yang, Xiaojun			Nestedness theory suggests wetland fragments with large areas and macrophyte diversity benefit waterbirds	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Many artificial wetland constructions are currently underway worldwide to compensate for the degradation of natural wetland systems. Researchers face the responsibility of proposing wetland management and species protection strategies to ensure that constructed wetlands positively impact waterbird diversity. Nestedness is a commonly occurring pattern for biotas in fragmented habitats with important implications for conservation; however, only a few studies have focused on seasonal waterbird communities in current artificial wetlands. In this study, we used the nestedness theory for analyzing the annual and seasonal community structures of waterbirds in artificial wetlands at Lake Dianchi (China) to suggest artificial wetland management and waterbird conservation strategies. We carried out three waterbird surveys per month for one year to observe the annual, spring, summer, autumn, and winter waterbird assemblages in 27 lakeside artificial wetland fragments. We used the NeD program to quantify nestedness patterns of waterbirds at the annual and seasonal levels. We also determined Spearman partial correlations to examine the associations of nestedness rank and habitat variables to explore the factors underlying nestedness patterns. We found that annual and all four seasonal waterbird compositions were nested, and selective extinction and habitat nestedness were the main factors governing nestedness. Further, selective colonization was the key driver of nestedness in autumn and winter waterbirds. We suggest that the area of wetland fragments should be as large as possible and that habitat heterogeneity should be maximized to fulfill the conservation needs of different seasonal waterbirds. Furthermore, we suggest that future studies should focus on the least area criterion and that vegetation management of artificial wetland construction should be based on the notion of sustainable development for humans and wildlife.

Climate Change Will Impact Surface Water Extents and Dynamics Across the Central United States	EARTHS FUTURE												Climate change is projected to impact river, lake, and wetland hydrology, with global implications for the condition and productivity of aquatic ecosystems. We integrated Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 based algorithms to track monthly surface water extent (2017-2021) for 32 sites across the central United States (U.S.). Median surface water extent was highly variable across sites, ranging from 3.9% to 45.1% of a site. To account for landscape-based differences (e.g., water storage capacity, land use) in the response of surface water extents to meteorological conditions, individual statistical models were developed for each site. Future changes to climate were defined as the difference between 2006-2025 and 2061-2080 using MACA-CMIP5 (MACAv2-METDATA) Global Circulation Models. Time series of climate change adjusted surface water extents were projected. Annually, 19 of the 32 sites under RCP4.5 and 22 of the 32 sites under RCP8.5 were projected to show an average decline in surface water extent, with drying most consistent across the southeast central, southwest central, and midwest central U.S. Projected declines under surface water dry conditions at these sites suggest greater impacts of drought events are likely in the future. Projected changes were seasonally variable, with the greatest decline in surface water extent expected in summer and fall seasons. In contrast, many north central sites showed a projected increase in surface water in most seasons, relative to the 2017-2021 period, likely attributable to projected increases in winter and spring precipitation exceeding increases in projected temperature. Climate change is expected to impact rivers, lakes, and wetlands. In this effort we used multiple satellites to track monthly surface water extent (2017-2021) for 32 sites across the central United States. The average amount of surface water was highly variable across sites. Individual statistical models, relating meteorological variables to surface water extent, were developed for each site. The models were then updated with climate change adjusted variables. Most sites were projected to show a decline in surface water extent, with drying most consistent across the southeast central, southwest central, and midwest central U.S. Projected declines under dry conditions at these sites suggest greater impacts of drought events are likely. Projected changes were seasonally variable, with the greatest decline in surface water extent expected in summer and fall seasons. In contrast, many north central sites showed a projected increase in surface water in most seasons, likely attributable to projected increases in winter and spring precipitation.

On one side, the lake provides water for irrigation of the Po valley during summer, and on the other side its regulation is crucial to prevent flood risk, especially in fall and winter. The dynamics of lake Como are linked to the complex cryospheric hydrology of its Alpine contributing catchment, which is in turn expected to change radically under prospective global warming. The Poli-Hydro model is used here to simulate the cryospheric processes affecting the hydrology of this high-altitude catchment. We demonstrated the model's accuracy against historical hydrological observations, available during 2002-2018. We then used four Representative Concentration Pathways scenarios, provided by three Global Circulation Models under the AR6 of IPCC, to project potential climate change until 2100. We thereby derived daily series of rainfall and temperature, to be used as inputs for hydrological simulations. The climate projections here highlight a substantial increase in temperature at the end of the century, between +0.61 degrees and +5.96 degrees, which would lead to a decrease in the total ice volume in the catchment, by -50% to -77%. Moreover, there would be a decrease in the contribution of snow melt to the annual lake inflow, and an increase in ice melt under the worst-case scenarios. Overall, the annual Lake inflows would increase during autumn and winter and would decrease in summer. Our study may provide a tool to help policy makers to henceforth evaluate adaptation strategies in the area.					; Casale, Francesca/HOH-2609-2023	Bocchiola, Daniele/0000-0001-8493-0894; Casale, Francesca/0000-0001-6658-6970; GIUDICI, FEDERICO/0000-0001-7098-7953														2225-1154				JAN	2021	9	1							8	10.3390/cli9010008	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli9010008													WOS:000609998200001

We studied the vertical distribution of both types of MMPs in the sediment at Lake Yuehu during 1 year. Both types of MMPs were observed at sediment depths ranging from 1 to 34 cm, depending on the seasons. The eMMPs distributed at depths of 2-34 cm during spring, 1-11 cm during summer, 2-21 cm during autumn and 9-32 cm during winter. The eMMP species Candidatus Magnetananas rongchenensis, with magnetite magnetosomes, dominated at all distribution depths. These results suggested that Ca. M. rongchenensis migrated vertically during four seasons. The vertical profiles of oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) in Lake Yuehu changed seasonally, and these changes coincided with the seasonal distribution of MMPs, suggesting that the ORP affected the vertical distribution of MMPs. In addition, high concentrations of ammonium and silicate were associated with low abundances of MMPs.

These studies have shown that atmospheric deposition is a major factor in the degradation of water quality and associated adverse environmental effects. Recent mercury studies in the Great Lakes region have identified the atmosphere as a major source of mercury (Hg) to remote lakes and that modest increases in the deposition of Hg from the atmosphere could lead to higher levels of mercury in fish. These findings led to the requirements of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments which mandated EPA to assess the importance of atmospheric deposition of hazardous air pollutants and to determine the sources of these pollutants deposited to the Great Waters. Since 1990, a significant body of information has been collected to assess the patterns and magnitudes of mercury deposition in the Great Lakes region. Regional and local-scale spatial gradients in both atmospheric Hg concentrations and in wet deposition have been observed. For example, the Pellston site in northern lower Michigan received 53% of the Hg wet deposition recorded at the South Haven site in southwestern Michigan and 65% of that observed at the Dexter site in the southeastern portion of the state. Higher levels of particulate Hg were observed in the large urban/source areas primarily located in the southern portions of the state. A significant fraction of the particle-associated Hg was observed in the coarse size fraction (> 2.5 mu m). The concentration of Hg in precipitation exhibited a strong seasonal behavior with low values of 1.0 to 2.0 ng/L in winter and maximum values greater than 84 ng/L in spring. Furthermore, the spring, summer, and autumn precipitation accounted for approximately 90% of the total yearly Hg wet deposition. Particulate Hg levels also varied seasonally with higher concentrations observed during the winter months than during the summer. Elevated Hg concentrations, both in the particulate phase as well as in precipitation, were observed with air mass transport from known areas of high Hg emissions density.																					1-880611-10-4				1997							305	321																WOS:000072818300017

The chloride content is variable, with values from 8.9 g/L (spring of 2018) up to 38.3 g/L (autumn of 2017). There are different similarities between the values obtained over seasons. Thus, in the spring of 2017, an average of 11.8 g/L was obtained, a value close to that obtained in the spring of 2018 (8.9 g/L). The average of chlorides in autumn 2016 (25.5 g/L) is relatively different to the autumn of 2017 (38.3 g/L). During the autumn of 2016 and spring of 2018, the dynamics of several microbial communities was assessed as follow: heterotrophic, sulphate reducing, ammonifying and denitrifying bacteria respectively. The recorded results revealed that the best represented communities appear to be ammonifying bacteria, being high in the spring months. Denitrifying bacteria have registered high values in autumn 2017 and sulphate reducing bacteria in April 2017. The dynamics of halophilic bacteria were also recorded and more than 100 strains were randomly selected for purification, characterization and extracellular enzymatic activity analyses for the future biotechnological applications.

POPULATION AND INFECTION DYNAMICS OF DAUBAYLIA POTOMACA (NEMATODA: RHABDITIDA) IN HELISOMA ANCEPS	JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY												Dalubaylia potomaca is an unusual parasite for several reasons. Specifically, it has a direct life cycle in which it uses a planorbid snail, Helisoma anceps, as the definitive host. In addition, adult females have been shown to be both the infective stage and the only stage documented to be shed from a live, infected host. Finally, adults, juveniles, and eggs have been observed in all tissues and blood spaces of the host, suggesting the parasite consumes and actively migrates through host tissue. The present study examined the population and infection dynamics of D. potomaca in Mallard Lake, a 4.9-ha public access pond in the Piedmont region of North Carolina. In particular, the study examined the role of seasonality on the prevalence and mean intensity of infection of D. potomaca in the snail host. Data collected from August 2008 to October 2009 suggest that prevalence and mean intensity were inversely related in the spring and fall. Prevalence in fall 2008 was 10.3% but increased to 47.3% in spring 2009. Conversely, intensity was high in fall 2008 at 52.4 +/- 8.9 worms/infected host but dropped to 3.1 +/- 0.3 worms/infected host in spring 2009. During the same time, the parasites within the snails went from highly aggregated populations in the fall to a less aggregated distribution in the spring. It is hypothesized that D. potomaca induces mortality of the snail hosts during the winter, followed by a rapid recruitment event of the nematodes by the snail population after torpor.

A conceptual watershed model and several climate scenarios were used to estimate the effects of climate change on three lakes in the Vuoksi watershed for 2010-2039, 2040-2069 and 2070-2099. The adaptation possibilities were studied by using alternative regulation strategies. In Lake Pielinen the impacts of these water level changes on social, economic and ecological indicators were assessed with two different outflow strategies. According to the results, climate change will alter snow accumulation and melt and therefore cause large seasonal changes in runoff and water levels. Runoff and water levels will decrease during late spring and summer and increase during late autumn and winter. In some lakes current calendar-based regulation practices and limits, which have been developed based on past hydrology, may not be appropriate in the future. Modifying the regulation practices and limits is a necessary and effective way to adapt to climate change.					; Marttunen, Mika/G-3134-2019; Veijalainen, Noora/AAN-4826-2020	Veijalainen, Noora/0000-0003-4665-933X; Marttunen, Mika/0000-0001-9494-4181; 													0920-4741	1573-1650				OCT	2010	24	13					3437	3459		10.1007/s11269-010-9614-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-010-9614-z													WOS:000281742000008

Seventy-two smallmouth bass were captured, implanted with acoustic tags, and released back into the LWSC where they were captured. Smallmouth bass displayed a strong seasonal migration pattern between the LWSC and Lake Washington. Out of 57 smallmouth bass tracked for seasonal movement information, 82% migrated from the LWSC to Lake Washington sometime between June and October. Departure from the LWSC may be related to a combination of factors, such as cessation of spawning activity, reduced water quality conditions, and reduced prey availability. Smallmouth bass <350 mm FL were more likely to overwinter in the LWSC than larger fish and if they did migrate to Lake Washington, they migrated later in August-October. After overwintering in Lake Washington, smallmouth bass moved back into the LWSC between early-March and mid-April. Smallmouth bass returned to the LWSC at the beginning of the spring warming phase, a behavior likely related to spawning activity. Smallmouth bass often showed some degree of site fidelity between years for both spring/summer locations in the LWSC and summer/fall/winter locations in Lake Washington. Because smallmouth bass often have a high degree of spawning site fidelity, there can be different populations within the same water body. Our results provide some preliminary evidence that LWSC smallmouth bass are reproductively isolated from smallmouth bass that inhabit Lake Washington year-round.

J	AMIN, OM				AMIN, OM			ACANTHOCEPHALA FROM LAKE FISHES IN WISCONSIN - HOST AND SEASONAL DISTRIBUTION OF SPECIES OF THE GENUS NEOECHINORHYNCHUS HAMANN, 1892	JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY												Five species of Neoechinorhynchus are reported, not including Neoechinorhynchus robertbaueri Amin, 1985, which was described elsewhere. Of 14 species of fish infected with Neoechinorhynchus cylindratus (Van Cleave, 1913) Van Cleave, 1919, from Silver and Tichigan Lakes, Micropterus salmoides, Micropterus dolomieui and Esox lucius were the principal definitive hosts. Lepomis macrochirus may be a second intermediate host in its life cycle. Most recruitment occurred in late summer and in autumn, sexual development and breeding by spring, and growth and elimination of ripe eggs by summer. A partial overlap of generations was observed in the autumn. Neoechinorhynchus prolixoides mostly infected Erimyzon sucetta but was also found in M. salmoides, M. dolomieui, Pomoxis nigromaculatus, Stizostedion vitreum, Pimephalus promelas (all new host records) and Moxostoma erythrurum; new state record for Wisconsin. Measurements of Neoechinorhynchus prolixoides were provided and comparison is made with the original description. Extension of its binucleate lemniscus relative to anterior testis margin is not a good diagnostic character. The seasonal periodicity of N. prolixoides bore basic similarities to that of N. cylindratus but involved more juveniles, particularly in the spring and its simultaneous growth and maturation produced the highest adult intensity index during the summer. The smaller land-locked Silver Lake was considerably more heavily populated by both species than the larger river-connected Tichigan Lake. Both species showed significant but limited posterior migration in the intestine of their major hosts by the summer. Their intestinal distribution was compared with sites occupied by other helminth species in concurrent infections. Host sex did not affect worm burden, but size did. Neoechinorhynchus rutili (Mueller, 1780) Hamann, 1892 and Neoechinorhynchus strigosus Van Cleave, 1949 were also recovered from Culaea inconstans and Catostomus commersoni respectively. Neoechinorhynchus salmonis Ching, 1984 is reported for the first time in the U.S. from Lepomis cyanellus (new host species and family records) that was recovered earlier from the Pike River, which drains into Lake Michigan.																			0022-3395	1937-2345				FEB	1986	72	1					111	118		10.2307/3281802	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3281802													WOS:A1986C559900011
J	Tapics, T; Gregory-Eaves, I; Huot, Y				Tapics, Tara; Gregory-Eaves, Irene; Huot, Yannick			High-frequency diatom dynamics seen in an ice- and snow-covered temperate lake using an imaging-in-flow cytometer	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The study of winter in temperate, ice-covered lakes has largely been neglected, creating a major gap in our understanding of annual phytoplankton cycles. We assessed patterns in biovolumes of Asterionella, cf. Synedra, Urosolenia, and total phytoplankton at three depths during the winter of 2014/2015 as estimated using images from an Imaging FlowCytobot (IFCB) moored in Lac (Lake) Montjoie, Quebec (Canada). Even though the use of the IFCB under-ice presented challenges, these were outstripped by its advantages. The IFCB provided unprecedented high temporal and spatial resolution phytoplankton count and biovolume data that allowed patterns of abundance to be observed in detail. Interestingly, the IFCB captured an abundance of Urosolenia, which may be dissolved in standard Lugol's-preserved grab samples. We found Asterionella grew until mid-December and then slowly decreased towards the spring, whereas cf. Synedra diatoms decreased from early December and then rebounded towards late December as light increased before falling again towards the spring. Urosolenia peaked in late December as cf. Synedra diatoms rebounded and then began to decline towards the spring. Total phytoplankton declined towards late December, increased in the beginning of January and then declined towards the spring. The studied diatoms maintained considerable under-ice seed populations and grew when light was sufficient.

J	Fang, Y; Huang, RT; Shi, XY				Fang, Yong; Huang, Ruting; Shi, Xianyang			Using machine learning to reveal seasonal nutrient dynamics and their impact on chlorophyll-a levels in lake ecosystems: A focus on nitrogen and phosphorus	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) is a pivotal indicator of lake eutrophication. Studies examining nutrients limiting lake eutrophication at large scales have traditionally focused on summer and autumn, potentially limiting the applicability of their findings. This study encompasses 86 state-controlled points in the Eastern China Basin, spanning data collected from January 2020 to July 2023. Furthermore, we focus on the application of three machine-learning models (i.e., eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines, and Naive Bayes Classifier) to analyze the seasonal nutrient dynamics in lake ecosystems. We categorized the monitoring data by season to eliminate outliers and employed adaptive synthetic sampling to address data imbalance issues. The results reveal that the direct correlations between total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and TP in conjunction with turbidity and Chl-a are broadly weak, possibly because of geographic variations, nutrient lag effects on algae, and differences in algal community composition. However, probabilistic analyses revealed that as TP or TN levels transitioned from oligo-mesotrophic (O) to eutrophic (E), TP exhibited a greater influence on the variation in Chl-a status than TN during spring and winter (p < 0.05). Conversely, the effects of TP and TN on Chl-a (O-E) were comparable during summer and autumn. Seasonal variations in TN and TP thresholds derived from XGBoost modeling for O and E states of Chl-a suggest the need for stricter control measures during periods of high-nutrient levels and cost-effective management strategies to employ during low-nutrient periods. These findings should enhance our understanding of trophic shifts in lakes and provide a foundation for optimizing eutrophication management strategies across all seasons.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				DEC	2024	169								112916	10.1016/j.ecolind.2024.112916	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2024.112916		NOV 2024											WOS:001373144600001

Water storage and transfer in the epikarst of karstic systems during high flow periods	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												A monitoring of spring and rain waters in the South of France during two hydrological cycles is presented. Rain waters were sampled after each precipitation event at 3 rain-gauge stations. Four karstic springs located in the same area have also been daily (high discharge events) to monthly (low flow periods) sampled. This paper focuses on compositional. changes in the Cl- and Br- ions and the oxygen-18 (delta 18O) and hydrogen (delta D) isotopes during the high discharge events. The responses of the different karstic systems are quite homogeneous and reflect the hydrological state of the system. The waters discharged during the major autumn and winter high discharge events originate from the epikarstic reservoir and show characteristics chemical variations related to residence in the unsaturated zone close to the surface. Their residence time in the order of 1-3 months. Correlations between the composition of the spring-water and the rainwater during three successive high discharge events during the summer of 1998 indicate that the water for high discharge event "n" is derived from water from precipitation event "n-1" via a piston-type mechanism with residence time of 2 weeks. These results are interpreted as an indication of the major role of the epikarst reservoir in the karst recharge functioning. The similar behaviour of the four springs, although located in different geological contexts allows to think that the epikarst role could be more important than previously thought.

We conducted sediment sampling from 40 locations covering Hongze Lake and analyzed their chemical properties. Intra- and interkingdom networks were constructed using 16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Microeukaryotic intranetworks were more complex in spring than in autumn, while no clear variation in the complexity of bacterial intranetworks was found between autumn and spring. Larger and more complex bacterial-microeukaryotic bipartite networks emerged in spring than in autumn, correlated with lower carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus levels in spring, likely resulting in intense microbial competition. Bacteria and microeukaryotes played different topological roles in interkingdom networks, with microeukaryotes contributing to the networks' greater complexity. Seven keystone modules were identified in spring and autumn nutrient cycling. Importantly, keystone taxa in these modules belonged to photoautotrophic microalgae or predatory protostomes, indicating that these organisms are key drivers in lake sediment nutrient cycling. Our results suggested that nutrient content variation in autumn and spring changes interkingdom networks' topological structure between bacteria and microeukaryotes. Microalgae and protostomes are essential in freshwater lake nutrient cycling and may be targeted to modulate nutrient cycling in large freshwater ecosystems.

Seasonal dependency of controlling factors on the phytoplankton production in Taihu Lake, China	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												In this study, 44 profiles of gross primary productivity (GPP) and sunlight, along with water temperature, Chlorophyll-a (Chla) and nutrients, were observed in Meiliang Bay of Taihu Lake, China, in the spring, summer, and fall seasons. Effects of water temperature, light, and nutrient concentration were examined in relation to the GPP-unit-Chla (GPP of algae per Chla). The results showed that the optimum temperature for the GPP of phytoplankton was 27.9 degrees C, the optimal PNA-unit-Chla (photon number absorbed by phytoplankton per Chla) was 0.25 (mol), and the HSCN-unit-Chla and HSCP-unit-Chla (half-saturation constants of nitrogen and phosphorus of algae per Chla) were 0.005 (mg/L) and 0.0004 (mg/L), respectively. The seasonal dependency of the effect of different factors on the GPP was analyzed. Compared with temperature and nutrients, light was found to be the most important factor affecting the GPP during the three seasons. The effect of temperature and nutrients on the GPP of phytoplankton has obvious seasonal change. In spring, temperature was the secondary factor affecting the GPP of phytoplankton, and the effect of nutrients may be negligible in the eutrophic lake on account of temperature limit, which showed that the GPP of algae was only affected by the physical process. In summer and fall, temperature didn't affect the GPP of algae, and the presence of nutrients was the secondary factor affecting the GPP of phytoplankton. From summer to fall, effect of phosphorus was weakened and effect of nitrogen was enhanced. (C) 2018 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

J	Pope, KL; Matthews, KR				Pope, KL; Matthews, KR			Movement ecology and seasonal distribution of mountain yellow-legged frogs, Rana muscosa, in a high-elevation Sierra Nevada basin	COPEIA												Movement ecology and seasonal distribution of mountain yellow-legged frogs (Rana muscosa) in Dusy Basin (3470 m), Kings Canyon National Park, California, were characterized using passive integrated transponder (PIT) surveys and visual encounter surveys. We individually PIT-tagged 500 frogs during the summers of 1997 and 1998 and monitored these individuals during seven recapture surveys in 1997 and 15 recapture surveys in 1998 from the time they emerged from overwintering in July until the lakes froze for the winter in October. Probability of movement between lakes was associated with abundance of Hyla regilla larvae in the different lakes of origin, activity of the frogs (overwintering, breeding, feeding), and time of year. Overland movements exceeding 66 m were observed in 17% of the tagged frogs. Movement between lakes 1 km apart was detected. Site fidelity from 1997 to 1998 was high, and 97% of the tagged frogs recaptured in October of both years were found in the same overwintering lakes. Frogs were more narrowly distributed in spring and fall than in summer. Summer frog densities (number per meter of shoreline) were positively related to water temperature, air temperature, maximum lake depth, and presence of H. regilla larvae and negatively related to presence of trout. Mountain yellow-legged frogs use a range of aquatic sites throughout their activity period, and basins with a variety of deep lakes and shallow ponds may be the most appropriate reserves for this declining species.

J	SCHOENBERG, SA				SCHOENBERG, SA			MICROCRUSTACEAN COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND BIOMASS IN MARSH AND LAKE HABITATS OF THE OKEFENOKEE SWAMP - SEASONAL DYNAMICS AND RESPONSES TO RESOURCE MANIPULATIONS	HOLARCTIC ECOLOGY												Microcrustacean community and biomass dynamics were studied for two years in a Nymphaea-Eriocaulon macrophyte marsh and a nearly shallow lake which lacked macrophytes in the Okefenokee Swamp. In this blackwater, acidic wetland, microcrustacean diversity and biomass were similar to other circumneutral lakes and littoral areas, contributing to a productive fish assemblage. In the lake, the annual biomass pattern (15-1627 .mu.g l-1) was unimodal and was dominated by the crustaceans Diaptomus sinuatus and Eubosmina tubicen. Rotifers were occasionally important, constituting up to 55% of total biomass. Over the long term, mean annual biomass in this post-drought study are higher than in pre-drought years. In the marsh, biomass (11-777 .mu.g l-1) fluctuated biomodally with late winter depression corresponding to low temperatures and midsummer declines indicative of increasing fish predation. Summer dominance shifted between years from Macrothricidae in 1982 to Sididae in 1983. Variation in biomass correlated most strongly with algal chlorophyll in the marsh and with bacterial density in the lake. In field enclosure experiments in which primary production was reduced by shading, microcrustacean responses varied between lake and marsh habitats and with season. Lake zooplankton were consistently suppressed by reduced algal resources in winter, spring and summer experiments, with greatest responses to shading in the summer. Marsh microcrustacea were most affected in the winter experiment and became less sensitive to manipulated resource levels in spring and summer. Decoupling of these consumers from autotrophic resources in the marsh, but not in the lake, coincides with times of high macrophyte turnover and warming temperatures which promote the conversion of detritus into heterotrophic resources such as bacteria. The conflict between interactions implied by the experimental approach vs statistical criteria emphasizes a need to interpret resource dependence from seasonal dynamics of field populations with caution.																			0105-9327					FEB	1988	11	1					8	18																WOS:A1988M567300002

The stratification of their populations is best shown by sampling at close depth intervals and quantifying their densities by the Utermohl technique. With this technique we were able to count males which otherwise pass through filters and more accurately count egg production. We evaluated female, male and egg numbers of the two main oxiclinal species of lake Arcas-2: Filinia hofmanni and Anuraeopsis fissa, during two annual cycles (1990-91). F. hofmanni was an exclusive oxiclinal species. It had an exponential growth phase at the onset of stratification giving a distinct spring peak. The population then maintained a high density during summer, but was almost absent the rest of the year. This cycle is repeated annually but population density can vary among years, depending on winter-spring circulation. Sexuality was always observed when the animal was present in the samples, with a maximum of males and resting eggs at the peak of the population. Resting eggs were always inside females. The annual cycle of A. fissa is displaced with respect to that of F. hofmanni: A. fissa attained greatest densities during summer, until the autumn overturn. Mixis in A. fussa a was restricted to the end of the stratification period. Moreover, A. fissa occured throughout the vertical profile and secondarily occupied the oxicline.

J	VINCENT, WF				VINCENT, WF			PHYTOPLANKTON PRODUCTION AND WINTER MIXING - CONTRASTING EFFECTS IN 2 OLIGOTROPHIC LAKES	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Two deep oligotrophic lakes in the center of North Island, New Zealand, shared several limnological features but differed in their seasonal patterns of algal production. Lake Waikaremoana followed, in its thermal stratification, the classic pattern for temperate warm-monomictic lakes. During winter circulation, light availability to the phytoplankton was reduced by a factor of at least 13 relative to that in spring and summer, and there was no increased supply of P, which later controlled the amount of growth of its phytoplankton. Concentrations of algal biomass and algal production rates were predictably low, but rose rapidly with increased irradiance in spring. Lake Taupo experienced similar thermal stratification and mixing, but concentrations of algal biomass and algal photosynthetic production rose to maxima for the year during winter isothermy when temperatures were at their annual minimum and when mixing extended to the bottom of the lake. Winter circulation brought an increased supply of P and more importantly N, which later controlled the amount of algal growth in the euphotic zone. This increased availability of potentially limiting nutrients offset the effects of low light availability and low temperature. Lake Taupo, and other nearby lakes which behave similarly, form intermediates between temperate lakes with typical winter minima of algal production and many tropical lakes which experience maximum phytoplankton production during storm-induced mixing.

In 4 of the 10 regions, statistically significant seasonal modulation of seismicity (>90% probability) occurs, such that there is an increase in the monthly seismicity during a given portion of the year. In five regions, seasonal seismicity is significant in the upper 3 km of the crust. Peak seismicity occurs in the summer and autumn in Mt. St. Helens, Hebgen Lake/Madison Valley, Yellowstone Lake, and Mammoth Mountain. In the eastern south moat of Long Valley caldera (LVC) peak seismicity occurs in the winter and spring. We quantify the possible external forcing mechanisms that could modulate seasonal seismicity. Both snow unloading and groundwater recharge can generate large stress changes of >5 kPa at seismogenic depths and may thus contribute to seasonality. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Littoral benthic macroinvertebrate response to water-level fluctuations in three reservoirs of the Willamette River Basin, Oregon	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												High-head dams throughout the Willamette River Basin, Oregon create deep reservoirs that undergo inter-seasonal and intra-seasonal water-level fluctuations (WLFs). The magnitude of WLFs is dependent on competing objectives of flood control, recreation, and water releases to maintain downstream habitat and facilitate migration of Endangered Species Act-listed salmonids. These reservoirs are drawn down to minimum conservation pool in winter, refilled to full pool by late spring and undergo variable WLFs, typically between 4 and 15m, throughout summer. Here, we investigate the impact of seasonal WLFs on the density, biomass, and species composition of littoral benthic macroinvertebrates at Fall Creek, Hills Creek, and Lookout Point reservoirs. We sampled the submerged littoral zone during spring and summer using an adapted quadrat sampling method and assessed differences in species assemblages using a non-parametric multivariate statistical technique. Descriptors of variation in substrate, WLF, temperature, and depth were incorporated to identify environmental variables associated with variation in assemblage composition. We hypothesized that density and biomass would decrease and assemblage composition would shift between seasons in response to WLFs. We found statistically significant differences in assemblage composition between seasons and among reservoirs, but density and biomass did not respond similarly. Observed variation in assemblages was associated with surface water temperature, water depth, substrate, and WLF. None of these variables alone explained observed variation. We provide evidence that seasonal WLFs influence macroinvertebrate assemblage composition and alter habitat characteristics. Our procedure effectively quantifies changes in species assemblages in impounded systems with low densities and dynamic littoral zones and can inform water management decisions with relatively modest costs.					; Arismendi, Ivan/B-3144-2010; Murphy, Christina/O-4941-2019	Murphy, Christina/0000-0002-3467-6610; Arismendi, Ivan/0000-0002-8774-9350; 													1535-1459	1535-1467				SEP	2017	33	7					1052	1059		10.1002/rra.3150	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.3150													WOS:000409105100007

Following refilling in the spring of 1993, fry of eel (Anguilla anguilla), pike (Esox lucius) and wels (Silurus glanis) were introduced, in total 236 fry ha(-1). In 1994 the reservoir was additionally stocked with adult pike in spring (10 kg ha(-1)), with pike fry in summer (156 specimens ha(-1)), and pike and pikeperch (Stizostedion lucioperca) fry in the autumn (413 specimens ha(-1)). High water transparency and low concentration of chlorophyll-a were observed throughout 1993 except for a short period of water bloom caused by Aphanizomenon flos-aquae in summer. In the spring of 1994 only a short water bloom caused by diatoms was observed. Not only zooplankton grazing but also low phosphorus content limited the growth of phytoplankton biomass in this period. At the beginning of summer cladoceran biomass decreased, leading to a strong water bloom dominated by Planktothrix agardhii. During this event water transparency decreased to 0.3 m. This was a result of insufficient introduction of predatory fish, which could not ensure effective control of the rapidly increasing plankivorous fry numbers.					; Gołdyn, Ryszard/J-1093-2018	Kozak, Anna/0000-0001-7448-0498; Goldyn, Ryszard/0000-0001-8325-5161													0018-8158					JAN 17	1997	342						327	333		10.1023/A:1017036717550	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017036717550													WOS:A1997WZ13900035

Therefore, in arid areas with scarce water resources and fragile ecological environments, the below-cloud evaporation is an issue of great concern. Based on 406 event-based precipitation samples collected from nine stations in the Shiyang River basin (SRB) in the northwest arid area, global meteorological water line (GMWL) and local meteorological water line (LMWL) are compared, and the Stewart model is used to study the effect of spatial and temporal variation of below-cloud evaporation on isotope values in different geomorphic units at the SRB. Furthermore, factors influencing below-cloud evaporation are analyzed. The results show that 1) the change of d-excess (Delta d) in precipitation at the SRB and the residual ratio of raindrop evaporation (f) vary in time and space. With regard to temporal variation, the intensity of below-cloud evaporation is described by summer < autumn < winter < spring. Regarding spatial variation, the below-cloud evaporation in mountain areas is weaker than in oases and deserts. The intensity of below-cloud evaporation in mountain areas increases with decreasing altitude, and the below-cloud evaporation in oasis and desert areas is affected by local climatic conditions. 2) Below-cloud evaporation is also affected by local transpiration evaporation, especially around reservoirs. Reservoirs increase the relative humidity of the air nearby, weakening below-cloud evaporation. This study deepens our understanding of the water cycle process in arid areas.

These habitats lead to a high variability of otter's prey. From December 2012 until July 2014, diet of Eurasian otter was studied based on spraint analysis in Putna-Vrancea Natural Park (n=118 samples) and Lower Siret Valley Natura 2000 Site (n=56 samples), south - east Romania. The Percentage of Occurrence (PO), Relative Frequency of Occurrence (RFO) and Percentage Frequency of Occurrence (PFO) were calculated. Fish (PO = 56.1%) and amphibians (PO =22.5%) were the primary diet components of otters in Putna-Vrancea, while in Lower Siret Valley, fish (PO = 36.7%) and crayfish (PO = 32.6%) formed the mass of the diet. Fish consumption was all seasons high in Putna-Vrancea, except in winter. In Lower Siret Valley, the highest fish consumption was in the autumn and the lowest in the summer. In Putna-Vrancea, amphibians were more frequently become part of the diet in the spring, while in Lower Siret Valley were during the summer. Crayfish were the primary elements of otters' diet from Lower Siret Valley in the summer, while in Putna-Vrancea remains of crayfish were not discovered in the spraints. The results indicate that the otters' feeding ecology was influenced by environmental factors of the ecosystems where the otters live, such as altitude, climate and different prey fauna.

There was no evidence of tissue damage caused by C. piscium, and the rate of infection did not directly correlate with physical and chemical water parameters. Thus, the increase of the pelagic ciliate community during the ice-free period may have a major impact on the specific population dynamics of C. piscium as it represents its major food source.																			0003-9136					JAN	2005	162	1					99	109		10.1127/0003-9136/2005/0162-0099	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2005/0162-0099													WOS:000226937800007

Monitoring of Microplastics in Water and Sediment Samples of Lakes and Rivers of the Akmola Region (Kazakhstan)	WATER												This paper provides a detailed description of the findings and methodology related to the monitoring of microplastics in three lakes and one river of the Akmola Region in Kazakhstan. The concentration of microplastic particles and the analysis of water and sediment quality of the Yesil River and Kopa, Zerendinskoye, and Borovoe lakes have been analyzed. A total of 64 water samples were collected across the spring, summer, and autumn seasons, with subsequent analysis revealing a seasonal increase in microplastic concentrations. The average microplastic content ranged from 1.2 x 10(-1) particles/dm(3) in spring to 4.5 x 10(-1) particles/dm(3) in autumn. Lakes exhibited higher concentrations compared to the Yesil River. Correlation analysis highlighted a connection between microplastic content and turbidity, particularly notable during the spring season. Analysis of sediments revealed a decrease in microplastic concentrations from the coastal zone toward open waters sediments. Microplastic fibers were predominant in sediments (69.6%), followed by fragments (19.1%), films (7.4%), and granules (3.9%). Larger particles (>500 mu m) were found in beach sediments, constituting an average of 40.5% of the total plastics found. This study contributes valuable insights into the spatial and temporal distribution of microplastics, emphasizing the need for ongoing monitoring and management strategies to address this environmental concern.

Therefore, traditional frequency analysis techniques are not applicable and more sophisticated statistical techniques are required to account for the dependence in the annual extremes. Decomposition of the annual extremes into two parts, one containing the highly dependent part and the other containing the random part, is one method of dealing with the dependence in the lake elevations. These parts are then combined by application of the total probability theorem. Seasonality of the occurrence of both parts was found to be very important. Therefore, the complete analysis was done for the 6-month fall-winter period and the 6-month spring-summer period. The two curves were then combined by the union of probabilities. Application of this method to the Buffalo Harbor and Cleveland gages resulted in computed "1% of Years Exceeded" elevations of 176.76 meters (579.91 feet) and 175.17 meters (574.71 feet) (IGLD 1955), respectively.																			0380-1330						1992	18	1					202	206		10.1016/S0380-1330(92)71287-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(92)71287-8													WOS:A1992HP68100019

The remote sensing model of chlorophyll-a concentration inversion was established through the comparative analysis of the linear model, exponential model, logarithmic model and quadratic polynomial model by 38 kinds of band combinations. The average relative error was 22.81%. The RMSE of 13.71 mg/m(3) was far lower than the average concentration of 34.16 mg/m(3). The results showed the following. (i) From the perspective of time distribution, the eutrophication degree decreased successively in summer, autumn, spring, and winter. Dongting Lake is mainly in the state of moderate nutrition, which may be attributed to its unique hydrological conditions (short water cycle and fast flow rate). (ii) Eutrophicated water bodies are mainly distributed in the East Dongting Lake and inner lake where the water flow is relatively slow. The water bodies with pool nutrient status are mainly distributed in the outer lake areas where the water flows faster, such as West Dongting Lake.

Today, the lower elevations in the basin are hyperarid. To understand to what extent the climate plays a role in the maintenance of the megalake system during the Pliocene, we applied the Weather Research and Forecasting model for dynamical downscaling of ECHAM5 global climate simulations for the present day and the mid-Pliocene. When imposing the mid-Pliocene climate on the QB with its modern land surface settings, the annual water balance (Delta S), that is, the change in terrestrial water storage within the QB, increases. This positive imbalance of Delta S induced solely by the changes in the large-scale climate state would lead to a readjustment of lake extent, until a new equilibrium state is reached, where loss due to evaporation over lake areas compensates for the input by runoff and precipitation. Atmospheric water transport (AWT) analysis at each border of the QB reveals that this imbalance of Delta S is caused by stronger moisture influx across the western border in winter, spring, and autumn and weaker moisture out-flux across the eastern border in summer. These changes in AWT are associated with the strengthening of the midlatitude westerlies in all seasons, except for summer, and the intensification of the East Asian Summer Monsoon. Given that the mid-Pliocene climate is an analog to the projected warm climate of the near future, our study contributes to a better understanding of climate change impacts in central Asia.					; Botsyun, Svetlana/KZT-8375-2024; Otto, Marco/AAA-9365-2019; Ehlers, Todd/A-9582-2012	Wang, Xun/0000-0003-3294-747X; Botsyun, Svetlana/0000-0002-5019-0418; Mutz, Sebastian Gerhard/0000-0001-8180-6150; Ehlers, Todd/0000-0001-9436-0303; Otto, Marco/0000-0003-4464-2673; Schmidt, Benjamin/0000-0002-9669-3360; 													2169-897X	2169-8996				AUG	2021	126	16							e2020JD033965	10.1029/2020JD033965	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JD033965													WOS:000688706400005

Biomass and productivity during the winter-spring transition	POLAR BIOLOGY												Phytoplankton populations in perennially ice-covered Lake Bonney, Antarctica grow in a unique non-turbulent environment. The absence of turbulence generated by winds or major streams, combined with strong vertical gradients in temperature and nutrients, create vertically stratified environmental conditions that support three discrete phytoplankton populations in the east lobe of this lake. Phytoplankton biomass and photosynthesis were measured in the east lobe of Lake Bonney during the winter-spring transition (September) to mid-summer (January). During this period, irradiance beneath the ice increased from 0.03 to 1.9 mol quanta m(-2) d(-1). Chlorophyll a concentrations ranged from 0.03 to 3.8 mu g l(-1) within the trophogenic zone (just beneath the permanent ice cover to 20 m) and photosynthesis ranged from below detection to 3.2 mu g C l(-1) d(-1). Our results indicate: (1) phytoplankton photosynthesis began in late winter (before 9 September, our earliest sampling date); (2) maxima for phytoplankton biomass and production developed sequentially in time from the top to the bottom of the trophogenic zone, following the seasonal increase in irradiance; and (3) the highest photosynthetic efficiencies occurred in early spring, then decreased over the remainder of the phytoplankton growth season. The spring decrease in photosynthetic rates for shallower phytoplankton appeared to be related to nutrient availability, while photosynthesis in the deeper populations was solely light-dependent.																			0722-4060					MAR	1996	16	3					155	162		10.1007/s003000050040	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s003000050040													WOS:A1996TW04100001

The pond showed a pronounced algal periodicity. High-diversity phytoplankton assemblages occurred in spring and autumn. During the winter period, low diversity values were related either to stable community states, when K-strategist species dominated the plankton, or to a large bloom of r-strategist species. In summer, the stable environment led to low-diversity, high-biomass phytoplankton assemblages, dominated by Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii. At this time, the growth conditions for Cylindrospermopsis were akin to those prevailing in a continuous fermenter. The overwhelming dominance of this species lasted for more than four months, during which time, the phytoplankton resembled that of one in the tropics. In August, 1993, an unsuccessful chemical treatment for reducing the algal bloom succeeded in killing the pond's entire population of fish. The large fish-stock comprised the planktivorous silver carp. Although the summer of 1994 was one of the warmest summers of this century, the expected Cylindrospermopsis bloom failed to develop probably because of a higher grazing pressure by large zooplankton. In spite of the fact that the temporal and spatial pattern of the phytoplankton is influenced principally by bottom-up effects, changes in cascading trophic interactions may also considerably influence the species composition and biomass.

Numerical simulation is an important means to comprehensively understand the water environment. Aiming at problems of high pollution load, poor capacity of self-purification and sensitive water environment system of lakes, this study took Xinglong Lake, the largest artificial lake in Chengdu City, Sichuan Province, west of China, as an example, to simulate and quantitatively evaluate the spatio-temporal changes of key water quality factors such as TN, TP, COD and NH3-N, by using integrates historical data, in-situ monitoring and PCLake model. The historical and in-situ spatial data of TN and TP concentrations were water exit>north side>center>south side>inlet, indicating that the self-purification capacity of Xinglong Lake is weak. In terms of time, the PCLake was used to establish a high precision water quality model which is suitable for shallow lakes through initial condition setting, parameter calibration, modeling, model correction and verification. The results showed that compared with the measured values, the model can reflect the dynamic changes of water quality in Xinglong Lake well (RMSE<0.25). The concentrations of 4 water quality factors showed a fluctuating decline from 2016 to 2019, with the decreasing rates of TN(0.28mg/(l center dot a)), TP(0.02mg/(l center dot a)), NH3-N(0.04mg/(l center dot a)), and COD(4.54mg/(l center dot a)), respectively. Affected by heavy rainfall, temperature and algal reproduction, the water quality of Xinglong Lake in spring and summer were obviously better than those in autumn and winter. The TN and NH3-N concentration in spring and summer were about 1.5 times and 3 times of that in autumn and winter. TP has little change within a year, and the concentration of COD was the highest in autumn. The comprehensive evaluation showed that the water quality of Xinglong Lake increased from inferior V class to IV class during 2016 to 2019. After 2019, the proportion of water quality below IV class decreased by about 30%, and some of them even reached III class. However, about 12.5% of water quality in the south and outlet of Xinglong Lake still failed to reach IV class. Also, the lake had problems of light eutrophication from 2016 to 2020 and trophic state index (TSI) showed a trend of increasing and then decreasing, reaching a peak in 2018.

Nitrate repletion during spring bloom intensifies phytoplankton iron demand in Yangtze River tributary, China	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Most aquatic systems show characteristic seasonal fluctuations in the total nutrient pool supporting primary productivity. The nutrient dynamics essentially exacerbate critical demand for the counterpart micronutrients towards achieving ecosystem equilibrium. Herein, the phytoplankton demand for iron (Fe) uptake under high concentration of nitrate-nitrogen during spring in Xiangxi Bay, China, was studied. Our result confirmed that significant Fe concentrations (P = 0.01) in both autumn (0.62 +/- 0.02 mgL(-1)) and winter (0.06 +/- 0.03 mgL(-1)) relative to spring (0.004 +/- 0.01 mgL(-1)) are linked to the low NON paradigms during autumn and winter. As NON showed a sharp increase in spring, a dramatic reduction in the Fe pool was observed in the entire tributary, driving the system to a critical Fe limited condition. Bioassay study involving Fe additions both alone and in combinations led to maximum growth stimulation with biomass as chla (16.44 +/- 0.82 mu gL(-1) ) and phytoplankton cell density (6.75 x 10(6) cellsL(-1) ) which differed significantly (P = 0.03) with the control. Further, the study demonstrated that Fe additions triggered biomass productions which increased linearly with cell densities. The P alone addition caused biomass production (15.26 +/- 2.51 mu gL(-1)) greater than both NO3-N (9.15 +/- 0.66 mu gL(-1)) and NH4+N (13.65 +/- 1.68 mu gL(-1) ) separate additions but reported a low aggregate cell density (3.18 x 10(6) cellsL(-1)). This indicates that nutrient and taxonomic characteristics e.g., high cell pigment contents rather than just the cell bio-volume also determine biomass. The Bacilliarophyta, Chlorophyta, and Cryptophyta with the total extinction of Cyanophyta characterized the bloom in spring. The anthropogenic NON input into XXB would have driven to higher NO3-N than NH4+N situation, and incapacitated the Cyanophyta that preferentially utilize NH4+N. Our study provides a useful report for incorporation into the monitoring programs for prudent management of phytoplankton bloom and pollution across the eutrophic systems. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

A total of 35 different fatty acids were determined in gas chromatography. Among these, palmitic, oleic, and palmitoleic acids had the highest proportion. The main polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were found to be docosahexaenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, and arachidonic acid. There were more PUFAs than monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) in all seasons. Similarly, the percentages of omega 3 fatty acids were higher than those of total omega 6 fatty acids in the fatty acid composition omega 3/omega 6 ratios were calculated as 1.53, 1.32, 1.97, and 1.71 in spring, summer, autumn and winter, respectively. Overall, we found that the fatty acid composition and omega 3/omega 6 fatty acid ratio in the muscle of northern pike were significantly influenced by season.

The lateral density gradient resulting from this differential cooling can trigger a cold downslope density current that intrudes at the base of the mixed layer during stratified conditions. This process is known as a thermal siphon (TS). TSs flush the littoral region and increase water exchange between nearshore and pelagic zones; thus, they may potentially impact the lake ecosystem. Past observations of TSs in lakes are limited to specific cooling events. Here, we focus on the seasonality of TS-induced lateral transport and investigate how seasonally varying forcing conditions control the occurrence and intensity of TSs. This research interprets 1-year-long TS observations from Rotsee (Switzerland), a small wind-sheltered temperate lake with an elongated shallow region. We demonstrate that TSs occur for more than 50 % of the days from late summer to winter and efficiently flush the littoral region within similar to 10 h. We further quantify the occurrence, intensity, and timing of TSs over seasonal timescales. The conditions for TS formation become optimal in autumn when the duration of the cooling phase is longer than the time necessary to initiate a TS. The decrease in surface cooling by 1 order of magnitude from summer to winter reduces the lateral transport by a factor of 2. We interpret this transport seasonality with scaling relationships relating the daily averaged cross-shore velocity, unit-width discharge, and flushing timescale to the surface buoyancy flux, mixed-layer depth, and lake bathymetry. The timing and duration of diurnal flushing by TSs relate to daily heating and cooling phases. The longer cooling phase in autumn increases the flushing duration and delays the time of maximal flushing relative to the summer diurnal cycle. Given their scalability, the results reported here can be used to assess the relevance of TSs in other lakes and reservoirs.

Habitat selection in a southern Lake Sturgeon population: implications of temporal, spatial, and ontogenetic variation for restoration	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Successful species reintroduction requires restoration of receiving habitats to support growth, survival, and reproduction that reverse the initial causes of decline. Little is known about whether present habitat conditions can support all life stages of reintroduced southern Lake Sturgeon populations that were possibly extirpated by the mid-1900s due to overharvest and habitat degradation. Therefore, we conducted a telemetry study to assess annual adult and subadult and overwinter age-0 Lake Sturgeon habitat selection and suitability in two Missouri River U.S. tributaries near the southern edge of the species range. Spring habitat selection models were unable to define spawning habitat criteria, but criteria from other studies suggest that substrate and depths for spawning are suitable in both rivers. In the summer and winter, adult and subadult Lake Sturgeon exhibited strong selection for pools greater than 8 m deep, which comprised less than 5% of our study streams. Habitat selection in the fall and winter by age-0 Lake Sturgeon differed from adults with age-0s selecting shallower habitats both rivers and swifter current velocities in the Gasconade River. General habitat patterns persisted for both life stages in each river regardless of habitat availability, suggesting specialized habitat requirements in southern Lake Sturgeon that differ from previously studied populations further north. These results may be used to direct sampling for validation of reproduction and restoration of not only spawning habitats, but age-0 and summer and winter refugia that may be potential restoration bottlenecks for southern Lake Sturgeon populations.

J	ROTT, E				ROTT, E			THE LIGHT CLIMATE OF A SMALL DEEP LAKE (PIBURGER SEE, AUSTRIA) AND ITS INFLUENCE ON PHYTOPLANKTON PRODUCTION	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The influence of light on phytoplankton photosynthesis in the mesotrophic and meromictic Piburger See is investigated by the temporal analysis of the components of the underwater light climate. The annual time course of global radiation is affected by topographical screening of the horizon, which accentuates the difference in energy income between summer and winter. From December to April additional light attenuation by the winter cover causes a limitation of photosynthesis. During the ice-free seasons the vertical light gradient (of the most penetrating component) controls the structure of the photosynthesis depth profile. In spring, however, the maximum phytoplankton density in mid-depth layers causes irregular vertical distribution of photosynthesis. Phytoplankton is highly productive in near-surface layers in summer, as is shown by the maximum photosynthetic capacity found, i.e. 7.9 mg C .cntdot. mg chlor-1 .cntdot. h-1.																			0003-9136					JUL	1986	107	1					89	117																WOS:A1986D587100005

Dynamics of planktonic prokaryotes and dissolved carbon in a subtropical coastal lake	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												To understand the dynamics of planktonic prokaryotes in a subtropical lake and its relationship with carbon, we conducted water sampling through four 48-h periods in Peri Lake for 1 year. Planktonic prokaryotes were characterized by the abundance and biomass of heterotrophic bacteria (HB) and of cyanobacteria (coccoid and filamentous cells). During all samplings, we measured wind speed, water temperature (WT), pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), precipitation, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and carbon dioxide (CO2). DOC was higher in the summer (average = 465 mu M-WT = 27 degrees C) and lower in the winter (average = 235 mu M-WT = 17 degrees C), with no significant variability throughout the daily cycles. CO2 concentrations presented a different pattern, with a minimum in the warm waters of the summer period (8.31 mu M) and a maximum in the spring (37.13 mu M). Daily trends were observed for pH, DO, WT, and CO2. At an annual scale, both biological and physical-chemical controls were important regulators of CO2. HB abundance and biomass were higher in the winter sampling (5.60 x 10(9) cells L-1 and 20.83 mu mol C L-1) and lower in the summer (1.87 x 10(9) cells L-1 and 3.95 mu m mol C L-1). Filamentous cyanobacteria (0.23 x 10(8)-0.68 x 10(8) filaments L-1) produced up to 167.16 mu mol C L-1 as biomass (during the warmer period), whereas coccoid cyanobacteria contributed only 0.38 mu mol C L-1. Precipitation, temperature, and the biomass of HB were the main regulators of CO2 concentrations. Temperature had a negative effect on the concentration of CO2, which may be indirectly attributed to high heterotroph activity in the autumn and winter periods. DOC was positively correlated with the abundance of total cyanobacteria and negatively with HB. Thus, planktonic prokaryotes have played an important role in the dynamics of both dissolved inorganic and organic carbon in the lake.

Seasonal dynamics of internal waves governed by stratification stability and wind: Analysis of high-resolution observations from the Dead Sea	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Internal waves in stratified lakes are affected by the seasonally varying stratification and the wind forcing. We studied the seasonal dynamics of internal waves by means of high-resolution observations and model simulations for the Dead Sea. A two-layer hydrostatic model provided high correlations between measured thermocline depth and the lake level oscillations. Seasonally, the amplitude of the thermocline fluctuations were anticorrelated with the density difference between the water layers; the largest fluctuations were observed when stratification was weak in spring/fall and moderate to weak fluctuations in mid-summer when stratification was fully developed. The surface and the internal waves propagated counterclockwise along the coasts at a speed of ~0.5 m s(-1). Power spectra of the observed wind as well as the measured and simulated lake level and thermocline depth show a pronounced diurnal period during summer, suggesting forcing by the diurnally varying wind. During spring and fall, when the water column stability diminishes, a hint of longer wind periods appear in addition to the diurnal mode. Accordingly, the lake level and thermocline depth fluctuations respond at lower frequencies. In the fall, the longer wind periods are close to the lake's first vertical normal mode, suggesting that resonant amplification of the internal waves may explain the observed lower frequency response of the level and thermocline oscillations. Reduction of the stratification stability originating from anthropogenic water diversion over the past four decades, associated with lake level decline and salinity increase, have led to increases of internal waves amplitude and periods.					; Lensky‬‏, Nadav/AAL-7950-2021	, Nadav/0000-0002-4726-1668; Arnon, Ali/0000-0002-7943-659X; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				SEP	2019	64	5					1864	1882		10.1002/lno.11156	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11156													WOS:000485001400003
J	Kletti, LL; Stefan, HG				Kletti, LL; Stefan, HG			Correlations of climate and streamflow in three Minnesota streams	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Correlations between four climate parameters and streamflow in three Minnesota streams were investigated. Runoff values measured over periods of up to 37 years were correlated with precipitation, air temperature, wind, and dew point temperature. The overall objective was to examine if relationships can be obtained which require only readily available input parameters without calibration. Such relationships would be of great use, e.g. to compute future lake water budgets without recourse to more detailed and complex hydrologic runoff models. Monthly, seasonal, and annual time frames were investigated. A seasonal time frame using 3 month averages gave the closest fit for the linear regressions without time lag. Although the watershed sizes varied from 360 to 49,600 square kilometers, the 3 month period seemed sufficiently long to average long term hydrologic processes such as infiltration, evaporation, and groundwater flow. An equation was found for each season (3 months) for each of the rivers. Winter (December, January, February) regressions required only precipitation data; spring regressions required air temperature and precipitation; summer and fall regressions were found with precipitation, air temperature, dew point temperature, and wind speed. The coefficients in the regression equations were related to the watershed characteristics, The r(2) values were highest for the Zumbro River in spring (0.69) and lowest for the Baptism River in winter (0.14). Root mean square error values ranged from 2.8 mm/mo for the Mississippi River in winter to 18 mm/mo for the Baptism River in spring. The coefficients of variability (CV) ranged from 0.24 to 0.52. Overall the results were disappointing but not all bad. Climate parameters without watershed parameters can characterize runoff only within limits. To project possible future runoff averages the GISS GCM-values for the 2 x CO2 climate scenario were applied to the seasonal runoff regression equations. The projections were that the spring runoff values would decrease by up to 35% while in the other seasons streamflows would increase by up to 50%. Annual runoff would not change significantly enough to be predictable. The results were in the range of changes predicted by other investigations using very different techniques. Since predictions were based on equations found with past records, it was implied that the land cover would remain unchanged in the 2 x CO2 environment. This may be unrealistic and needs further investigation.																			0165-0009					DEC	1997	37	4					575	600		10.1023/A:1005396601785	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1005396601785													WOS:A1997YL62400001

Organochlorine contaminants in water, sediment and fish of Lake Burullus, Egyptian Mediterranean Sea	BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												Lake Burullus is one of the Delta lakes, connected with the Mediterranean Sea through El Boughaz opening. Concentrations of organochlorine contaminants were measured in water, sediments and biota of the lake because of concerns about their effects on its productivity. The concentrations of chlorinated hydrocarbons decreased in the order of PCBs > DDTs > TC > HCHs for all water samples collected from Lake Burullus during 2006. Higher concentrations were recorded during summer season, this clearly affected by higher agricultural and sewage activities. The concentrations of DDTs in water were ranged from 0.07 to 221.9 ng L-1; 46.3-656.5 ng L-1; 94.3-882.6 ng L-1 and 24.8-233 ng L-1 during winter, spring, summer and autumn, respectively. Among DDTs metabolites p,p-DDE was the most dominant with a maximum of 520.13 ng L-1 recorded at station 10 ( El Boughaz opening). In sediment samples, PCBs concentrations were ranged from 4.6 to 213.9 ng g(-1) with an average 47.2 ng g(-1); dry weight. Total pesticides were higher than PCBs for mostly all sediment samples of Lake Burullus. Concentrations of DDTs in fish tissues were ranged from 2.76 to 24.23 ng g(-1) and from 14.16 to 45.13 ng g(-1); wet weight for Oresochromus niloticus and Clarries sp., respectively.						O.

Estimating potential menhaden consumption by double-crested cormorants along the coast of North Carolina	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												The south Atlantic coast supports one of the highest assemblages of non-breeding double-crested cormorants (Nannopterum auritum) known and is a convergence area for Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus) during the winter months. We surveyed cormorants along the coast of North Carolina and used a bioenergetics approach to estimate potential menhaden consumption. We estimated cormorant numbers using a network of repeatable aerial transects along the outer coast (366 km) and within sounds (266 km) during fall migration, winter and spring migration (2019-2021). We estimated the number of bird days, metabolic demand and menhaden equivalents of demand. Cormorant numbers peaked around 122,000 to 131,000 during southward migration, reached a low of 30,000 to 39,000 in winter and then increased to 67,000 to 68,000 during northward migration. We did not capture the peak of spring migration during the study period (20 November through 24 March). We estimated the number of cormorant days within the study period to be 8.6 x 10(6) and 9.2 x 10(6) for the two field seasons respectively. We estimated that cormorants consumed approximately 5,334 and 5,660 mt of menhaden equivalents within the study area. Estimated consumption peaked between 76 and 81 mt(-d) during fall passage and reached a low of 19 and 24 mt(-d) during the winter. Annual menhaden take by humans and predatory fish is around 354,000 mt. Menhaden consumption by cormorants within the study area represents 4% of the commercial and recreational take and 7% of the estimated consumption by predatory fish or 2.5% of the known take.																				2296-7745				JUN 14	2023	10								1193429	10.3389/fmars.2023.1193429	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2023.1193429													WOS:001018188500001
J	Cyr, H				Cyr, Helene			Substrate and fetch affect the emergence of freshwater mussels from lake sediments	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY												Unionid mussels are among the largest and longest-lived invertebrates in shallow benthic communities, where they often make up most of the biomass. However, they spend their juvenile stages and extended periods of their adult lives buried in the sediments and emerge from the sediments only during part of the year. I tested whether the magnitude and timing of emergence of Elliptio complanata, an abundant native mussel, are related to water temperature, upwelling activity, site exposure, and sediment characteristics. Seasonal changes in the density and average body size of mussels on the sediment surface were measured at 26 shallow (2-m) littoral sites in a multibasin lake to determine which factors are most useful in predicting their emergence. In general, densities started increasing in early spring, peaked in spring or sometime in summer, and declined through autumn, but the magnitude (ratio of minimum-to-maximum surface density) and timing (date of maximum surface density, start of autumn decline) of emergence differed between sites. Maximum mussel surface density was on average (median) 2X higher than minimum surface density and was higher at exposed sites with fine sediment particles than at more protected sites. The timing of mussel emergence and burial were most closely related to site exposure. Mussels reached their maximum surface density earlier, but they also started burying earlier at the most exposed sites (effective fetch > 900 m). At more protected sites, maximum densities were reached later in summer, after the main period of reproduction, and densities did not start declining until late summer. The only exceptions were 2 protected sites with deep, fine, highly organic and, presumably, anoxic sediments, where mussels emerged early in the spring and did not bury until late in the season. The timing of mussel emergence varied greatly in different parts of the littoral zone. These results suggest that the functional role of unionid mussels in shallow benthic communities might change seasonally and might change differently at sites exposed to different levels of physical disturbance.																			0887-3593					JUN	2009	28	2					319	330		10.1899/08-133.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1899/08-133.1													WOS:000266645700006
J	Mochizuki, A; Hosoda, K; Sugiyama, M				Mochizuki, Akihito; Hosoda, Ko; Sugiyama, Masahito			Characteristic seasonal variation in dissolved uranium concentration induced by the change of lake water pH in Lake Biwa, Japan	LIMNOLOGY												Epilimnion-dominated profiles of dissolved uranium (U) have been observed during summer in an oxygenated Japanese lake, Lake Biwa, contrary to the commonly accepted view that U shows conservative behavior in oxygenated seas and lakes. Monthly observations were conducted to reveal the mechanism for such characteristic distribution and geochemical behavior of dissolved U in the lake. In the surface water, dissolved U concentration started to increase in spring, peaked in summer, and decreased from autumn to winter. In contrast, the concentration remained almost constant in the middle layer (40 m depth) and decreased slightly in the bottom layer (70 m depth) throughout the stagnation period. Mass balance calculations of U suggest that the major mechanism for seasonal variations in the surface layer is the supply of U, not via water inflow from the watershed, but by internal chemical reactions within the lake. A laboratory experiment using the lake water and sediment demonstrated that U was desorbed from and adsorbed onto sediment in response to variations in lake water pH. From these results, it is inferred that the seasonal variation in the concentration of dissolved U in the epilimnion results mainly from the desorptive/adsorptive processes of U between sediment/water interface in response to variation in water pH, which is affected by biological activity in the lake.

J	Shang, W; Jin, SG; He, Y; Zhang, YY; Li, J				Shang, Wei; Jin, Shuanggen; He, Yang; Zhang, Yuanyuan; Li, Jian			Spatial-Temporal Variations of Total Nitrogen and Phosphorus in Poyang, Dongting and Taihu Lakes from Landsat-8 Data	WATER												Poyang Lake, Dongting Lake, and Taihu Lake are the largest freshwater lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, China. In recent years, the eutrophication level of lakes has increased with the development of the social economy and caused many environmental and social problems. The concentrations of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) are the key indicators of the degree of eutrophication, but the traditional ground monitoring methods are not capable of capturing such parameters in whole lakes with high spatial-temporal resolution. In this paper, empirical models are established and evaluated between the TN and TP and remote sensing spectral factors in the three lakes using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite data and in-situ data. The results show that the inversion accuracy is higher than 75%. The TN and TP concentrations in the three lakes are inversed based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform from 2014 to 2020 and their spatial-temporal variations are analyzed. The results show that the concentrations of TN and TP in Poyang Lake were decreased by 5.99% and 7.13% over 7 years, respectively, and the TN in Dongting Lake was decreased by 5.25% while the TP remained stable. The temporal changes in TN and TP concentrations displayed seasonal variations. A low concentration was observed in summer and high concentrations were in spring and winter. The average concentrations of TN and TP in Taihu Lake were higher than that of the other two lakes. The TP concentration was increased by 17.3% over 7 years, while the TN concentration remained almost stable. The variation in TN in Taihu Lake was the same as the growth cycle of algae, with higher value in spring and winter and lower value in summer, while the concentration of TP was lower in spring and winter and higher in summer. The spatial distribution of TN and TP concentrations in the three major lakes was significantly affected by human activities, and the concentrations of TN and TP were higher in areas near cities and agricultural activities.

J	Mellina, E; Hinch, SG; MacKenzie, KD				Mellina, E; Hinch, SG; MacKenzie, KD			Seasonal movement patterns of stream-dwelling rainbow trout in north-central British Columbia, Canada	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Movement forms an important part of salmonid life histories, and although previous studies have largely concluded that the majority of stream-dwelling salmonids are sedentary, the paradigm of restricted movement has been questioned by recent findings. We conducted a 3-year study to examine the seasonal movement patterns of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss in three small, lake-headed streams situated in north-central British Columbia and to determine whether movement was related to environmental conditions. Two of the three streams were subjected to streatuside clear-cut logging during the second year. The trout in our study streams generally remained sedentary during the summer, autumn, and winter seasons for a period of approximately 1-2 years before undertaking long-range (> 372-607-m) movements during springtime. These springtime long-range movements were most closely linked to stream discharge, as they generally ceased with the onset Of Summer low flows (< 10-20 L/s), but they did not resume in the autumn despite increasing flows. Links between movement patterns and stream temperature were less clear, as long-range movements occurred over a wide range (0-30 degrees C) of temperatures. The predominant direction of long-range movements was lakeward. All three streams supported relatively large populations of resident trout during the summer and autumn months; densities of 0.4-1.0 trout/dm(2) were primarily associated with age-0 to age-2 fish. Our data provide insights into how the movement patterns and life history strategies of stream-dwelling rainbow trout are intertwined, as well as how the timing of sampling efforts may be an important factor when assessing whether stream-dwelling fish are sedentary or mobile.																			0002-8487					JUL	2005	134	4					1021	1037		10.1577/T03-188.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T03-188.1													WOS:000230411700021

Waxing and waning slacks: The changing ecohydrology of interdunal wetlands/slacks in a Lake Michigan coastal dune complex during rising Lake Michigan-Huron levels	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Since 2016 we have studied the largest interdunal wetlands/slack lying within a deflated parabolic dune east of Lake Michigan. Geologic cross-sections show ti 15 m of sand and gravel beneath the dunes, creating an aquifer hydraulically connecting Lake Michigan-Huron (MH) with the water table/shallow groundwater influencing the slack. Lake Michigan-Huron (MH) water levels have risen ti 1 m from 2016 to 2020, increasing water levels within and around the slack ti 1 m. Color-infrared images and vegetation quadrat sampling show water appearing, then significantly expanding with the main slack and upland/dune vegetation transitioning to wetland vegetation in response to this rise. Monitoring well data show slack water levels rise in spring as Lake MH rises. Levels drop as the growing season begins while Lake MH continues to rise through summer. Short-term slack water level increases occur due to local rain events, but significant water level declines follow due to evapotranspiration. Slack water levels begin to rise again in late summer and into fall as the end of the growing season arrives, evapotranspiration decreases, and heavier, more frequent rain events occur. Together, these factors push slack water levels to their highest point of the year while Lake MH levels are decreasing. In late fall-winter, slack water levels drop in concert with Lake MH levels. Climate change effects, increased transpiration from higher temperatures, summer drought, and greater variability in lake level fluctuations, may make it more difficult to maintain wet growing conditions for hydrophytic vegetation. Hence, climate change poses risks to the existence of this imperiled ecosystem. (c) 2021 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Features of the Under-Ice Development of Phytoplankton in Northern Lakes	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												The structure of phytoplankton during the under-ice period in northern oligotrophic lakes (Lake Krivoe and Lake Krugloe) has been considered and its level of development during ice melt is assessed. In winter 2019-2021, cyanobacteria, diatoms, and cryptophyte algae were noted in phytoplankton. The phytoplankton spring increase in Lake Krivoe was due to the development of the dinophyte Peridinium aciculiferum and, in Lake Krugloe, to the diatom Aulacoseira subarctica. Biomass varied from 0.003 to 0.083 mg/L in winter and up to 0.65 mg/L in spring. The spring peak (April-May) of phytoplankton is associated with the development of dinophyte algae and exceeded summer values. The average Chl a concentration in plankton reached 0.3-0.4 mu g/L. The cryoflora contained algae frozen into the ice in an inactive state (0.003-0.04 mg/L). The development of phytoplankton under the ice makes an important contribution to the productivity of northern lakes.

Five vegetation types are separated, dominated by 1) white spruce, 2) balsam poplar, 3) black spruce, 4) alder/willow shrubs, and 5) bog/fen/nonforest vegetation. Open water of rivers and lakes is also separated. Accuracy of forest classification is investigated as a function of frequency and polarization of the radar, as well as the forest seasonal state, which includes winter/frozen, winter/thawed, spring/flooded, spring/unflooded, and summer/dry conditions. Classifications indicate that C-band is a more useful frequency for separating forest types than L- or P-bands, and HV polarization is the most useful polarization at all frequencies. The highest classification accuracy, with 90 percent of forest pixels classified correctly, is obtained by combining L-band HV and C-band HV data acquired in spring as seasonal river flooding recedes and before deciduous tree species have leaves. In 17 forest stands for which actual percentages of each tree species are known, the same radar data are capable of predicting tree species composition with less than 10 percent error. For the same combination of observation channels, classification accuracy is 79 percent in spring on a day of intense river flooding, and 62 percent on a dry summer day with leaves on deciduous trees. In winter, using 4-look SAR data instead of 16-look, classification accuracy is 55 percent on a frozen day, and 76 percent on a thawed day. White spruce and balsam poplar stands are best separated in thawed conditions when balsam poplar trees have no leaves. From our classification, we predict that current and future spaceborne SAR systems will have limited mapping capabilities when used alone. Yet, RADARSAT combined with J-ERS-1 and ERS-1 could resolve forest types with 80 percent accuracy, separate nonforest areas resulting from commercial logging or forest wildfire, and map river edges. For comparison, a combination of green, red, and near-infrared radiance data acquired by SPOT-2 on a dry summer day yields a classification accuracy of 83 percent for the same forest stands, with limited success in distinguishing among deciduous forest types and among coniferous forest types.

Seasonal movement of burbot in relation to temperature and discharge in the Kootenai River, Idaho, USA and British Columbia, Canada	BURBOT: ECOLOGY, MANAGEMENT AND CULTURE	American Fisheries Society Symposium				2nd International Burbo Symposium	SEP 13, 2005	Anchorage, AK					Movements of 11 sonic tagged burbot Lota Iota were examined in the Kootenai River, Idaho, USA and Kootenay River and Kootenay Lake, British Columbia, Canada through up to three spawning seasons. Our objectives were to determine seasonal movements, differences in behavior of individual burbot, and the role of temperature and discharge on prespawn movement. Burbot demonstrated multiple movement patterns: 3 burbot were very mobile, 3 appeared to be intermediate in activity, and 5 were sedentary in summer, while 2 of the 11 entered Kootenay Lake and returned to the river. Most burbot began in autumn what may have been prespawn migrations when river temperatures fell to a range of 3.0-4.9 degrees C. Six burbot entered the Goat River during the spawning season, of which five showed a multiple-year pattern of fidelity, and four returned to an apparent home pool and then exhibited sedentary behavior until the following winter. Three of the 11 burbot demonstrated an apparent nonspawning or rest year, but this was thought to be habitat-related. Logistic regression analysis of three of the six fish entering the Goat River suggested their migration to be best correlated to decreasing temperature and discharge. If the logistic model were representative of the population, then predicted migrations of burbot to the Goat River during winter would have followed a consistent pattern in November preLibby Dam, while postLibby Dam showed migrations to be unpredictable. Results of this study suggest that burbot had multiple life history patterns and several spawning locations and that rehabilitation measures should promote cooler winter water temperatures less than 5 degrees C and discharges less than 300 m(3)/S.																			0892-2284		978-1-888569-98-8				2008	59						55	77																WOS:000253841600004

The following were observed for both types of BF: 1) Concentrations of ammonium, nitrate, nitrite, and phosphate ions were much (hundreds to thousands of times) higher in the BFs than in the surrounding lake water; 2) the concentration of ions, especially nitrate ions, in the BFs changed seasonally, being higher from winter to spring and lower from summer to autumn, synchronizing with the changes in the lake water; 3) dissolved-form N:P ratios were higher in the lake water than BFs; and 4) the bacterial flora of the BFs differed from that of the lake water, with smaller seasonal variations. The present study reveals for the first time that the inside of BFs in a natural environment is rich in nutrient ions and shows similar seasonal changes as the lake water. The BFs in an aquatic environment provide a microenvironment capable of sustaining a specific bacterial flora different from that in the surrounding lake water.

Sedimentary oxygen dynamics in a seasonally hypoxic basin	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Seasonal hypoxia refers to the oxygen depletion that occurs in summer in the bottom water of stratified systems, and is increasingly observed in coastal areas worldwide. The process induces a seasonal cycle on the biogeochemistry of the underlying sediments, which remains poorly quantified. Here, we investigated the sedimentary oxygen consumption within Lake Grevelingen (The Netherlands), a saline coastal reservoir that is impacted by yearly recurrent bottom water hypoxia. Monthly sampling campaigns were conducted throughout 2012 at three sites along a depth gradient. Macrofauna sampling and sediment profile imaging demonstrated how summer hypoxia strongly impacts the benthic communities below 15 m of water depth. Benthic fluxes of oxygen, dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity, and ammonium were determined by closed core incubations, while oxygen depth profiles were recorded by microsensor profiling of sediment cores. Our results reveal a pronounced seasonality in the sedimentary oxygen consumption. Low uptake rates in summer were caused by oxygen limitation, and resulted in the build-up of an "oxygen debt" through the accumulation of reduced iron sulfides. Highest oxygen uptake rates were recorded in fall, linked to the reoxidation of the pool of iron sulfides in the top layer. However, uptake rates remained unexpectedly high during winter and early spring, likely associated with the oxidation of iron sulfides down to centimeters depth due to the electrogenic sulfur oxidation by cable bacteria. Overall, our results suggest that the sedimentary oxygen dynamic in seasonally hypoxic coastal systems is characterized by a strongly amplified "oxygen debt" dynamics induced by cable bacteria.

The spatiotemporal dynamics of invasive three-spined sticklebacks in a large, deep lake and possible options for stock reduction	FISHERIES RESEARCH												A combination of fishing and surveying methods (trawling, gillnetting, electrofishing and hydroacoustics) were used to obtain insight into the spatiotemporal dynamics of invasive three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) in the pelagic zone of Upper Lake Constance. The resulting information is highly pertinent to the development of management strategies to reduce the negative impact of sticklebacks on the pelagic ecosystem of the lake, and especially on the commercially important native pelagic whitefish (Coregonus wartmanni). The results indicate that sticklebacks are very mobile and opportunistic with respect to habitat selection, making extensive shifts between benthic and pelagic habitats. The greatest abundances of sticklebacks in the pelagic zone were identified in late summer, shortly after their spawning, when densities exceeding 10,000 individuals per hectare were recorded. A second peak occurred in winter, during the spawning season of pelagic whitefish. Data from gillnetting indicate high stickleback densities in the littoral zone of the lake during the spawning season of benthic whitefish (Coregonus macrophthalmus). Thus, damaging predation of pelagic and benthic whitefish eggs and larvae by sticklebacks seems very likely. Electrofishing surveys in tributary rivers revealed that these were used irregularly as migration routes and are therefore unlikely to represent a significant habitat for stickleback reproduction. Depth distribution of sticklebacks in the pelagic zone changed throughout the year with highest densities at depths of 9-12 m in spring, summer and autumn, while in winter densities were highest at 15-18 m. The most efficient option for capturing sticklebacks is trawling during September, at depths of 9-12 m, where very large catches were recorded without significant bycatch of non-target species. This method of control would require special fishing vessels not currently deployed on the lake and its economic feasibility will require careful assessment.					; Brinker, Alexander/ABF-4644-2020	Brinker, Alexander/0000-0002-2433-5652; Baer, Jan/0000-0001-8388-6684; 													0165-7836	1872-6763				DEC	2020	232								105746	10.1016/j.fishres.2020.105746	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2020.105746													WOS:000580905400020
J	Ge, YX; Abuduwaili, J; Ma, L; Liu, DW				Ge, Yongxiao; Abuduwaili, Jilili; Ma, Long; Liu, Dongwei			Temporal Variability and Potential Diffusion Characteristics of Dust Aerosol Originating from the Aral Sea Basin, Central Asia	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												The drastic desiccation of the Aral Sea has led to severe desertification of the former lake areas. Dust storms occur frequently, causing regional environmental degradation of the Aral basin and a serious ecological disaster. Knowledge of the temporal variability in dust emissions and the potential diffusion characteristics of dust aerosol originating from the Aral Sea basin in recent years are, however, lacking. To address this knowledge gap, we studied the interannual and intraannual changes in dust aerosol from the Aral Sea basin and its potentially seasonal diffusion characteristics from 2005 to 2013 using Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) aerosol data (2005-2013) and the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. Results show that the OMI aerosol index (AI) annual mean, standard deviation, median, and maximum values exhibit a strong increasing trend because of the continuous decrease in the water level since 2005. The annually mean OMI AI increases to 1.47 by 2013. Peak AI values are recorded in spring (March-May) and early winter (November-January of the following year), indicating notifying seasonal differences. The potential distance and height of air parcel trajectories to the northeast are greater than those to the west and south, whereas the air parcel trajectory proportion of the former is lower than that of the latter. The potential transport distance of dust aerosol to the northeast is greatest in spring and winter. This transport distance is less in autumn, with the minimum observed in summer. Dust transport distance to the west and south in different seasons is not significantly different. The present results may help in further understanding the emission, long-range transport, and deposition of dust from the dry lake bed of the Aral Sea as well as providing a motivation for the sensible use and protection of these tail-end lakes.					ma, long/JHU-2289-2023; Liu, Dongwei/AAB-9976-2021; ge, yongxiao/K-1251-2012	Ma, Long/0000-0002-8233-8640; ji, li li/0000-0001-8483-1554; Liu, Dongwei/0000-0002-1213-6795; 													0049-6979	1573-2932				FEB	2016	227	2							63	10.1007/s11270-016-2758-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-016-2758-6													WOS:000378782400001

We observed the longitudinal distributions of physical (water temperature, particle diameter of the bed sediment, sediment layer thickness, etc.), chemical [pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), phosphate (PO4-P), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) content of the sediment, etc.], and biological (species composition, biomass, and growth rate) factors related to E. densa in the Kurohashi River, a spring-fed stream flowing into the Lake Biwa. It was found that E. densa growth rate from summer to autumn was negatively correlated to pH and DO, which implies that the low pH spring water increases the growth rate of the species. The growth rate was also positively correlated to the free carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration (r = 0.67, p = 0.02). These results indicate that the low pH spring water increases E. densa growth rate by affecting free CO2 concentration in water.

However, whether nutrient was still be a better predictor of Chla when potential affecting variables were taken together, and whether the critical TN:TP (total nitrogen: total phosphorus, by mass) threshold for classifying nutrient limitation varied with lake type remain uncertain. Furthermore, it remains largely unknown to what extent small zooplankton (SZ) can affect the nutrients-Chla relationships. Here, an investigation on how Chla responded to abiotic factors and SZ dynamics was performed in 21 subtropical shallow lakes along the lower reach of Chinese Yangtze River. These lakes were subdivided into two lake types including urban lakes featured by a low water exchange rate, and suburban lakes with hydrological connectivity. Chla and TP:Chla ratio were generally higher and lower in urban lakes than those in suburban lakes, respectively. Various analyses revealed that TP and water temperature were the key factors regulating Chla in urban and suburban lakes, respectively. Across urban lakes, TP accounted for >50% of the Chla variances in spring, autumn, and winter, but only explained 28% of summer Chla. However, if the sampling sites where SZ density was >17.5 times higher than that in spring were removed, the determination coefficient (R-2) in the linear regression analysis between TP and summer Chla increased (from 0.28 to 0.57), and the Akaike Information Criterion decreased. Furthermore, TP:Chla was positively correlated with SZ in urban lakes in spring when the highest density of SZ (HSZ): the lowest density of SZ (LSZ) ratio was 456 (>17.5), while that interrelationship was not found in summer with the HSZ:LSZ ratio of 17.5. Therefore, the weak TP-summer Chla relationship in urban lakes was primarily caused by SZ when their density exceeded a 17.5-fold increase, i.e. small zooplankton could adopt "quantity-driven" strategy for phytoplankton control. For further strengthening the eutrophication management and remediation in subtropical urban lakes, it is critical to recover aquatic vegetation that can not only absorb P directly but provide refuge for zooplankton instead of dredging the sediments completely. In addition, we recommended that TN:TP ratio exceeding 20.0 could be the threshold identifying P-limitation in urban lakes rather than suburban lakes, and transparency can be used as rough indicators for measuring TP and Chla concentrations (<25 mu m) in urban lakes.					xu, jinqian/LDF-9919-2024; wu, bowen/MIO-5049-2025; Wang, Xiaodong/LTF-2079-2024														1470-160X	1872-7034				FEB	2022	135								108571	10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.108571	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.108571		JAN 2022											WOS:000761282000007

In American black ducks (Anas rubripes) total Hg in duck breast muscle increased with residence time on contaminated marshes, reaching means of 0.82 +/- 0.21 mu g/g ww (wet weight) by the end of the fall hunting season, and prompting Maine to issue a human consumption advisory on duck breast muscle. Methyl Hg comprised over 99% of the total Hg in breast muscle. The ratio of Hg concentrations in blood and muscle were strongly correlated and approached 1: 1 after extended residence times. Primary feather (P1) total Hg concentrations averaged 2.2 +/- 1.3 mu g/g fw (fresh weight), verifying low Hg exposure during feather growth on distant breeding grounds the preceding summer. Mercury concentrations in black ducks, following winter residence along the lower Penobscot exceeded levels associated with reproductive toxicity. Carry-over of Hg to summer breeding grounds may limit the subsequent reproductive success of black ducks. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.						Kopec, A.

Current State of the Selenga River Waters in the Russian Territory Concerning Major Components and Trace Elements	CHEMISTRY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT												Studies were performed concerning the seasonal dynamics of major ions (Na+, Mg2+, K+, Ca2+, SO42-, Cl-, HCO3-), Si, 52 trace elements, organic carbon, pH, O-2 in the Selenga River, the main tributary of Lake Baikal and the rivers flowing into the Selenga in the Russian territory, the flow paths and lakes of the delta within the barrier area of Lake Baikal (up to 7 km from the mouth of the Selenga River). Using the factor analysis we revealed four main groups, those differ from each other in the spatial and temporal distribution of the components in the Selenga River. The first group comprises the water salinity, the major ions and trace elements, some conservative trace elements (B, Br, Sr, Mo, Ba, Re, U). The concentration values for these components are maximal within the ice period (March) and minimal within the flood period (May), exhibit an increase on the frontier with Mongolia reducing towards the mouth as being diluted by less saline water of the tributaries of the Selenga River. The elements of the second group are connected with the content of dissolved organic matter capable of mobilizing difficultly soluble and almost insoluble elements (Be, Al, Ti, Fe, Ni, Cu, Ga, Y, Zr, Nb, Hf, REE, Pb, Th) to produce fine-dispersed organomineral complexes. The concentration values for these elements demonstrate increasing in the spring, in the course of the snowmelt and of an active removal of organic matter from the catchment area. The third group of the elements (Si, Li, Cr, Mn, Co, Zn, Ge, Rb, Ag, Cd, Sn, Cs, Bi) reflects the processes of water acidifying against the background of seasonal dynamics inherent in the dissolved oxygen. Concentration values for these elements increase towards the mouth (except for Co within the period of spring and autumn, as well as Ge in winter), being to a significant extent increased in the winter. The fourth group of the elements (V, As, Sb, I, W, Cu) represents a marker of a weak cross-border transfer in summer. Increased concentration values of these elements are observed in July, especially on the upper section of the river (0-120 km from the frontier with Mongolia). The maximum and average weighted concentrations of the most of trace elements in the Selenga River are lower than those inherent in the global natural river background. Exceeding the maximum background concentration values is observed for Mo (10 %), Mn (10 %) and Ge (60 %). Average weighted background concentration values exhibit a 2-to 5-fold exceeding in Zr (2.1), Nb (2.1), Sr (2.5), Ti (2.9), U (3.5), Y (3.5), Zn (3.7), Mo (3.8) and Sn (4.9), which could be caused by the geological structure of the basin and the naturally occurring processes of mobilizing the elements. The concentration of Mo, Mn, Cu, Al, Fe, V in the general river station of the Selenga River and the tributaries thereof in some seasons are slightly higher than Russian standards established for fish-industry water basins (in 80 % of cases less than 2 MPC). Within the barrier zone of Lake Baikal there is an excess over the fish industry water standards in Mo registered to be constant (1.2-2.1 MPC): for Cu in winter (up to 1.8 MPC), in summer (up to 1.9 MPC), in autumn (up to 1.3 MPC); for V in summer (up to 1.6 MPC); for Mn in winter (up to 2.2 MPC).

Mitigating trophic level under endogenous phosphorus release is an unsolved problem in eutrophic lakes. However, understanding the dynamics and assembly of microbial communities encoding the alkaline phosphatase ( phoD community) and their responses during trophic transitions in eutrophic lakes is limited. In this study, we compared the composition and assembly mechanisms of phoD communities in four seasons in the Yilong Lake, a shallow lake of the Yunnan- Guizhou Plateau. The lake exhibits slightly eutrophic conditions in summer and mesotrophic conditions in spring, autumn, and winter. By analyzing seasonal variations, we observed that during summer, the relative abundance of Pseudomonas in the water had the highest value, while the Shannon-Wiener index of phoD communities was lowest. Mantel tests showed an increased Bray-Curtis dissimilarity of phoD communities in the water with rising eutrophication, a trend not observed in sediment. Notably, eutrophication heightened the homogeneity selection governing the assembly of phoD communities in water. The co-occurrence networks showed that the OTUs in the summer exhibited closer interconnections than those in other seasons. Additionally, the topological parameters from networks indicated that eutrophication is poised to instigate changes and modulate the dynamics of the microbial phoD community, resulting in markedly distinct seasonal behaviors. pH was identified as a critical factor directly influencing phoD community diversity via partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM). This study shed light on our understanding of the seasonal dynamics of phoD communities and their pivotal role in phosphorus cycling in eutrophic lakes.

Spatiotemporal distribution of bacterioplankton functional groups along a freshwater estuary to pelagic gradient in Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Freshwater bacteria play key roles in biogeochemical cycling and contribute significantly to biomass and energy fluxes. However, studies of Great Lakes ecosystem dynamics often omit bacteria. Here, we used high throughput sequencing to analyze how bacterial diversity and community composition (BCC) vary seasonally along the long-term Muskegon estuary to pelagic research transect. Diversity was higher in the estuary than Lake Michigan, in spring compared to summer, and for particle-associated (PA) relative to free-living (FL) fractions. PA communities were distinct from and more variable than FL communities. For both fractions, spring BCC was more similar between estuary and nearshore Lake Michigan compared to offshore waters. In summer and fall, nearshore and offshore BCC were more similar compared to estuary BCC. Most abundant taxa were inferred to be chemoorganoheterotrophs. While, as a whole, this functional group only showed habitat preference for the PA fraction, we observed phylum- and class-level seasonal and spatial preferences. Chemoorganoheterotrophs that also perform bacteriorhodopsin-mediated phototrophy, such as acI Actinobacteria and LD12, strongly preferred FL fractions. Photoautotrophs (Cyanobacteria) were least abundant in spring, when mixotrophic methylotrophs were more abundant, particularly in the estuary. Organisms with chemolithotrophic capabilities, including a mixotrophic, highly abundant Limnohabitans (Lhab-A1) OTU, showed limited spatiotemporal patterns. One exception was Nitrosospira, an autotrophic ammonium oxidizer, which peaked in deep offshore waters in fall. Nitrosospira co-occurred with Chloroflexi CL500-11, which likely mineralizes nitrogen-rich organic matter in deep waters. These spatiotemporal BCC shifts suggest differences in bacterially mediated elemental cycling along estuary to pelagic gradients in Lake Michigan.

The timing of Carcinus maenas recruitment to a south-east Australian estuary differs to that of native crabs	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Strong seasonal trends in reproduction and early development of many invasive species are commonplace and may differ between introduced and native ranges, reflecting differences in abiotic conditions that trigger reproduction, or in selective pressures. The invasive crab Carcinus maenas has been present in south-east Australia for over 100 years, but little is known about its recruitment to benthic substrates in this introduced range. This study assessed the timing of C. maenas and native crab recruitment to Merimbula Lake (36.89(o)S, 149.92(o)E) south-eastern Australia between August 2011 and October 2013. It also assessed the effectiveness of four different types of recruitment bags for detecting the invasive crab. Carcinus maenas recruited in greater numbers to bags that contained live oysters than those with oyster shell, artificial turf or without structure. Recruitment of C. maenas peaked in the late winter and spring, while recruitment of most native species peaked in autumn. The timing of C. maenas recruitment contrasted its native European range where recruitment typically occurs in summer and autumn. Although likely triggered by the warmer water temperatures of south-eastern Australia, this differing reproductive phenology of C. maenas between its native and Australian range may also modify its interactions with native crab recruits.

Whether the previously observed climate changes stimulate carbon uptake via enhanced photosynthesis or carbon loss via enhanced soil respiration remains unclear. Here we present 14 years of observations of carbon fluxes, meteorological variables and remotely sensed plant cover estimations from a central Tibetan alpine steppe ecosystem at Nam Co, the third largest lake on the TP. Using modified Mann-Kendall trend tests, we found a significant increasing daily net carbon uptake of 0.5 g C m(-2) decade(-1), which can be explained by a widespread greening at the southern shore of lake Nam Co. The Plateau-wide changes in temperature and precipitation are locally expressed as an increasing diurnal temperature range during winter, higher water availability during spring, higher cloud cover during early summer and less water availability during late summer. While these changes differ over the course of the year, they tend to stimulate plant growth more than microbial respiration, leading to an increased carbon uptake during all seasons. This study indicates that during the 14 years study period, a higher amplitude in winter temperatures and an earlier summer monsoon promote carbon uptake in a central Tibetan alpine steppe ecosystem.

A climatology of extreme wave height events impacting eastern Lake Ontario shorelines	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												Model-derived wave height data for points along the eastern Lake Ontario shoreline provide the basis for a 36-year climatology of extreme wave heights. The most extreme wave heights exceed 6m at all locations, except for those along the extreme northeastern shoreline of the Lake. Typically extreme wave events are a regional phenomenon, affecting multiple locations along the eastern and southeastern shoreline. A pronounced seasonal cycle in wave event occurrence is characterized by peaks in autumn and spring, with an absence of 99.9th percentile wave heights during summer. Less extreme (90th percentile heights) occur in all months with a peak in winter. Extreme wave events are most often associated with a low pressure center tracking to the north of Lake Ontario from the Ohio Valley. This track produces the strong winds >10ms(-1) and predominantly west-to-east wind fetch that characterize high wave height events. The seasonal frequency of the wave events exceeding the historical 95th percentile has shown a statistically significant increase at most locations since 1979. This has been partially offset by declines in the frequency of events with wave heights between the 90 and 95th percentile. Seasonal extreme wave height frequency is also found to be related to the occurrence of El Nino. During El Nino winters, there are significantly fewer events with wave heights exceeding 2.5m than would be expected by chance. A corresponding relationship to La Nina occurrence is not evident.																			0177-798X	1434-4483				APR	2019	136	1-2					543	552		10.1007/s00704-018-2502-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-018-2502-9													WOS:000464906200039

At the end of the study, from the 114 S. cephalus examined, 14 host fish specimens were infected with 75 Caryophyllaeus brachycollis (prevalence 12.3% and mean parasite intensity 5.3 +/- 10.0 parasites/fish) and one host fish specimen was infected with 65 Biacetabulum appendiculatum (prevalence 0.9%, 65 parasites). Infection data of the parasite species were evaluated for seasons, host fish size, and sex. The period of the study covered the four seasons: spring, summer, fall, and winter. The infection values of C. brachycollis changed according to seasonal conditions, except for fall. Prevalence of infection and mean intensity of the species were maximum in spring. Host fish specimens were divided into four groups according to their size. The occurrence of C. brachycollis was recorded in III, V and VI groups. The highest infection prevalence and mean intensity were seen in age group VI. C. brachycollis was recorded in both male and female hosts, but the occurrence of parasites was higher in females. The other species, Biacetabulum appendiculatum, was found in only one host fish specimen that belonged to group V according to its size in spring. According to the results of this study, among these species, Caryophyllaeus brachycollis is observed for the first time in Turkey, and Biacetabulum appendiculatum is a new parasite species record for S. cephalus in Turkey. Thus, a new locality and a new host fish species have been added to the geographical invasions by the two caryophyllaeid species.																			1300-0179	1303-6114					2016	40	1					1	5		10.3906/zoo-1403-67	http://dx.doi.org/10.3906/zoo-1403-67													WOS:000366496200001

Obvious seasonal variation of phytoplankton was observed, and the abundance of phytoplankton ranged from 2.02 x 10(6) to 57.9 x 10(6) cells/L. The dominant species in autumn and summer was Microcystis sp., Psephonema aenigmaticum Skuja was dominant in winter, and Microcystis sp., Aphanizonmenon flos-aquae, Asterionella sp., P. aenigmaticum, etc. were dominant in spring. The abundance of bacterioplankton in the whole lake changed between 1.93 x 10(9) and 4.61 x 10(9) cells/L showing distinct seasonal variation characteristics. The results of correlation and RDA indicated that the abundance and community diversity of bacterioplankton were significantly correlated with the abundance of phytoplankton, and the group of Bacteroidetes had obvious correlation with Microcystis sp. and other cyanobacteria, which might have some links with the harmful algal blooms in Lake Erhai. Further research is needed to study the mechanisms of interactions between phytoplankton and bacterioplankton communities.

Impacts of boreal hydroelectric reservoirs on seasonal climate and precipitation recycling as simulated by the CRCM5: a case study of the La Grande River watershed, Canada	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												Located in northern Quebec, Canada, eight hydroelectric reservoirs of a 9782-km(2) maximal area cover 6.4% of the La Grande watershed. This study investigates the changes brought by the impoundment of these reservoirs on seasonal climate and precipitation recycling. Two 30-year climate simulations, corresponding to pre- and post-impoundment conditions, were used. They were generated with the fifth-generation Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM5), fully coupled to a 1D lake model (FLake). Seasonal temperatures and annual energy budget were generally well reproduced by the model, except in spring when a cold bias, probably related to the overestimation of snow cover, was seen. The difference in 2-m temperature shows that reservoirs induce localized warming in winter (+0.7 +/- 0.02 A degrees C) and cooling in the summer (-0.3 +/- 0.02 A degrees C). The available energy at the surface increases throughout the year, mostly due to a decrease in surface albedo. Fall latent and sensible heat fluxes are enhanced due to additional energy storage and availability in summer and spring. The changes in precipitation and runoff are within the model internal variability. At the watershed scale, reservoirs induce an additional evaporation of only 5.9 mm year(-1) (2%). We use Brubaker's precipitation recycling model to estimate how much of the precipitation is recycled within the watershed. In both simulations, the maximal precipitation recycling occurs in July (less than 6%), indicating weak land-atmosphere coupling. Reservoirs do not seem to affect this coupling, as precipitation recycling only decreased by 0.6% in July.

Fish were sampled both in epibenthic and pelagic habitats simultaneously with sampling of zooplankton resources. (2) Depth distribution of both Arctic charr and brown trout was correlated with Secchi disc transparency. Sympatric brown trout lived mainly in littoral areas down to 1 Secchi disc unit and were even more confined to near-surface waters in the pelagic zone. Sympatric Arctic charr were most abundant in epibenthic areas between 2 and 5 Secchi disc units and between 1 and 2 units in pelagic habitats. However, allopatric charr used chiefly littoral areas down to 2 Secchi disc units, but they also utilized depths down to 8 Secchi disc units. (3) Generally, the food of allopatric and sympatric populations of Arctic charr differed greatly from that of brown trout. Typically the food overlap index calculated was lower than 70%. (4) A comparison between habitat use of allopatric and sympatric charr indicated that Arctic charr were excluded by brown trout from littoral areas during summer. However, this habitat segregation was broken down in November through winter. (5) Habitat and resource utilization between Arctic charr and brown trout was explained by selective differences and asymmetric competition with brown trout as the dominant species in shallow areas from spring through autumn. In late autumn through winter (November-May), Arctic charr may be superior to brown trout because of higher activity at low temperatures.																			0021-8790					OCT	1991	60	3					895	912		10.2307/5420	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/5420													WOS:A1991GL48900011

The model calculates the short-term temporal evolution of atmospheric trace gas concentrations and their deposition on the regional scale. This study is focused on oxidant production in the eastern United States and southeastern Canada. The influence of atmospheric conditions is explored by comparing three characteristic winter, summer and spring/fall cases. Base-case 1985 emissions of SO(x), NO(x), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), NH3 and CO are specified using the comprehensive pollutant emissions inventory developed as part of the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program (NAPAP). The perturbed case, which represents projected anthropogenic emission changes for 2010, indicates changes in daily total 80 km grid average NO(x) emissions ranging from increases of 75% to decreases of 45% and VOC emission changes ranging from increases of 65% to decreases of 20%. The largest NO(x) emission changes occur in the northeast, and the largest VOC changes occur in the Gulf Coast area. Ground level grid average midday O3 concentrations for the 1985 emission cases are highest (on the order of 70 to 100 ppb) in the New York City and Houston metropolitan areas for the summer and spring cases; the summer case also indicates relatively high grid average O3 concentrations of greater than 80 ppb in the southeast. Winter case values are much lower than summer O3 values throughout the region, with highs of 40 to 50 ppb occurring in the southeast and the Great Lakes area. Changes in NO(x) and other emissions under the complex 2010 emissions scenario for the summer case result in maximum O3 concentration reductions of 10% in the Houston area and increases in O3 of a few percent in some rural areas of the southeast. This study underscores the need for more comprehensive assessment of the complex relationships among regional emission changes, oxidant production and atmospheric conditions.																			0049-6979					MAR	1993	67	1-2					133	159		10.1007/BF00480818	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00480818													WOS:A1993LE66300010

The model performed well (R-2 = 0.74, RMSE = 8.58 mg/L), with validation (R-2 = 0.72, RMSE = 11.98 mg/L). Then, 464 VIIRS images (2012 similar to 2015) were used to estimate SPM concentrations. The results show that the concentrations of SPM increase in the autumn and winter and decrease in the spring and summer. While it is higher in the east and central area of the lake than in the north and west sections of the lake. Inter-annual comparisons show a decrease of suspended particulate matter( SPM) over the short four year period. The visible/infrared imager radiometer suite (VIIRS) performs well in estimating SPM in Lake Hongze, allowing for an extension of MODIS analysis approaches and improving the remote sensing of inland lakes in the future.

Concentrations in Lake Washington [Washington, USA], a monomictic lake, peaked at 1000-3300 per ml in the epilimnion during the last spring and summer and reached lows in October of less than 2 per ml prior to fall turnover. The reason for the decrease in viable numbers is not known. Caulobacter spp. began to increase gradually in December, during the winter mixing period well before the spring bloom. Concentrations in Hall Lake [Washington, USA], a small kettle lake, were somewhat higher than in Lake Washington, ranging from 0.27 per ml in October to over 5000 per ml during May. In contrast to Lake Washington, the highest populations were found in the metalimnion and upper hypolimnion of Hall Lake. Caulobacter spp. were also found in the anaerobic depths of the hypolimnion. However, these did not grow anaerobically, suggesting that they had settled into the hypolimnion and survived in the cold anaerobic zone. The populations of Caulobacter spp. reached maximum numbers at the approximate times and depths at which algal biomass would be expected to be greatest.																			0168-6496	1574-6941				FEB	1987	45	1					1	6																WOS:A1987G521100001

The gut contents of 194 individuals were analysed and quantified with numerical and gravimetric methods. This species can be considered a generalized and opportunistic predator feeding both on teleosts and aquatic insects. A multivariate analysis revealed noticeable variation in O. stewartii diet composition with fish size and season. The smaller specimens fed primarily on Cobitidae and Hydropsychidae. As they grew, Cyprinidae and Chironomidae larvae became important prey. The preferred food items were teleosts in summer and autumn. For winter and spring, the predominant prey switched to chironomidae larvae. Diet composition did not significantly vary between the sexes. Finally, a significant and positive correlation between predator and prey length was found. These findings provide the fundamental information better understanding the role of this important endemic species in the Yarlung Zangbo River food web.

Average deposition flux of total PAHs was 75 ng cm(-2) year(-1), similar to those for other rural area. Deposition fluxes of PAHs did varied seasonally. In the vertical mixing period of the lake, late autumn to early spring, the fluxes of less volatile PAHs were enhanced while those for volatile PAHs were not. The size difference of particles associated with volatile and less volatile PAHs caused the seasonal variation of the fluxes. Oil discharge from water delivery equipments may contribute the fluxes of volatile PAHs in summer to autumn.

J	STORCH, TA; DIETRICH, GA				STORCH, TA; DIETRICH, GA			SEASONAL CYCLING OF ALGAL NUTRIENT LIMITATION IN CHAUTAUQUA LAKE, NEW-YORK	JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												Algal nutrient enrichment bioassays were conducted between May 1975 and Aug. 1978 using water samples collected from Chautauqua Lake, New York. Photosynthetic fixation rates of natural phytoplankton assemblages were enhanced by additions of P and N, although enrichment with other nutrients had no significant stimulatory effect on algal photosynthesis. Whereas P stimulated in spring and early summer, both N and P enhanced photosynthesis in midsummer and fall. Relative to the effect of P enrichment, enhancement of photosynthesis by N during the summer and fall was highest in the northern part of the lake. During the period of ice cover, photosynthesis did not appear to be limited by nutrients in that nutrient additions (P, N, Si, C, Fe, trace metals) did not enhance fixation rates. Observed temporal fluctuations in the response of the algae to P and N correlated with changes in the lake water N:P ratio and with temporal changes in dissolved Pi and NO3-NO2 N. The N:P ratio decreased drastically in the summer and remained at .apprx. 10 or less through mid-fall, suggesting that N concentrations were inadequate for the non-N-fixing phytoplankton. Studies over 3 yr indicate that states of P and N limitation undergo time-space fluctuations which occur in a cyclic pattern in the surface waters of Chautauqua Lake.																				1529-8817					1979	15	4					399	405																WOS:A1979HX55200009

The diurnal migration pattern was strongly correlated to light intensity. The total number of migrating fish decreased from autumn to spring. Ice coverage and water temperature were the only abiotic factors that affected the seasonal migration pattern significantly. Moonlight, water level, current velocity, rainfall, insolation and wind velocity did not influence the observed migration of juvenile fish. The results are discussed in relation to food availability, predation risk and energy conservation.

Simulating Impacts of Precipitation on Ice Cover and Surface Water Temperature Across Large Lakes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Precipitation impacts on ice cover and water temperature in the Laurentian Great Lakes were examined using state-of-the-art coupled ice-hydrodynamic models. Numerical experiments were conducted for the recent anomalously cold (2014-2015) and warm (2015-2016) winters that were accompanied by high and low ice coverage over the lakes, respectively. The results of numerical experiments showed that snow cover on the ice, which is the manifestation of winter precipitation, reduced the total ice volume (or mean ice thickness) in all of the Great Lakes, shortened the ice duration, and allowed earlier warming of water surface. The reduced ice volume was due to the thermal insulation of snow cover. The surface albedo was also increased by snow cover, but its impact on the delay the melting of ice was overcome by the thermal insulation effect. During major snowstorms, snowfall over the open lake caused notable cooling of the water surface due to latent heat absorption. Overall, the sensible heat flux from rain in spring and summer was found to have negligible impacts on the water surface temperature. Although uncertainties remain in overlake precipitation estimates and model's representation of snow on the ice, this study demonstrated that winter precipitation, particularly snowfall on the ice and water surfaces, is an important contributing factor in Great Lakes ice production and thermal conditions from late fall to spring. Plain Language Summary Snow and rain impact on ice cover and water temperature in large lakes were studied using a computational model for an example of the Laurentian Great Lakes. It was found that snow cover increased the reflection of solar radiation but at the same time prevented lake ice from the growing, resulting in less formation of ice and slightly earlier melting. The earlier ice melting also allowed earlier warming of the water surface in spring. Major snowstorms caused slight cooling in the water surface temperature because snowflakes absorbed heat when it touched the water surface to melt. On the other hand, warmer rain barely changed the water surface temperature during summer. Key Points Precipitation impacts on Great Lakes ice cover and water temperature were evaluated using a coupled ice-hydrodynamic model The model results showed that snow cover on the ice reduced the net production of ice, which resulted in earlier decay of ice cover The model results showed that snowfall cooled the water surface notably through latent heat absorption during storms					Fujisaki-Manome, Ayumi/AAA-5852-2021; Anderson, Eric/JYO-8924-2024	Wang, Jia/0000-0003-4154-9721; Fujisaki-Manome, Ayumi/0000-0001-5466-6332; Chu, Philip/0000-0002-3089-0353; Gronewold, Andrew/0000-0002-3576-2529; Anderson, Eric/0000-0001-5342-8383; Kessler, James/0000-0001-8643-7569													2169-9275	2169-9291				MAY	2020	125	5								10.1029/2019JC015950	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019JC015950													WOS:000548601000044

Total lipid content ratios (as wet weight) were found to be as 1.44% in spring, 6.41% in summer, 4.25% in autumn and 4.29% in winter. Total protein ratios in the muscle of C. angorae also varied from 16.55% to 19.24% during the year. The major fatty acids in the muscles of both sexes were palmitic, oleic, palmitoleic, eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoicacids. The proportions of n3 PUFAs were higher than those of n6 PUFAs through the year. The ratios of total n6 PUFAs to n3 PUFAs in the muscle of C. angorae changed from 0.14 to 0.19 in female and from 0.12 to 0.31 in males, respectively. The levels of EPA+DHA in the muscles of both genders changed from 0.19 to 0.91 g/100 g wet weight.

The much higher spatial and temporal resolution and improved precipitation and land surface data assimilation of the NARR data set compared with its global counterparts enable more accurate depictions of the moisture budget and hydrological cycle in the Great Lakes region. The analyses reveal that in the past three decades except for two drought years, the evaporation over the region is insufficient to account for the total precipitation. Transport mechanisms supply additional moisture, with a net gain in moisture associated with meridional transport by southerly winds overcoming a net loss in moisture due to zonal transport by westerly winds. The interannual variability of the moisture deficit (the difference between evaporation and precipitation) is associated mainly with the interannual variability in the moisture flux convergence. These results highlight the critical importance of remote moisture sources and large-scale moisture transport to the hydrological cycle in the Great Lakes region. The trend analyses show an upward trend for evaporation that is consistent with warming over the region in all seasons during the NARR data period. Precipitation exhibits an increasing trend in spring and winter, with the largest increase in winter, but no clear trends in summer and autumn.

Six species showed ontogenetic and/or seasonal changes in food use patterns. Smaller individuals generally preyed on small planktonic items (e.g., calanoid and cyclopoid copepods) or small crustaceans (gammaridean amphipods), subsequently changing to other prey items (e.g., mysids and filamentous algae) with growth. The most important dietary items for the reed fish assemblage comprised planktonic copepods, gammaridean amphipods and mysids. However, the relative importance of these changed seasonally, gammaridean amphipods being the most important in autumn and winter, and planktonic copepods and mysids the most important in spring and in summer. Cluster analysis based on dietary overlaps showed that the reed fish assemblage comprised five feeding guilds (planktonic-copepod, mysid, gammaridean-amphipod, filamentous-algae, and detritus feeders). Of these, the three former guilds were the most abundantly represented, whereas detritivores were represented by a single species.					; KUME, GEN/LGY-8967-2024	KUME, GEN/0000-0003-2467-175X; 													1341-8998	1616-3915				AUG	2008	55	3					207	217		10.1007/s10228-007-0021-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10228-007-0021-2													WOS:000258192000001

We implanted radio transmitters into 26 fish and monitored seasonal movements during 3 consecutive years. Data indicated the existence of two discrete populations of sturgeon in this watershed, differentiated by seasonal habitat use, movement patterns and rates, and timing of spawning. The ''lake'' population, a designation suggested by a consistent preference for lentic winter habitat, appeared to spawn and initiate extensive spring and summer movements later than the ''river'' population, which consistently inhabited the river during the winter months. Overall, movement rates were significantly greater in the spring and summer months than at other times of the year and decreased with water temperature. General preferences exhibited by lake sturgeon for certain habitat types at different times of the year appeared to be linked to foraging behaviour. The results suggest that population differentiation may be prevalent for this species inhabiting large lake-river systems, given some diversity in habitat structure and spawning cues. In management efforts, this potential should be taken into consideration and reflected.

Although these events have been studied for many decades, much of their characteristics remain unknown. Recent sightings of whitings near Ten Thousand Islands, Florida suggest a phenomenon that has not previously been documented in this area. Using medium-resolution (250-m) data collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) from December 2010 to November 2013, we documented whiting events and their spatial and temporal patterns in this region. Classification rules were first established, and then applied to all 474 cloud-free and sun glint-free MODIS images. Whiting occurrences were found between 25 degrees 46'N and 25 degrees 20'N and less than 40 km from the southwest Florida coastline. Over the 3-year period, whiting occurrence peaked in spring and autumn and reached a minimum during the winter and summer months. Further field and laboratory research are needed to explain driving force(s) behind these events.					; Hu, Chuanmin/AAB-9604-2021	Long, Jacqueline/0000-0001-5880-0009; 													2150-704X	2150-7058					2014	5	6					539	547		10.1080/2150704X.2014.933275	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2150704X.2014.933275													WOS:000338102700005

The concentration of Cl4-8DD/Fs ranged from 3065 to 49538 fg m(-3), with an average of 10249 fg m(-3). The international toxic equivalents (I-TEQ) value of that was 61.8-1182 fg m(-3), with an average of 235 fg m(-3), which was comparable to those in the other urban locations around the world. It was found that the Cl4-8DD/Fs appeared to be present mainly in the particle phase during winter, spring and autumn, while during summer which were dominantly in gas phase. The ratio of Cl4-8DD/Fs present in particle phase increased with the increasing level of chlorination. The concentrations of PCDFs and PCDDs decreased with the increase of chlorinated level, while the concentrations of 2,3,7,8-PCDDs congeners increased with the increase of chlorination level. The homolog profiles of the concentrations of PCDFs presented were higher than those of the PCDDs, which indicated the PCDD/Fs pollution source of the air in Dalian was characteristic for thermal source pollution. The correlation analysis of meteorological parameters with the concentrations of Cl4-8CDD/Fs was conducted using SPSS packages, and it was found that the ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure were important factors influence the concentration of PCDD/Fs in the air. The respiratory risk and intake dioxins of the residents around the sampling sites were studied in the paper. It was found that Junge-Pankow model was much more accurate in predicting the gas-particle partitioning behavior of PCDD/Fs homologues during winter, while the Harner-Bidleman model shows better agreement with the measured data during winter and summer.					; Schramm, Karl-Werner/C-7438-2013	chen, jiping/0000-0003-0553-7811; 													1001-6538					SEP	2012	57	26					3442	3451		10.1007/s11434-012-5320-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-012-5320-y													WOS:000308239400009

Many factors affect the composition and diversity of the intestinal bacterial community, including diet, environment and season. However, the unique life cycle of birds makes it interesting to study their gut bacteria, especially migratory birds. Birds use many habitats and food resources, which may influence their intestinal bacterial community structure during seasonal migration. Hooded crane (Grus monacha) is one such migrant waterbird that traverses long distances and occupies varied habitats. In this study, we investigated the diversity and differences in intestinal bacterial communities of hooded cranes over the migratory season. The intestinal bacterial alpha-diversity of hooded cranes in winter was significantly higher than fall and spring. The gut bacterial community composition differed significantly across the three seasons (ANOSIM, P = 0.001). This study provides baseline information on the seasonal dynamics of intestinal bacteria in migratory hooded cranes. Abstract Intestinal bacterial communities form an integral component of the organism. Many factors influence gut bacterial community composition and diversity, including diet, environment and seasonality. During seasonal migration, birds use many habitats and food resources, which may influence their intestinal bacterial community structure. Hooded crane (Grus monacha) is a migrant waterbird that traverses long distances and occupies varied habitats. In this study, we investigated the diversity and differences in intestinal bacterial communities of hooded cranes over the migratory seasons. Fecal samples from hooded cranes were collected at a stopover site in two seasons (spring and fall) in Lindian, China, and at a wintering ground in Shengjin Lake, China. We analyzed bacterial communities from the fecal samples using high throughput sequencing (Illumina Mi-seq). Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Tenericutes, Cyanobacteria, and Actinobacteria were the dominant phyla across all samples. The intestinal bacterial alpha-diversity of hooded cranes in winter was significantly higher than in fall and spring. The bacterial community composition significantly differed across the three seasons (ANOSIM, P = 0.001), suggesting that seasonal fluctuations may regulate the gut bacterial community composition of migratory birds. This study provides baseline information on the seasonal dynamics of intestinal bacterial community structure in migratory hooded cranes.

Such lake sediments are rare, but of great interest to studies of past environmental conditions since they provide annual or even seasonal time resolution, and can be used to follow environmental changes over hundreds or thousands of years. The chemical composition of the varves and speciation of chemical elements reveal information on past conditions. The colour of sediment varves can vary between light brown to almost black, and it was hypothesised that black layers were deposited in seasons with oxygen deficit in the hypolimnion (summer and winter) and light layers were formed at spring and autumn over-turn periods when oxygen-rich water flow occurred near the lake bottom. We have tested this hypothesis by analyses of seasonal layers of varves formed in 1968 and 2005 using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy with fast-frozen samples. We found that the organic (C, N, O, S) and inorganic (Al, Si, Ca, Fe, S) elemental composition was similar for all samples studied, but the chemical states of iron and sulphur differed remarkably depending on the season. The black colour of the summer layer was caused by the precipitation of inorganic FeS, while in the light layers only organic thiol (-SH) and sulphate SO42- together with Fe(III) hydroxides were found.

Additionally, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) photos have recently been applied to evaluate vegetation cover. We tested the ability of eDNA techniques to evaluate the distribution and biomass of an invasive macrophyte,Egeria densa(Brazilian waterweed). We conducted field surveys in two Japanese rivers to determine the abundance of eDNA fromE. densaand compared it with macrophyte coverage by evaluating UAV photographs taken in the summer and winter. We found eDNA ofE. densain all sampled sites, including various sites with no macrophyte coverage, indicating that there was a broad-scale distribution ofE. densaeDNA. In summer, we detected a slightly positive relationship betweenE. densaeDNA and macrophyte coverage. We did not find a clear relationship betweenE. densaeDNA and macrophyte coverage, probably because of their widespread and dense distribution and the flow of their materials in the rivers.The seasonal differences in the regression may have been caused by the seasonal growing period ofE. densain the summer, with a decline in their biomass in late autumn and winter. We confirmed the ability of eDNA techniques to survey this invasive macrophyte in rivers by comparing results with coverage measurements from UAV photographs.

ASSESSING ATMOSPHERIC CONCENTRATION OF POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS BY EVERGREEN RHODODENDRON MAXIMUM NEXT TO A CONTAMINATED STREAM	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Conifers are often used as an air passive sampler, but few studies have focused on the implication of broadleaf evergreens to monitor atmospheric semivolatile organic compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). In the present study, the authors used Rhododendron maximum (rhododendron) growing next to a contaminated stream to assess atmospheric PCB concentrations. The present study area was located in a rural setting and approximately 2 km downstream of a former capacitor plant. Leaves from the same mature shrubs were collected in late fall 2010 and winter and spring 2011. Polychlorinated biphenyls were detected in the collected leaves, suggesting that rhododendron can be used as air passive samplers in rural areas where active sampling is impractical. Estimated SPCB (47 congeners) concentrations in the atmosphere decreased from fall 2010 to spring 2011 with concentration means at 3990 pgm(-3), 2850 pgm(-3), and 931 pgm(-3) in fall 2010, winter 2011, and spring 2011, respectively. These results indicate that the atmospheric concentrations at this location continue to be high despite termination of active discharge from the former industrial source. Leaves had a consistent pattern of high concentrations of tetra-CBs and penta-CBs similar to the congener distribution in polyethylene passive samplers deployed in the water column, suggesting that volatilized PCBs from the stream were the primary source of contaminants in rhododendron leaves.

NUTRIENT MITIGATION AND POSSIBLE RECYCLING STRATEGIES OF THE HARVESTED BIOMASS OF WILD MINT (MENTHA LONGIFOLIA L.) IN NUTRIENT-RICH ENVIRONMENTS, EGYPT	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												This research was conducted to examine the seasonal fluctuations in the ability to remediate nutrients of Mentha longifolia in eutrophic waterbodies through biomass harvesting and estimating its potential use as animal feed. Samples of plants, water, and sediment were collected seasonally from six eutrophic and three freshwater sites. In the eutrophic waterbody, the highest fresh and dry biomass (47.9 and 22.4 g/m(2), respectively) was recorded in summer, while the lowest (23.6 and 9.5 g/m(2)) was recorded in autumn. The aboveground parts had the highest concentrations of Na, K, and Ca (212.3, 327.2, and 16.7 mg/kg) during autumn, while the highest N concentration (24.4 mg/kg) was recorded during summer. The roots in the eutrophic waterbody had substantially higher concentrations of Na, N, Ca, P, and Mg (183.8, 11.1, 11.4, 7.4, and 1.9 mg/kg) compared to those in the roots of the freshwater Nile (165.2, 3.6, 13.4, 5.6, and 0.8 mg/kg). The wild mint's aboveground tissues removed the highest amounts of Na, K, Ca, P, and Mg (4.5, 6.4, 363.0, 152.4, and 47.1 g/m(2)) during spring, while the highest N removal (437.7 g/m(2)) occurred during summer. The total digestible nutrients (TDN) of the wild mint above-and below-ground portions exceeds 50.0% of the breeding cattle's dietary needs. Moreover, the metabolized energy (ME: 1.6-2.2 Mcal/kg) was close to the requirements for breeding cattle and sheep. The best time to harvest wild mint to remediate Na, K, Ca, P, and Mg from eutrophic wetlands is spring, while summer is optimal for removing N and using the biomass as fodder.

Seasonal Sampling Influence on Population Dynamics and Yield of Channel Catfish and Walleye in a Large Great Plains Reservoir	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Fish samples collected during different times of the year can be subject to various biases, but the influence of sampling during different seasons on population dynamics and yield metrics in large reservoirs is not well reported. This study compared the age structure, growth, mortality, and yield estimates of Channel Catfish Ictalurus punctatus and Walleye Sander vitreus collected during spring and fall with standardized gill netting in a large Nebraska, USA, reservoir. We sampled fish by using the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission standardized gill net survey methodology. We estimated ages from pectoral spines of Channel Catfish and from sagittal otoliths of Walleye, derived age-length keys, and compared mean spring and fall ages with t-tests. We compared spring and fall von Bertalanffy growth curves with likelihood-ratio tests and mortality estimates from weighted catch curves with an analysis of variance. We visually compared spring and fall yield estimates derived from yield-per-recruit models to assess the impact of variable population dynamics estimates. Estimates of mean age, growth coefficient, mean asymptotic length, total annual mortality, and yield of Channel Catfish did not differ between spring and fall. Conversely, older age structure of Walleye in spring resulted in lower estimates of total annual mortality and higher yield than in fall. Estimates of mean asymptotic length and growth coefficient differed between spring and fall for female Walleye, and mean asymptotic length, growth coefficient, and theoretical time at age 0 estimates varied between spring and fall for male Walleye. Fall yield estimates were substantially lower than spring estimates for both male and female Walleye. These results demonstrate that the sample collection season can impact population dynamics estimates for certain species, whereas others remain relatively unaffected.																			1944-687X					JUN	2021	12	1					223	233		10.3996/JFWM-20-027	http://dx.doi.org/10.3996/JFWM-20-027													WOS:000669512800020

The results of the MSD technique showed that blood chemistry parameters were affected by seasonal changes, total number of parameters in the model and the interactions between the parameters. The relationships among various parameters were more apparent in winter with a coefficient of 87.8 %, which was followed by fall with 70.5 % and spring with 69.9 %. The results of the statistical analysis also indicated that direct bilirubin, total bilirubin, albumin, uric acid, total protein and low-density lipoproteins parameters of winter Bluefish were associated or similar with each other. The blood proteins did not seem to be related to any of the blood minerals except for K in winter. It was found that the relationships among Cl, K, Na and creatine and between uric acid and cholesterol were high in the fall caught Bluefish. The relationships among the blood parameters of the spring caught Bluefish suggested that high-density lipoproteins, total proteins and cholesterol parameters were associated with each other. It is concluded that MDS may be a valuable tool to study relationships and interactions between various blood chemistry parameters and exogenous factors.					celik, ihsan/A-4995-2011; Mendes, Fabiana/AAH-5593-2019														0970-7077					MAR	2008	20	3					2264	2274																WOS:000259602300080

Spatial and temporal variation in the fish community of a South Island, New Zealand coastal lake	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Communities in shallow coastal lakes are exposed to frequent environmental variation owing to their proximity to marine environments, and seasonal and daily variation in climate. Consequently, variability in these communities is likely to be considerable. The fish community of Lake Waihola, a shallow coastal South Island/New Zealand lake, was assessed by monthly day and night sampling by push net. A total of eight fish species were collected between January 1998 and January 1999. Common bully (Gobiomorphus cotidianus) comprised 78.92% of the total catch collected over the study period. Highest catches of common bully occurred in late summer and autumn, mostly at night. Juvenile perch (Perca fluviatilis) were also caught in high numbers for a short period in mid-summer, also mostly at night. Common smelt (Retropinna retropinna) and inanga (Galaxias maculatus) were collected in low numbers from late winter through to late autumn. Other species collected included shortfin eel (Anguilla australis), yellow-eyed mullet (Aldrichetta forsteri), lamprey (Geotria australis), and black flounder (Rhombosolea retiaria). Variation in abundance was attributed to life history an ontogenic shifts in habitat use, and changes in habitat structure related to the development of submerge macrophyte beds during warmer summer periods.

J	Pérez-Bote, JL				Pérez-Bote, JL			Feeding ecology of the exotic red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii (Girard, 1852) in the Guadiana River (Swiberian Peninsula)	CRUSTACEANA												The feeding ecology of the red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii was studied from October 1999 to September 2000 in the River Guadiana, the fourth largest river in the Iberian Peninsula. Analysis of the gut contents of 1225 individuals [15.8-172.3 mm total length (TL)] from 23 sites showed a diet dominated by plants [Relative Importance Index (RI) 50.34] and animals (RI 31.25), followed by amorphous material (RI = 12.21) and sand (RI 6.20). Animal food items were represented by insects, mainly dipterans (RI = 34.59) and ephemeropterans (RI = 16. 10), crayfish (RI = 15.14), and fish (RI = 11.40). Classes I (TL <= 40 mm) and 11 (TL = 40.1-80 mm) had a diet dominated by animals and amorphous material. Classes III (TL = 80.1-120 mm) and IV (TL > 120 mm) had a diet dominated by plants and amorphous material. Plants were consumed by all classes throughout the year, being most important for classes III and IV in autumn and winter. For classes I and II, animal diets are important throughout the year with increasing consumption in autumn and winter. Crayfish fragments were found throughout the year in all classes with more importance in spring and summer for classes III and IV. Similarly, fish were found in the guts of the crayfish throughout the year, this prey being more important in classes III and IV in the cold seasons. The diets of males and females were very similar, although females consumed more plants (RI = 48.72) than males (RI = 46.58). In contrast, males consumed more animal prey than females (RI = 32.36 and RI = 31.30, respectively). Differences in diet between males and females were not significant (G = 0.189, df: 3, P = 0.973).

Seasonal abundance, diet, and energy consumption of round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus) in Lake Erie tributary streams	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												The invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) is a benthic invertivore that has become established in many lake and river systems of Europe and the United States, especially within the Great Lakes basin. Multiple reports document its negative impact on benthic macroinvertebrates and fishes in lakes and recent studies show fish and invertebrate communities in streams are equally at risk. We assessed the seasonal abundance of round gobies and their summer diet composition in tributary streams to Lake Erie. Populations of round gobies in the lower reaches of two tributary streams peaked in abundance in early fall, were absent in late winter, and reappeared in early spring, suggesting a possible out-migration to the lake in winter. Population size distributions show a peak recruitment of young round gobies in July and low-level recruitment through October. In this study, round gobies obtained most of their energy from amphipods, chironomids, and caddisflies compared to other invertebrates, and midges were consumed in greater proportion than their availability suggesting a preference for these prey. As the stream lacked molluscs, large round gobies remained generalist invertivores without a diet shift to molluscivory as has been reported in lake studies. The observations on recruitment and abundance, and possible out-migration suggest the lower reaches of tributary streams may act as source populations for lake-bound round gobies. It may be possible to take advantage of this out-migration behaviour as a control strategy to capture large numbers of round gobies each winter.						pennuto, christopher/0000-0002-0584-4005													0906-6691	1600-0633				JUN	2010	19	2					206	215		10.1111/j.1600-0633.2010.00405.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.2010.00405.x													WOS:000277787300006

Estimating seasonal movements of Chinook salmon in lake Huron from efficiency analysis of coded wire tag recoveries in recreational fisheries	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												The decline of hatchery-reared Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha stocks in Lakes Huron and Michigan during the 1980s prompted, mass-tagging programs to investigate reproduction, poststocking survival, and movements. In Lake Huron, millions of smolts implanted with coded wire tags (CWTs) were released in Michigan waters and recovered from charter and noncharter fisheries, surveys, and weirs. Using generalized linear models (GLMs), we investigated Chinook salmon seasonal movements based on the spatial and temporal distributions of recoveries by fishing trips in U.S. recreational fisheries and recovery efficiency. We used models incorporating area, month, year, and recovery source; creel-clerk and "headhunter" (CVT collection specialist) samples; and charter captain reports. We implemented models for recoveries regardless of release area and from one particular area. All model predictors and interactions between month and area were significant. The variation in recovery levels among recovery sources was larger than temporal or spatial variation. Headhunters were 7 times more efficient than captains in recovering CWTs from charter-boat catch and I I times more efficient than clerks in recovering CWTs from non-charter-boat catch; this was due to the higher catches experienced in charter than in noncharter trips and to different recovery program goals. The spatial and temporal distribution of GLM-standardized recovery levels suggested that Chinook salmon released along the western coast of Lake Huron moved near shore during early spring and north during summer, returning mostly to nearby stocking areas in summer and fall. To complement our GLM analysis, we evaluated the distributions of CWT salmon released and recovered in U.S. and Canadian waters by all sources. Data supported previous conclusions on longitudinal movements and indicated that in spring fish moved from eastern locations to near shore in western Lake Huron then back to overwinter locations in autumn. These movement patterns coincided with seasonal prey species concentrations and favorable temperatures. The implications of our results for salmon fisheries management and the design of future tagging studies are discussed.

The spring TP-summer Chl relationship (n = 29, r2 = 0.67) and TN:TP ratios were similar to those reported for other north-temperate lakes. However, there was less variation in the summer TP-summer Chl relationship (n = 34, r2= 0.81) than in the spring TP-summer Chl relationship. This is a result of the variability in the summer TP:spring TP ratio which ranged 0.5-2.9 in these lakes. In the shallow productive freshwater lakes TP concentrations increased dramatically between spring and summer (the average summer TP:spring TP ratio was 1.7), whereas in the thermally stratified freshwater lakes (most of which were partially meromictic) summer TP concentrations were much lower than spring TP concentrations (the mean ratio was 0.7). There was less chlorophyll per unit TP in saline lakes (i.e., lakes with more than 500 mg/l; total dissolved solids) than in freshwater lakes.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1983	40	1					27	35		10.1139/f83-005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f83-005													WOS:A1983PU76900004

Three species were isolated from the lake and identified as the picoeukaryote Mychonastes homosphaera and two picocyanobacteria, Synechococcus sp. A and B. Picocyanobacterial and M. homosphaera cultures grew well at light intensities up to 330 and 700 mumol photons m(-2) s(-1), respectively, but poorly below 10 mumol photons m(-2) s(-1). Picocyanobacterial and M. homosphaera cultures photoacclimated to low light by increasing their chlorophyll per cell through increase in photosynthetic unit (PSU) size and PSU numbers, respectively. Growth rates of Synechococcus A and B were higher at temperatures characteristic of summer-autumn in the epilimnion, when maximum abundances of picocyanobacteria occur. Growth rates of M. homosphaera were higher at 14degreesC, corresponding to lake water temperatures during their occurrence in winter-spring. Temperature is a dominant factor influencing the seasonal dynamics of both picocyanobacteria and picoeukaryotes in Lake Kinneret, while the vertical distribution is controlled by acclimation to different light conditions. Differences in temperature tolerance and photoacclimation suggest that Synechococcus A belongs to picocyanobacteria found in summer below surface waters, while Synechococcus B represents picocyanobacteria found throughout the year at all depths. Photoacclimation to high light as shown in M. homosphaera cultures, may account for the relatively high abundance of picoeukaryotes in surface waters in Lake Kinneret.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				NOV	2002	24	11					1173	1183		10.1093/plankt/24.11.1173	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/24.11.1173													WOS:000179038500005

It was revealed that in spite of the installation of aeration systems and the pumping of mesotrophic water front Lake Biwa during the summer season, the trophic state of Lake Yogo overall has not improved during the past few decades. However, the pumping of water from Lake Biwa did affect the concentrations of nutrients and the periods of cyanobacterial bloom during the summer. The pumping period was different in each year, and the cyanobacterial bloom occurred during the period without pumping in both years. The aeration destratification was not strong enough to prevent cyanobacterial blooms. Cyanobacteria and Bacillariophyceae contributed most to the phytoplankton biomass in both years. Aphanizoinenon, Anabaena, and Microcystis were the main genera among cyanobacteria. The bloom of Aphanizomenon or A nabaena occurred early in the surnmer, and was then replaced by Microcystis. Aphanizomenon was almost always present, and often formed bloom even in winter. The seasonal succession of Bacillariophyceae was almost the same in both years and was well categorized: winter-growing species such as Aulacoseira pusilla (F. Meister) Tuji et Houki and species of Thalassiosiraceae, spring-growing species such as Asterionella formosa Hassall, Fragilaria crotonensis Kitton, and Synedra cf. acus, and fall-growing species such as Aidacoseira ambigua (Grunow) Simonsen, and Aulacoseira granitlata (Ehrenb.)

To investigate the response of vegetation to climate change and human activities, the GIMMS NDVI3g, MODIS NDVI, meteorological data, and nighttime light data were analyzed using Theil-Sen trend analysis, Mann-Kendall significance test, Hurst index, and correlation analysis to explore the spatial and temporal characteristics and trends of vegetation in the QLMs from 1982 to 2020. The results show that from 1982 to 2020, the NDVI in the QLMs showed an increasing trend in the interannual, growing season (0.0011/a), and through the four seasons-spring (0.0003/a), summer (0.0015/a), autumn (0.0007/a), and winter; and demonstrated a high spatial pattern in the southeast and low spatial pattern in the northwest. The NDVI showed a gradual increase in the improved area (46.43% -* 79.32%), a gradual decrease in the unchanged area (50.81% -* 18.23%), and a stable degraded area (2.76% -* 2.45%), but the distribution of the degraded area shifted from the northern part of Daxue Mountain to the Qinghai Lake and Datong River basin, and the intersection of Qinghai South Mountain and Laji Mountain. Additionally, the vegetation cover was not persistent, and the area of unclear future was more than half and distributed in the central and western parts of the QLMs, with obvious anti-sustainability characteristics. Temperature was the dominant climatic factor for vegetation growth in the QLMs, and from the spatial distribution, the area controlled by temperature (63.81%) was significantly higher than that controlled by precipitation (29.95%). On a temporal scale, NDVI during spring, autumn, and winter was positively correlated with the temperature and negatively correlated with precipitation; and vegetation growth was influenced by temperature for a longer period of time during the year. NDVI has an obvious lagging effect on climate change, with a maximum response to temperature and precipitation lagging by approximately 2-3 months and 0-1 month, respectively. Human activities have both promoting and inhibiting effects on vegetation. In human activity areas, NDVI shows an increasing trend, and the ecological environment is improving annually.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				AUG	2022	141								109101	10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109101	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109101													WOS:000823154900004

Riparian wetlands can potentially intercept phosphorus mobilized from upland soils before it reaches connecting waterways, but the capacity of wetlands to buffer against downstream losses of P is poorly understood, especially in northern temperate zones. In these regions, the spring freshet releases large volumes of water from snowmelt and soil pore water during the time when microbial productivity, which transfers available P into biomass, is low. In addition, losses of P in runoff may be exacerbated by freeze-thaw cycling (FTC) in soil during late winter and early spring through the physical degradation of organic matter. We investigated P dynamics from late fall through spring thaw and into summer to assess P transfers between inorganic, organic and microbial biomass pools, as functions of season and distance from a river. The site is located on the Grand River in southern Ontario, which discharges to Lake Erie, and consists of riparian wetland and wooded areas. Reactive P (Olsen P) and microbial biomass P (P-MBIO) increased with distance from the river and varied more over time in the wetland soil compared to the adjacent wooded area, reflecting higher variability in vegetation, topography and hydrology. The positive correlation between microbial biomass P and microbes linked to ammonification supports the release of N and P through mineralization pathways as spring progresses, with microbial biomass decreasing in June as plant growth increases. There was evidence for leaching of Fe and Al, and lower concentrations of total P, in the transect proximate to the river. Seasonal flooding during spring thaw contributed to a pulse of dissolved reactive P, but temperature monitoring showed that the wetland soil did not experience freeze-thaw cycling. Investigation of FTC using wetland soil in mesocosms indicated that multiple FTC (> 3) were necessary to increase the pool of reactive soil P, with the highest amount of soil reactive P observed after six FTC, when dissolved reactive P also tended to increase.					; Macrae, Merrin/KPB-7902-2024; Munford, Kimber/GQB-1089-2022; Glasauer, Susan/AAY-6599-2021	Munford, Kimber/0000-0002-2416-7329; Macrae, Merrin/0000-0003-3296-3103; 														2296-665X				DEC 8	2022	10								983129	10.3389/fenvs.2022.983129	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.983129													WOS:000898182200001

THE ALGAL COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE OF THE YAITSKOE LAKE (SAMARA REGION, RUSSIA)	NATURE CONSERVATION RESEARCH												We studied the phytoplankton of the Yaitskoe Lake (Samara region, Russia) from May to October 2009-2011. In this water body, there were 312 species and intraspecific taxa of algae. They belonged to nine taxonomic Divisions, 14 Classes, 22 Orders, 52 Families, and 108 Genera. A larger number of species, varieties and forms of algae belonged to the Chlorophyta, which included 37% of the total number of species and intraspecific taxa, followed by Bacillariophyta (21%), Euglenophyta (14%), and Cyanoprokaryota (12%). The other algae species number was less than 10% of the total species richness. The value of algae quantitative development was high in the Yaitskoe Lake during the three-year period. The values of abundance and biomass increased from spring to the end of summer, then there was a decrease. The level of trophic state was assessed as eutrophic. The abundance and biomass of algae were high during the study. The level of species diversity and evenness in phytoplankton community were assessed as high. Indices values, calculated by the phytoplankton abundance, were maximal at late spring. In summer, their values decreased. This was due to the increased dominance of bluegreen algae (cyanoprokaryotes). The degree of cyanoprokaryota dominance decreased in autumn, while species diversity and evenness of the community increased. The indices, calculated on biomass, decreased from spring to early autumn. Their minimal values were during the "blooming" of water, and then gradually increased. Saprobiological analysis showed that this pond belonged to the beta-mesosaprobic type, moderately polluted with Class III of water quality.

DRIVING FACTORS OF PHYTOPLANKTON COMMUNITY AND ASSESSMENT OF THE WATER QUALITY IN A SMALL EUTROPHIC WUXING LAKE, NORTHEAST CHINA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The community structure, spatiotemporal variation and influencing factors of phytoplankton accompanied with water quality in Wuxing Lake, northeast China were studied during spring, summer and autumn from summer 2019 to spring 2020. Our purpose was to reveal the driving factors influencing phytoplankton community, combined with water quality, discussing methods on improving water quality in the lake.112 species of phytoplankton including 8 phyla and 74 genera were identified. The phytoplankton community structure demonstrated obvious seasonal and spatial variation. 20 dominant species were selected during three seasons. Redundancy analysis (RDA) result showed that transparency (SD), total phosphorous (TP), chemical oxygen demand (CODCr), turbidity (Tur), dissolved oxygen (DO) and conductivity (EC) were main factors influencing the abundance of dominant species. Results of Shannon-Wiener index (H') and Pielou's evenness index (J') indicating slight to light pollution in the lake. Considering the risk of deterioration of water quality is still a possibility, measures to improve SD may be effective to prevent Cyanophyta blooms in summer. Our findings will provide a reference for water quality protection and management in small eutrophic lakes similar to Lake.																			1589-1623	1785-0037					2022	20	1					711	725		10.15666/aeer/2001_711725	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/2001_711725													WOS:000750437500043

In this study, we quantified the bulk and dry atmospheric N deposition around the Dongting Lake, which is connected to the Yangtze River and is the second largest freshwater lake in China. Bulk N deposition averaged 48.0 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), of which ammonium (NH4-N), nitrate (NO3-N), and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) accounted for 41.6%, 35.1%, and 23.3%, respectively. Dry N deposition averaged 27.0 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), and was dominated by NH3. Bulk N deposition was higher in spring and summer than in autumn and winter at the sites around the lake because of the high precipitation. NH3 deposition was the highest in spring and summer due to fertilization, and NOx deposition was the highest in winter because of the combustion of coal for domestic heating. The concentrations of NH3 significantly decreased with the concentration of NH4-N, indicating below-cloud scavenging and local sources. The concentrations of NOx and NO3-N were not correlated, indicating long-distance transfer of NOx. Bulk N deposition in our study was generally twice that reported in other studies, even when only inorganic N species in bulk deposition were considered. Total N deposition averaged 75.0 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), which was much higher than that reported in other studies. Both N deposited directly into the lake and N deposited across the lake basin that was subsequently transported to the lake in runoff could enrich the N concentration of the lake water and increase the gross primary productivity (GPP). Our results highlighted the importance of integrated management that includes both aquatic and atmospheric systems at either the lake basin scale or regional scale, rather than at the individual lake-scale.					ying, zhang/AAO-4754-2020; Liu, Xuejun/AAA-7412-2022	Zhang, Ying/0000-0002-5465-059X; Zhang, Ying/0000-0002-9964-9381													1352-2310	1873-2844				JUN 15	2019	207						197	204		10.1016/j.atmosenv.2019.03.034	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2019.03.034													WOS:000467661600017

Dynamic characteristics and seasonal features of changes were identified in the concentrations of substances. Seasonal factor plays a substantial role in changing nutrient concentrations. In the averaged year dynamics of substances concentrations are more diverse in the spring and early summer compared with the second half of the year. Spring effects may be related to the intensive development of phytoplankton. Autumn is also an outbreak of phytoplankton biomass, which can affect the concentrations of ammonium and phosphorus. In general, the concentration of phosphorus compounds is more stable, which may favorably affect the life of phytoplankton species which are fond of phosphorus.

J	HAKANSON, L				HAKANSON, L			VARIABILITY AND REPRESENTATIVENESS OF LAKE VARIABLES	INTERNATIONALE REVUE DER GESAMTEN HYDROBIOLOGIE												This paper summarizes results from extensive field work in 95 Swedish lakes. It discusses four years (1986-1989) of monthly data on pH, Secchi depth, temperature, alkalinity, total-P, conductivity, Fe, Ca, hardness and colour. These variables vary both temporally and areally. The focus here is on such variations and patterns in variations, and how to express take-typical values, not for specific sites and sampling occasions, but for entire lakes and longer periods of time (months-years). This is of importance in monitoring and validating models. A definition of total variability (TV), expressing variability between adjacent months within the year, and between the same month for different years, is presented. Selected results: An important pattern emerges for total-P with marked increases in TV during the summer and minimum values in winter. The pattern for colour shows lower TV during summer and higher TV during fall. The TV-values for pH are low and stable thoughout the year and no clear seasonal pattern can be seen. A seasonal pattern exists for conductivity, alkalinity, hardness, and Ca with higher TV during spring. The results concerning the variability within and between lakes show that the greatest differences exist for conductivity and Fe; the smallest (except temperature) for pH and alkalinity.																			0020-9309						1994	79	2					177	195		10.1002/iroh.19940790203	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19940790203													WOS:A1994NW40300002

Snowmelt runoff sensitivity analysis to drought on the Canadian prairies	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES					Joint Meeting of the 32nd Annual Meeting of the Canadian-Geophysical-Union/Canadian-Society-of-Soil-Science	MAY 14-17, 2006	Banff, CANADA	Canadian Geophys Union, Hydrol Sect, Canadian Soc Soil Sci				The Canadian prairies are subject to severe extended droughts that are characterized by warmer temperatures, lower precipitation, lower soil moisture and sparser vegetation than normal conditions. The physically based cold regions hydrological modelling platform (CRHM) provides a possible means to analyse the sensitivity of prairie snowmelt processes to drought. The model was tested against detailed observations from Creighton Tributary of the Bad Lake Research Basin, Saskatchewan for the 1974-1975 and 1981-1982 hydrological years and found to perform, satisfactorily in reproducing snow accumulation and streamflow without parameter calibration. By lowering winter precipitation and raising winter air temperature from actual meteorological observations and by lowering fall soil moisture and vegetation height parameters, the resulting drought condition sensitivity of snow accumulation, snow cover duration, sublimation of blowing snow, evaporation, infiltration into frozen soils, soil moisture storage change, snowmelt runoff and streamflow discharge was estimated. Snow accumulation and snow cover duration were relatively insensitive to meteorological changes associated with drought because the suppression of blowing snow sublimation moderated reduced snowfall. Infiltration, soil moisture storage change and evaporation were also relatively insensitive to drought conditions. However, lower precipitation, higher air temperature and lower initial soil moisture caused a marked reduction in snowmelt runoff. Similarly, large reductions in streamflow discharge were caused by diminished winter precipitation, increased winter air temperature and decreased fall soil moisture content. A scenario showed that a combination of these factors could cause complete cessation of spring streamflow even under moderate drought of 15% reduction in winter precipitation and 2.5 degrees C increase in winter mean air temperature. Results show that spring runoff and streamflow discharge are inherently unstable in the Canadian prairie environment, and so, magnify the impacts of drought, and through multi-season storage and vegetation change can cause the impacts of hydrological drought to persist for several seasons after meteorological drought has ended.

J	Nogueira, MG				Nogueira, MG			Phytoplankton composition, dominance and abundance as indicators of environmental compartmentalization in Jurumirim Reservoir (Paranapanema River), Sao Paulo, Brazil	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Patterns in the spatial and temporal composition, dominance and abundance of the phytoplankton community of the Jurumirim Reservoir (Brazil) were studied during one year at ten different sampling stations. The main phytoplankton associations were characterized by diatoms and blue-green algae, in distinctive patterns of dominance. The main species were Microcystis aeruginosa Kuetz, Anabaena circinalis Rabenhorst, A. spiroides Kleb., A. solitaria Kleb., Aulacoseira cf. italica Grunow and A. granulata (Ehr.) Simon. A high growth of Aulacoseira was observed in the upstream zones of the reservoir in spring, at the beginning of the seasonal rainy period. This growth was a response to increased flow rates and input of fresh nutrients by the main feeder rivers. A high concentration of blue-green algae, especially Anabaena circinalis and A. spiroides, was observed in winter (dry season) in the lacustrine part of the reservoir, towards the dam. These algae benefitted from the longer water retention times and greater internal circulation of nutrients in the absence of a thermocline at this time of the year. Among the Cyanophyceae, there was an alternation between M. aeruginosa, more abundant in summer, and Anabaena, dominant in autumn and winter. A conspicuous growth of Anabaena occurred in a diverticle of the reservoir, sheltered from the main advective processes that predominate in the central channel. Higher phytoplankton diversity was associated with the contact zone between riverine and lacustrine systems.

Diet composition and prey selection of the pike, Esox lucius, in Civril Lake, Turkey	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												Diet composition and prey selection of pike (Esox lucius) were studied in Civril Lake, Turkey. The lake is eutrophic in character with a surface area of ca. 64 km(-2) and mean depth of 3 m. Stomach contents of 409 specimens were collected between October 2003 and April 2005. Pike diet included 10 prey fish species, two Crustaceae, four Insecta, one Hirudinae and one Amphibia. Feeding was homogeneous, with most pike specializing in prey fish and a few pike specializing on miscellaneous items. Feeding activity varied by season and ontogeny. Stomach fullness and the percentage of fish with prey were highest in spring and in small pike, while feeding intensity was lowest in winter and in large sized pike. Diet composition was dominated by fish, including Carasius gibelio, Chondrostoma meandrense, Esox lucius, Gambusia affinis, Gobio gobio, Hemigrammocapoeta kemali, Leuciscus cephalus, and Tinca tinca. Crustacea were also a significant component in spring and in small sized pike. The most important prey items were C. meandrense, Gammarus sp., H. kemali, and L. cephalus. Pike feeding in winter and summer was homogeneous, specializing mainly on fish as prey, while the diet in spring and autumn was heterogeneous with some pike specializing on Gammarus sp. Cannibalism at 8.7% was observed only in the large sized pike (> 40 cm). Pike strongly preferred C. meandrense (Selectivity index V = 0.372; chi(2) = 27.739; P < 0.01), G. gobio (V = 0.192; chi(2) = 7.350; P < 0.01) and T. tinca (V = 0.146; chi(2) = 4.257; P < 0.05) despite their low abundance in the lake. Hemigrammocapoeta kemali was the most abundant prey fish in the environment; however, it was a negatively selected food item (V = -0.358; chi(2) = 25.642; P < 0.01). Cyprinus carpio also inhabits the lake, but was not preferred by pike (V = -0.056; chi(2) = 0.625; P > 0.05).

Seasonal variation in the influence of environmental drivers on nearshore water quality along an urban northern Lake Ontario shoreline	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We examined drivers of water quality during 2007-2013 in a region of Lake Ontario influenced by various anthropogenic inputs and natural influences. Nutrient concentrations generally declined from shore-line to offshore, with mean concentrations approaching background after 1 km from shore. N species were an exception to this overall pattern, often with higher concentrations coincident with a mid-nearshore Water Pollution Control Plant outfall (WPCPo). The WPCPo, however, did not appear to be a major contributor to shoreline total phosphorus (TP) or ammonia + ammonium. Shoreline TP variability increased in dry years, while E. coli and conductivity variability increased in wet years. The influence of environmental drivers on water quality differed seasonally. In summer, cross-shore winds causing resus-pension appeared to be drivers of elevated nearshore TP and suspended solids (SS), while precipitation, light, and water column stability were related to E. coli. Summer biological activity was evident in higher shoreline total Kjeldhal N contributions and lower NO3 + NO2 and dissolved inorganic N. In fall and spring, TP, SS, and conductivity were elevated within 400 m of the shore, suggesting tributary inputs were an important P delivery mechanism to the nearshore in addition to spring resuspension events. Fall, how-ever, represented a transitional period representing a shift from drivers dominant in summer to those in spring. The analytical approach used here reveals generalizable patterns in nearshore water quality and their drivers and may be applicable to other regions where there is a confluence of varying drivers of water quality to a nearshore region.

J	BRAITHWAITE, LW				BRAITHWAITE, LW			ECOLOGICAL-STUDIES OF BLACK SWAN .1. EGG, CLUTCH AND INCUBATION	AUSTRALIAN WILDLIFE RESEARCH												Statistics are given for egg dimensions, clutch size, laying rate and incubation period in black swans [Cygnus atratus] nesting at Lake George and Lake Bathurst, New South Wales [Australia], and compared with data from other studies. Methods of determining clutch size and incubation dates are given and examined. Emphasis is placed on the importance of the method of assessment of clutch size in comparisons within and between studies. There was evidence of 2 size classes of eggs, possibly related to factors of age or breeding experience, the smaller class being laid in summer breeding, during an exceptional abundance of food, but not in winter when food may have been limiting. Egg size varied significantly, according to sequence in the clutch. The adaptive significance of egg size is discussed; moisture loss may be important in the evolution of egg size.Clutch size varied significantly according to location and date of nesting. The reasons for the variation were possibly, both in nutritional value of food available and in its relative temporal and physical availability and the swans'' ability to metabolize it. Possible evolutionary determinants of average clutch size in the black swan are considered. Moisture losses from the egg may again be important. The laying rate was similar to that reported elsewhere. The mean incubation period was 40-45 days and most clutches ranged from 39-43 days. Clutches laid in autumn and winter took marginally longer to hatch than clutches laid in spring and summer, possibly due to effects of ambient temperature; the difference was probably not of particular adaptive significance.																			0310-7833						1977	4	1					59	79																WOS:A1977DA13500006
J	VERDUIN, J				VERDUIN, J			ENERGY FIXATION AND UTILIZATION BY NATURAL COMMUNITIES IN WESTERN LAKE ERIE	ECOLOGY												Photosynthetic and respiratory rates of natural plankton communities (predominantly diatom) were measured, (1) in samples concentrated by filtering through bolting cloth, (2) at natural population density, and (3) under completely natural conditions. Change in pH of natural water served as an index of CO2 change using a graph obtained by differential titration with 0.01 [image] NaOH. Autumn communities used dim light more efficiently than spring communities, and rates for communities growing in 0[degree] water equalled those for communities from 23[degree] environment. Ratios of photosynthesis, at optimal light, to respiration ranged from 1.5 to 20, averaging 8. Photosynthetic yields at optimal light averaged 5 [mu]M/10 [mu]l/hr. and 1.6 [mu]M/mg. ash-free dry wt./hr. Filtering lake water through bolting cloth removed 1/3 of the photosynthetic activity, thus 2/3 of the autotrophic community is unidentified. Photosynthetic yields under completely natural conditions amounted to 68 [mu]M/1/day in summer and 10 in winter. CO2 exchange between air and water is usually negligible in western Lake Erie, and photosynthesis by autotrophs approximately equals respiration by the total community. Daily photosynthesis per m2 is about 220 [image] in summer, with an annual mean of 140. It is estimated that macroscopic bottom fauna contribute 4% to the total respiration.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1956	37	1					40	50		10.2307/1929667	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1929667													WOS:A1956WR62000005

The impacts of changing climate and streamflow on nutrient speciation in a large Prairie reservoir	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Climate mediated warming water temperature, drought and extreme flooding are projected to shift the phenology of nutrients in receiving lakes and reservoirs further intensifying eutrophication and algal blooms, especially in temperate reservoirs. An emerging issue in reservoir management is the prediction of climate change impacts, a necessity for sound decision making and sustainable management. Lake Diefenbaker is a large multipurpose reservoir in the Canadian Prairies. In this study, the impact of climate change on nutrient speciation in Lake Diefenbaker is examined using loosely linked SpAtially Referenced Regression On Watershed attributes (SPARROW) and CE-QUAL-W2 models. Two climate mediated scenarios, RCP 8.5 representing the most extreme climate change, and climate induced streamflow were modelled. Nutrient levels are anticipated to double under the climate change and streamflow scenarios. Winter and spring were identified as hot moments for nitrogen pollution with a plausible saturation of nitrous oxides in the future. Of concern is a plausible recycling of nitrate through dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium. Summer and fall on the other hand represent the period for phosphorus enrichment and internal loading with a probable succession of cyanobacteria in the summer.					; Lindenschmidt, Karl-Erich/AFM-9194-2022	Morales-Marin, Luis Alejandro/0000-0003-4318-6194; 													0301-4797	1095-8630				JUN 15	2021	288								112262	10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112262	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112262		MAR 2021						33756384					WOS:000643645000006
J	Hu, YP; Zhou, BT; Han, TT; Li, HX; Wang, HJ				Hu, Yuepeng; Zhou, Botao; Han, Tingting; Li, Huixin; Wang, Huijun			In-Phase Variations of Spring and Summer Droughts over Northeast China and Their Relationship with the North Atlantic Oscillation	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Analyses of the standardized precipitation evaporation index (SPEI), using the season-reliant empirical orthogonal function (S-EOF) method, indicate that the second leading mode of drought over Northeast China features an in-phase variation from spring to summer. Such an in-phase change is closely connected to the persistence of geopotential height anomalies around Lake Baikal. The positive height anomalies around Lake Baikal, with an equivalent barotropic structure in the troposphere, can decrease water vapor transport into Northeast China and induce anomalous descending motion over Northeast China during both seasons, favoring precipitation deficit and high temperature in situ and hence resulting in the synchronous variations of spring and summer droughts. Further investigation reveals that the spring North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) plays a notable role in the in-phase change of spring-summer droughts over Northeast China. The positive phase of spring NAO could induce spring drought over Northeast China directly through its influence on the above atmospheric circulations via a zonal wave train emanating from the North Atlantic. Meanwhile, it can also increase the soil moisture in central Siberia by enhancing the local snow depth. The wetter soil moisture in the following summer, in turn, increases the meridional temperature gradient between the middle and high latitudes and then forces westerly anomalies around 60 degrees N, consequently yielding positive height anomalies around Lake Baikal that favor the occurrence of summer drought over Northeast China. Therefore, the spring NAO is hypothesized to contribute to the in-phase variations of spring-summer droughts over Northeast China through the combined roles of zonal wave train and central Siberian soil moisture. Significance StatementNortheast China suffers from frequent droughts severely in recent decades. Thus, it is urgent to understand the physical mechanisms of drought in Northeast China. Using the season-reliant empirical orthogonal function (S-EOF) analysis, this study indicates that the second mode of S-EOF shows an in-phase change of drought from spring to summer over Northeast China, which is associated with the persistence of geopotential height anomalies around Lake Baikal. Our study further reveals that the spring NAO plays a pronounced role in the in-phase change of spring-summer droughts over Northeast China, through the combined roles of zonal wave train and the soil moisture in the central Siberian plateau. These findings are encouraging for better understanding of drought in Northeast China and are also important for disaster prevention and mitigation.					; Han, Tingting/AFL-9459-2022	zhou, Botao/0000-0002-5995-2378; Hu, Yuepeng/0000-0001-6992-0372													0894-8755	1520-0442				NOV 1	2022	35	21					3323	3337		10.1175/JCLI-D-22-0052.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-22-0052.1													WOS:000878871800003
J	Zhang, MQ; Sun, JQ				Zhang, Mengqi; Sun, Jianqi			Increased Persistence in Winter-to-Spring Precipitation Anomalies over South China since the Late 1990s and the Possible Mechanisms	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												This study reveals that South China precipitation (SCP) anomalies tend to persist well from winter to the following spring after the late 1990s, favoring long-lasting drought or flood events over South China. Mechanism analysis indicates that the interdecadal changes in El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the preceding November central Asian snow cover could contribute to the increased persistence of winter-to-spring SCP anomalies. ENSO has a stable impact on winter SCP, whereas its impact on spring SCP is significantly enhanced after the late 1990s. With a weakened intensity and faster decay rate in the recent two decades, the ENSO-related spring SST anomalies over the tropical Pacific are relatively weaker, inducing a weakened and more southward-located western North Pacific anticyclone. This further leads to an interdecadal migration of the spring rainfall belt anomaly, consequently favoring the persistence of winter-to-spring SCP anomalies after the late 1990s. Additionally, the impacts of November central Asian snow cover on winter and spring SCP are both strengthened after the late 1990s. In the most recent two decades, the snow-cover-related cooling effect has become stronger, which induces winter cyclonic anomalies over Lake Baikal, favoring increased winter SCP. In addition, increased snow cover excites upward-propagating waves from the troposphere to the stratosphere, consequently weakening the stratospheric polar vortex. In spring, the stratospheric polar vortex signals propagate downward and result in a negative Arctic Oscillation in the troposphere, favoring more spring SCP. Therefore, central Asian snow cover is also conductive to the persistence of winter-to-spring SCP anomalies after the late 1990s.

J	Zhao, QH; Sun, JH				Zhao Qiao-Hua; Sun Ji-Hua			The variation features of the surface mixed layer depth in Erhai Lake and Taihu Lake in spring and autumn and their mechanism analyses	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA												The variation of the surface mixed layer depth may affect not only the evolution of aquatic ecosystem, but also the temporal-spatial distribution of precipitation and climate in the basin. Based on the meteorological data and water temperature profiles observed in Erhai Lake (located in the Tibetan Plateau) and Taihu Lake (located in the Taihu Plain), the variation features and the mechanisms of the surface mixed layer depths are investigated. The stratification in Erhai Lake can be established and sustained in summer; the diurnal stratification in Erhai Lake can also be established, However, in both summer and autumn, stratification may exist in Taihu Lake. The time length of stratification is longer in Erhai Lake than that in Lake Taihu in the autumn. And the surface mixed layer depths in Erhai Lake are shallower than those in Taihu Lake in summer and autumn. The transformation frequency between establishment and destruction of stratification in Taihu Lake is faster than that in Erhai Lake, which illustrated that the response of water body in Taihu Lake to atmospheric variation is quicker than that in Erhai Lake. The water depth is a key factor which prevents such shallow lakes as Taihu Lake from establishing and maintainaning stratifications and in a suitable radiation condition the stratification will exist. The net radiation is a key factor that determines the stratification and the length of the time when the stratification can be sustained in lakes whose depths are the same as that of Erhai Lake. The research result in this paper is helpful for exploring the coupling mechanism of the turbulence of water and air and the evolution law of aquatic ecosystem.																			1000-3290					FEB	2013	62	3							039203	10.7498/aps.62.039203	http://dx.doi.org/10.7498/aps.62.039203													WOS:000316818900077

In addition, comparisons were made between seasons in the Bayonne/Elizabeth and Los Angeles sites where the same individuals were sampled in two seasons. The most striking differences between sites and seasons were in outdoor air samples. For this medium the concentrations in Los Angeles in the winter season were much higher than in Bayonne/Elizabeth, New Jersey in the winter. However, in the summer season this difference was not evident due to a dramatic decrease in VOC levles in Los Angeles in the summer. Outdoor VOC levels in Greensboro and Devils Lake were usually dramatically lower than both Bayonne/Elizabeth and the California sites. Concentration levels for the breath and personal air samples were usually higher in the winter than the spring or summer. This was particularly true in Los Angeles for personal air samples. For the breath samples, this pattern was not clearcut and, in fact, Bayonne/Elizabeth tended to have higher concentrations in the summer. For water samples, Devils Lake had particularly low VOC levels. Bromoform, which was found in California samples, was almost never present in Bayonne/Elizabeth, Greensboro and Devils Lake samples.					; Wallace, Lance/K-7264-2013	Wallace, Lance/0000-0002-6635-2303; 													1352-2310	1873-2844					1987	21	11					2413	2424		10.1016/0004-6981(87)90376-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0004-6981(87)90376-3													WOS:A1987K787500015
J	BERTHON, JL				BERTHON, JL			COMPARISON OF BIOMASS AND ENERGETIC CONTENTS OF A PLANKTONIC COPEPOD - ACANTHOCYCLOPS-VERNALIS (FISCHER 1853)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												In Lake Dayet er Roumi [Morocco], the annual cycle of A. vernalis (Copepoda) is composed of 2 different cohorts, the 1st in autumn, the other, numerically the most important, in spring. Growth rates and size of the individuals are nearly equivalent in the 2 cohorts, but their chemical composition changes appreciably. Autumn animals have a higher energetic content than spring ones: 2.425 104 nm .cntdot. g-1 and 1.965 104 nm .cntdot. g-1, respectively. The result is a great difference in biomass and production value between the 2 populations. Because of the difference in population density, the autumn cohort produces much less than the spring one. Because each autumn specimen has a higher energy content, this difference becomes much smaller, on balance. The difference in numbers between the cohorts could result from the fact that in autumn, but not spring, A. vernalis, because so rich in energy, is strongly positively selected by predators.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1985	123	3					223	231		10.1007/BF00034383	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00034383													WOS:A1985AHQ0200007

Chlorophyll a seasonality in four shallow eutrophic lakes (northern British Columbia, Canada) and the critical roles of internal phosphorus loading and temperature	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Chlorophyll a (Chl a) seasonality was investigated in four shallow eutrophic lakes located in north-central British Columbia (western Canada). Chlorophyll a concentration maxima in all four lakes occurred during the late summer/early autumn when near-surface total phosphorus ([Tot-P]) and total dissolved P concentrations, pH, and water temperature were highest. Mass balance and inferential analyses showed that bloom-triggering P loads came mostly from within-lake sources, but that mechanisms controlling internal loading in Charlie and Tabor (lakes having hypolimnetic oxygen deficits during summer) were fundamentally different than those in Nulki and Tachick (isothermal, well oxygenated lakes). Although the timing and intensity of major blooms were associated with late summer/early autumn P loads, average summer [Chl a] were predicted well by previously developed models based solely on spring overturn [Tot-P]. Instantaneous within-lake [Chl a] were best predicted by models incorporating both surface [Tot-P] and temperature (r(2) = 0.57-0.70). Moreover, [Tot-P] and temperature combined accounted for 57% of among-lake variations in instantaneous [Chl a]: log [Chl a] = 0.038 (degrees C) + 0.006 ([Tot-P]) + 0.203 (P < 0.001), where [Chl a] and [Tot-P] are in mu g l(-1). Positive associations between instantaneous [Chl a] and temperature support climate change models that forecast changes in phytoplankton productivity even if nutrient loading rates remain constant.																			0018-8158					JAN	2007	575						285	299		10.1007/s10750-006-0377-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0377-8													WOS:000242505000023

Inferring phytoplankton community composition with a fatty acid mixing model	ECOSPHERE												The taxon specificity of fatty acid composition in algal classes suggests that fatty acids could be used as chemotaxonomic markers for phytoplankton composition. The applicability of phospholipid-derived fatty acids as chemotaxonomic markers for phytoplankton composition was evaluated by using a Bayesian fatty acid-based mixing model. Fatty acid profiles from monocultures of chlorophytes, cyanobacteria, diatoms, euglenoids, dinoflagellates, raphidophyte, cryptophytes and chrysophytes were used as a reference library to infer phytoplankton community composition in five moderately humic, large boreal lakes in three different seasons ( spring, summer and fall). The phytoplankton community composition was also estimated from microscopic counts. Both methods identified diatoms and cryptophytes as the major phytoplankton groups in the study lakes throughout the sampling period, together accounting for 54-63% of the phytoplankton. In addition, both methods revealed that the proportion of chlorophytes and cyanobacteria was lowest in the spring and increased towards the summer and fall, while dinoflagellates peaked in the spring. The proportion of euglenoids and raphidophytes was less than 8% of the phytoplankton biomass throughout the sampling period. The model estimated significantly lower proportions of chrysophytes in the seston than indicated by microscopic analyses. This is probably because the reference library for chrysophytes included too few taxa. Our results show that a fatty acid-based mixing model approach is a promising tool for estimating the phytoplankton community composition, while also providing information on the nutritional quality of the seston for consumers. Both the quantity and the quality of seston as a food source for zooplankton were high in the spring; total phytoplankton biomass was; similar to 56 mu g C L-1, and the physiologically important polyunsaturated fatty acids 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 comprised; similar to 22% of fatty acids.

Trin. ex Steudel affects subsequent canopy structure and nutritive value of roughage in subtropical highland	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												In recent decades, constructed wetlands dominated by common reeds [Phragmites australis (CAV.) Trin. ex Steudel] have been utilized for treating nitrogen-rich wastewaters. Although plant harvest is a vegetation management in constructed wetlands for the purpose of improving nutrient removal, harvested biomass has become a problem in many places. The reed has attracted increasing interest for its potential as high-quality roughage for ruminants. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the effect of reed harvest timing on subsequent regrowth, reconstruction of canopy structure, and nutritive value of regrown biomass for roughage when defining an appropriate vegetation management in constructed wetlands. The shoots of common reeds were harvested in January (winter), March (spring), and May (early summer) in a free-water surface constructed wetland in southwest China. Harvesting in winter enhanced the shoot regrowth and concentrations of total digestible nutrients (TDN), probably due to vigorous translocations of nonstructural carbohydrates from rhizomes. Harvesting in spring and early summer decreased aboveground biomass, nitrogen (N) standing stock, and concentrations of TDN. From fifty to 110 days after harvest, the TON had sharply declined to values similar to non-harvested stands. Thus, to obtain high-quality roughage, it is recommended that regrown shoots be harvested again within a year in the early growing stage after the first harvest in winter. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Diet and Body Mass of Ducks in the Presence of Commercial Harvest of Brine Shrimp Cysts in the Great Salt Lake, Utah	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Commercial fisheries and waterbirds are often in competition for available resources and may affect each other through limiting available forage for birds or reducing harvest for commercial fisheries. Relatively little is known regarding the wintering population of waterfowl on the hypersaline Great Salt Lake (GSL), Utah, but mid-winter counts indicate waterfowl use the GSL during winter coinciding with a commercial harvest of brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana) cysts (i.e., eggs). We surveyed previously unmonitored pelagic regions of GSL to estimate total wintering populations of waterfowl and collected northern shoveler (Anas clypeata) and green-winged teal (Anas crecca) during 3 nonbreeding seasons, 2009-2012, to examine patterns in diet and body mass of birds using the GSL and estimate the amount of cyst removal by ducks. Our results indicated >200,000 northern shovelers and >150,000 green-winged teal wintered in the GSL and their diets, based on esophageal contents, changed seasonally, likely because of food availability. Esophagi contained predominately wetland plant seeds in fall and spring, whereas GSL invertebrates (i.e., brine shrimp adults and cysts, brine fly [Ephydra spp.] larvae) made up 75-100% aggregate wet weight during winter. Body mass of both species of ducks was greatest in fall and decreased through winter until a partial to full recovery of mass by spring. Though decreases in body mass were positively associated with decreases in GSL cyst abundance, cyst mass in duck diets peaked when cyst abundance was lowest in the GSL. Our results suggest current management of commercial cyst harvest leaves adequate cysts for waterfowl consumption during late winter. Furthermore, estimates of cyst removal from the GSL by ducks suggests they consume <1% of the yearly raw mass removed by ducks and commercial harvest combined, which implies ducks do not have an adverse impact on the commercial cyst harvest. We suggest managers begin incorporating pelagic areas in mid-winter waterfowl surveys to better monitor the relationship between cyst harvest and waterfowl abundance and distributions.

In spite of the importance and agriculturally-intensive phenomenon in Qilu Lake Basin, few studies have provided a modern evaluation of pesticide residues and potential effects to local aquatic organisms. The primary goal of this study was to determine the spatio-temporal variations of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in this area, and to further assess the related ecological risks. Of the 25 OCPs analyzed, 14 were detected, and the concentrations of n-ary sumation 25OCPs were highest in the upstream of rivers, followed by regions close to the lake shore, and the lowest concentrations were found in Qilu Lake in every season except winter. The concentrations of n-ary sumation 25OCPs were the highest in summer, and the lowest in winter. OCP concentrations in spring and in autumn were similar. 4,4 '-DDD, gamma-HCH, HCB, trans-chlordane, and cis-chlordane were 5 OCPs with relatively high risk in Qilu Lake Basin. Interestingly, higher OCP concentrations do not necessarily correspond to higher ecological risk levels. Low predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) values and relatively high toxicity of these OCPs led to their high risk quotient (RQ) values. This work further illustrated that although OCPs have been banned for many years, they were still frequently detected in surface waters, and caused risks to aquatic animals.						/0000-0002-1154-5618; Chen, Chong/0000-0002-1743-7511													0045-6535	1879-1298				SEP	2022	303		1						135029	10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.135029	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.135029		MAY 2022						35605728					WOS:000810029300004

Taxonomic and functional differences between winter and summer crustacean zooplankton communities in lakes across a trophic gradient	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Despite increasing interest in winter limnology, few studies have examined under-ice zooplankton communities and the factors shaping them in different types of temperate lakes. To better understand drivers of zooplankton community structure in winter and summer, we sampled 13 lakes across a large trophic status gradient for crustacean zooplankton abundance, taxonomic and functional community composition and C/N stable isotopes. Average winter zooplankton densities were one-third of summer densities across the study lakes. Proportionally, cladocerans were more abundant in summer than winter, with the opposite pattern for calanoids and cyclopoids. In green (eutrophic) lakes, zooplankton densities were higher under the ice than in brown (dystrophic) and blue (oligotrophic) lakes, suggesting better conditions for zooplankton in productive lakes during winter. Overall, zooplankton communities were more similar across lakes under the ice than during the open water season. Feeding group classification showed a decrease in herbivore abundance and an increase in predators from summer to winter. C/N stable isotope results suggested higher lipid content in overwintering zooplankton and potentially increased reliance on the microbial loop by winter zooplankton. Our results show substantial variation in the seasonality of zooplankton communities in different lake types and identify some of the factors responsible for this variation.					; Silsbe, Greg/AAB-3321-2022	Crawford, Christopher/0000-0002-7145-0709; Shchapov, Kirill/0000-0001-6823-0927; Silsbe, Greg/0000-0003-2673-1162; 													0142-7873	1464-3774				SEP-OCT	2021	43	5					732	750		10.1093/plankt/fbab050	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbab050		AUG 2021											WOS:000705381700009

J	Xu, B; Li, G				Xu, Bei; Li, Gen			A Potential Seasonal Predictor for Summer Rainfall over Eastern China: Spring Eurasian Snowmelt	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												The hydrological effect of snow over Eurasia is important for regulating regional and global climate through affecting land-atmosphere energy exchange. Based on observational and reanalysis datasets, this study investigates the effect of spring Eurasian snowmelt on the following summer rainfall over eastern China during the period of 1979-2018. The results show that a substantial meridional dipole pattern of summer rainfall anomalies over eastern China is closely associated with the preceding spring snowmelt anomalies over Eurasia, especially over remote Siberia. Excessive snowmelt anomalies over Siberia in spring could result in a wetter local soil condition from spring until the following summer, thereby increasing latent heat fluxes and reducing local surface temperature, and vice versa. Then, the anomalous summer surface cooling over Siberia increases the meridional gradient of temperature between the Eurasian midlatitudes and high latitudes, which intensifies the Eurasian atmospheric baroclinicity and motivates the eddy-induced geopotential height responses along with the significant wave propagations spreading from the Eurasian high latitudes to Lake Baikal. As a result, excessive spring snowmelt anomalies over Siberia tend to be accompanied with an anomalous anticyclone circulation to the east of Lake Baikal and an anomalous cyclonic circulation over southeastern China in the following summer. This could lead to a meridional dipole pattern of summer rainfall anomalies over eastern China, with deficient rainfall over northern China and slightly excessive rainfall over southern China. The present findings highlight the lagged effect of spring Eurasian snowmelt on summer climate over eastern China, with implications for the regional seasonal climate prediction.

Macrohabitat associations of fishes in shallow waters of the Detroit River	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Seasonal variation in large-scale habitat selection by fishes in shallow, Canadian waters of the Detroit River was examined. Fish communities were compared among three river segments (upstream, middle and downstream) consisting of areas of shallow water habitat separated by wide hydrologic barriers of deep, flowing water and between inshore and offshore areas. In spring, the most unique, diverse and abundant fish assemblages were found at inshore sites in the middle segment where the largest remaining wetland habitats are located. Fishes used inshore habitat to spawn and probably avoided offshore areas because macrophyte cover was not available in spring. In summer, juvenile gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum and white bass Morone chrysops were observed in high densities in the upstream segment, probably migrating downstream from Lake St Clair. There was little difference in the fish assemblage among macrohabitats in autumn. The upstream segment appeared to be the most degraded, because it contained no species that were not found in the other segments, had a paucity of uncommon species and had significantly more non-native species. This state was attributed to the infilling of coastal wetlands by urban land use and a resulting loss of habitat heterogeneity. The middle segment, with the only remaining wetland habitats, had the greatest occurrence of uncommon species and the only species at risk found in this study. Conservation and restoration efforts should be greatest for wetlands; however, shallow offshore areas provide important fish habitat in summer and autumn.

Three helminth species were identified: Dactylogyrus lenkorani and Dogielius forceps (Monogenea) on the gills and Neoechinorhynchus zabensis (Acanthocephala) in the intestine. Among these species, D. lenkorani was the most common species and a total of 2830 specimens were recorded on 103 fish. The overall prevalence and mean intensity were 80 and 23.11%, respectively. D. forceps was the second dominant parasite in. this study. A total of 179 parasites were found and the overall prevalence was 64%. The third most prevalent parasite was N. zabensis with overall prevalence and mean intensity of 2.3 and 4%, respectively. Regarding seasonal variations, the prevalence of D. forceps was observed to peak in Winter. Its mean intensity level was highest in Spring (3, 30). For D. lenkorani, the highest prevalence was observed in. Summer (100%). Prevalence levels of N. zabensis were rather low and this species was also not detected in Spring and Autumn. This is the first record of these three helminth parasites in C. umbla for Turkey, so these findings are very important for the parasite fauna of Turkey.																			1680-5593	1993-601X					2012	11	5					41	46																WOS:000303201600008

Hence, resolving the spatio-temporal scale may uncover important spatial and/or temporal components in community variability. Using long-term data from Lake Constance (Bodensee), we find that a reduction in grazing pressure and relaxed competition for nutrients during winter and spring generates coherent dynamics among edible and less edible phytoplankton. During summer and fall, when both grazing pressure and nutrient limitation are present, edible and less edible phytoplankton exhibit compensatory dynamics. This study supports recent work suggesting that both abiotic and biotic interactions promote compensatory dynamics and to our knowledge, this is the first example of a system where compensatory and coherent dynamics seasonally alternate.					; Vasseur, David/A-2545-2013	Vasseur, David/0000-0003-1706-9613; 													0030-1299					SEP	2005	110	3					507	514		10.1111/j.0030-1299.2005.14006.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2005.14006.x													WOS:000230995400010

The usefulness of such lacustrine deposits for palaeoclimatic interpretations is discussed. The sedimentology of laminated couplets comprising yellow and grey silts has been investigated to test the hypothesis that the couplets are varves (i.e. annual rhythmites) comprising alternations of loess and glacial silt and clay. The laminae are mostly less than 1 mm thick and include from bottom to top: (1) a matrix of well-sorted, non-graded fine yellow silt with sand-size intraclasts, (2) coarsening-upward grey silt with a cap of fining-upward silt to clay. The latter is typical for varves in modern proglacial lakes and reflects summer and winter deposits (silt and clay, respectively). We propose that the lack of grading and the matrix supported fabric is indicative of aeolian transport and therefore interpret the yellow laminae as loess deposits. Volcanic glass intraclasts in the loess layers are probably derived from volcanic terrain to the west of the lake, indicating an easterly palaeowind direction. Deposition of loess in the lake occurred regularly at the beginning of each annual cycle, suggesting that the palaeowinds were associated with winter and/or spring conditions. Two transport scenarios are suggested to explain the sand grains scattered in this deep-water lacustrine record. 1. The grains may have been transported as bedload over the annual winter ice-cover of the lake under moderate wind strengths, frozen into the ice, and released for deposition during spring melt. 2. The sand grains were blown directly out onto the lake water by very strong winds during spring. The first scenario is contrary to the general view that loess was transported during summer, and that loess deposits thus reflect summer conditions only. Loess input to the lake shows a transitional decrease after ca. 14.3 kyr BP and cessation at ca. 14 kyr BP, probably as a result of a change of wind behaviour, increased humidity and/or vegetational changes during the Oldest Dryas in central Europe.

Declining river flows in western North America, including the upper Columbia River, have reduced the area of open water wetlands in the floodplain and raised concern that the Columbia Wetlands will not remain viable under increasing climate change. In this study we use water isotopes (& delta;O-18 and & delta;H-2) and electrical conductivity to quantify the proportion of groundwater, river water and precipitation contributing to wetland water balance, as well as the role of evaporation, in the Columbia Wetlands through the spring, summer and fall of 2019. We found strong seasonality of water input sources. Groundwater and precipitation were important in spring and fall, while river water was dominant during the summer. An individual wetlands' location in the floodplain as well as relative connectivity to the river channels influenced its seasonal pattern of input sources. Quantifying the relative contributions of the main input water sources to wetlands provides important new understanding of hydrologic connectivity in the Columbia Wetlands.					; Remmer, Casey/LZI-3542-2025; Rooney, Rebecca/H-5586-2012	Rooney, Rebecca/0000-0002-3956-7210; Remmer, Casey/0000-0003-2626-3012; 													0701-1784	1918-1817				APR 2	2024	49	2					204	218		10.1080/07011784.2023.2234869	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07011784.2023.2234869		JUL 2023											WOS:001034601400001

Zooplankton is a secondary producer which acts as the intermediate link between phytoplankton and fish in aquatic environment. Zooplankton diversity in the lake was monitored during autumn 2012 and summer 2013. Among zooplankton single species belonging to protozoa, 11 species to rotifera, 3 species to cladocera, and 2 species with single larval stage belonging to copepod were identified. Percent composition of zooplankton communities revealed that rotifera was the most dominant group followed by copepoda in summer, while rotifera was the most dominant group followed by cladocera in autumn season. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index (SWI) in summer varied from 1.29 to 3.63 and from 1.43 to 3.67 in autumn indicating moderate-to-good level of zooplankton diversity in the lake and low-to-medium impact of organic pollution from the anthropogenic activities. The study indicates that species abundance was lower in summer as compared to autumn season which may be due thereby to variation in environmental characteristics of the lake water.																			2363-5037	2363-5045				DEC	2018	4	4					897	904		10.1007/s40899-017-0183-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40899-017-0183-7													WOS:000461221800019

Our study region covers moderately flat land surfaces seasonally covered by snow/ice/vegetation. The maximum solid Earth uplift of similar to 10 mm yr(-1) is primarily due to the incomplete glacial isostatic rebound that occurs around Hudson Bay, North America. We use decadal (1992 - 2002) surface height measurements from TOPEX/POSEIDON radar altimetry to generate height changes time series for 12 selected locations in the study region. Due to the seasonally varying surface characteristics, we first perform radar waveform shape classification and have found that most of the waveforms are quasi-diffuse during winter/spring and specular during summer/fall. As a result, we used the NASA beta-retracker for the quasi-diffuse waveforms and the Offset Center of Gravity or the threshold retracker for the specular waveforms, to generate the surface height time series. The TOPEX height change time series exhibit coherent seasonal signals (higher amplitude during the winter and lower amplitude during the summer), and the estimated deformation rates agree qualitatively well with GPS vertical velocities, and with altimeter/tide gauge combined vertical velocities around the Great Lakes. The TOPEX observations also agree well with various GIA model predictions, especially with the ICE-5G (VM2) model with differences at 0.2 +/- 1.4 mm yr(-1), indicating that TOPEX has indeed observed solid Earth deformation signals manifested as crustal uplift over the former Laurentide Ice Sheet region.					; Lee, Hyongki/AAD-5210-2021	Shum, C K/0000-0001-9378-4067; Lee, Hyongki/0000-0001-6478-7533													1017-0839	2311-7680				APR	2008	19	1-2					37	46		10.3319/TAO.2008.19.1-2.37(SA)	http://dx.doi.org/10.3319/TAO.2008.19.1-2.37(SA)													WOS:000255856500004
J	Schatz, J; Kucharik, CJ				Schatz, Jason; Kucharik, Christopher J.			Urban heat island effects on growing seasons and heating and cooling degree days in Madison, Wisconsin USA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Urban areas tend to be warmer than their rural surroundings, a phenomenon known as the urban heat island (UHI) effect. UHIs are nearly always described in terms of temperature. However, UHIs can also be described using derived climate indices, including growing season length, growing degree days (GDDs), and heating and cooling degree days, which may have more direct ecological and economic significance than temperature alone. To characterize UHI effects on these basic climate parameters, we used over 3 years of continuously collected temperature data from up to 150 locations in and around Madison, Wisconsin, USA, an urban area of population 402 000 surrounded by lakes and a rural landscape of agriculture, forests, wetlands, and grasslands. Compared to rural areas, Madison's UHI extended the freeze-free season by several weeks each year. However, it only shifted the onset of spring and fall (represented by 10-day moving average temperature crossing seasonal thresholds) by 1 day or less in spring and by a few days to a week in fall. The different effects on freeze dates versus running-mean temperatures were primarily because the UHI could affect temperatures during individual freeze events much more than it could influence regional seasonal temperature trends. Urban effects on the meteorological growing season were nearly always greater in fall than in spring. We hypothesize that this is due to seasonal differences in sub-surface temperatures, with urban and rural areas presumably having more uniform sub-surface temperatures in spring after being frozen throughout the winter, contributing to weaker UHI effects in spring than in fall. In terms of degree days, densely built urban areas averaged 14% (209) more GDDs, 25% (117) more cooling degree days, and 6% (284) fewer heating degree days than rural areas, indicating that the UHI could have significant impacts on energy consumption in Madison.

However, few studies have investigated the contributions of alkaline phosphatase (APase) or alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) to P cycling in natural riparian zones. Here, seasonal and spatial development of plankton, P fractions, APA fractions, and fluorescence labeled enzyme activity were investigated in a natural riparian zone in the main diversion channel for water transfer into Lake Taihu. Plankton greatly benefited from APase, and APA production was their important advantage for P acquisition and proliferation. Fluorescence labeling varied greatly between species and seasons, indicating different adaptive strategies for dissolved organic P acquisition. Phytoplankton experienced severe P stress when they were the main APA producers in spring and summer, but bacteria were superior P competitors. During autumn and winter, free APA dominated, phytoplankton APA (phyt-APA) deceased because of low biomass or high dissolved reactive P (DRP) and bacterial APA (bact-APA) proportions were high. Bulk APA and DRP were negatively correlated for the entire data-set and during the productive seasons. Significant negative correlation was observed between phyt-APA and DRP in the lacustrine and wetland zones, but the situation was complicated for bact-APA, probably owing to organic carbon limitation.					wang, pei/MTG-1182-2025; Wang, Ruizhe/NHQ-5372-2025; Wang, Chao/GXF-8353-2022														1944-3994	1944-3986					2016	57	44					20970	20984		10.1080/19443994.2015.1111817	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19443994.2015.1111817													WOS:000382975100032

An unpolluted regulated stream and its recovery gradient dependency from environmental variables	LIMNETICA												Periods of thermal stratification in deep dams can result in increased liberation of ammonia and phosphates at the sediment-water interface, which can cause nutrient enrichment in the downstream river section. We studied the recovery gradient of a thermally altered, regulated, unpolluted stream and its dependency on the main environmental variables. Macroinvertebrate assemblages were assessed in the spring-summer and autumn periods, at three sampling sites in a 1.25 km river reach, downstream from the dam, for 4 years (2019-2022). Water samples were collected from all riverine sites and one site in the dam. Nutrients were measured and hydrological alteration indices were calculated for the longitudinal gradient survey. We aimed to unravel the main environmental variables linked to the dam-induced hydro-morphological pressure affecting macroinvertebrate communities. Complex interactions between nutrients and the main physical parameters were identified as responsible for the observed trends. The analysis revealed natural-born hypolimnetic ammonia as the most contributing parameter to the biomonitoring metrics reflecting the status of macroinvertebrates. Ammonia enters the river system mainly during the dam thermal stratification periods (spring- summer) and as a result, macroinvertebrate communities had the highest recovery rates in the autumn. In this season the stream can achieve good ecological status even as near as 25 m below the dam wall if ammonia concentrations are low. Therefore, seasonal fluctuations of parameters such as dissolved oxygen and temperature in the hypolimnion are affecting invertebrate communities.

The current hypotheses explain this delay as a consequence of a regional aridity during the early Holocene, slow migration rates of forest trees, and/or a long history of land use and agro-pastoralism in this region. In the present paper, support is given to a hypothesis that suggests different precipitation seasonalities during the early Holocene compared with the late Holocene. The oak species of the Zagros-Anti-Taurus Mts, particularly Quercus brantii Lindl., are strongly dependent on spring precipitation for regeneration and are sensitive to a long dry season. Detailed analysis of modern atmospheric circulation patterns in SW Asia during the late spring suggests that the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) intensification can modify the amount of late spring and/or early summer rainfall in western/northwestern Iran and eastern Anatolia, which could in turn have controlled the development of the Zagros-Anti-Taurus deciduous oak woodlands. During the early Holocene, the northwestward shift of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) could have displaced the subtropical anticyclonic belt or associated high pressure ridges to the northwest. The latter could, in turn, have prevented the southeastward penetration of low pressure systems originating from the North Atlantic and Black Sea regions. Such atmospheric configuration could have reduced or eliminated the spring precipitation creating a typical Mediterranean continental climate characterized by winter-dominated precipitation. This scenario highlights the complexity of biome response to climate system interactions in transitional climatic and biogeographical regions.

Of the fish examined, 88.3% had gills parasitized by myxosporeans. The prevalence of the parasite ranged from 80% in the spring and fall, 93% in the summer and 100% in the winter. The parasite induced the formation of white, oval-shaped cysts measuring 40-64 mum x 64-80 mum which deformed the gill lamellae, compressed the capillaries, and caused retraction of the neighboring lamellae. The mature spores were elongated and had two identical, parallel elongate polar capsules. Each capsule contained a polar filament with 9-10 turns. There was no mucous envelope or iodinophilous vacuole. Morphometric differences between this parasite and other species of the genus Henneguya indicated, that he parasite observed in A. altiparanae is a new species.

Very large summer-autumn Nodularia blooms were recorded by Landsat subsequent to low early winter surface water TN concentrations, very low fluvial discharge, and fluvial TN loads as predicted, but contrary to predictions, also when fluvial discharge and TN loads were very high. The observed cause of large Nodularia blooms following high fluvial nitrogen influx was temporary meromixis produced by the large volume of freshwater transporting this nitrogen. Incomplete winter lake circulation reduced internal transport of hypolimnetic nitrogen to surface waters. Meromixis resulted in early stable summer thermal stratification and early depletion of epilimnetic inorganic nitrogen, followed by early and large Nodularia blooms. Variations in magnitude of historic Nodularia blooms in a saline desert lake support the generality of blue-green algal dominance in lakes with low nitrogen and high phosphorus concentrations (i.e. low N:P ratios). However, climatic forcing of fluvial discharge and lake mixing patterns were also shown to be important determinants of seasonal succession of phytoplankton to blue-greens.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				NOV	1988	45	11					1959	1967		10.1139/f88-228	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f88-228													WOS:A1988Q956100010
J	Zhang, RN; Sun, CH; Li, WJ				Zhang RuoNan; Sun ChengHu; Li WeiJing			Relationship between the interannual variations of Arctic sea ice and summer Eurasian teleconnection and associated influence on summer precipitation over China	CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION												This work investigates the relationship between Eurasian mid-high latitudes teleconnection in summer and the interannual variations of Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) from preceding spring to summer and the associated influence on East Asian summer precipitation during the period of 1980-2015 by using NCEP/NCAR reanalysis datasets and the Community Atmospheric Model version 3. 1. Results show that the second Empirical Orthogonal Function mode of the summer 500 hPa geopotential height field over mid-high latitudes of the North Atlantic-Eurasian continent shows a clear "-+-+" pattern with an anomalous trough over the region from Greenland to the North Atlantic, Ural Mountains, and a anomalous ridge over Europe and regions around Lake Baikal, which is similar to the Eurasian (EU) teleconnection pattern. When the summer Eurasian teleconnection exhibits a "-+-+" ("-+-+") pattern, the light (heavy) SIC occurs in regions over Northern Barents Sea and Baffin Bay in preceding spring and over Northern Barents Sea in simultaneous summer, leading to deficit ( excessive) summer precipitations over most regions to north of the Yangtze River valley, especially northern Northeast China and the region between Yellow and Yangtze River valleys. Further study shows that the persistence of light SIC tends to change the local surface turbulent heat flux from spring to summer, triggering the anomalous Rossby wave sources and the propagation of quasi-stationary Rossby wave activity flux southward and eastward from Arctic to East Asia. These physical processes ultimately result in the development of anomalous summer Eurasian teleconnection. In addition, corresponding to the influence of light SIC condition, the "-+" dipole pattern of anomalous Eurasian snow water equivalent (SWE) in April-May is observed from the Ural Mountains to north of Lake Baikal. This dipole SWE pattern then changes the soil moisture and associated heat flux anomalies in the following summer, further resulting in the enhancement of the summer Eurasian teleconnection. Accompanying with occurrence of the "-+-+" Eurasian teleconnection, the Ural blocking and the East Asian trough are weakened. Meanwhile, the summer Asian subtropical jet stream is accordingly accelerated, with increase of the westerly wind over subpolar regions and decreasing to the north of the East Asian subtropical jet stream. This favors formation of anomalous anticyclonic circulation in south of Lake Baikal, leading to weaker cold air activities. The aforementioned circulation system ultimately results in deficit of summer precipitation in northern Northeast China and the regions between Yellow and Yangtze River valleys. Relative to heavy SIC conditions, the influences are inversed. On the basis of the spring SIC index and late spring SWE index, we also establish a prediction model for the summer precipitation in the Yangtze-Huaihe River valley. The hind-cast results show that our prediction model can well predict the variation of summer precipitation in the Yangtze-Huaihe River valley.

The main emphasis was on the transfer of primary production to herbivores since this process dominates the flow of matter within the food web. Biomass size distributions offer an ecosystem approach which relies only on measurements of biomass and a few general assumptions, whereas network analysis is predominantly based on production estimates and requires more detailed knowledge of the ecosystem. Despite these differences, both approaches give consistent results for both the absolute values of the transfer efficiencies and seasonal trends. Estimates of the seasonally averaged transfer efficiency (dominated by the utilization of primary production by herbivores) range from 0.20 to 0.27. They are considerably lower in late winter and spring (0.05 to 0.21) than in summer and autumn (0.25 to 0.38, extreme values: 0.20 and 0.42).

Centric diatoms Cyclotella ocellata (group B) and Aulacoseira granulata (group P) were dominant in the spring, with water mixing and low temperature. Groups F (Elakatothrix gelatinosa, Elakatothrix gelatinosa, and Sphaerocystis schroeteri), J (Pediastrum simplex and Coelastrum reticulatum), G (Eudorina elegans and Volvox aureus), L-M (Ceratium and Microcystis), and H1 (Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and Anabaena spiroides) dominated the phytoplankton community from summer to mid-autumn, with thermal stratification. Groups H1 and P became dominant in the late autumn, with the breakdown of stratification. With the deepening of the mixing zone, groups P and T (Mougeotia sp.) were dominant in the winter. The reservoir was meso-eutrophic according to trophic state index values based on total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll a, Secchi depth and total nitrogen, habitat preferences of PFGs, and diversity indices of phytoplankton. Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that NO3-N, SiO2, TP, pH, and water temperature (WT) were the most important environmental factors controlling PFGs in the BDR. Weighted averaging regression results indicated that among PFGs, groups F and T had a narrower tolerance range for WT, pH, and SiO2, while groups G and T had a narrower tolerance range for TP and NO3-N.					; Varol, Memet/F-6797-2013	Varol, Memet/0000-0001-6475-0570; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				JUL	2019	26	20			SI		20439	20453		10.1007/s11356-019-05354-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-05354-0								31102217					WOS:000473172800036

Though typical numbers of owls were banded at most Great Lakes stations during 1995, a record number were netted at Hawk Ridge, near Duluth, Minnesota and, when compared with more normal years, a remarkably disproportionate 40 percent of the total were banded at 5 stations in New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia. The movement occurred throughout the eastern U.S. and may have been comparable to that of 1965 when unusually high numbers of Northern Saw-whet Owls were netted at songbird banding stations throughout the northeastern U.S. In the Mid-Atlantic states, the 1995 movement was comprised largely of immature females, with the proportion of males decreasing as latitude decreased. Many owls migrating through the Mid-Atlantic states probably wintered south of Virginia. None of our banded owls were recovered as northbound spring migrants along the southern shores of the Great Lakes. Interstation retraps and other autumn recoveries present a pattern that suggests that the forests of the southeastern United States may be an important wintering area for a portion of the eastern continental population of Northern Saw-whet Owls.																			0363-616X						1997	190						74	89																WOS:000077557600013

The Siling reservoir is a major drinking water source for the inhabitants of Yuhang County, Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, China. In this study, water quality index (WQI) was verified to calculate scores based on water characteristics data from September 2011 to September 2012. WQI (considering ten parameters) and a minimal water quality index (WQImin) (considering five parameters: dissolved oxygen (DO), electrical conductivity, turbidity, water temperature and pH) were investigated using an online water quality monitoring system. Statistical analysis techniques: correlation analysis and redundancy analysis were employed to analyse the obtained data. The results showed good water quality in the Siling reservoir during autumn and winter. However, a decreased trend in water quality was observed during spring and summer seasons. WQImir, illustrates similar trend to WQI with a better R2 value of 0.99, with a minimum cost and could be useful for the intervallic routine monitoring program. Higher positive correlation between WQI and DO was observed during winter season. Moreover, the results further indicated the risk of algal blooms in the reservoir water; which reflected the effects of climatic condition on reservoir water quality. This study suggested that the resulting WQI provides valuable information on developing, monitoring and understanding surface source water quality for the decision makers and reservoir management.

J	Scharf, J; Koschel, R				Scharf, J; Koschel, R			Distribution, abundance and life history of Mysis relicta (LOVEN) in the Feldberg Lake District, Germany	LIMNOLOGICA												Distribution, abundance and life history characteristics of Mysis relicta were studied in the Feldberg Lake District (Lake Breiter Luzin, Lake Schmaler Luzin, Lake Zansen) located in northeastern Germany. Between July 2001 and November 2002 mysids were collected by vertical net hauls. In order to determine the impact of the current trophic conditions on the distribution of mysids in these lakes, oxygen concentration, total phosphorus, chlorophyll a and water transparency were also measured. All investigated lakes are mesotrophic at present. Lake Breiter Luzin exhibited great seasonal and spatial variations in mysid abundance. Density of adults and juveniles had a mean of 44.9 +/- 57.1 and 68.7 +/- 99.6 m(-2), respectively. Highest abundance of adults was 110.4 +/- 76.5 m(-2) in summer, lowest abundances of 2.0 +/- 4.0 m(-2) occurred in spring. For juveniles, highest density of 218.4 +/- 174.6 m(-2) was detected in summer and lowest of 0.8 +/- 1.8 m(-2) in winter. No mysids were caught in any of the daytime hauls, but they were widely distributed throughout the water column at night. Size frequency distribution of mysids suggested that reproduction occurred year-round, the most consistent influx of juveniles occurred in early summer and a smaller second cohort in autumn. Highest mysid abundance was 189.2 +/- 318.6 adults and 127.0 +/- 66.3 juveniles m(-2) in Lake Schmaler Luzin, and 59.6 +/- 5.6 adults and 79.4 +/- 11.2 juveniles m(-2) in Lake Zansen. There were great spatial differences in abundance in both lakes.																			0075-9511	1873-5851				OCT	2004	34	3					199	212		10.1016/S0075-9511(04)80045-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0075-9511(04)80045-8													WOS:000225063900004

Projected extreme temperature and precipitation of the Laurentian Great Lakes Basin	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												The Laurentian Great Lakes Basin has been subject to increasingly extreme weather events in the past seven decades. This study uses a regional climate model spanning the region to project summer maximum temperature (Tmax), winter minimum temperature (Tmin), and seasonal extremes of precipitation for the mid-century (2030-2059) and late-century (2060-2089) relative to the baseline period (1980-2009). The basin's southern portion (US side) summer Tmax increases are projected to be greater than those in the northern portion of the basin (Canadian side), whereas Canadian side winter Tmin increases will be greater than those on the US side. The annual number of extremely hot days (Tmax >= 32 degrees C) in this region during mid-century and late century periods is projected to rise by 6.1-15.3 days and 10.0-32.1 days relative to the baseline period (1980-2009) values (0.1-21.5 days), respectively; whereas the annual number of extremely cold days (Tmin <= -18 degrees C) is projected to be reduced by 3.9-6.2 days (mid-century) and 5.5-9.9 days (late century) compared to the baseline period (2.6-60.5 days). The annual number of extremely cold days is projected to remain unchanged in 23%-61% of the area over the Lakes. The Basin's annual precipitation is projected to rise continuously but the degree of change will vary by season. Winter and spring precipitations are projected to rise greatly, autumn precipitation will rise to a lesser extent, but summer precipitation is projected to decline relative to the baseline period. The annual number of extremely wet days ( >= 40 mm/day) over the Lakes only is projected to increase by between 0.3 and 0.6 days (mid-century) and 0.5-0.8 days (late century). The annual number of extremely wet days over land areas is projected to increase by 0.2-0.6 days and 0.5-0.8 days, respectively. However, about 20% of the region will also experience a reduced number of extremely wet days, which implies that future precipitation changes in this region may be quite different at smaller scales (e.g. county to county) than over larger scales. We propose that lake and land differences, seasonal variations, and changed and unchanged areas should all be considered in climate studies of regions within which large inland water bodies reside, as these regions will have similarities with the Great Lakes basin.					; Ciborowski, Jan/AAC-8247-2019	ZHANG, LIANG/0000-0002-6063-3892; Hein-Griggs, David/0000-0003-2304-2409; Ciborowski, Jan/0000-0002-6588-0366													0921-8181	1872-6364				JAN	2019	172						325	335		10.1016/j.gloplacha.2018.10.019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2018.10.019													WOS:000456222800024
J	Lindenschmidt, KE; Chorus, I				Lindenschmidt, KE; Chorus, I			The effect of water column mixing on phytoplankton succession, diversity and similarity	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The lake number was used to describe the mixing condition for three consecutive years (1992-1994) in Lake Tegel, Berlin, and compared to the successions of diatoms, dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria, the main phytoplankton groups in the lake, as well as to diversity and similarity indices. Using both diversity and similarity indices in juxtaposition provides an indication of the growth type of prevailing species (r- or K-strategists) and the degree of competition in the aqua-ecological system. A general pattern of these indices can be recognized as three phases: (i) high diversity-during spring, summer and autumn, interrupted by (ii) phases of low diversity during the late spring clear-water phase as the number of spring species plummeted, and (iii) during the late summer, climax populations of K-strategists. On a smaller time scale, similarity and diversity proved to react sensitively to disturbances at frequencies intermediate in relation to the generation times of the phytoplankton. This supports the 'intermediate disturbance hypothesis', as proposed for phytoplankton by Padisak et al. [(eds) Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis in Phytoplankton Ecology. Kluwer Academic, 1993]. Diversity may remain quite high even for extended periods during summer climax situations, in conjunction with a high degree of similarity, if deeper mixing of the epilimnion occurs at time intervals of 2-3 weeks, as during the summer of 1993. This enables the prevalence of 'ruderal' species, together with some motile K-strategists who actively seek optimal depths for photosynthesis. During such summer situations described by frequent occurrences of lower lake numbers, the epilimnion of Lake Tegel is mixed deeply enough to support ruderals, but not too vigorously to counteract competitive advantages of motile species. Thus, vertical niche separation enhances diversity.

Sampling stations were selected based on systematic, non-random approach, and it was performed in 7 stations, with intervals of 30 days in 2010-2011. At first, indices model of IRWQI, NSFWQI, and TLI was prepared in GIS environment based on qualitative parameters by interpolation functions (deterministic and geostatistical methods). Results demonstrated that qualitative parameters of FC, NO3-, BOD5, DOSat%, pH, PO43- and Turb respectively with annual average quality of 13.5 very bad, 27.4 bad, 46.8, 47.2 and 48.6 moderate, 70 goodish, and 71 good using statistical and geostatistical methods-accounted for highest pollution level and created greatest impact on lake pollution status. This amount was considered as bad and eutrophication quality on the southern and east margins of the lake because of the effluent load of the rivers under high land use activities (especially residential and then agricultural) in comparison with the lake core and north (showing baddish and moderate quality status) has more pollution level than that. Also, all parameters showed a high positive correlation and significance with increased of water temperature owing to increase in pollutant land use activities and condensation of pollutants and decreased of floodrains in warm seasons, and two parameters of TDS and Turb show high significance rather than beginning floodrains in spring and autumn. Also, lake was in qualitative status of baddish 43.7, moderate 58.2, and mild eutrophication 57.2 based on IRWQI, NSFWQI, and TLIChl.a respectively. Further, according to IRWQI index, the quality of lake in summer was in baddish status of 35, in half of initial winter in goodish condition of 56 and spring and autumn in moderate qualitative status of 46.

At two of these sites (Egbert and Burnt Island), TGM concentrations presented significant seasonal variations. Possible explanations for the larger winter-spring/smaller summer fall concentrations included seasonal meteorological differences, a northern hemispherical increase in coal combustion for wintertime heating, seasonal cycles of atmospheric oxidants and overall hemispherical source-sink relationship. The impact of populated/industrialized areas on the TGM concentrations at rural sites was demonstrated using pollution roses. Trend analyses for Egbert and Point Petre indicated relatively stable TGM concentrations between 1997 and 2000. Principal component analysis of TGM and trace metals confirmed the influence of the industrialized/populated area of Southwestern Ontario on both Egbert and Point Petre as well as metal recovery activities from Northern Ontario. For one episode of significant TGM concentrations, only a general geographical area could be implied as the source of atmospheric mercury. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The bacterial diversity is also an important indicator of the stability of the water ecosystems. In order to understand the composition and seasonal variation characteristics of bacterial community in eutrophic lake sediments, we analyzed sediments of Lake Dian by applying the sec-generation sequencing technology to sequence the V4 region of 16S rDNA of Lake Dian sediments in summer and winter. The data were interpreted to comparatively map the bacterial diversity and nature in both summer and winter seasons. Alpha diversity analysis showed that Shannon index and Chaol index of samples collected in summer were significantly higher than those collected in winter, indicating higher diversity and richness of bacterial communities in summer sediments similar to the abundance rarefaction curve. The PCA principal component analysis further demonstrated that seasonal changes resulted in significant distribution change of bacterial communities. Sediment bacteria in summer mainly belonged to the Proteobacteria, followed by Planctomycetes, Chloroflexi and Bacteroidetes phyla. Major sediment bacteria in winter were mainly grouped in Planctomycetes phylum. In summer, the average relative abundance of sediment bacteria belonging to the Planctomycetes phylum was significantly lower than that of winter, whereas other 9 phyla were significantly higher than that of winter season. The species and abundance of sediment dominant bacterial flora showed significant seasonal variations. With the decreased classification level, the abundance of rare bacteria in the sediments of summer samples were increased. At each classification level, the abundance of rare bacteria in sediments of summer samples was significantly higher than that of winter samples, indicating that the low-abundance species in sediments in summer was significantly higher than that in winter. The sediment in summer has higher diversity and richness of bacterial community. The species and richness of sediment dominant flora showed significant seasonal differences.

We tested these hypotheses analysing weekly phytoplankton and chemistry data collected over 2 years of contrasting weather from two adjacent stratified lakes in North Italy, differing from each other by trophic state and water retention time. Dissolved oxygen concentrations were higher in colder hypolimnia of both lakes in the second year following the cold winter, despite the second summer was warmer and the lakes more strongly stratified. Higher loading during the rainy winter and spring increased nutrient (N, P, Si) concentrations, and a phytoplankton based trophic state index, whilst the N/P ratio decreased in both lakes. The weakened Si limitation in the second year enabled an increase of diatom biovolumes in spring in both lakes. Chlorophyll a concentration increased in the oligo-mesotrophic lake, but dropped markedly in the eutrophic lake where the series of commonly occurring cyanobacteria blooms was interrupted. The projected increase of winter precipitation in southern Europe is likely to increase the nutrient loadings to lakes and contribute to their eutrophication. The impact is proportional to the runoff/in-lake concentration ratio of nutrients rather than to the retention time, and is more pronounced in lakes with lower trophy.

Samples collected in different places and at different times of the year were analyzed using 16s rRNA sequencing. At the same time, the physico-chemical parameters of samples from different places and collected in different seasons were measured and analyzed together. According to the diversity index, the summer-autumn diversity was higher than the autumn-winter one. According to the relative abundance of Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the most numerous bacterial communities in the Jinghu Lake. According to the RDA analysis, in addition to temperature, the greatest correlation of the bacterial community was O-2, ammonia and total nitrogen.

J	Felip, M; Pace, ML; Cole, JJ				Felip, M; Pace, ML; Cole, JJ			Regulation of planktonic bacterial growth rates: The effects of temperature and resources	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												We examined the potential limitation of bacterial growth by temperature and nutrients in a eutrophic lake. Dilution cultures from winter and summer were incubated at both high (>20 degrees C) and low (4 degrees C) temperatures and enriched with various combinations of organic carbon (C), inorganic nitrogen (N), and inorganic phosphorus (P). Bacterial abundance, H-3-thymidine incorporation, and H-3-leucine incorporation were measured over the growth cycle. For both winter and summer assemblages, low temperature limited growth even when resources (C, N, and P) were added. When temperature was adequate, bacterial growth in dilution cultures was co-limited by C, N, and P. Additions of either C, P, or N and P alone provide little or only modest stimulation of growth, suggesting that under in situ conditions both nutrients and organic carbon limit bacterial growth. Our results provide little evidence of seasonal adaptation to low temperatures for bacterial communities in temperate lakes. Instead, bacterial growth appears to be temperature limited during winter and resource limited during summer. We propose that, in general, bacterial growth rates are temperature dependent up to a threshold, but that the patterns of change across temperature gradients are resource dependent, such that temperature has little effect on growth in resource-rich environments but a strong effect in resource-poor environments.					; Cole, Jonathan/G-4566-2011; Felip, Marisol/G-2823-2016	Pace, Michael/0000-0001-5945-6131; 													0095-3628					JAN-FEB	1996	31	1					15	28											24185633					WOS:A1996TG94000002

The spatial and temporal features of water quality were analyzed and the water pollution loads at river sections were estimated using statistic analysis. Combining land use in the riparian buffer zone interpreted form Remote Sensing images, the relationship between river water pollution load and land use were analyzed. It was clear that river water in the study area was polluted so seriously that water quality was ranked Grade V or worse. Pollutant input process in most river sections prevailed river self-purifying process. River qualities varied seasonally as that pollutant were denser in spring and winter than that in summer and autumn. Residential land in the 100 m buffer zone and industrial land in the 500 m buffer zone had the greatest influence on water quality. Forested and grassed riparian land appeared important in mitigating water quality degradation.

Measurements were taken over 2 years, during which river discharge ranged from record flooding to base flow conditions. Over the period of study, average denitrification enzyme activity was highest in backwater lakes and lowest in the main channel. Throughout the study reach, highest denitrification enzyme activity occurred during fall and lowest occurred in winter. Rates during spring floods (2001) were only slightly higher than during the preceding winter. Mean unamended denitrification rates ranged from 0.02 (fall 2001 in backwaters) to 0.40 mug N.cm(-2.)h(-1) (spring 2001 in backwaters). Laboratory experiments showed that denitrification rates increased significantly with addition of NO3- regardless of sediment C content, while rates increased little with addition of labile C (glucose). Denitrification in this reach of the upper Mississippi River appears to be NO3- limited throughout the growing season and the delivery of NO3- is strongly controlled by river discharge and hydrologic connectivity across the floodplain. We estimate that denitrification removes 6939 t N.year(-1) or 6.9% of the total annual NO3- input to the reach. Hydrologic connectivity and resultant NO3- delivery to high-C sediments is a critical determinant of reach-scale processing of N in this floodplain system.					; Strauss, Eric/G-3368-2013	Bartsch, Lynn/0000-0002-1483-4845; Strauss, Eric/0000-0002-3134-2535													0706-652X	1205-7533				JUL	2004	61	7					1102	1112		10.1139/F04-062	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F04-062													WOS:000224451000006

Studies were carried out from 1973 to 1975 on the daily activity pattern of this species to understand the role played by it in the lake ecosystem. Horizontal gill nets were used. In early spring, peamouth are active after dusk and during the entire night. In late spring, a little activity was observed during daylight hours but most activity seemed to be at hight. In early summer, they are active for most of the day with intensive movement at night and in the early morning hours. During late summer, 2 activity peaks are noticed, one just after dusk and the other just before dawn. Peamouth during fall are active only at night.																			0047-8539						1981	15	1					126	132																WOS:A1981NK29600024

Impacts of Copper on a Lotic Benthic Invertebrate Community: Response and Recovery	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												We examined the impact of copper on invertebrate community composition in a small stream (Pelican Brook) originating from a zebra mussel infested lake in central Minnesota. One bay of the lake was treated weekly with chelated copper during the summers of 2004 and 2005, resulting in copper levels in Pelican Brook ranging from 0.1 to 0.8 mg/L for three months each summer. Benthic macroinvertebrates were collected from two sites in Pelican Brook in spring and fall over four years (2004-2007), including one pretreatment collection (spring 2004). Samples were also collected from two reference streams (2005-2007). Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, and Plecoptera comprised over half of the community in pre-treatment and reference stream samples. During treatment seasons, mayflies were eliminated and the community shifted to only a few taxa (Hydropsychidae and Chironomidae, primarily Orthocladiinae). Reference stream communities showed seasonal fluctuations but not the massive shifts in taxa abundance seen in the impacted sites. Invertebrate communities began to recover in the first year post-treatment (2006), and by fall 2007 Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera again accounted for over half of the taxa collected. Ephemeroptera, particularly Heptageniidae, appear to be good signal taxa for copper impacts.																			0270-5060					DEC	2010	25	4					575	587		10.1080/02705060.2010.9664407	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2010.9664407													WOS:000284243100010

Samplings were performed usually twice a year in different seasons (spring, summer and autumn). The heavy metal concentrations of zooplankton biomass were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Additionally, for some of the sampling sites - Western- and Eastern basins - the correlations between the heavy metal load of Crustaceans and the element concentrations of the water recorded monthly by the Transdanubian Environmental Protection Agency were also analyzed. The average metal concentrations in zooplankton varied in the following ranges: Cd: 0.25 - 3.91; Cu: 5.9 - 26.4; Pb: 1.59 - 12.84; Zn: 37.6 - 180.5 mg kg(-1) dry weight. Significant spatial and seasonal variations with occasionally outstanding differences in the heavy metal load of samples could be observed during the investigated period. The heavy metal load of the Crustacea plankton biomass in summer and autumn proved to be usually higher than in spring. During the investigated period an overall significant increase in the cadmium, copper and lead load of the Crustacea plankton populating the lake could be observed. Pearson correlation analysis performed between the heavy metal concentration of Crustacea plankton biomass and that of the water in the two outlying basins of the lake revealed strong relationship for Cd, Cu and Zn, while for lead the correlation proved to be not significant.

Energetic carrying capacity of actively and passively managed wetlands for migrating ducks in Ohio	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Habitat conservation strategies of the North American Waterfowl Management Plan (NAWMP) are guided by current understanding of factors that limit growth of waterfowl populations. The 1998 implementation plan of the Upper Mississippi River and Great Lakes Region Joint Venture (UMR and GLRJV) assumed that availability of foraging resources during autumn in wetlands actively managed for waterfowl was the primary limiting factor for duck populations during the nonbreeding season. We used multistage sampling during autumn and spring 2001-2004 to estimate energetic carrying capacity (ECC) of actively and passively managed wetlands in Ohio, USA, and examine this assumption. Energetic carrying capacity during autumn was similar between actively and passively managed wetlands each year. Averaged across years, energetic carrying capacity was 3,446 and 2,047 duck energy-days (DED)/ha for actively and passively managed wetlands, respectively. These estimates exceeded the UMR and GLRJV assumption that 1,236 DED/ha were provided by managed wetland habitats. Energetic carrying capacity declined each year by >80% between autumn and spring migration. Consequently, ECC of actively and passively managed wetlands was low during spring (x = 66-242 DED/ha). These results suggested that duck foraging resources in actively and passively managed wetland habitats are abundant during autumn, but overwinter declines may create food-limiting environments during spring.

Physiological responses of the upside-down jellyfish, Cassiopea (Cnidaria: Scyphozoa: Cassiopeidae) to temperature and implications for their range expansion along the east coast of Australia	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Upside-down jellyfish (Cassiopea spp.) are predominantly tropical, but there have been recent reports of medusae in temperate environments. In 2017 they were recorded in temperate Lake Macquarie, Australia, where they have a tendency to disappear from this area through late winter (Austral, August). This raises questions about the role of temperature as a controlling factor of their abundance, and future density increases with warming oceans as a result of climate change. Here we test the degree to which temperature may drive winter die-offs of the medusa stage in temperate environments, and how this may change with altered thermal regimes. We assessed the physiological response of Cassiopea (via measurement of bell pulsation rate, bell diameter, and routine metabolic rate) under a regime mirroring Lake Macquarie's seasonal temperature drop (autumn into winter) compared to three other temperature profiles: 1) seasonal profile with predicted climate change (+ 2 C), 2) stable temperatures equivalent to the end of autumn (20 C) and, 3) a profile that mimicked the increasing temperatures from winter into summer (20 C increasing to 24 C). Overall, the results indicate that, compared to the ambient state, elevated temperatures can have positive effects on performance of Cassiopea medusae as evidenced by greater bell pulsation rate and bell diameter. The rate of bell diameter decline was lower in all elevated temperature treatments relative to the ambient profile. This highlights the capacity for elevated temperatures in the future to slow the rate of bell degradation, contributing to an increased probability of overwinter survival, thus increasing the size and duration of Cassiopea blooms in temperate waterways such as Lake Macquarie.

J	Craigie, GE; Petrie, SA				Craigie, GE; Petrie, SA			Moult intensity and chronology of Tundra Swans during spring and fall migration at Long Point, Lake Erie, Ontario	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE												Moult intensity and chronology in staging Eastern-Population (EP) Tundra Swans (Cygnus columbianus columbianus) were studied during spring in 1999 and 2000 (n=35) and during fall in 1999, 2000, and 2001 (n=47) at Long Point, Lake Erie, Ontario. To test for age, sex, and seasonal differences in moult intensity, 20 feather regions were scored according to the proportion of growing feathers. Adult, subadult, and juvenile Tundra Swans moulted contour feathers at low intensities during spring and fall. Males and females of all three age classes had similar patterns and intensities of moult during spring and fall. Shared costs of incubation and brood rearing, perennial monogamy, and lack of a breeding plumage could be some of the pressures selecting for intersexual similarities in feather replacement during migration. Adult, subadult, and juvenile Tundra Swans moulted more intensively during fall than spring. Larger lipid reserves and seasonal dietary differences may allow fall-staging Tundra Swans to moult more intensively than spring-staging birds at Long Point. Overlap of nutritionally costly events (moult and migration) may be necessary as Tundra Swans spend half of their annual cycle on spring and fall staging areas. However, reduced daily nutritional costs associated with moulting at low intensities and migrating slowly apparently permits the overlap of these two lifecycle events.																			0008-4301					JUN	2003	81	6					1057	1062		10.1139/Z03-089	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/Z03-089													WOS:000184714500013

Results show that the second mode of the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of the spring snowmelt, featured as a west-east dipole pattern, displays two interdecadal changes near the late-1970s and in the mid-2000s. The increased spring snowmelt over the Western Siberia (WSI) and the opposite situation over the Eastern Europe (EEU) are significantly linked to a meridional quadrupole summertime rainfall pattern on interdecadal time scales, with excessive rainfall over the regions of southern China (SC) and the Huang-Huai River (HHR) and deficient rainfall over the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River Valley (YRV) and Inner Mongolia-northeastern China (IMNC). Besides, the possible mechanisms are discussed from the perspective of the hydrological effect related to snowmelt-induced soil moisture. Increased spring snowmelt can produce more water inflowing into the soil, leading to anomalous soil moisture, which can persist into summer. Excessive (deficient) snowmelt-related soil moisture anomalies over the WSI (EEU) in summer will change local land thermal conditions and thus generate cyclonic (anticyclonic) circulations with a quasi-barotropic structure. Therefore, the eastward-propagating wave-activity flux (WAF) could be strengthened over the WSI and EEU in the mid- and upper-troposphere and further propagate downstream. Combining the local response of atmospheric circulations to summer surface heating induced by local snowmelt-related SM anomalies over Mongolia, an anomalous anticyclonic (cyclonic) circulation near the Lake Baikal (SC) and the related strong descending (ascending) motion over the IMNC (SC) are founded. Besides, strong positive (negative) upper-level divergence appears over the YRV (HHR), which is the right (left) side of the exit region of upper-level jet. The upper-level divergence could be attributed to the convergence (divergence) of meridional winds on the right side of the anticyclonic circulation, thus the uniform descending (ascending) motion also appears over the YRV (HHR) through the collocation of upper-level convergence (divergence) and the compensatory lower-level circulations. Consequently, a quadrupole pattern of secondary circulation over Eastern China is founded, thereby causing the anomalously distributed ECSP under favorable water vapor conditions.																				2296-6463				JUL 5	2022	10								927876	10.3389/feart.2022.927876	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2022.927876													WOS:000828639200001

Climate change and recent water level variability in Patagonian proglacial lakes, Argentina	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												A long series of lakes (similar to 150) borders the Patagonian Andes (south of similar to 38 degrees S), most of which are a geomorphologic relict of Pleistocene glaciations. Employing instrumental records, we inspected lake water level departures from seasonal variations in seven proglacial lakes: Lacar, Mascardi, Steffen, Escondido, Puelo, Vinter, and Argentino. Lakes north of similar to 42 degrees S show maximum gage (water) level during austral winter months; lakes between similar to 42 degrees and similar to 45 degrees S appear transitional; the one lake south of similar to 50 degrees S (Argentino) shows maximum water level in early autumn. Most lakes show moderate level fluctuation throughout yearly records and, in general, show heteroscedacity. Furthermore, Hurst exponents reveal persistent behavior (i.e., long-term memory effect) in all water level series. In most lakes there are no trends in deseasonalized mean and maximum water levels (Seasonal Kendall test). Lake Mascardi-Manso River system (mostly fed by melt water from the retreating Manso Glacier) is a contrasting example that shows a decreasing trend during summer months that we ascribe to the also declining ice volume. Harmonic analysis (Fourier and wavelet transform) of deseasonalized mean and maximum water level time series shows interannual and decadal periodicities that we link to the occurrence of El Nino and/or the Antarctic Oscillation. The associated phase spectrum indicates that there is a similar to 13-month lag between ENSO occurrences and its effect on anomalous lake water levels. Increased snow accumulation during austral winters usually follows summertime El Nino events, which normally result in increased melt water volume that occurs with about one-year delay during the following (austral) spring/summer.

J	Yang, RM; Zhang, TJ				Yang, Rui-Min; Zhang, Tingjun			Dramatic thinning of Alaskan river ice and its climatic controls	ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH												River ice thickness (RIT) directly influences human activities, such as rural transportation and subsistence activities, in addition to ecosystem and hydrology processes in the Arctic. Knowledge of RIT response to the rapid Arctic warming is very limited or essentially lacking. The scientific objective of this study is to investigate changes and variations in RIT and their response to rapid Arctic warming. We used ground -based measurements of 45 river gauge sites from 1961 through 2015 spanning 12 river basins across Alaska. The results indicate that the long-term mean maximum river ice thickness (MRIT) ranged from 40.3 +/- 12.7 cm in the southeast to 187.3 +/- 31.9 cm in northwest Alaska. MRIT decreased dramatically from 1961 to 2015, on average, at a rate of -0.26 +/- 0.17 cm per year, and RIT declined significantly in all months from October through March, and more rapidly in winter than in autumn and spring. The impacts of air temperature and snowfall on MRIT change were analysed, and their relative influences were 74% and 26%, respectively. Specifically, an increase in air temperature was the primary factor contributing to MRIT decrease, while increasing snowfall, and snow on river ice enhanced MRIT decline. Seasonally, snowfall was the primary regulator for thickness change and higher air temperature resulted in RIT declining in autumn, while ice thickness decrease was mostly driven by warming in spring. However, neither air temperature nor snowfall is the primary control factor for declining RIT in winter, and further work needs to be done to detect the reason.					; Zhang, Tingjun/GWB-9359-2022	YANG, RUIMIN/0000-0002-8205-7507; 													1674-9278					OCT	2022	13	5					623	631		10.1016/j.accre.2022.08.001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.accre.2022.08.001													WOS:000874699900001

Most documented long-term changes in stream temperature are from large rivers. We know less about water temperature trends for small headwater streams, especially those found in northern landscapes that contain small lakes. We analyzed 36 yr of stream temperature observations from a long-term watershed study in Ontario, Canada, to understand how headwater streams are responding to climate variability. We found that groundwater-fed (GWF) and lake-fed (LF) streams exhibit contrasting responses, as GWF streams warmed in the spring (0.19-0.60? per decade) and LF streams warmed in the fall (0.39-0.72? per decade). Both stream types exhibited weak temperature trends in summer and winter. These results highlight that a stream network perspective that includes headwater streams and small lakes, and accounts for seasonal changes in thermal regimes, is important for understanding aquatic ecosystem response to climate variability.					; Hudson, Danielle/GRE-6086-2022	Leach, Jason/0000-0001-6639-7993; Hudson, Danielle/0000-0003-2775-8236; 														2378-2242				DEC	2023	8	6					885	895		10.1002/lol2.10349	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lol2.10349		AUG 2023											WOS:001043557700001

The lakes were selected due to the high risk of pollution from agricultural and residential areas. Water samples were taken in 6 control points in the spring, summer and autumn, from 2004 to 2014. Trophic status of the lakes was evaluated based on the concentration of nutrients (nitrates, nitrites, ammonium, nitrogen and phosphorus) and indicators of eutrophication. Studies have shown that the concentration of nutrients varied greatly both in individual years and seasons of the analyzed decades, especially in Lakes Niepruszewskie and Pamiatkowskie. The main problem is the high concentration of nitrates. In general, it showed an upward trend until 2013, especially in the spring. This may indicate that actions restricting runoff pollution from agricultural sources have not been fully effective. On the other hand, a marked downward trend in the concentrations of NH4 over the years from 2004 to 2014, especially after 2007, indicates a gradual improvement of wastewater management. Moreover, seasonal variation in NH4 concentrations differed from those of NO3 and NO2. The highest values were reported in the autumn season, the lowest in the summer. Concentrations of nutrients and eutrophication indexes reached high values in all analysed lakes, indicating a eutrophic or hypertrophic state of the lakes. The high value of the N:P ratio indicates that the lakes had a huge surplus of nitrogen, and phosphorus is a productivity limiting factor.

J	Breen, E; Metaxas, A				Breen, Erin; Metaxas, Anna			Overlap in the distributions between indigenous and non-indigenous decapods in a brackish micro-tidal system	AQUATIC BIOLOGY												In the Bras d'Or Lakes, Nova Scotia, Canada, the vertical distributions and abundances of the non-indigenous Carcinus maenas and the indigenous Cancer irroratus and Dyspanopeus sayi were quantified at 4 sites (to a maximum depth of 3.5 m in 2005), in 3 seasons (spring, summer and fall), in each of 2 years (2005, 2006). All species overlap spatially and temporally at 0.5 m in all seasons and years, indicating a strong potential for biotic interactions (e.g. habitat use, prey consumption). All species, particularly the juvenile stages, were most abundant at shallow (<= 1.5 m) depths and were strongly associated with cobble and cobble-composite substrates. C. maenas and D. sayi abundances were also strongly correlated at shallow depths in Benacadie, Ross Ferry and Kempt Head. In 2006, when winter water temperatures were similar to 1 to 4 degrees C warmer than in 2005 (at which time winter water temperatures were <0 degrees C and ice coverage was extensive), the abundances of C. maenas and D. sayi were similar to 1.5- to 10-fold higher, and pronounced pulses in recruitment were observed. The abundance of C. irroratus was low (<0.125 ind. m(-2)) in Benacadie (compared to C. maenas and D. sayi, at 0.5 to 10 ind. m(-2)), where salinity regularly falls below 20, a level which is outside the preference and tolerance of C. irroratus. Inter-annual differences in water temperatures may influence the survival and abundance of both indigenous and non-indigenous species, which could, in turn, modify biotic interactions among these species.																			1864-7790	1864-7782					2009	8	1					1	13		10.3354/ab00195	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ab00195													WOS:000274028300001

However, there has been a lack of comprehensive analysis and research on the long-term trends and interactions among hydrometeorological factors within the region. To address this gap, this study collected data from 31 meteorological stations in the region and employed statistical analysis methods, including the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test, Sen's slope test, and cross-wavelet analysis. The results revealed significant increases in temperatures, especially in the spring season, while summer, winter, and annual rainfall also exhibited a significant increase. However, spring and autumn rainfall showed a non-significant decrease, and there was a clear decreasing trend in annual streamflow. Interestingly, evaporation demonstrated a significant increasing trend. The annual average temperature and annual runoff exhibited approximately negative correlations in the 6-10-year resonance period and positive correlations in the 4-6-year resonance period. There are significant positive resonance periods in the relationship between annual precipitation and annual runoff within the range of 0-12 years, indicating that precipitation has a substantial impact and serves as the primary source of runoff. Furthermore, there was a transition between "abundance" and "dry" periods in the annual runoff around 4 a, occurring before and after 1973 and 2005. The change points in annual precipitation and runoff were identified as 1993 and 1983.					li, chuannan/HMD-1522-2023; Shan-Shan, Li/Q-9503-2017															2073-4433				DEC	2023	14	12							1793	10.3390/atmos14121793	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos14121793													WOS:001131180500001

Bacterial Community Seasonal Dynamics in Lake Baikal Littoral Zone	MICROBIOLOGY												We performed monitoring survey of the taxonomic diversity and structure of microbial community of littoral zone in Lake Baikal (Russia) during open-water period from June to October 2020 by DNA-metabarcoding approach. It was shown according to analysis that bacterial community divided into two clusters-Cluster-I (Spring) consisted of bacterial species mostly represented in June and which are living during ice-cover period or got here with surface and ground waters. Cluster-II was formed by so called summer-autumn microbial community.

Understanding the process of phytoplankton variation can be particularly useful in water quality improvement and management decisions. In this study, the phytoplankton taxonomic composition, abundance, temporal variations, spatial distribution, and diversity were studied based on a monthly sampling campaign from three sampling stations between May 2010 and May 2011. A total of 132 species (8 phyla, 72 genera), including 64 species of Chlorophyta, 26 species of Bacillariophyta, 21 species of Cyanophyta, 12 species of Euglenophyta, 3 species of Cryptophyta, 2 species of Xanthophyta, 1 species of Pyrrophyta, and 3 species of Chrysophyta were identified. Average phytoplankton diversity index and evenness values were 3.83 and 0.77, respectively, revealing a high biodiversity of phytoplankton community. The phytoplankton abundance averaged 5.11 x 10(6) cells/L, with Bacillariophyta dominant in winter and spring, but Cyanophyta in summer and autumn. There were 14 predominant species including Pseudanabaena limnetica, Chlamydomonas simplex, Cyclotella stelligera, and Chroomonas acuta. Phytoplankton community structure and water quality variables changed substantially over the survey period; redundancy analysis, Pearson correlations, and regression analysis as an integrated approach were applied to analyze the relationships among them. Total phosphorus and ammonium played governing roles in the phytoplankton dynamics of Dongping Lake during all periods investigated.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				MAR	2013	185	3					2627	2645		10.1007/s10661-012-2736-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-012-2736-4								22791112					WOS:000314033300048

At the beginning of summer and throughout autumn, feeding was more intense, decreasing during winter as well as in May and August. Feeding intensity was found to be directly dependent on water temperature. A. macedonica fed mainly on copepods (47.7% in terms of number), but according to Pearre's electivity index, cladocerans (18.5% in terms of number) were the most preferred prey. Although rotifers represented the third trophic group (17.1% in terms of number), they seem to be avoided. The diet composition changed with season and fish size. During summer-autumn, the diversity of food increased. Older fish (170-219 mm) were characterized by a consumption of larger prey, such as fish. Negative and positive selection was present for the smaller (100-200 mum) and the larger (200-300 mum) size class of Bosmina longirostris, respectively, only during the period of population explosion of this species.																			0021-2210						2001	47	3					213	231		10.1560/7YXH-L2AJ-5K2X-A1V9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1560/7YXH-L2AJ-5K2X-A1V9													WOS:000172981500002

The total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUPA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) were the most important groups of total lipid and statistically ranged (P<0.05) from 33.88% to 55.85% and from 23.37% to 38.71%, respectively. The major fatty acids of total lipid in all seasons were palmitic acid (16:0) in SFA, oleic acid (18:1) in MUFA, linoleic acid (18:2) in n-6 PUFA, and docosahexanoic acid (22:6, DHA) in n-3 PUPA. In the present study, n-3/n-6 ratios of total lipid were 2.47, 1.20, 1.03 and 1.40 in spring, summer, autumn and winter, respectively. It was determined that MUFA and PUFA were the most important groups of triacylglicerol and statistically ranged (P<0.05) from 34.09% to 47.02% and from 33.13% to 46.12%, respectively. The main fatty acids of triacylglicerol were palmitic acid in SFA, oleic acid in MUFA and linoleic acid in PUFA. PUPA was the most important group of phospholipid except summer. The total PUFA percentages of the phospholipid statistically ranged (P<0.05) from 38.12% to 65.75%. The major fatty acids identified in the phospholipid were palmitic acid in SFA, oleic acid in MUFA, arachidonic acid (20:4, AA) in n-6 PUFA and DHA in n-3 PUFA in all seasons. DHA was very high in winter (30.41%). It was shown that the fatty acid compositions in the muscle of fish were significantly influenced by seasons.

Most water bodies in the Yangtze River delta are mesotrophic/eutrophic, which has attracted much attention from ecologists. Nevertheless, previous studies on crustacean zooplankton community in this region only focused on their relation to physicochemical factors excluding phytoplankton. In this study, the crustacean zooplankton abundance and environmental factors (physicochemical factors and phytoplankton abundance) were investigated in Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter in 13 waterbodies (8 lakes and 5 reservoirs) located in the Yangtze River delta. Results showed that NO2--N and TN in Spring, SD and TP in Summer had significant difference (P < 0.05) between 8 lakes and 5 reservoirs. That may be related to microbial communities and macrophytes. All 13 studied water bodies were dominated by cyanophyta, whose Microcystis may determine the dominance of Bosmina fatalis. Moreover, eutrophic level should be in relation to the significant difference of plankton between 8 lakes and 5 reservoirs. Finally, five factors (cyanophyta, SD, WT, pH and DO) were significantly correlated with crustacean zooplankton abundance. That indicated the metabolism, reproduction, development and competitors of crustacean zooplankton were affected by these five factors. This research provided basic data of the 13 water bodies and studied the relationship between zooplankton and physicochemical factors as well as phytoplankton, providing scientific basis for the monitoring of eutrophic waterbodies located in the Yangtze river delta.																			0003-4088	2100-000X				AUG 13	2019	55								16	10.1051/limn/2019016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2019016													WOS:000481647600001
J	Bartholow, J; Hanna, RB; Saito, L; Lieberman, D; Horn, M				Bartholow, J; Hanna, RB; Saito, L; Lieberman, D; Horn, M			Simulated limnological effects of the Shasta Lake temperature control device	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												We estimated the effects of a temperature control device (TCD) on a suite of thermodynamic and limnological attributes for a large storage reservoir. Shasta Lake, in northern California. Shasta Dam was constructed in 1945 with a fixed-elevation penstock. The TCD was installed in 1997 to improve downstream temperatures for endangered salmonids by releasing epilimnetic waters in the winter/spring and hypolimnetic waters in the summer/fall. We calibrated a two-dimensional hydrodynamic reservoir water quality model. CEQUAL-W2, and applied a structured design-of-experiment simulation procedure to predict the principal limnological effects of the TCD under a variety of environmental scenarios. Calibration goodness-of-fit ranged from good to poor depending on the constituent simulated, with an R-2 of 0.9 for water temperature but 0.3 for phytoplankton. Although the chemical and thermal characteristics of the discharge changed markedly, the reservoir's characteristics remained relatively unchanged. Simulations showed the TCD causing an earlier onset and shorter duration of summer stratification, but no dramatic affect on Shasta's nutrient composition. Peak in-reservoir phytoplankton production may begin earlier and be stronger in the fall with the TCD, while outfall phytoplankton concentrations may be much greater in the spring. Many model predictions differed from our a priori expectations that had been shaped by an intensive, but limited-duration, data collection effort. Hydrologic and meteorological variables, most notably reservoir carryover storage at the beginning of the calendar year, influenced model predictions much more strongly than the TCD. Model results indicate that greater control over reservoir limnology and release quality may be gained by carefully managing reservoir volume through the year than with the TCD alone.

J	FILBIN, GJ; BARKO, JW				FILBIN, GJ; BARKO, JW			GROWTH AND NUTRITION OF SUBMERSED MACROPHYTES IN A EUTROPHIC WISCONSIN IMPOUNDMENT	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												The annual growth of submersed macrophytes in Eau Galle Reservoir, Wisconsin, was measured during 1981. Ceratophyllum demersum L. and Potamogeton pectinatus L. collectively comprised approximately 94% of maximum macrophyte standing crop. Much of the macrophyte standing crop, accrued during the summer, senesced during the early fall. However, C. demersum, persisted into the winter. Major senescence in this species occurred prior to spring thaw. Epiphyte biomass comprised in a large portion (up to 33%) of macrophyte biomass, and in combination with phytoplankton, may have limited the growth of submersed macrophytes by light attenuation. Areal densities (g m-2) of N, P and K in macrophyte tissue change primarily as a function of change in standing crop rather than due to changes in respective tissue nutrient concentrations. Release of tissue nutrients associated with macrophyte decay potentially occurred as two separate annual events of sensecence. The significance of the submersed macrophyte community of Eau Galle reservoir in nutrient cycling appears to be relatively minor, because of the persistence of C. demersum into the winter, but more importantly due to the periodically riverine nature of this system. Nutritional conditions in most reservoirs are probably much less influenced by internal loading associated with macrophyte decay than in natural lakes.																			0270-5060	2156-6941					1985	3	2					275	285		10.1080/02705060.1985.9665116	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1985.9665116													WOS:A1985AVB2200014
J	Callieri, C; Karjalainen, SM; Passoni, S				Callieri, C; Karjalainen, SM; Passoni, S			Grazing by ciliates and heterotrophic nanoflagellates on picocyanobacteria in Lago Maggiore, Italy	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												During the oligotrophication of Lago Maggiore, picocyanobacteria (Pcy) increased in abundance and production. In their bimodal, seasonal cycle, the spring peak was due almost exclusively to single cells of Pcy, whereas in late-summer/autumn the variety of morpho-types increased and larger Aphanothece-like rods appeared. Rates of Pcy cell removal by heterotrophic nanoflagellates and ciliates were measured by using fluorescently labelled Pcy (FLC) in four experiments performed during the Pcy population shift from small cocci to larger rods. The ciliate community appeared to be composed mainly of oligotrichs in the first two experiments, and subsequently of scuticociliates; heterotrophic nanoflagellates decreased in number from May to September, and there was a size shift which might reflect species composition change. Peritrichs emerged as the most efficient Pcy grazers. For the other ciliate groups we observed higher individual ingestion rates during the spring experiments than during those performed in late summer/autumn. The heterotrophic nanoflagellates ingested from 0.5 to3 Pcy h(-1) while ciliates ingested from 18 to 80 Pcy h(-1). The grazing impact of the heterotrophic nanoflagellate community ranged from 1.9 x 10(3) to 8 x 10(3) Pcy ml(-1) h(-1), whereas the ciliate community ingestion rate was one order of magnitude lower (0.2 x 10(3)-0.4 x 10(3) Pcy ml(-1) h(-1)). A significant inverse correlation between Pcy size and the clearance rate of heterotrophic nanoflagellates and ciliates was found. Our results indicate that protozoa are less efficient in cell uptake when the Pcy are composed of larger cells. In Lago Maggiore, the carbon flux from Pcy to protozoa decreased from 29.8 to 10.2 mug C l(-1) day(-1) (May and September respectively). A tentative balance on an annual basis suggests that around 80% of the carbon produced by Pcy is taken up by protozoa and channelled to metazooplankton.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				AUG	2002	24	8					785	796		10.1093/plankt/24.8.785	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/24.8.785													WOS:000177061100005

Cortisol secretion of the fish was stimulated in situ by an acute capture stress or by an i.p. injection of 4 IU/100 g body mass of porcine corticotropin (ACTH(1-39)). The response to both these challenges was lower in perch from the highly contaminated site than in perch from the reference site in the spring but not in summer. In fall, fish from the highly contaminated site had, as in spring, a lower response to ACTH than fish from the reference site. The reduced ability of perch to respond to capture stress or to ACTH indicates that the interrenal tissue in fish from contaminated sites is functionally impaired. Cortisol-impaired fish also had abnormal carbohydrate metabolism. The reduced ability of wild fish from contaminated sites to respond to a standardized ACTH challenge may be used as an early indicator of contamination-induced chronic stress.

The goal of this follow-up was to evaluate annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including spring emissions (N.B. gross emissions for reservoir), through flux calculations using the thin boundary layer model. Our measurements underscored the winter CO2 accumulation due to ice cover and the importance of a reliable estimate of spring diffusive emissions as the ice breaks up. We clearly demonstrated that in our systems, diffusive CH4 flux (in terms of CO2 equivalent) were of minor importance in the GHG emissions (without CH4 accumulation under ice), with diffusive CO2 flux generally accounting for more than 95% of the annual diffusive flux. We also noted the extent of spring diffusive CO2 emissions (23% to 52%) in the annual carbon budget.

Results show that the proposed regional algorithm can provide reasonably accurate estimations of water turbidity from satellite observations in the Great Lakes. Therefore, VIIRS-derived water turbidity data are used to investigate spatial and temporal variations in water turbidity for the entirety of the Great Lakes. Water turbidity values are overall the highest in Lake Erie, moderate in Lake Ontario, and relatively low in lakes Superior, Michigan, and Huron. Significantly high values in water turbidity appear in the nearshore regions, particularly in Thunder Bay (Lake Superior), Green Bay (Lake Michigan), and Saginaw Bay (Lake Huron). Seasonal patterns of water turbidity are generally similar in lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, and Ontario, showing relatively high values in the spring and autumn months and lows in the winter season, while the seasonal pattern in Lake Erie is apparently different from the other lakes, with the highest value in the winter season and the lowest in the summer season. A strong interannual variability in water turbidity is shown in the time series of the VIIRS-derived water turbidity data for most of the lakes.

Water samples (n = 168) were collected every month for 1 year (March 2016 to February 2017). Pesticides (cyanazine, simetryn, fenarimol, isoprothiolane, and diazinon) were extracted by Sep-Pack C18 cartridges and analyzed using a reversed-phase HPLC-UV system. The pesticides were also determined in non-target organisms Red algae (Audouinella sp.) and diatoms (Cocconeis placentula) from the river. Based on the residual concentrations, an ecotoxicological risk assessment was conducted using the risk quotient (RQ) index. The human health carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risk assessments were evaluated using hazard quotients (HQ). Results showed that cyanazine was the most commonly detected (64%), followed by simetryn (58%), and diazinon (57%) in all the sample sites (n = 12). Except for isoprothiolane, the pesticides were highest in spring followed by summer, autumn and winter. Based on extreme values (ex), non-acceptable ecotoxicological risk was obtained for diazinon (RQex = 21.317), cyanazine (RQex = 3.129), simetryn (RQex = 8.577) and fenarimol (RQex = 10.855), while that of isoprothiolane (RQex = 0.013) was negligible. Based on the HQ estimates, all the pesticides were below the threshold value of 1, hence pose no significant health risks to humans.

After hydroregulation, two of four icefish species, a migratory species (Hemisalanx brachyrostralis) and a previously rare species (Neosalanx tangkahkeii) were absent from survey samples. The relative abundance of the remained icefish stocks changed greatly. The spring and autumn stocks of N.taihuensis increased from 9.9% and 1.7% to 74.8% and 4.8%, respectively, and N.oligodontis decreased from 84.8% to 20.4%. Total icefish density (CPUE) and yield doubled under the new hydrologic regime. Average adult body size and absolute fecundity of the three persistent icefish stocks decreased, and this could have resulted from slower rates of growth and development of larvae and juveniles in response to greater density of icefishes overall and more intense competition for planktonic food resources during summer and fall.					; Guangchun, Lei/ABC-8081-2021; LU, XINXIN/ADK-5411-2022	Winemiller, Kirk/0000-0003-0236-5129; 													0906-6691	1600-0633				OCT	2013	22	4					637	644		10.1111/eff.12068	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12068													WOS:000327783200014

The mean density of M. leidyi in spring, summer, autumn and winter were 8, 54, 130, and 15 ind m(-3), respectively. The density of various stages, particularly cydippid, showed a decreasing trend with increase in depth. Cydippids had the highest abundance with a lower percentage in the deeper layers and colder seasons. Temperature was found to be the most influential parameter on the distribution of M. leidyi's life stages, particularly cydippids, with a stronger effect in spring and summer. The highest densities for all life stages were observed above 20 degrees C with an explosive growth at above 25 degrees C for the cydippids. Moreover, cydippids were strongly influenced by all the three stages of the copepod Acartia tonsa (nauplius, copepodite and adult), especially its later developmental stages. Due to the presence of M. leidyi, the maximum zooplankton abundance has shifted to cold seasons. There was also a relationship between M. leidyi with barnacle larvae and rotifers in the cold seasons. The interrelationships among the life stages of M. leidyi, particularly between the transition and cydippid, was a major factor in its population dynamics. The relationship curves between these environmental parameters and the life stages of M. leidyi were nonlinear and mostly sigmoidal (not absolutely linear). The magnitude of parameter importance and relationships curves varied with season and life stage. (C) 2020 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, the variability of WCAR is an important issue for disaster prevention and mitigation. This study addressed the linkage of the WCAR variability to the early summer sea ice concentration in the Barents Sea (BSIC) over the course of 1961-2020. It is found that their relationship changes from a significant negative correlation to an insignificant one since the early 21st century. During 1961-2002, the reduction in early summer BSIC can induce anomalous warming of autumn surface air temperature over the Barents-Kara Seas through altering the surface heat fluxes. The resultant warming further triggers a meridional wave train extending from the high latitudes southeastward to the western North Pacific via the region of Lake Balkhash and Lake Baikal, leading to a northward displacement of the East Asian jet, a deepening of the Lake Balkhash trough, and a strengthening of the western North Pacific subtropical high, which favor the increase of WCAR. During 2003-2020, however, the surface thermal anomaly in autumn associated with the reduction of early summer BSIC shifts to the western flank, due to decreased climatology and interannual variability of BSIC. Correspondingly, it yields a westward-located meridional wave train, which fails to affect the above WCAR-related atmospheric circulations and hence the variability of WCAR.

Patterns in the abundance, phenology, and hatching of the resting egg stage of the invasive zooplankter Bythotrephes longimanus: implications for establishment	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												To examine how dormancy contributes to the establishment and persistence of Bythotrephes longimanus, we investigated resting egg production and hatching in relation to the demography of the planktonic stage and environmental conditions in Island Lake Reservoir (USA). During a 3-year study, the largest contribution to the egg bank occurred in autumn and most eggs hatched in spring, but we also detected some resting egg production and hatching in summer. The difference between summer and late autumn densities of eggs in sediments averaged 47% (range 0-98%) for 18 sites throughout the reservoir, which was similar to experimental estimates of in situ hatching fraction of 67% for eggs in the spring and summer following their production. Based on emergence traps, neonates hatch in the field during May and June. We estimated mortality rates of 64% for resting eggs and embryos, and 59% for newly emerged neonates. Although hatching fraction saturated at the same level, eggs incubated offshore hatched later than those nearshore where water temperature was warmer and light was detectable at the sediment surface. Low dissolved oxygen concentration did not significantly reduce hatching fraction but resulted in some eggs that initiated development but failed to hatch. Collectively, our results demonstrate substantial annual turnover in the resting egg bank of B. longimanus and high mortality of resting eggs during recruitment from the egg to the first molt of the planktonic stage. These patterns suggest that propagule pressure in the form of resting eggs requires large numbers for establishment, and that considerable post-establishment resting egg production is necessary for inter-annual persistence.																			1387-3547	1573-1464				NOV	2011	13	11			SI		2547	2559		10.1007/s10530-011-0080-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-011-0080-1													WOS:000296352600009

Many sites occur near lakes and streams creating health hazards and deteriorating water quality. SSF CWs have been evaluated year-round at two northern sites since 1995. The NERCC CWs simulate single homes and the Grand Lake demonstration CW treats STE from a cluster of 9 lakeshore homes. Systems were generally able to achieve design criteria of 25 mgTSS/L and 30 mgBOD5/L and the NERCC CWs required only 0.3m of unsaturated soil to achieve consistent disinfection to < 200 fecals/100 mL year round. Seeding experiments with Salmonella indicated removal efficiencies of 99.8% in summer and 95% in winter. High strength (similar to 300 mgBOD/L, 95 mgTN/L) influent at NERCC probably limited system performance, particularly N-removal (mass) which was similar to 42% in summer and 20% in winter. The data indicate Ws are a viable, year-round treatment option for homeowners in terms of performance, ease of operation, and cost but require additional maintenance related to inconsistent vegetation growth, winter insulation, and meeting concentration-based regulatory standards since they were seasonally and annually variable due to rain events, partial freezing, spring snowmelt, and summer evapotranspiration.																			0273-1223						2001	44	11-12					345	352		10.2166/wst.2001.0850	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2001.0850								11804117					WOS:000172844500048
J	DEEMILIANI, MOG				DEEMILIANI, MOG			SEASONAL SUCCESSION OF PHYTOPLANKTON IN A LAKE OF THE PARANA RIVER FLOODPLAIN, ARGENTINA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Phytoplankton biomass, morphological and taxonomic composition, species diversity and productivity were analyzed in a shallow lake of the Middle Parana River floodplain (El Tigre,31-degrees-41' S and 60-degrees-42' W), between November 1986 and July 1988. Lake inundation (filling and through-flow phases) constituted an intense long-term perturbation in the physical and chemical environment. As the lake filled with river water, K-selected species (netplanktonic filamentous bluegreens, > 37 mum, with low surface area/volume (SA/V) ratios) that had existed prior to filling (late spring 1986) were replaced in summer-fall by r-selected species (nannoplanktonic chlorophytes and cryptophytes, < 37 mum, mainly stout forms with high SA/V ratios). During the through-flow phase, lentic phytoplankton was replaced by lotic flagellate populations due to the direct flushing by river water. During the period of falling water (drainage and isolation phases), nanoplanktonic algae with similar characteristics to those of the filling phase dominated in late winter-spring. Later in the isolation phase, these were succeeded by K-selected species (netplanktonic algae, mainly motile spherical dinoflagellates and filamentous bluegreens with low SA/V ratios). Simultaneously, primary production per unit biomass decreased and total biomass and specific diversity increased. Seasonal changes of phytoplankton in floodplain takes can be interpreted as the interaction between true successional development (as observed in the drainage and isolation phases) and intermediate disturbance. Using Reynolds' terminology, short-term disturbance (slight inflow of nutrient-rich river water) caused 'reversion' to an earlier stage in the former succession, and long-term disturbance (lake inundation) truncated the successional progression and a new (or 'shifted') succession was initiated.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL 26	1993	264	2					101	114																WOS:A1993LW09600004

Phosphite concentrations ranged from <, MDL to 14.32 +/- 0.19 mu g P/kg with a mean concentration of 1.58 +/- 0.33 mu g P/kg, which accounts for 5.51%; total soluble P (TSPs) in surficial, sediments (0-20 CM). Spatially, the concentrations of sedimentary phosphite in the lake's northern areas were relatively higher than those in the southern. areas. Higher phosphite concentrations were always observed in seriously polluted sites. Generally, phosphite in the deeper layers (20-40 cm and 40-60 cm) showed minor fluctuations compared to that in the surficial sediments, which may be associated with the frequent exchange. at the sediment water-interface. Phosphite concentrations in surficial: or core sediments decreased as spring > autumn > summer > winter. Higher phosphite levels occurred in the areas with loiver redox (Eh); higher P Contents, and particularly when metal bonded with P. to form Al-P-s and Ca-Tp(s). Phosphite may be an important media in the P biogeochemical cycle in Lake Taihu and contribute to its internal P transportation.

However, the spatiotemporal variation of the bacterioplankton community composition structure (BCCS) within a large, shallow, highly dynamic freshwater lake is still poorly understood. Here, we examined the seasonal and spatial variability of the BCCs within Poyang Lake by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene amplicon to explore how hydrological changes affect the BCCs. Principal coordinate analysis showed that the BCCs varied significantly among four sampling seasons, but not spatially. The seasonal changes of the BCCs were mainly attributed to the differences between autumn and spring-winter. Higher alpha diversity indices were observed in autumn. Redundancy analysis indicated that the BCCs co-variated with water level, pH, temperature, total phosphorus, ammoniacal nitrogen, electrical conductivity, total nitrogen, and turbidity. Among them, water level was the key determinant separating autumn BCCs from the BCCs in other seasons. A significantly lower relative abundance of Burkholderiales (betI and betVII) and a higher relative abundance of Actinomycetales (acI, acTH1, and acTH2) were found in autumn than in other seasons. Overall, our results suggest that water level changes associated with pH, temperature, and nutrient status shaped the seasonal patterns of the BCCs within Poyang Lake.																			0008-4166	1480-3275				NOV	2018	64	11					786	797		10.1139/cjm-2018-0126	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjm-2018-0126								29791806					WOS:000448727200002

It compares the results with the classic MK trend test at a 95% confidence level. Among the 15 annual and seasonal data series (3 weather stations annually, spring, summer, autumn, and winter) studied, the MK trend test found significant increasing trends of 3 data series (20%). However, using the new ITA method, 6 data series (40%) 'high' and 'low' simultaneously showed a significant increasing trend. The new ITA method can also detect all significant trends identified by the MK trend test. As for the new ITA method, the 'high' values of the 12 data series (80%) exhibited significant increasing patterns, and the 9 data series (60%) displayed significant increasing patterns for 'low' values. According to the 'low' and 'high' values, a gain one data series (6.7%) manifested significant decreasing trends. These results detailed annual and seasonal precipitation data series patterns by evaluating 'low' and 'high' values. The findings also demonstrated that the new method runs counter to the previous ITA.

Low rates of photosynthesis occurred from late fall to early spring and increased to maximum levels in late spring to summer (29-39 mgO2 .cntdot. g-1 dry wt .cntdot. h-1). Areal biomass increased following the rise in photosynthesis and peaked in autumn (163-206 g dry wt .cntdot.m-1). Photosynthetic rates were directly correlated with temperature, nitrogen, and phosphorus over the entire annual cycle and during the growing season. Differences in photosynthetic activity and biomass between the two growing seasons (1980 and 1981) were apparently related to higher, early spring temperatures and higher levels of NO3-N and PO4-P in 1981. Laboratory investigations of temperature and light effects on Pithophora photosynthesis and respiration indicated that these processes were severely inhibited below 15.degree. C. The highest Pmax value occurred at 35.degree. C (0.602 .mu.mol O2 .cntdot. mg-1 chl a .cntdot. min-1). Rates of dark respiration did not increase above 25.degree. thus contributing to a favorable balance of photosynthetic production to respiratory utilization at high temperatures. Light was most efficiently utilized at 15.degree. C as indicated by minimum values of Ik (47 .mu.E .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. s-1) and Ic (6 .mu.E .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. s-1). Comparison of P. oedogonia and Cladophora glomerata indicated that the former was more tolerant of temperatures above 30.degree. C. Pithophora''s tolerance of high temperature and efficient use of low light intensity appear to be adaptive to conditions found within the dense, floating algal mats and the shallow littoral areas inhabited by this filamentous alga.																				1529-8817				DEC	1985	21	4					562	569																WOS:A1985AWZ5700006

Diatom community structure along physico-chemical gradients in Southern Caspian Sea (Noor shore)	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCES												Diatom species diversity and cell abundance are influenced by environmental factors. The effect of physico-chemical factors on interseasonal dynamics of planktonic diatom community structure was examined along Noor shore of Caspian Sea to determine which of the variables impact more on the diatom diversity, distribution and cell number. Overall, 144 samples were collected during four sampling campaigns along four transects of 2 km long each with three sampling sites in 2014 (February, May, July and November). In total, 62 diatom species were identified, of which 27 species were typical marine or brackish-water and the rest were marine-freshwater or freshwater. In the present study, diatom species diversity was highest in winter. As a result, Shannon-Wiener Index was 3.5 in winter, while in spring it was reduced to 0.8. Among the revealed species, the centric Thalassiosira caspica was the most abundant (up to 2.75x 10(6) cells L-1). Comparison of species and their abundances between coastal, middle and offshore stations, as well as all stations as a whole, showed that they differed (Test chi(2), p<0.05) except for Navicula sp. (in summer) and Ulnaria ulna (in autumn and winter). Canonical correspondence analysis results showed that in particular temperature and salinity, in the second place transparency, phosphates and to a lesser extent dissolved oxygen and pH can affect diatom species diversity and abundance. Diatoms Thalassiosira fasciculata, T. caspica and Melosira caspica may be recommended as biological indicators along the shore of Caspian Sea.					; Patimar, Rahman/A-1015-2019	Bigham Soostani, Sarvenaz/0000-0001-8355-3257; Patimar, Rahman/0000-0002-3106-8257													1562-2916						2021	20	4					945	960		10.22092/ijfs.2021.124392	http://dx.doi.org/10.22092/ijfs.2021.124392													WOS:000672753500002

The inspiration is to examine seasonal distribution of Piscicola geometra (L., 1761) fauna's on Cyprinidae family and analyze diseases which they bring about. During the study 161 Abramis brama, 132 Cyprinus carpio, 166 Scardinius erythrophthalmus and 165 Tinca tinca, with total number of 624 samples investigated. This parasite was encountered in the operculum and skin cavity of fish. As a result, the annual infestation rates of Piscicola geometra on Bream, Carp, Rudd and Tench were % 7,7, % 25,9, % 5,4 and % 4,2 respectively. Moreover, the annual mean infestation rate of Piscicola geometra was calculated as % 11. As for seasonal distribution; in autumn this rate is % 2,6, winter % 11,1, spring % 18,2 and in summer the rate has value of % 11,3. Thus, we can conclude that, the infestation rate is not proportional with increase of the temperature.																			1309-1743						2012	15	1					52	58																WOS:000409883700008

Dry deposition calculations include the effects of the wet surface and the predominant seasonal atmospheric boundary-layer structure over the lakes, i.e., strong stability in spring and summer and strong instability in autumn and winter. Modeling results are generally consistent with objective analyses of observed deposition. Best agreement is shown for the lower lakes; the model appears to underestimate deposition to Lake Superior, particularly for S. The analyses themselves contain large uncertainties, especially for Lake Superior, because all monitoring is over land and dry deposition monitoring is also both sparse and indirect. Examination of S and N mass budgets for Lake Superior indicates that the atmospheric pathway plays an important role in total loading and that the atmospheric pathway is more important for N than for S. An examination of modeled and observed S deposition trends during the 1980s illustrates the difficulty in separating possible emission-related trends in deposition from meteorologically induced variability and uncertainties in modeling or analysis when the emission changes are relatively small.																			0013-936X					MAY	1992	26	5					970	978		10.1021/es00029a016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es00029a016													WOS:A1992HR62300026

Positional telemetry for consecutive 96-h was conducted by boat in July 2005 and by walking on surface ice in January/February 2006. Positions of pike (N = 11) were recorded with a GPS unit corrected by a reference station. Movement rates, distance to shore and habitat use were compared between summer and winter and relative to daytime and fish length. Pike moved significantly more in summer, and during summer had activity peaks in twilight periods. In winter, pronounced activity peaks at specific daytime periods were missing and pike chose habitats significantly closer to shore. In summer, submerged macrophyte beds were positively and pelagic areas negatively selected. In winter, pike negatively selected shallow open water in the littoral zone, and there was a tendency to avoid the pelagic. Movement rate and distance to shore were significantly and positively related to the size of pike.

Over 10,000 bats belonging to 11 spp. were found to hibernate. Numbers, dominance, constancy of occurrence, species diversity, capacity and density of individuals in the colony were determined. Maximum density in the population of hibernating bats was 152.6 individuals per 100 m of corridor. Slight differences were found in the value of the species diversity index (H) between different months and also between successive study seasons. Capacity index (K) reached its maximum value at the turning point between Dec. and Jan. Different species appear and disappear within a given time and that exchange of individuals takes place during hibernation. In autumn Myotis daubentoni dominated in the colony, in winter Barbastella barbastellus, in spring M. myotis.

Here, we used Chl-a data from 586 lakes >= 1 km(2) in eastern China from 2013 to 2018 derived from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) onboard the Landsat-8 satellite to examine influences of climatic and anthropogenic factors on Chl-a variations among these lakes, partitioned into groups of different sizes. The results indicate that Chl-a values in small lakes (1-50 km(2)) were higher than those in large lakes (>50 km(2)), and the mean Chl-a in summer and autumn was higher than in spring and winter. Air temperature was positively correlated with the seasonal mean Chl-a in all sizes of lakes. Small lakes had a larger cropland proportion in their watersheds than large lakes, suggesting that the higher cropland proportion of the land cover contributed to the high Chl-a of these lakes. This research highlights the merit of high spatial resolution remote sensing for monitoring lakes in a regional context and indicates that the management of lakes could benefit from controlling agricultural activities in their watersheds.

J	TAGGART, CT; MCQUEEN, DJ				TAGGART, CT; MCQUEEN, DJ			HYPOLIMNETIC AERATION OF A SMALL EUTROPHIC KETTLE LAKE - PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL-CHANGES	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Tory Lake, Ontario [Canada] (1.23 ha, 10 m maximum depth) received hypolimnetic aeration for 2 succesive summers (May-Oct.; 1978, 1979). The small portable aerator did not disturb stratification and raised O2 concentrations (average 2.42 mg/l 1978, and 1.47 mg/l 1979) in the hypolimnion. During the summers of both years total Kjeldahl-N and NH3-N slowly increased in the hypolimnion. NO3-N concentrations remained low. In the fall NH3 was nitrified to NO3 which slowly decreased during the winter. Total hypolimnetic P increased during the summer but the total mass of P was lower in 1979 than in 1978. Soluble Mn decreased as a result of aeration and may have been removed in phosphate complexes. In both summers the metalimnion was virtually anoxic by July, and remained so until fall turnover. H2S increased in the metalimnion but was almost absent in the hypolimnion. Hypolimnetic aeration apparently is a useful lake restoration technique. A method must be found to eliminate anoxic metalimnia which are potential barriers to lake biota.																			0003-9136						1981	91	2					150	180																WOS:A1981LX22000003

Overwinter survival, energy storage and reproductive allocation in the invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) from a river system	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												The dynamic nature of population density during the invasion process may compromise how a population is able to cope with challenging environmental conditions within their non-native range. In temperate regions, one of the greatest seasonal environmental challenges is winter. We assess overwinter survival, changes in body condition and lipid content, and reproductive allocation of round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) from the point of introduction and the leading edges of an expanding invasive population in a tributary of Lake Ontario. Autumn lipid content was highest in round goby from the downstream edge and lowest at the centre of the invasive range, likely due to lower population density and reduced intraspecific resource competition at the expanding edges of its distribution. After 142days of starvation under simulated winter conditions, round goby exhibited 96% survival. Despite the extended starvation period, the majority of females were able to allocate energy into ovarian development, with 60% of females having a gonadosomatic index of >5% at the end of the overwintering period. Individuals originating from the downstream edge allocated significantly more energy towards reproduction compared with individuals from the upstream and centre locations. The results suggest that the position within an expanding invasive range can influence the autumn energy content and consequently the reproductive effort of round goby in early spring. High overwinter survival and greater allocation of energy to reproduction at the expanding edge of an invasion may contribute to the highly successful expansion of the round goby in the Great Lakes Basin.					; Rooke, Anna/AAN-8486-2020	Rooke, Anna/0000-0001-7258-9094; 													0906-6691	1600-0633				APR	2014	23	2			SI		224	233		10.1111/eff.12071	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12071													WOS:000332209100012

Spatial variations in surface water methane super-saturation and emission in Lake Lugano, southern Switzerland	AQUATIC SCIENCES												We measured methane concentrations in the surface water of the northern basin of Lake Lugano in spring (May 2012) and autumn (October 2011, 2012), and calculated turbulent diffusive methane fluxes to the atmosphere. Surface water methane concentrations were highly variable in space and time but always exceeded atmospheric equilibrium. Methane concentrations were significantly lower in spring (on average 16 nmol L-1) than during the autumn sampling campaigns (on average 57 nmol L-1 in 2011 and 45 nmol L-1 in 2012). This suggests methane accumulation in the surface mixed layer during the summer productive season. The origin of the methane in the lake's surface waters requires further assessment, but the observed concentration profiles indicate that the excess methane originates from a near-surface source, rather than from the large deep-water methane pool in the anoxic monimolimnion. As a consequence of the higher surface water methane concentrations and increased buoyancy turbulence caused by autumnal cooling of the surface boundary layer, diffusive fluxes were much higher in October (average similar to 97 mu mol m(-2) day(-1), compared to 7 mu mol m(-2) day(-1) in May 2012). The increase in methane concentration in the surface water between spring and autumn suggests links between methane accumulation and the annual biological cycle, yet seasonal changes in wind and temperature forcing of methane emission likely play an important modulating role. While the relative importance of biological versus physical controls on methane emission in Lake Lugano awaits further investigations, our study underscores that lakes can act as an important source of methane to the atmosphere, even when the lake-internal microbial methane filter in the water column seems to work efficiently.					; Lehmann, Moritz/A-3301-2014; Schubert, Carsten/GQQ-1673-2022; Niemann, Helge/C-6630-2014; Zopfi, Jakob/E-8245-2017; Lehmann, Moritz F./A-3301-2014	Schubert, Carsten J./0000-0003-1668-5967; Niemann, Helge/0000-0002-3468-8304; Zopfi, Jakob/0000-0002-8437-7344; Lehmann, Moritz F./0000-0003-0626-5942													1015-1621	1420-9055				OCT	2015	77	4					535	545		10.1007/s00027-015-0401-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-015-0401-z													WOS:000361396800002

The state-of-the-art of the wind variability studies suggests a hypothetical reinforcement of SB at coastal stations. We first developed a robust automated method for the identification of SB days. Then, by using homogenized wind observations from 16 stations across Eastern Spain, we identified 9,349 episodes for analyzing the multidecadal variability and trends in SB speeds, gusts and occurrence for 1961-2019. The major finding is the opposite trends and decoupled variability of SB speeds and gusts: the SB speeds declined significantly in all seasons (except for winter), and the SB gusts strengthened at the annual scale and in autumn-winter, being most significant in autumn. Our results also show that the SB occurrence has increased across most of Eastern Spain, although presenting contrasting seasonal trends: positive in winter and negative in summer. We found that more frequent anticyclonic conditions, NAOI + and MOI + are positively linked to the increased winter occurrence; however, the causes behind the opposite trends in SB speeds and gusts remain unclear. The SB changes are complex to explain, involving both large-scale circulation and physical-local factors that challenge the understanding of the opposite trends. Further investigation is needed to assess whether these trends are a widespread phenomenon, while climate models could simulate the drivers behind these decoupled SB changes in a warmer climate.

In the laboratory, crab meat and crab shells were seperated. All crab meat and dried crab shell analyses were conducted separately. According to proximate composition analysis, there were no significant differences in the moisture, protein, fat and ash contents in terms of seasons. But there were significant (P < 0.05) changes between male and female crab meats in terms of protein values. It was found that freshwater crab meat was a good protein source. Mineral matter analysis was carried out with ICP-OES instrument after drying of crab samples in lyoflizator. Of the crab meat, the highest contents of calcium, sodium and potassium were 17.87 +/- 1.356 (winter female), 11.88 +/- 0.62 (summer female) and 11.70 +/- 0.50 mg/g (summer male), while these values for crab shell were 197.50 +/- 7.836 (summer male), 3.96 +/- 0.583 (winter male) and 6.26 +/- 0.222 mg/g (summer male), respectively. Chitin and Chitosan analysis were performed from shells with demineralization, deproteinisation, decoloration and deacetylation. Female freshwater crab samples had the highest chitin (7.80 +/- 0.835%) and chitosan (5.86 +/- 0,536%) contents in the summer and spring, respectively. (C) 2011 PVJ.

J	Stuart-Smith, RD; Richardson, AMM; White, RWG				Stuart-Smith, RD; Richardson, AMM; White, RWG			Increasing turbidity significantly alters the diet of brown trout: a multi-year longitudinal study	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The stomach contents of adult brown trout Salmo trutta from Lake Sorell, Tasmania, were analysed during 6 years of increasing turbidity to follow changes in the diet associated with dramatic changes in water clarity. Brown trout were sampled from 1996, when turbidity was 26 NTU, to 2001 when turbidity was 141 NTU. The mean relative volume of stomach contents decreased progressively to 2001, by which time it was only one sixth of that in 1996, and the mean diversity of prey in stomachs decreased from an average of more than six species per stomach in 1996 to one species in 2001. The species composition of stomach contents shifted from domination by the phreatoicid isopod Colubotelson sp., to the galaxiid fish Galaxias auratus and the amphipod Austrochiltonia australis, and then the cladoceran Daphnia carinata. To give an indication of diet changes over a typical yearly cycle in the current turbid state of the lake, a sample was taken from each season from December 2000 to September 2001. Two basic diets were found during the year; brown trout specialized on D. carinata in summer and autumn, and G. auratus in winter and spring. Mean diversity of prey was less than two species per stomach in all samples from 2000 to 2001, except for the sample from spring 2001 when it was 2.2 species per stomach, and the mean relative volume of stomach contents was more than three times greater in winter than any other season. The ways in which high turbidity may have influenced the changes in the brown trout diet observed since 1996 and the patterns evident during the seasons of 2000-2001 are discussed.

Changes in external nutrient supply have turned P limitation, during the 1980s, into the present deficiency of Si for the spring bloom. Contrary to depletion of the N and Si pools, the internal sources and sinks were responsible for input of P into the pelagic ecosystem in the 1990s. Restructuring of the nutrient pool reshaped the pelagic planktonic communities. Changes of the species composition and food-web relationships occurred. Till the 1990s, an increase of diatoms in the summer phytoplankton and an increase of herbivores in zooplankton took place. Later, the role of dinoflagellates, greens, blue-greens and heterotrophic algae increased and more intense competition between herbivorous species of zooplankton developed. The nutrient accumulations in winter and the riverine input defined the phytoplankton spring growth, whereas the decline phase was determined by sedimentation and grazing of the bloom by crustacean zooplankton. Heterotrophic dinoflagellates formed only a negligible share of the vernal phytoplankton. The nutrient requirements of the summer algae were covered by vertical transport and regeneration, where zooplankton-mediated fluxes could be important. There were environmental indications on long-term modification of nutrient summer cycling. The vigorous blue-green algae blooms may have contributed to the sharp increase of the P surface values in summer of the 1990s.																			0018-8158						1999	393						83	94		10.1023/A:1003574706608	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003574706608													WOS:000081924600010

Comparison of glacial and non-glacial-fed streams to evaluate the loading of persistent organic pollutants through seasonal snow/ice melt	CHEMOSPHERE												The release of persistent organic pollutants (PCBs, HCB, HCHs and DDTs) accumulated in Alpine glaciers, was studied during spring-summer 2006 on the Frodolfo glacial-fed stream (Italian Alps). Samples were also taken on a non-glacial stream in the same valley, to compare POP contribution from different water sources (glacier ice, recent snow and spring). In late spring and early summer (May, June) recent snow melting is the most important process. POP contamination is more affected by local emissions and transport, and comparable levels have been measured in both streams for all studied compounds. In late summer and autumn (July-October), the contribution of ice melting strongly increases. In the glacial-fed stream the concentration of chlorinated pesticides (HCHs and DDTs) is about one order of magnitude higher than in the non-glacial-fed. A different behaviour was observed for PCBs, characterised by a peak in June showing, in both streams, concentrations three orders of magnitude higher than the background levels measured in May and in October. This result should be attributed to local emissions rather than long range atmospheric transport (LRAT). This hypothesis is supported by the PCB congener pro. le in June strictly comparable to the most commonly used Aroclor technical mixtures. The different seasonal behaviour observed for the different groups of chemicals indicates the POP loading in glacial streams is a combined role of long range atmospheric transport and local emission.

J	Stephan, LL				Stephan, L. LeMar			VEGETABLE PRODUCTION IN THE NORTHERN EVERGLADES	ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY												The use of refrigerated trucks (esp. since 1900) has resulted in the intensive winter utilization of land around Lake Okeecho-bee in the northern everglades of Florida, for the production of vegetables. Truck farming here is organized on a seasonal basis with production peaks occurring in fall (Sept. 15-Dee. 20) and spring (Mar. 1-May 15). Dominant crops by seasons are snap beans in the fall; celery, cabbage, and English peas in the winter; snap beans, tomatoes, celery and cabbage in the spring. Sugar cane production with low growing costs is favored by a rainy growing season and a dry sunny maturing and harvest season; annual replanting is not necessary. Low terrain and a marsh environment favor mechanization and large scale production. Climatic unpredictability and differences in soil foster diversification. The fertile soils are related to high lime and organic content. Light applications of certain elements such as Cu, Mn, and Zn and heavy applications of K2O and P are necessary. Tenancy based on a cash payment is prevalent. Labor requirements result in a seasonal influx of 4000-5000 cane cutters (Nov.-Apr.) and 5000-7500 vegetable harvesters (Oct. 15-June 1). The production of sugar, starch, beef, and fiber offers reasonable stability but large profits assure a prominent place to vegetable production.																			0013-0095	1944-8287				APR	1944	20	2					79	101		10.2307/141051	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/141051													WOS:000203296900001

Hydrological reconstruction from tree-ring multi-proxies over the last two centuries at the Caniapiscau Reservoir, northern Quebec, Canada	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The objective of this study was to reconstruct 200 years of spring (Q(spr)), summer (Q(sum)) and annual (Q(ann)) water supply variability at the Caniapiscau Reservoir in a remote area of northern Quebec. This region which is a key hydropower region of North America lacks long-term hydrological series, and tree-ring proxies are seen here as the best alternative for the extension of the climatic series beyond instrumental records. Thus, ring widths, ring densities and stable isotope ratios (delta C-13 and delta O-18) were used to perform paleohydrological reconstructions. The following reconstruction techniques were evaluated for each variable reconstructed: partial least square (PLS) regression applied to all of the tree-ring series, PLS regression applied to selected tree-ring series, and the best analogue method (BAM) applied to selected tree-ring series. These three reconstructions were then combined in a composite reconstruction. Reconstruction verification shows that the annual and summer water supply reconstruction quality is good. Conversely, the verification tests disqualified our spring water supply reconstruction. The reconstructed long-term water supply variations over the last two centuries are dominated by decadal to sub-decadal fluctuations, including distinct long hydrological periods during which water supplies change in intensity and variability. Annual water supplies (Q(ann)) inversely correlate with both winter and summer indices. Annual water supplies (Q(ann)) inversely correlate with Arctic oscillation (AO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) winter and summer indices. Also, AO indices also influence Q(ann) to a greater degree than NAO indices. Finally, summer water supplies inversely correlate only with summer indices. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In winter and spring every year a bloom of dinoflagallate Peridinium gatunense produces an average biomass of 150000 ton wet weight. Part of this biomass sinks to the hypolimnion and sediments where it is decomposed and mineralized, with some of the mineralization due to the activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). The sulfate-reduction potential of the upper sediment layer at the deepest part of the lake (42 m) was measured. The activity of the enzyme arylsulfatase was also monitored. Rates of sulfate-reduction ranged from a minimum of 12 nmoles SO42- reduced cm-3 day-1 in December before lake overturn to a maximum of 1673 nmoles SO42- reduced cm-3 day-1 in July during stratification. These rates are considerably higher than those recorded from other freshwater lakes in the world and are probably limited more by the availability of organic matter than by sulfate concentrations.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL 17	1992	235						295	301		10.1007/BF00026221	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00026221													WOS:A1992JM30800027

Both reservoirs are seasonal anoxic and alkaline. The concentrations of sulfate, sulfide, iron, and manganese in Aha Reservoir were enriched compared to the reference levels in Hongfeng reservoir due to the AMD input. It was found that the MeHg accumulation layer in Aha Reservoir transitioned from the top sediment layer in winter to the water-sediment interface in spring and then to the overlying water above sediment in summer. It supported the assumption that spring methylation activity may start in sediments and migrate into the water column with seasonal variation. The weaker methylation in sediment during spring and summer was caused by the excessive sulfide (similar to 15-20 mu M) that reduced the bioavailability of mercury, while sulfate reduction potential was in the optimal range for the methylation in the overlying water. This led to a transport flux of MeHg from water to sediment in spring and summer. In contrast, such inversion of MeHg accumulation layer did not occur in Hongfeng Reservoir. The sulfate reduction potential was in the optimal range for the methylation in top sediment, and dissolved MeHg was positively related to sulfide in pore water of Hongfeng Reservoir ( r=0.67, p<0.001). This result suggested that accumulation of MeHg in lake water and cycling of MeHg at sediment-water interface associate with some sensitive environmental factors, such as sulfur.																			0944-1344	1614-7499				APR	2015	22	7					5124	5138		10.1007/s11356-014-3864-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-014-3864-x								25483970					WOS:000351586500031

In this study, the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of heavy metals in atmospheric deposition in western Taihu Lake were studied. We established 10 sampling sites to collect atmospheric deposition for two years in different seasons. The atmospheric deposition flux follows the order urban area (95.6 g m-; 2.a- 1) > suburban area (80.2 g m- 2.a- 1) > forestland (56.8 g m- 2.a- 1). The concentrations of heavy metals in atmospheric deposition show trends of high values in the winter and low values in the summer and are significantly negatively correlated with distance from the city. The pollution level of Igeo-Cd is 6, which is very high, and that of E-Cd is 219, which means high risk. Heavy metals in atmospheric deposition are mainly taken up via hand-mouth intake, and the harm to children is significantly higher than the harm to adults. The highest health risk assessment values for the four analyzed heavy metals in atmospheric deposition are located near the city and in suburbs (within 5 km of the city center), that is, in areas where human activities are concentrated. The health risk assessment values in areas outside the suburbs are low; these areas are less affected by human activities. The health risk assessment values of heavy metals in the winter and spring are higher than those in the summer and autumn. The Pb isotope ratios show that the main sources of heavy metals in atmospheric deposition and local soil are human activities, such as industry and coal combustion, with less input from natural sources. Heavy metals in atmospheric deposition in the western part of Taihu Lake not only directly threaten local human health but also enter Taihu Lake, posing a serious threat to the Taihu Lake ecosystem.					李, 岩/GRR-5804-2022; Jia, Zhenyi/P-9765-2019	Li, Yan/0000-0001-9909-1675; 													0269-7491	1873-6424				SEP 1	2021	284								117465	10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117465	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117465		MAY 2021						34062436					WOS:000672596600007

The impact of climate change on groundwater recharge: National-scale assessment for the British mainland	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Groundwater systems provide an important source of water supply as well as contributing baseflow to rivers, lakes and dependent ecosystems and so the impact of climate change on these systems needs to be understood. Calculating recharge to groundwater systems is, therefore, necessary to quantify what is typically one of the largest components of the groundwater balance. This study uses the national-scale recharge model developed for the British mainland and the 11 ensemble members from the Hadley Centre for rainfall and potential evaporation created by the Future Flows and Groundwater Levels (FFGWL) project to investigate the impact of future climate on groundwater resources. Changes to seasonal and monthly recharge for the 2050s and 2080s time slices have been produced for the whole modelled area and for river basin districts for England and Wales. Areal summaries and monthly time series of recharge values show a generally consistent trend of increased recharge in winter, decreased recharge in summer, and mixed pattern in autumn and spring. The work shows that increased winter rainfall is the main factor in increasing recharge. Water balance calculations reveal that over the 2050s and 2080s, the climate change "signal" predominates over the annual variability, which results in a clearer pattern of more recharge being concentrated in fewer months. This finding should prove useful for water resources planners to assess the resilience of groundwater resources to climate change. Further work is recommended to understand the sequencing of flooding and drought events and to the effects of soil health and land cover changes in the future analysis.					; Charlton, Matt/KBA-7302-2024	Ward, Robert/0000-0001-7512-2246; Hughes, Andrew/0000-0001-9940-1813; Charlton, Matthew/0000-0003-2045-4184; Kieboom, Natalie/0000-0001-8497-0204													0022-1694	1879-2707				JUL	2021	598								126336	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126336	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126336		MAY 2021											WOS:000661813200120

The main aim: to assess seasonal changes in the mass, velocity and chemical composition of sedimentary material entering Lake Shira on the basis of generalization and analysis of the results of multiyear annual monitoring of the material of sedimentation traps incubated in the lake. Object of the study was the drainless, slightly saline meromictic lake Shira, located in the steppe intermontane depression on the territory of the Republic of Khakassia. Methods: long-term seasonal monitoring of sedimentary material forming bottom sediments using sedimentation traps incubated in the lake; study of the obtained material for a wide range of parameters (biological, hydrochemical, lithological-geochemical, granulometric, etc.) by various conventional methods, including the method of X-ray fluorescence microanalysis on synchrotron radiation beams (XRF-SI), adapted for the study of bottom samples; computer statistical analysis of the data obtained (multiple regression method, cross-correlation analysis, etc.) in order to identify the relationship between regional temperatures and the chemical composition of the deposited material with the construction of a regression model. Results. Based on the study of the amount and elemental composition of the sedimentary material of the seasonal bottom traps of Lake Shira, collected for 2012-2017, a dynamic model of the seasonal influx of sedimentary flows in lakes of this landscape-geochemical type was formulated. It has been established that the most intensive sedimentation of the material occurs in the summer-autumn period, less - in the winter-spring period. At the same time, in spring, the accumulation of allochthonous (terrigenous) aleurite material, supplied with flood waters, predominates; in the summer-autumn period, simultaneously with the deposition of clastogenic pelitic material, biogenic and chemogenic materials are accumulated in sediments in large quantities. In winter, clastogenic and biogenic processes of sedimentation practically stop, only chemogenic sedimentation of carbonates is observed. It was established that the sedimentation of allochthonous material entering the reservoir occurs during two-three months, which indicates a certain inertness of sedimentation. The presence of a stable relationship between the mass and chemical composition of terrigenous material entering the lake with the regional temperature of the near-surface air, which is one of the main regulators of the water balance of the reservoir, is shown.					; Rogozin, Denis/AAE-8113-2019; Darin, Andrey/O-3036-2013; Kalugin, Ivan/A-5608-2014	Darin, Andrey/0000-0001-5966-4838; 													2500-1019	2413-1830					2021	332	12					22	34		10.18799/24131830/2021/12/3178	http://dx.doi.org/10.18799/24131830/2021/12/3178													WOS:000751641500002

Samples were captured monthly from April to December 2002. In male testes, spermatozoa or spermatids were observed from April to July and from September to December. In August, males showed low gonadosomatic index (GSI) and the testes were occupied by spermatocytes. In feature, oocytes with early or late perinucleolus and yolk stages were observed from April to June and from October to December. From July to September, females showed low GSI and a decrease in the number of oocytes with yolk stages. In both males and females, plasma testosterone and 17,20beta-dihydroxy-4-pregen-3-one levels reached peaks in May. In males, 11-ketotestosterone reached a peak in May. In females, estradiol-17beta showed high levels in April. From these results, the reproductive period of smallmouth bass can be considered to be from spring to early summer. However, they have gonads keeping a certain degree of maturity from autumn to early winter.																			0021-5392	1349-998X				NOV	2004	70	6					896	901		10.2331/suisan.70.896	http://dx.doi.org/10.2331/suisan.70.896													WOS:000226502200007

Prey selection by the Lake Superior fish community	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Mysis diluviana is an important prey item to the Lake Superior fish community as found through a recent diet study. We further evaluated this by relating the quantity of prey found in fish diets to the quantity of prey available to fish, providing insight into feeding behavior and prey preferences. We describe the seasonal prey selection of major fish species collected across 18 stations in Lake Superior in spring, summer, and fall of 2005. Of the major nearshore fish species, bloater (Coregonus hoyi), rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), and lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) consumed Mysis, and strongly selected Mysis over other prey items each season. However, lake whitefish also selected Bythotrephes in the fall when Bythotrephes were numerous. Cisco (Coregonus artedi), a major nearshore and offshore species, fed largely on calanoid copepods, and selected calanoid copepods (spring) and Bythotrephes (summer and fall). Cisco also targeted prey similarly across bathymetric depths. Other major offshore fish species such as kiyi (Coregonus kiyi) and deepwater sculpin (Myoxocephalus thompsoni) fed largely on Mysis, with kiyi targeting Mysis exclusively while deepwater sculpin did not prefer any single prey organism. The major offshore predator siscowet lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush siscowet) consumed deepwater sculpin and coregonines, but selected deepwater sculpin and Mysis each season, with juveniles having a higher selection for Mysis than adults. Our results suggest that Mysis is not only a commonly consumed prey item, but a highly preferred prey item for pelagic, benthic, and piscivorous fishes in nearshore and offshore waters of Lake Superior.

Seasonal movements with shifts in lateral and longitudinal habitat use by common bream, Abramis brama, in a heavily modified lowland river	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												Acoustic telemetry was used to investigate the longitudinal and lateral movements and distribution of adult common bream, Abramis brama (L.), over 43months in a heavily modified lowland river in eastern England. A positive relationship between activity and temperature was found, with bream moving greater cumulative distances during the warmer months and distributed over a greater longitudinal proportion of the main channel. The occupancy of tributaries was related to temperature, with bream entering shallow tributaries during rising temperatures in the spring, whilst a deeper, slow-flowing tributary was used more frequently during the cooler autumn/winter months. During the autumn, occupancy of this deeper tributary was positively related to flow rate in the main channel, suggesting that bream use this tributary for flow refuge. The functions of these behaviours are discussed along with potential management of heavily modified lowland rivers.

They forage and roost in agricultural landscapes and may cause damage to sensitive crops. We studied field selection of greylag geese around lake Sorfjarden in south central Sweden where geese aggregate during the growing season. In this area a set-aside field was established in 2010, i.e., a field where geese can graze undisturbed, with the aim to reduce damage in surrounding conventional fields. The goal of our study was to investigate the general selection of the different field types as well as the specific set-aside field. We used a point survey count to estimate goose numbers and regression analyses to evaluate the relationship between presence or absence of greylag geese and field characteristics such as crop type, distance to roost site and field size. According to the top-ranked model, the probability of presence of foraging greylag geese was higher in spring and in grass fields, while the probability decreased with distance to roost site. Our results also show that the set-aside field in general was used more than other fields in the area during spring and summer but not during autumn. We conclude that it is important to consider variables affecting the probability of field selection by geese, such as season, crop type and distance to roosts to understand the behaviour of geese when establishing set-aside fields.

Bacteria were identified and their ability to decompose certain biopolimers was determined. It was found that the number of bacteria growing on helophytes, i.e. common reed and bulrush, increased from spring to summer, and then decreased in autumn. On the surface of hornwort the number of heterotrophic bacteria increased throughtout the whole vegetative season, reaching its maximum in autumn. From among all of the isolated strains, lipo-, cellulo- and proteolytic bacteria were dominant. Strains isolated from the surface of cattail were characterized by the potentially highest physiological activity. The generic composition of the isolated strains changed with the development of the macrophytes (season) and depended on the species of plant.

Evidence from the spatial structure of bird communities on land-bridge islands	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim: We tested the effects of season and migratory status (residents-versus-seasonal migrants) on island biogeography of bird assemblages through partitioning beta diversity into richness and turnover components and community nestedness metrics. We predicted that total beta diversity, the richness component of beta diversity and community nestedness will be lower for bird assemblages in winter than in summer, and lowest of all for winter visitors. These predictions were derived from published ideas about resource availability, movement and habitat choice in birds in different seasons. Location: Thousand Island Lake, China. Methods: Bird species were sampled using line transects on 36 islands during five breeding and winter seasons (2009-2014). Birds were grouped into assemblages of winter residents, winter visitors and summer residents. Associations between beta diversity partitioning, island area, isolation and habitat richness were tested using partial Mantel correlations. We complemented these tests with measures of nestedness and null model approaches. Results: Contrary to expectation, beta diversity, nestedness and difference of beta diversity or its components from null models were higher for winter residents than either summer resident or winter visitor assemblages. As predicted, winter visitors showed little association with habitat richness, and beta diversity was rarely different from null communities. Summer residents had the highest correlations of beta diversity components with habitat richness, but showed the lowest level of total beta diversity, a low richness component and were anti-nested (less nested than random). Main conclusions: Substantial differences were found in the biogeography of winter-versus-summer residents, and seasonal visitor (migratory)-versus-resident bird assemblages, which match expectations derived from bird biology and population ecology. Summer residents highlighted the role of habitat-related niche differences, whereas winter residents showed area-related selective extinction. By contrast, winter visitors appeared to be more randomly distributed.

J	Ludsin, SA; DeVries, DR				Ludsin, SA; DeVries, DR			First-year recruitment of largemouth bass: The interdependency of early life stages	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Four early life events (i.e., hatching, the ontogenetic diet shift to piscivory, fall lipid accumulation, and the first winter) are conceptualized as being critical to Ist-yr recruitment success of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) via cause-and-effect associations among them. Toward this end, we conducted a multiple life-stage investigation of largemouth bass to examine the functional dependency and significance to recruitment of these temporally separated early life events. Specifically, we quantified growth and survival of two largemouth bass year-classes in six Alabama ponds from hatching to the end of the first winter. The first winter was an important survival bottleneck with lower largemouth bass survival in ponds with smaller largemouth bass (high-density ponds), relative to ponds with larger fish (low-density ponds). While cannibalism was not important, we found size-dependent first-winter mortality to be regulated directly by lipid reserves (i.e., triglycerides) accumulated during fall, and indirectly by both hatch date and the ontogenetic diet shift to piscivory during summer. Early-hatched largemouth bass attained an initial length advantage, remaining large relative to late-hatched fish, despite the relatively higher growth rate of late-hatched fish during their first month of life. Enhanced size permitted early-hatched fish to become piscivorous before late-hatched fish, increasing their access to fish prey (i.e., sunfishes) during fall. This in turn elevated their fall lipid accumulation and winter survival above that of late-hatched fish. Our results indeed suggest that Ist-yr recruitment of largemouth bass in southern systems is governed by several functionally dependent critical events. Because each is likely vital to understanding recruitment variability, we suggest that future recruitment studies should adopt a more synthetic (i.e., multiple life-stage) approach.

Differential timing of Wilson's Warbler migration in Alaska	WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												We examined age- and sex-related differences in the timing of Wilson's Warbler (Wilsonia pusilla pileolata) migration at four locations in Alaska: Fairbanks, Tok, Mother Goose Lake, and Yakutat. We captured Wilson's Warblers with mist nets for >= 5 years during spring (northbound) and autumn (southbound) migration. In spring, males passed through our two northernmost sites-Tok and Fairbanks-earlier than females. During autumn, timing of adult migration did not differ by sex, but immatures passed through earlier than adults at all four sites. During previous studies of autumn passage sampled at lower latitudes, the lack of age-related differences in migration timing could be attributed to adults migrating faster than immatures (i.e., if immatures from higher latitudes began migration earlier than the adults, then the adults may have caught up to them at lower latitudes) or to the mixing of breeding populations from different locales. Autumn migration of adults and immatures netted at our two southernmost sites, both coastal locations, preceded migration at our two interior sites. These site-specific differences in the timing of autumn migration are likely the result of our coastal stations sampling birds that breed farther south and arrive earlier than birds breeding in more northerly regions of Alaska (and sampled at our interior stations). Early-arriving populations are likely able to complete their breeding season activities earlier and, subsequently, initiate their autumn migration earlier.																			1559-4491	1938-5447				DEC	2006	118	4					547	551		10.1676/05-085.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1676/05-085.1													WOS:000243309800014

Reproductive biology of the threatened golden galaxias Galaxias auratus Johnston and the influence of lake hydrology	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Golden galaxias Galaxias auratus (31-235 mm fork length, L(F)) were collected monthly from littoral habitats in Lakes Crescent and Sorell, Tasmania, Australia, between July 2000 and December 2002. Spawning habitats were identified and monitored in both lakes, and surveyed in Lake Crescent. Trends in gonado-somatic indices and reproductive stages of development indicated that gonad development in both sexes begins in midsummer and peaks in late autumn to early winter. Males mature at smaller sizes (50% at 52 mm L(F)) than females (50% at 76 mm L(F)), larger individuals are predominately females (95% of fish >= 138 mm L(F)), and overall male to female ratios are female biased (c. 1:2). Spawning occurs late autumn to early spring (water temperatures = 1.4-9.7 degrees C) with peaks in spawning activity in winter (mean water temperatures < 5 degrees C). Demersal adhesive eggs (c. 1.5 mm diameter) were found on cobble substrata (c. 20-250 mm diameter) in littoral areas (c. 0.2-0.6 m deep) and fecundity of fish 71-181 mm L(F) ranged from 619 to 14 478 eggs. The rate of change in water level over the 20 days prior to monthly sampling was important in explaining the occurrence of spent fish and this accounted for temporal differences in spawning between the populations. Lake hydrology influences the reproductive cycle of G. auratus by possibly providing a stimulus for spawning and it controls the availability of spawning habitat in Lake Crescent. Seasonal hydrological cycles (i.e. rises during late autumn to winter) and a minimum water level of 802.20 m Australian Height Datum in Lake Crescent during autumn (above which littoral areas of cobble substratum are inundated) are critical to G. auratus populations.

We also estimated the self-purification capability of TN and TP in Dianshan Lake. The results showed that interannual variability of the average concentration of TN in Dianshan Lake changed significantly, showing a characteristic increase before a decline, and the average concentration of TN showed an obvious downward trend, especially after 2007. Interannual variability of the average concentration of TP in Dianshan Lake fluctuated, and the average concentration of TP showed a downward trend after 2007. The seasonal variations of TN and TP in Dianshan Lake were similar. Higher TN concentration occurred in winter and spring, while higher TP concentration appeared in summer, autumn, and winter. The spatial distribution of TN and TP in Dianshan Lake were similar, showing a characteristic which decreased from north to south and west to east. The highest TN and TP values were mainly distributed in the inlet monitoring sites, while the lowest TP values were distributed in the outlet monitoring sites. The self-purification capability of TN and TP were about 2289.97 t/yr and 112.16 t/yr, which suggested a deterioration of natural water quality.

Temperature is an important physical variable in the biology of both fish and their parasites. Currently, there is no information on the seasonal occurrence of fish parasites in Lake Kariba. The objective of this study was to investigate the seasonal occurrence of metazoan parasites in Hydrocynus vittatus in Lake Kariba, Zimbabwe. Twenty fish specimens were collected by seine netting per season between October 2014 and July 2015 in the Sanyati Basin, Lake Kariba, and examined for metazoan parasites. Mean water temperatures ranged from 24.1 degrees C to 31.2 degrees C with slight variations between the seasons. Metazoan parasites consisting of Monogenea (Annulotrema pikei, Annulotrema pseudonili, Annulotrema bracteatum), Nematoda (Contracaecum larvae), Copepoda (Lamproglena hemprichii), Cestoda (larval cestodes, Ichthybothrium sp.) and Pentastomida (pentastomid larvae) were recorded. Larval cestodes were recorded in autumn and spring, while pentastome larvae were recorded in summer and spring. The Ichthybothrium sp. was recorded once in winter. Annulotrema pikei and A. pseudonili were observed on the gills and A. bracteatum on both the gills and the skin. Contracaecum larvae, L. hemprichii and A. bracteatum (from the skin) were recorded in all the seasons, with slight variations in prevalence, mean abundance and mean intensity. However, these variations were not statistically significant (analysis of variance or ANOVA, p > 0.05). The slight variations in occurrence of the parasites were probably because of the thermal stability of the lake where variation in temperature was small between seasons. Both A. bracteatum and Contracaecum larvae were aggregated on the fish host, whereas L. hemprichii exhibited a random distribution. Parasite diversity was at its highest during winter.

The distribution and dynamic of the water level before and after the TGD were analyzed using frequency distribution and a complex network. Frequency distribution was unimodal before the TGD, and the peak ranged from 13-15 m. Frequency distribution was bimodal after TGD and two peaks ranged from 9-10 m and 16-17 m. The number of days when the water level was above warning level was reduced, and it was increased when the water level was below the ecological level. Further, the TGD had little effect on the number of days of rapid water level rising, which mainly existed during the flood season. However, this imposed a greater influence on the number of days of rapid water level decline, which implies a weaker intensity of the recession process, along with a longer duration. Thirdly, in winter and spring, the water level after the TGD was lower than that before the TGD by approximately 1 m. In summer, the number of days when the water level was above warning level was reduced. In autumn, the frequency distribution changed from unimodal to bimodal. The TGD has the greatest influence during the winter, which resulted in a lower water level and more severe drought.					; Shen, Shi/W-4256-2019	YE, Sijing/0000-0002-8805-8914; chen, shi/0000-0001-9126-229X														2220-9964				NOV	2019	8	11							470	10.3390/ijgi8110470	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi8110470													WOS:000502272600004

The data show that river macrophytes display not only characteristic biomechanical traits and morphological characteristics specific to their hydraulic habitats, but also distinctive temporal changes due to seasonally varying water temperature, flow velocity, and growth phase. Furthermore, the data reveal differences between lake and river specimens that could be explained by wind exposure of the lake sampling sites and the species-specific flow requirements of the river macrophytes. Biomechanical properties and morphological characteristics varied along the stem with larger cross-sections and a higher resistance against tension and bending forces at the bottom compared to the top parts, being similar for both lake and river specimens. The acquired and analysed stem biomechanical and morphological data contribute to the plant biomechanics database to underpin a wide range of studies in aquatic ecology, river and wetland management.					; Albayrak, Ismail/AAS-9598-2020; O'Hare, Matthew/F-3648-2011	albayrak, ismail/0000-0002-4613-6726; 													1015-1621	1420-9055				OCT	2014	76	4					465	481		10.1007/s00027-014-0347-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-014-0347-6													WOS:000342283000001

Alkaline phosphatase activity	ROMANIAN BIOTECHNOLOGICAL LETTERS												Phosphorus is one of the most important inorganic nutrients in aquatic ecosystems, the development and functioning of the phytoplankton communities being often correlated with the degree of availability in assimilable forms of this element. Alkaline phosphatase (AP) is an extracellular enzyme with nonspecific activity that catalyses the hydrolysis of a large variety of organic phosphate esters and release orthophosphates. During 2011-2013, AP Activity (APA) was assessed in the water column and sediments of several aquatic ecosystems from Danube Delta: Rosu Lake, Mandra Lake and their adjacent channels - Rosu-imputita and Rosu-Puiu. The intensity of APA widely fluctuated, ranging between 230-2578 nmol p-nitrophenol L-1h-1 in the water column and 2104-15631 nmol p-nitrophenol g-1h-1 in sediment. Along the entire period of the study, APA was the most intense in Rosu-imputita channel, for both water and sediment samples. Temporal dynamics revealed its highest values in summer for the water column and in autumn for sediment. Statistical analysis showed significant seasonal diferences of the APA dynamics in spring vs. summer and autumn for the water column, and any relevant diferences for sediment.

In this work, a decadal nutrient data set from the eutrophic Lake Taihu, China, revealed a strong seasonal pattern of nutrient concentration and limitation. A nutrient-driven dynamic eutrophication model based on a Bayesian hierarchical framework was established to quantify the relative contributions to temporal variations from external discharges and internal processes. Results showed that after years of efforts on nutrient reduction, external discharges were relatively small and fluctuated less between seasons compared to the internal processes. A quantitative relationship between monthly nutrient concentration and corresponding internal loading was observed. Lake sediment could transform from a source of phosphorus in overlying water in summer and autumn to a sink in winter and spring. Together with temporal variations in nitrification and denitrification, seasonal transformation from the limitation of phosphorus induced colimitation of nitrogen and phosphorus. Understanding the potential impact of internal nutrient cycling on a seasonal pattern of nutrient concentration and limitation, the growth of phytoplankton, and, possibly, phytoplankton community composition should be emphasized, given the change in the relative importance of external discharges and internal loading in the process of lake restoration.

J	JASINSKI, AW				JASINSKI, AW			ANTHROPOGENIC IMPACTS ON SNIARDWY LAKE (POLAND)	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Sniardwy Lake, located in the northeastern part of the Great Masurian Lakes region, is Poland''s largest inland lake. It is classified as a soft-water lake, and has relatively low nitrogen and phosphorus levels. Annual maximum values for chlorophyll (5.4 mg/L) and seston (6.7 mg/L) are relatively low. Pesticide pollution is of concern, and average levels of DDD and DDE were 2.2 .times. 10-5 and 6.2 .times. 10-5 mg/L, respectively. Concentrations of mercury, lead, cadmium, zinc, and copper in the waters of Sniardwy Lake are near, but below, Polish and World Health Organization limits. Similarly, levels of heavy metals in the flesh of freshwater fish all were within acceptable limits (levels of these metals in livers of bream and eel were elevated, however). Levels of these metals in sediment were at least equal to, and often exceeded, levels found in fish tissue. According to Polish standards, the waters of Sniardwy Lake are categorized as Class I (drinkable) during the winter, and Class II (increased pH and total nitrogen) during other seasons. Changes in pH account for the lower classification in spring and summer, while elevated organic nitrogen is responsible for the lower rating in autumn.																			0380-1330						1989	15	3					510	518		10.1016/S0380-1330(89)71506-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(89)71506-9													WOS:A1989AR71000014

With six pyramidal emergence traps anchored to the streambed, a total of 8191 adult specimens of 12 plecopteran species were recorded. Nemoura cinerea was the dominant, and Isoperla oxylepis the rarest species. Emergence was seasonal and influenced by water temperature. Some species emerged mostly in spring/early summer (Nemouridae), and some in autumn/early winter (most Leuctridae). Plecoptera preferred microhabitats with pebbles, mosses and higher water velocity. New data on species-level preferences, such as Leuctra albida selecting similar conditions, improve our understanding of plecopteran ecological requirements in Dinaric karst tufa barriers. Plecoptera assemblage metrics were comparable among the three hydrological periods identified during the study, and among the 14 years of the study, indicating resilience of the recorded species to the effects of ongoing climate change.

Impacts of climate change on hydrology and water quality: Future proofing management strategies in the Lake Simcoe watershed, Canada	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The impacts of climate change on hydrology and water quality of the Black River, a tributary of Lake Simcoe, Canada, were assessed for the period 2001-2100, by integrating two models, HBV and INCA-P, and using statistically downscaled data from the Global Circulation Model CGCM3 for two IPCC scenarios (A1b and A2). The effectiveness of catchment management strategies was assessed across the 21st century by simulating controls on sewage treatment works and fertiliser applications, and implementing buffer strips and bank erosion controls. Both IPCC scenarios projected greatest precipitation increases during winter (highest in A2), and greatest rises in temperature during summer (highest in A1b) throughout the 21st century. Under both IPCC scenarios, the greater winter precipitation and warmer temperatures resulted both in higher winter flows and in an earlier spring snowmelt event Under scenario A2, the flow regime ceased to represent a river with a significant snowmelt influence by the 2090s. Increasing summer temperatures reduced summer flows (greater under A1b). Despite variability between IPCC scenarios, both projected increases in annual TP loadings into Lake Simcoe throughout the 21st century (greatest during winter). Management scenarios reduced, but did not fully compensate for, the impact of climate change upon Black River TP loads throughout the 21st century. Winter increases were still observed, due to high rainfall and flow. This climatic impact has significant implications for the current management plans which aim to reduce TP loads to the Lake by 30 tonnes. Mitigation strategies should therefore focus on methods for reducing TP loadings during wetter conditions. (c) 2012 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) exhibit binge-feeding and digestive flexibility during seasonal resource pulses associated with salmon migrations	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Resource pulses are infrequent, ephemeral events of resource hyperabundance that can represent important feeding opportunities for consumers. To capitalize on pulsed resources, consumers can exhibit behavioural and physiological traits including binge-feeding and phenotypic plasticity of digestive physiology, although expression of these traits has not been observed simultaneously. Further, past studies of binge-feeding have largely focused on times and locations where resources were highly concentrated, ignoring potential temporal and spatial variation in consumer responses. We investigated these traits in bull trout Salvelinus confluentus that experience seasonal resource pulses associated with the spring migration of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka smolts and their fall spawning migrations in a large lake-river system. We also examined spatial variation in S. confluentus diet and feeding behaviour within seasons to explore associations with proximity to aggregated salmon. To do this, we collected S. confluentus stomach contents and analysed consumption rates across seasons and capture locations. We also investigated if the size of digestive organs changed with season. In the spring and fall, S. confluentus consumed O. nerka smolts and eggs, respectively, at high rates, with consumption often exceeding theoretical daily maximums by up to 21.50-fold in the spring and 7.69-fold in the fall. The degree of binge-feeding was correlated with proximity to the lake outlet where smolts and spawning salmon congregate, increasing by 1.21-fold in the spring and 2.78-fold in the late fall for each similar to 13-km shift in capture location towards the outlet. Salvelinus confluentus also exhibited larger digestive organs during the spring and fall, while the same organs were atrophied during the summer. Our results indicate that a single consumer population can exhibit both behavioural and physiological responses to resource pulses, and that exploitation can vary along a spatial gradient of presumed resource availability. These responses emphasize the importance of resource pulses to consumers and the potential for intra-population differences in consumer responses to transient feeding opportunities.																				1095-8649				2025 OCT 8	2025										10.1111/jfb.70242	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfb.70242		OCT 2025						41060094					WOS:001589770700001

Nearly all litter mass and N loss occurred during the winter when soils were mostly frozen. Litter lost mass during the first summer, but during the subsequent two summers when biological activity was presumably higher than it is during winter, litter mass remained constant and litter immobilized N. By contrast, litter lost significant mass and N over both winters of measurement. Mass loss and N dynamics were unaffected by microsite variation in soil temperature and moisture. Whether wintertime mass and N loss resulted from biological activity during winter or from physical processes (e.g., fragmentation or leaching) associated with freeze-thaw is unknown, but has implications for how future climate warming will alter carbon (C) and N cycling in tundra. We hypothesize that spring runoff over permafrost as soils melt results in significant losses of C and N from litter, consistent with the observed influx of terrestrial organic matter to tundra lakes and streams after snow melt and the strong N limitation of terrestrial primary production.					; Chapin, F/AAZ-3931-2020	Hobbie, Sarah/0000-0001-5159-031X; Chapin III, F Stuart/0000-0002-2558-9910; 													0168-2563					NOV	1996	35	2					327	338		10.1007/BF02179958	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02179958													WOS:A1996VW59400002

Samples were collected monthly or bimonthly between March 1981 and May 1982 and weekly between August 1982 and June 1983. Relative abundance of all nine life stages (eight larval stages and one adult stage) in the samples was determined. Futhermore, in 10 selected monthly samples, sex-ratio, relative abundance of three female maturity stages and number of eggs in uteri of ovigerous females were monitored. Nearly all life stages were present throughout the year and M. henricae is thus a perennial form in Lake Bathurst. Relative abundance of life stages suggests that M. henricae produces three successive generations per year. The spring generation, hatched from eggs laid during winter, matures around November-December. Its larval development takes between 4 and 5 months. The summer generation matures after a larval development of 2.5 months; this short period is ascribed to more favourable temperatures. The autumn generation takes about 4 months to mature.

The choice of oxygen conditions as the factor to be investigated was dictated by the fact that it had a particular importance for ecological conditions in the lakes and influenced the ichthyofauna. The study (performed during the hydrological years 2010, 2011 and 2012 - underway) looked at 39 water bodies of different origins, sizes, hydrology and function and the anthropopressure they were subject to. The results show that oxygen conditions in the water bodies varied across a very wide spectrum from oxygen-less, recorded during long periods of continuous ice cover (e. g. Rozlewisko Bytomki 4%, 0.6 mg/l; Brzeziny 5%, 0.7 mg/l) or at a time of sewage discharge incidents (e. g. Trzy Stawy Miechowice 10%, 1.0 mg/l), to extreme supersaturation during spring and summer algal blooms (e. g. Kamieniec 399,7%, 32,8 mg/l; Farskie 313,2%, 27,3 mg/l). The greatest diversity in vertical cross-sections was recorded in summer when phytoplankton development caused oxygen supersaturation in the epilimnion while hampering light penetration into deeper areas, which contributed to the development of oxygen-less conditions in the hypolimnion (e. g. Brantka from 111%, 10.1 mg/l to 2%, 0.2 mg/l, Szczyglowice from 145%, 13.4 mg/l to 3%, 0.3 mg/l). This was particularly frequent in polluted water bodies. In winter, the oxygen content depended on the duration of ice cover, especially in small, highly polluted ponds. In spring and autumn, the best oxygen conditions were recorded in the vertical cross-sections due to the vertical circulation of water and vigorous water turnover.

Seasonal Variation of Fatty Acids and Stable Carbon Isotopes in Sponges as Indicators for Nutrition: Biomarkers in Sponges Identified	MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY												To get a better understanding of sponge feeding biology and efficiencies, the fatty acid (FA) composition and C-13 natural abundance of sponges and of suspended particulate matter (SPM) from surrounding seawater was studied in different seasons at three locations. Haliclona oculata and Haliclona xena from the Oosterschelde, the Netherlands, Halichondria panicea and H. xena from Lake Veere, the Netherlands, and Aplysina aerophoba and Dysidea avara from the Mediterranean, Spain, were studied. Several FA biomarkers for different algal groups, bacteria and sponge biomass were identified in all sponges. The FA concentration variation in sponges was related to changes in fatty acid concentration in SPM. Stable carbon isotopic ratios (delta C-13) in sponge specific FAs showed very limited seasonal variation at all sites. Algal FAs in sponges were mainly acquired from the SPM through active filtration in all seasons. At the two sites in the Netherlands only in May (spring), the sponge specific FAs had similar delta C-13 ratios as algal FAs, suggesting that sponges were mainly growing during spring and probably summer. During autumn and winter, they were still actively filtering, but the food collected during this period had little effect on sponge delta C-13 values suggesting limited incorporation of filtered material into the sponge body. The sponge A. aerophoba relied mostly on the symbiotic bacteria. In conclusion, fatty acid composition in combination with stable carbon isotope analysis can be used to analyze the food source of sponges.					; Boschker, Henricus/A-8868-2011	Wijffels, Rene/0000-0001-7630-4295; 													1436-2228	1436-2236				FEB	2015	17	1					43	54		10.1007/s10126-014-9594-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10126-014-9594-8								25107690					WOS:000348132100005

Seasonal and diel patterns in activity and habitat use by brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) in a small Newfoundland lake	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Despite the challenges winter poses to salmonids inhabiting temperate and northern environments, there are relatively few studies that evaluate the factors that influence activity and habitat use during this season, particularly for lake environments that are ice-covered. This study examines brook trout depth distribution and movement (activity and range) in relation to temperature, light, and time of day across a 17-month period in a small lake in Newfoundland, Canada. Brook trout maintained elevated diurnal activity patterns throughout the year, despite seasonal changes in temperature, shifts in depth use, and prolonged, ice-induced darkness. Despite the tendency for relatively lower activity at night, brook trout remained active nocturnally, inferring a shift in foraging modes rather than a cessation of feeding. Winter movement velocities and ranges were less than other seasons but they occupied littoral areas that overlapped extensively with spring and fall core ranges. In contrast, summer core ranges of brook trout were principally comprised of areas with cooler water in the deep portion of the lake. As water temperature increased, daytime movement velocities increased in a log-linear fashion, whereas modeled nighttime movement velocity relationships with temperature were curvilinear and included the lowest movement velocities at 2-3 degrees C and the highest at the extremes of the occupied temperature range. The ability of brook trout to maintain diurnal activity patterns throughout a wide spectrum of environmental conditions suggests a strong behavioral and physiological capacity to adapt to their seasonally variable environment.

Bubble emissions of CH4 accounted for 99.7 and 91.67% of the total CH4 emission measured at two sites in the summer; however, no bubble was observed in the autumn. The pond was supersaturated with CO2 and CH4 during the monitoring period, and the saturation ratios (i.e. observed concentration/equilibrium concentration) of CH4 were much higher than that of CO2. Although the concentration of dissolved CO2 in the surface water collected in the autumn was 1.24 times of that in the summer, the mean diffusive CO2 flux across the water-air interface measured in the summer is almost twice compared with that in the autumn. The mean concentration of dissolved CH4 in the surface water in the autumn was around half of that in the summer, but the mean diffusive CH4 flux in the summer is 4-5 times of that in the autumn. Our data showed that the variation in gas exchange rate was dominated by differences in weather patterns and primary production. Averaged k(600)-CO2 and k(600)-CH4 (the gas transfer velocity normalised to a Schmidt number of 600) were 0.65 and 0.55 cm/h in the autumn, and 2.83 and 1.64 cm/h in the summer, respectively. No statistically significant correlation was found between k(600) and U-10 (wind speed at 10m height) in the summer at low wind speeds in clear weather. Diffusive gas fluxes increased during the nights, which resulted from the nighttime cooling effect of water surface and stronger turbulent mixing in the water column. The chemical enhancements for CO2 were estimated up to 1.94-fold in the hot and clear summer with low wind speeds, which might have been resulted from the increasing hydration reactions in water due to the high water temperature and active metabolism in planktonic algae. However, both the air and surface water temperatures decreased continually, and relatively lower temperature and overcast weather with occasionally light rain dominated the second campaign in the autumn. The concentration of dissolved oxygen in the surface water and U-10 controlled gas transfer velocities of CO2 and CH4, respectively, in the cool autumn. When the surface water temperature was higher than the air temperature, higher CO2 flux was observed because the water body was unstable and overturned quickly, inducing quick CO2 emitted from plankton algae in surface water to the atmosphere.

This study investigates CO2 and CH4 fluxes in the flooding (A), transition (B), and dry areas (C) of a boreal lake ATTZ. The results showed that CO2 fluxes peaked in the lake ATTZ during summer (85.27 +/- 3.42 mg m(-2) h(-1)). Area C was identified as the primary CO2 emission hotspot, though seasonal variations reversed this trend (A > B > C during autumn). CO2 emissions were primarily driven by CH4 oxidation and organic matter mineralization in area C, while decomposition of organic carbon and microbial respiration were the main contributors in area A. Meanwhile, CH4 fluxes averaged 2.40, 0.49, and 0.35 mg m(-2) h(-1) during summer, spring, and autumn, respectively, with area A exhibiting the highest CH4 emissions. These emissions were influenced by nitrogen loading in area A and redox potential in area C, as well as shifts in microbial communities and functional gene abundance. Key methanogens, including Methanomicrobiales, Candidatus Methanofastidiosum and Methylthiophilus may play an important role in CH4 production. Furthermore, in comparison to the lake center, CH4 fluxes from the lake center were typically higher than those from the lake ATTZ during autumn and summer (p < 0.05). Our findings confirm that the lake ATTZ characterized by significant variability in carbon emissions across different inundation zones, plays a crucial role in estimating the contributions of freshwater ecosystems to global GHGs emissions.					zhao, yiming/ONJ-1421-2025														0013-9351	1096-0953				NOV 15	2025	285		4						122613	10.1016/j.envres.2025.122613	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2025.122613		AUG 2025						40816683					WOS:001562086400002

Identification of Summer Origins of Songbirds Migrating through Southern Canada in Autumn	AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY												Stable hydrogen isotopes (delta D) in flight feathers were measured to investigate the summer origins of five species of boreal-breeding warblers captured during fall migration at Canadian Migration Monitoring Network (CMMN) stations spread across southern Canada. Mean delta D varied among stations and species within stations, but there was broad overlap in delta D values. Although isotope ratios indicate that migrants at each station come from a wide range of latitudes, they are unable to provide much longitudinal discrimination. Band recoveries are sparse, but indicate that in general western Canadian warblers move southeast in fall, eastern birds move southwest, and there is a transition zone in the Great Lakes region. Combining knowledge of migratory direction with isotope results increases discrimination of breeding areas. Isotope results support fall migratory movements by Blackpoll Warbler (Dendroica striata) and Northern Waterthrush (Seiurus novaboracensis) that are more easterly than for other species, and in all study species, birds from more northern regions passed through southern Canada later in the season. Migration monitoring stations capture birds from broad areas of latitude, and migrants passing through each province appear to come from largely different portions of the Canadian breeding range, so a few stations placed in each province should suffice collectively to sample birds from most of the boreal forest. Migration monitoring in southern Canada, therefore, has the potential to monitor status of boreal forest birds in Canada that are unsampled by other monitoring programs.					; Hobson, Keith/Q-9306-2019; Wassenaar, Leonard/B-5996-2013	Wassenaar, Leonard/0000-0001-5532-0771; 													1712-6568					JUN	2006	1	2							4															WOS:000208195200004

SPATIAL STRUCTURE AND DYNAMICS OF THE SEASONAL MIGRATION OF PASSERINES (PASSERIFORMES, AVES) ON THE PUTORANA PLATEAU, SIBERIA	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL												The ecological structure and dynamics of the seasonal migrations of passerines of the Putorana Plateau, Siberia are analyzed. The route counting method on transects of unlimited width is used. On the Putorana Plateau as a junction of migration routes birds fly along the coastal-edge strip along rivers or lakes in the northern, western or eastern directions in spring, and in the southern, southwestern, western directions in autumn. Spring migration takes place from May 22 to June 20, lasting 8-17 days and restricted to 9-12 days for most species. In the south of Putorana, spring migration lasts shorter than in the north of the region. Autumn migration takes place from late July to late August, lasting 14-31 days and restricted to 20-26 days for most species. During the entire migration, a more fleeting period of the main migration is expressed, when 70-80% individuals fly. The bird population density in spring amounts to 231 individuals/km(2), vs 440 in autumn. The population density reaches the maximum in the south of Putorana, the minimum in the north. Significant amplitudes of daily abundance indices of species and asynchrony between phenological phenomena in different species and in individuals of the same species are characteristic. The course of migration is wave-like, with 1-4 bursts of migration activity per season. The intensity of migration is higher on days with the lowest air temperature. In autumn, synchronization of the waves of maximum flight does not occur in related species. In spring, the dynamics of flight in related species vary in different years, ranging from complete synchronization of the waves of maximum flight to their absolute discrepancy.																			0044-5134					JUL	2025	104	7					68	84		10.31857/S0044513425070075	http://dx.doi.org/10.31857/S0044513425070075													WOS:001546358800001

To prevent the potential impact caused by road runoff involving de-icing salts (NaCl) and trace metals (Cd and Pb) on the watershed, a full-scale treatment chain system (including a detention basin, a filtering bed, and a constructed wetland) was built. Average Cl and Na concentrations in groundwater were higher in wells affected by road network (125 mg/L Cl and 64 mg/L Na) than in control wells (13 mg/L Cl and 33 mg/L Na) suggesting a contamination by de-icing salts. The monitoring of influent and effluent surface water in the treatment system has shown a seasonal dependence in NaCl concentrations and electrical conductivity values, being the highest in summer, linked with the lower precipitation and higher temperature. Concentration ranges were as follows: 114-846 mg/L Na and 158-1757 mg/L Cl (summer) >61-559 mg/L Na and 63-799 mg/L Cl (spring and autumn). The treatment system removal efficiency was significant, however with seasonal variations: 16%-20% Cl, 3%-25% Na, 7%-10% Cd and 7%-36% Pb. The treatment system has shown an interesting potential to mitigate the impact of anthropogenic salinity at watershed scale with higher expected performances in the subsequent years of operation.					; de Santiago Marti--n, Ana/K-3308-2016; de Santiago Martí­n, Ana/K-3308-2016	Galvez, Rosa/0000-0001-7357-1582; de Santiago Marti--n, Ana/0000-0002-4723-9364; 													2073-4441					JUL	2016	8	7							285	10.3390/w8070285	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w8070285													WOS:000380764800018

In 2020, in the Central Polish Coastal Waters (PLB990002), which is a special area for the protection of birds, tests were carried out on the concentrations of chlorophyll, phosphates, dissolved microelements: zinc, cobalt, nickel and iron, and electrolytic conductivity. For the analysis of dissolved microelements, a graphite cuvette version of atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS-GF) was used. Chlorophyll and phosphates were studied using UV-VIS spectrophotometer. The concentrations obtained in coastal sea water in the spring after the wintering of waterfowl and in the autumn were compared. Microelement and phosphate concentrations were higher in spring than in autumn. The relationship between the level of chlorophyll and phosphates and the tested microelements in coastal waters was demonstrated, and the results were linked to the possible sources of these chemical substances, such as wintering of birds, tourism, municipal and port management. It was also observed that the upwelling effects occurred in the study area, which significantly influenced changes in the chemical composition of sea water.																			1842-4090	1844-489X				FEB	2024	19	1					147	155		10.26471/cjees/2024/019/286	http://dx.doi.org/10.26471/cjees/2024/019/286													WOS:001165279800001

Counts of waterbirds at Western Springs Lake, Auckland, New Zealand	NOTORNIS												Waterbirds were counted over similar to 12 ha of Western Springs Lakeside Park, Auckland, twice-monthly from November 2012 to October 2014. On average there were 742 water-birds per count (s.d. = 151.7, range = 511-1081), equating to a mean density of about 62 birds/ha within the study area. The 3 commonest species (mallard, Anas platyrhynchos, black-backed gull, Larus dominicanus and feral goose, Anser anser) made up 63% of all waterbirds counted. Mallard (and all waterbirds combined) were most abundant in summer and autumn. Black-backed gull, Eurasian coot (Fulica atra) and New Zealand scaup (Aythya novaeseelandiae) were seasonally uniform in numbers but red-billed gull (Larus novaehollandiae) were virtually absent from September to December. Spring was the peak season for numbers of black swan (Cygnus atratus), but the seasonal minimum for feral geese. Incidental historical counts trace temporal changes at Western Springs Lake, with a rapid increase of coots in the 1980s and of scaup in the 1990s. Royal spoonbill (Platalea regia) arrived more recently. The counts quantify for the first time the importance of the lake as a habitat for common waterbirds on the Auckland isthmus.					; Gill, Brian/I-9553-2019	Gill, Brian/0000-0003-4026-2905; 													0029-4470	1177-7680					2016	63	3-4					142	151																WOS:000418955600003

We used high-frequency water temperature data (2007-2021) from nine sub-alpine (>600 m ASL) lakes in the Northeastern US to investigate the drivers and coherence of ecologically important autumn processes. The end of summer stratification was highly variable across lakes and mediated by DOC and lake depth. The timing of end of stratification affected the onset of continuous autumn mixing; however, mixing was decoupled from ice-on. Ice-on was highly coherent and driven by air temperature. Extreme weather events with high winds, heavy precipitation, and anomalous air temperatures drove early onset of mixing, re-stratification events, and freeze-melt events. The variability of thermal structure during autumn demonstrates that climate change will not uniformly shift the start and end of autumn season later in the year.

Freshwater fish functional and taxonomic diversity above and below Niagara Falls	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												The Niagara River, which connects two Great Lakes (Erie and Ontario) and forms a border between Canada and the United States, has experienced decades of abiotic and biotic disturbance as well as long-term restoration efforts. Given the iconic riverscape and importance as a binational fisheries resource, a biodiversity assessment of the mainstem Niagara River fish assemblage is overdue. Here, fish assemblage and habitat data from a standardized boat electrofishing program of the Niagara River were combined with species trait data related to substrate associations, diet preferences, reproductive strategies, and body size to quantify biodiversity patterns among river sections (sites above and below Niagara Falls), seasons (spring, summer, fall), and years (2015-2017). Sixty-five species were captured representing a variety of trait combinations. Significant differences in functional dispersion and divergence (i.e., functional diversity) were observed between river sections, seasons, and (or) years. The fish community captured in the lower river in spring 2015 had both the highest average functional dispersion (2.08 +/- 0.32 SD) and divergence (0.88 +/- 0.04 SD) compared to the other seasonal sampling efforts, but relatively few fishes were captured (n = 686). Although non-native fishes represented a small portion of the catch over the 3 years (8.6% of catch), the seasonal presence (spring and fall) of mostly introduced large-bodied salmonids expanded functional trait space in the lower river during these periods. The importance of rare species on functional diversity metrics suggests further insight on local species detection probabilities is needed to understand if differences in functional diversity reflect ecological patterns or are driven by sampling design.

Newly emerged charr, .apprx. 20 mm long, appared in the stony shallow water zone during both May and June. From length variation and variation in mouth position of the young charr, it is concluded that at least two of the four charr morphs in the lake are present in the surf zone during spring and summer. In August, some of the larger age-0 charr had moved out from the surf zone, into the pelagic and the deeper epibenthic waters.

This study compiled a series of data, including phytoplankton, seawater depth and chemistry from 104 sites, to explore the spatial patterns and their drivers of phytoplankton communities in the Beibu Gulf and adjacent waters, located in the northwestern South China Sea. Our results showed that (1) the beta diversity values ranged from 0.2 to 0.84 (0.5 average), and turnover dominated. (2) The relative contributions of environmental heterogeneity and dispersal limitation to beta diversity varied seasonally, wherein former dominated in summer and winter, latter dominated in spring and autumn. (3) Hydrologic distance, pH, alkalinity, and total nitrogen were the crucial factors shaping the beta diversity pattern. This study detailed the temporal variation of the relative roles of environmental heterogeneity and dispersal limitation in shaping the patterns of phytoplankton communities, which may reflect the dynamical nature of ocean, characterized by seasonal variation in wind and hydrology. It also clarified the intrinsic linkage between these two processes in the ocean, which provides a novel insight to understanding the ocean biogeography and informs decision making for area-based marine biodiversity conservation.

Recent winter field surveys to estimate the species' population size were almost totally conducted in coastal areas, but tracking studies showed that some individuals now winter inland. To ensure its long-term survival, we need a more comprehensive assessment of the current distribution and abundance of the species. Methods We combined the most recent count data and satellite tracking information to update existing information about the population abundance and distribution of the Black-faced Spoonbill at all stages of its annual life cycle, and how these have changed during 2004-2020. Results Black-faced Spoonbills mainly breed on the west coast of the Korean peninsula, while immature birds show a wider summer distribution throughout Yellow Sea coastal areas, when a few remain on wintering sites in the south. Combined tracking results and mid-winter counts confirmed known wintering sites on the east and south coasts of China, but showed that the species also winters on wetlands in the Yangtze River floodplain and in Southeast Asia. During 2004-2020, counts of wintering birds in coastal habitats increased from 1198 to 4864, with numbers wintering on the island of Taiwan contributing most to the overall increase. Latest counts found 5222 in 2021. We also identify key wintering and stopover sites as well as their current conservation status. Conclusions This study revised the known summering and wintering ranges of the Black-faced Spoonbill and assessed the conservation status of key sites based on a combination of field survey and satellite tracking data. We recommend prioritisation of further field research to identify and survey inland wintering areas in the Yangtze River floodplain and summering areas of immature birds. More tracking of adult individuals and birds during spring migration is necessary to fill these information gaps. We also suggest establishing a Black-faced Spoonbill monitoring platform to store, share and show real-time distribution range and population abundance data.					; CHEN, YIWEN/HGT-8841-2022	Cao, Lei/0000-0002-1157-0303; 													2053-7166					DEC 17	2021	12	1							74	10.1186/s40657-021-00307-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40657-021-00307-z													WOS:000731286900001

Agricultural activities have a great impact on surface water and groundwater. If the impact of agricultural activities on hydrochemistry is not prevented, the risk of water quality change in arid areas may be greatly intensified. Based on the hydrochemical data of the whole Shiyang River Basin from April 2014 to October 2019, this paper analyzes the impact of agricultural activities on hydrochemistry in the basin. The results show that (i) in the middle and lower reaches of farmland with high intensity of agricultural activities, the ion concentration of groundwater in summer and autumn is significantly higher than that in winter and spring due to the influence of irrigation; (ii) the runoff ion concentration in the backflow of the river reaches recharged by irrigation water is significantly higher than that of other reaches; (iii) due to strong evaporation, different types of reservoirs will lead to an overall increase in ion concentration, which is more obvious in plain reservoirs and river tail lakes. In addition, the reservoirs have a certain removal effect on nitrates.

Prior to the expansion of a temperate upland reservoir in Australia, we used radio telemetry to compare seasonal differences in the diel movements of adult endangered Macquarie perch (Macquaria australasica) (235414 mm total length) in Cotter Reservoir, Australian Capital Territory. Macquarie perch exhibited a diel range of 389 +/- 46 m, a diel mobility of 769 +/- 93 m and diel area use of 24008 +/- 5595 m2 among four seasons. Diel range was significantly higher in winter compared with other seasons, and diel mobility was negatively correlated with fish size among four seasons. Macquarie perch inhabited deeper water in summer across the diel cycle (7.2 +/- 0.5 m) in comparison with other seasons (spring: 3.8 +/- 0.3 m, autumn: 3.0 +/- 0.2 m, winter: 3.0 +/- 0.3 m). Within seasons, both remote and manual telemetry identified that diel activity was predominantly crepuscular. Prey availability and the threat of avian predation represent the most likely explanations for the differences in seasonal movements. In a reservoir where expansion will likely result in a loss of critical habitat (emergent macrophytes) for this endangered species, we use site-specific knowledge of the spatial ecology of Macquarie perch to inform the placement of shelter habitat prior to filling the enlarged reservoir.

Nitrate, ammonium, and phosphorus drive seasonal nutrient limitation of chlorophytes, cyanobacteria, and diatoms in a hyper-eutrophic reservoir	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) inputs influence algal community structure and function. The rates and ratios of N and P supply, and different N forms (e.g., NO3 and NH4), from external loading and internal cycling can be highly seasonal. However, the interaction between seasonality in nutrient supply and algal nutrient limitation remains poorly understood. We examined seasonal variation in nutrient limitation and response to N form in a hyper-eutrophic reservoir that experiences elevated, but seasonal, nutrient inputs and ratios. External N and P loading is high in spring and declines in summer, when internal loading because more important, reducing loading N:P ratios. Watershed NO3 dominates spring N supply, but internal NH4 supply becomes important during summer. We quantified how phytoplankton groups (diatoms, chlorophytes, and cyanobacteria) are limited by N or P, and their N form preference (NH4 vs. NO3), with weekly experiments (May-October). Phytoplankton were P-limited in spring, transitioned to N limitation or colimitation (primary N) in summer, and returned to P limitation following fall turnover. Under N limitation (or colimitation), chlorophytes and cyanobacteria were more strongly stimulated by NH4 whereas diatoms were often equally, or more strongly, stimulated by NO3 addition. Cyanobacteria heterocyte development followed the onset of N-limiting conditions, with a several week lag time, but heterocyte production did not fully alleviate N-limitation. We show that phytoplankton groups vary seasonally in limiting nutrient and N form preference, suggesting that dual nutrient management strategies incorporating both N and P, and N form are needed to manage eutrophication.					; Jimenez Gonzalez, Maria/JXN-1084-2024	Vanni, Michael/0000-0001-8690-9124; Andersen, Isabelle/0000-0002-8674-6238													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAY	2020	65	5					962	978		10.1002/lno.11363	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11363		OCT 2019											WOS:000492486800001

This monitoring site was set up by the Global Mercury Observation System (GMOS project) and is located inside Nahuel Huapi National Park (41 degrees 07'43.33 '' S, 71 degrees 25'12.03 '' W; 800 m a.s.l) in a forested valley of the Andes upwind of San Carlos de Bariloche city. This study aimed at describing atmospheric Hg levels and trends of variation using concentration data of Gaseous Elemental Mercury (GEM) collected from October 2012 to July 2017 and, Gaseous Oxidized Mercury (GOM) and Particle-Bound Mercury (PBM) recorded from March 2014 until July 2017. During the studied period the mean GEM concentration was 0.86 +/- 0.16 ng m(-3); with the highest level in the austral spring (0.95 +/- 0.13 ng m(-3)) and the lowest in the autumn (0.80 +/- 0.15 ng m(-3)). Mean GOM concentration was 4.61 +/- 4.00 pg m(-3), displaying the highest level in autumn (5.47 +/- 4.39 pg m(-3)) and the lowest in winter (1.24 +/- 0.90 pg m(-3)). Mean PBM computed for the whole period was 3.74 +/- 3.41 pg m(-3); with the highest mean levels recorded in autumn (6.32 +/- 3.41 pg m(-3)) and the lowest in spring (1.18 +/- 0.92 pg m(-3)). Daytime levels of GEM, GOM and PBM were higher than nighttime concentrations, although in the case GOM and PBM similar levels were computed in autumn and summer, respectively. Westerly winds along with temperature and relative humidity influenced the dynamics of GEM, GOM and PBM at the EMMA Station. The HYSPLIT model showed that the area of the EMMA station was simultaneously affected by local and regional sources (forest fires and volcanoes) while the lowest values were recorded with the inflow of clean oceanic air masses coming from the free troposphere and corresponding to a long-range transport. Moreover, the Potential Source Contribution Function analysis showed that emissions in the Marine Boundary Layer, deriving from remote areas of Pacific Ocean, are sources of GEM and GOM.

J	Yang, XY; Zeng, G; Zhang, GW; Li, C				Yang, Xiaoye; Zeng, Gang; Zhang, Guwei; Li, Chun			Linkage between interannual variation of winter cold surge over East Asia and autumn sea ice over the Barents Sea	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												This paper discusses the interannual variation of winter cold surges (CSs) over East Asia (EA) from the perspective of the cold air path and its relationship with autumn Barents Sea ice concentration (BSIC). Flexible particle dispersion model for large-scale atmospheric transport process simulation is used to track the cold air path of 301 CSs in EA in winters from 1979 to 2017, and the probability density distribution of cold air path is calculated by kernel density estimation. The cold air mainly originates from the Ural Mountains, and is continuously cooled by the impact of cold land, then accumulates and strengthens near the Lake Baikal, and finally invades EA under the guidance of the northwest airflow. The autumn BSIC has a significant negative correlation with CSs over EA. The decreased autumn BSIC hinders the spread of zonal warm advection over Eurasia and makes the soil temperature near Lake Baikal drop, and the negative anomaly of soil temperature persists from autumn to winter, strengthening cold source therein, which provides suitable thermal conditions for occurring more CSs over EA. Moreover, the decreased autumn BSIC can also persist to winter, which leads to the positive anomaly of the geopotential height over the polar region. Through the propagation of Rossby wave, the negative geopotential height anomaly over EA is excited and provides the appropriate dynamic conditions for forming more CSs in EA. The simulations from the Community Atmosphere Model version 5.3 (CAM5.3) further confirm the proposed possible mechanism.					; Zeng, Gang/IWM-2172-2023; Yang, Xiaoye/KAM-5012-2024; Zhang, Guwei/CAI-0239-2022	zhang, guwei/0000-0001-8272-3007; 													0177-798X	1434-4483				APR	2021	144	1-2					339	351		10.1007/s00704-021-03545-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-021-03545-9		FEB 2021											WOS:000615554400002

Different microbial functioning in natural versus man-made Mediterranean coastal lagoons in relation to season	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Coastal marsh lagoons are of high ecological relevance playing a key role in the carbon cycle but are threatened to disappear due to global change effects. Restoration practices can counteract this process. This study compares the microbial heterotrophic functioning in three "new" man-made lagoons (created in 2016) to that in three "old" lagoons (two natural plus one created in 2002) from a Mediterranean coastal marsh. The activity of a range of microbial extracellular enzymes, the functional diversity, and the dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality, together with microbial biomass and water physic-chemistry were analysed seasonally in the water column of the six lagoons during 2017. Seasonality was a key driver for the lagoons microbial functioning mainly characterized by lowest microbial activities in winter when DOM was highly aromatic after storm events and an increase in organic matter degradation capabilities from winter to summer probably due to a rise in temperature and DOM input from primary production. Significant differences among lagoons appeared when they were less connected (summer and autumn), and old lagoons showed a greater utilization of proteinaceous and polysaccharidic compounds than new lagoons probably linked to their greater algal biomass (chlorophyll content), which may be supported by their larger phosphorus content. In autumn, there was also a greater use of allochthonous plant material in the old lagoons (higher XYL, and XYL/GLU ratio) probably related to their greater development of riparian vegetation. The functional diversity was the lowest in autumn when the lagoons showed distinct functional fingerprints and the lagoon created in 2002 was grouped with the new ones and distinguished from the natural ones, suggesting that it did not achieve complete restoration. Results indicate that microbial functional parameters related to organic matter use are a relevant and sensitive tool to study lagoon restoration processes, reflecting whole ecosystem nutrient and carbon cycling.

J	Zhang, YH; Yang, N; Xu, JW; Yin, YX				Zhang, Yehui; Yang, Na; Xu, Jiawei; Yin, Yixing			Long-Term Study of the Relationship between Precipitation and Aquatic Vegetation Succession in East Taihu Lake, China	SCIENTIFICA												Based on long-term rainfall measurements (1956-2012), water level records (1956-2006), and aquatic plants field survey data (19602014), the relationship between precipitation and aquatic vegetation succession in east Taihu Lake, China, is studied. Neither abrupt changes nor any trends were found in the annual rainfall series in Taihu Lake during the studied period (1956-2012). However, for seasonal variations, statistically significant decreases are found in spring and autumn, while the rainfall in winter exhibits statistically significant increase. No significant trend was obtained in summer. A "dry" period was detected in our studied period (1963/1964 similar to 1978/1979). Total annual rainfall was significantly positively correlated to the number of rain-days (r = 0.59) and the water level (r = 0.84). Our results indicate that the variations of rainfall and water level may have an impact on the aquatic plants in Taihu Lake. The dry period may be not suitable for the growth of the aquatic plants. All aquatic plants in Taihu Lake were dramatically reduced in the dry period, especially for submerged macrophytes and floating-leaf macrophytes. Our results may be helpful for the aquatic restoration in the future.					; xu, jiawei/JCD-7577-2023	Zhang, Yehui/0000-0002-1448-0119; 													2090-908X						2017	2017								6345138	10.1155/2017/6345138	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2017/6345138								28261516					WOS:000394969000001
J	Vyshnevskyi, VI				Vyshnevskyi, Viktor Ivanovych			Temperature and ice regimes of waterbodies under the impacts of global warming and a hydropower plant	METEOROLOGY HYDROLOGY AND WATER MANAGEMENT-RESEARCH AND OPERATIONAL APPLICATIONS												Based on the results of regular monitoring and remote sensing data the patterns of water temperature and ice regime of the Dnipro River within Kyiv, as affected by global warming and a hydropower plant, were identified. The characteristic features of this stretch of the river are increasing water temperature, and the decreasing thickness and duration of ice cover. The largest water temperature increase is in summer, with a somewhat smaller increase in autumn. The increase of water temperature in spring is much less than the increase in air temperature. In summer, the gradient of water temperature increase is a little bit less than that of air temperature. In autumn, the gradient of water temperature increase is larger than the gradient of air temperature increase. From April to August the lowest water temperature is usually observed near the Kyivska hydropower plant (HPP), which is located upstream. During this period the water temperature downstream from HPP increases. The uneven daily operation of HPP causes the alternation of areas with different temperature along the Dnipro River. In the cold season the water temperature in the Dnipro River is usually higher than in other nearby urban water bodies. Freezing of the water area usually starts from the small and shallow lakes and ponds. The main branch of the Dnipro River freezes last. On the whole, the sequence of ice melting on the waterbodies is the reverse of the freezing process. The longest ice cover duration in spring is observed in the bays with small water exchange, mainly located at a large distance from Kyivska HPP.

Of the 54 taxa of benthic macroinvertebrates collected, 27 were Chironomidae. Chironomids and oligochaetes numerically dominated the benthos, comprising 82% of the individuals collected. The greatest numbers of taxa and individuals were found during the winter when hydrilla biomass was low. Hydrilla biomass ranged from 0.382 kg/m2-FW [fresh weight] in April, 1977 to 2.275 kg/m2-FW in Oct., 1977. Low numbers of macroinvertebrate taxa and individuals were collected from bottom sediments during summer and fall. Dissolved O2 concentrations at the bottom were approximately 2.0 ppm during summer and fall and possibly limited benthic organisms. The annual means for the Shannon and Simpson indices for the benthos were 1.92 and 0.35, respectively.																			0270-5060	2156-6941					1981	1	1					41	49		10.1080/02705060.1981.9664015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1981.9664015													WOS:A1981MQ04900004

The US EPA Lake Erie indicators monitoring program 1983-2002:: Trends in phosphorus, silica, and chlorophyll a in the central basin	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												During the past 20 years, Lake Erie has exhibited a series of complex chemical changes resulting from changing anthropogenic influences and introductions of exotic species. Since 1990, some apparent trends in nutrient concentrations have been inconsistent with the predictions of models originally used to guide Lake Erie water quality management. We performed time trend analysis on total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll a (Chl a), and dissolved reactive silica (DRS) measurements collected during spring and summer in the central basin of Lake Erie between 1983 and 2002. Three distinct time trends in basin-specific, station-averaged open-water TP concentrations were observed over the 20-year period: 1983-1989 decreases, 1990-1997 increases, and 1997-2001 decreases. Exceptionally high levels of turbidity and TP were observed in spring 2002, possibly reflecting increasing frequency of winter storm events. Open-water concentrations of TP declined during the 1980s as annual TP loadings to Lake Erie declined below the 11,000 metric ton target level that had been expected to reduce central basin eutrophication. This was accompanied by a significant increase in available silica and in Chl a concentrations. During the period 1990-2002, when dreissenid mussels were abundant, spring TP concentrations increased but summer TP concentrations declined. Unexpected increases in spring central basin concentrations of DRS (exceeding 1 mg/L) were observed. During the same period, Chl a concentrations declined in the spring and rose slightly during summer.																			0380-1330						2005	31			2			23	34		10.1016/S0380-1330(05)70302-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(05)70302-6													WOS:000238618700003

Twenty seven different fatty acids were determined in the composition of Vimba vimba tenella. Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) were found to be in higher amounts than saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in all seasons. Oleic acid (C18:1 n9) was the major MUFA in all seasons. Palmitic acid (C16:0) was identified as the major SFA in all four seasons. Arachidonic acid (C20:4 n6), docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6 n3). linoleic acid (C18:2 n6), and eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5 n3) were at the highest levels among the PUFAs. In the present study, n-3/n-6 ratios were found to be 1.4,1.5,1.2 and 1.4 in spring, summer, autumn and winter, respectively. Vimba vimba tenella may be a valuable food for human consumption in terms of fatty acids. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This study evaluated three water supply reservoirs with bottom-release (hypolimnion) outlet structures in Arizona. MIB concentrations were always higher than geosmin concentrations, but both followed similar seasonal trends. MIB concentrations increased from spring to late summer, and stratified vertically with depth in the water column; the highest concentrations were always in the upper 110 to of the water column. Thermal destratification in the autumn increased MIB concentrations released from the outlet of reservoirs and impacted downstream utilities for several months. By winter of each year MIB concentrations were non-detectable. Mass balance analyses on MIB indicated that in-reservoir reactions were more important in changing MIB concentrations than conservative hydraulic "flushing" of the reservoir. Maximum net loss rates for MIB in the field (R-F,R-max) were on the order of 0.23-1.7 ng/L-day, and biodegradation appeared more important than volatilization, photolysis or adsorption. Using lake water in laboratory experiments, bacterial biodegradation rates (R-L) ranged from 0.5-1 ng/L-day and were comparable to R-F,R-max values. Based upon these rates, MIB concentrations in a reservoir would decrease by approximately 30 ng/L over a period of 1 month. This was the magnitude change in MIB concentrations commonly observed after autumn thermal destratification of the reservoirs. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The spatial patterns of delta N-15 corresponded to the urbanization level, and the nitrogen cycle was associated with the hydrological regime at the basin level. During the high flow season of summer, nonpoint sources from fertilizer/soils and atmospheric deposition constituted the highest proportion of the total nitrogen load. The point sources from sewage/manure, with high ammonium concentrations and high delta N-15 and delta O-18 contents in the form of nitrate, accounted for the largest inputs among all sources during the low flow season of winter. Hot spot areas with heavy point source pollution were identified, and the pollutant transport routes were revealed. Nitrification widely during the warm seasons, with decreased delta O-18 values; whereas great potential for denitrification existed during the low flow seasons of autumn and spring. The study showed that point source reduction could have effects over the short-term; however, long-term efforts to substantially control agriculture nonpoint sources are essential to eutrophication alleviation for the receiving lake, which clarifies the relationship between point and nonpoint source control.					wenqing, shi/JCO-4345-2023														0013-936X	1520-5851				MAY 16	2017	51	10					5396	5403		10.1021/acs.est.6b06278	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.6b06278								28425288					WOS:000401674400007

This research analyzed the winter wheat growth dynamics of experimental plots at the Lakehead University Agricultural Research Station, Thunder Bay, Canada using high spatial and temporal resolution remote sensing images. The spectral signatures for five growing stages were prepared. NIR reflectance increased during the growing stages and decreased at the senescence, indicating healthy vegetation. The space-time cube provided valuable insight into how canopy height changed over time. The effect of nitrogen treatments on wheat did not directly influence the plant count (spring/autumn), and height and volume at maturity. However, the green and dry weights were different at several treatments. Winter wheat yield was predicted using the XGBoost algorithm, and moderate results were obtained. The study explored different techniques for analyzing winter wheat growth dynamics and identified their usefulness in smart agriculture.

High-resolution distributed temperature sensing to detect seasonal groundwater discharge into Lake Vaeng, Denmark	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Distributed temperature sensing (DTS) was used to map spatial and temporal changes in temperature on a 25 m by 6 m lakebed area in the winter (February), spring (May), and summer (August) of 2012. A constant and high discharge of groundwater with the average temperature of around 8 degrees C to the lake will result in either lower (summer) or higher (winter) daily temperatures and reduce temperature variability at the sediment-water interface (SWI). DTS data were used as a proxy for groundwater discharge using three metrics; daily minimum temperature, diel amplitude, and daily standard deviation of temperature. During the seasons, the daily minimum temperatures at the SWI indicate a discharge zone 4-6 m offshore. From winter to summer, the extent of this zone changes and the SWI temperatures also show a shift of discharge locations toward the shore. Fluxes estimated on the basis of vertical temperature profiles from the top 50 cm of the lakebed and seepage meters in August compare well with the locations of the high-discharge zones detected by the DTS in the same period, giving confidence in the ability of the method to map both the areas and spatial variability of groundwater discharge to lakes. Compared to February, the DTS was able to detect new relatively cold temperature zones at the SWI in May and August indicating that groundwater discharge to the lake changes over time and that DTS can be used to monitor temporal variability in areas of discharge.

J	COPE, WG; RADA, RG				COPE, WG; RADA, RG			ACCUMULATION OF MERCURY BY AUFWUCHS IN WISCONSIN SEEPAGE LAKES - IMPLICATIONS FOR MONITORING	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												We examined temporal variation in the total Hg content of aufwuchs collected from artificial substrates in 11 seepage lakes in north-central Wisconsin and its relation to the Hg content of resident yellow perch Perca flavescens from the lakes. Dry weight concentrations of Hg in aufwuchs varied temporally, as follows: summer/fall 1985 > summer 1985 > spring/summer 1986. Areal concentrations of Hg during the 1985 sampling periods were greater than concentrations during the spring/summer 1986 period, but did not differ from each other. Although chlorophyll a accrual was correlated with the areal concentration of Hg in aufwuchs during each period of study, partial correlation coefficients between Hg in aufwuchs and the chlorophyll a, organic (ash-free dry weight), and inorganic (non ash-free dry weight) content of aufwuchs during spring 1986 were not significant. Thus, we were unable to quantify the partitioning of Hg among the organic (photosynthetic, heterotrophic, and detrital) and inorganic components of the aufwuchs. Concentrations of Hg in aufwuchs were not correlated with lake pH during any of the three periods, even though the Hg content of fish in these and other lakes in the region are strongly correlated with pH. Moreover, the only significant correlation between Hg in aufwuchs and Hg in age-2 yellow perch from the lakes were weak negative correlations for areal Hg concentrations in aufwuchs during summer 1985.

China precipitation is characterized by large seasonality, with a maximum in summer and a minimum in winter. The seasonality of precipitation shows an increasing linear tendency in northwest China, with a change of about 20% from 1901 to 1998. A relatively weaker increasing tendency also appears in the Big Bend of Yellow River (BBYR) and the Tibetan Plateau, while southwest China experiences a decreasing tendency. Furthermore, the seasonality in the BBYR shows particularly significant interdecadal variability, while that of southern and eastern China has decreased slightly in the recent decades. Compared to China, the United States as a whole has less precipitation in summer but more precipitation in other seasons. Here, the seasonality of precipitation is only about 24% of that in China. The annual mean precipitation is 64.1 mm per month in the United States, compared to 54.6 mm per month in China. The seasonality of precipitation exhibits a decreasing tendency in the southeast, Pacific Northwest, and Gulf Coast and an increasing tendency in the Great Lakes. The seasonality in the Great Plains exhibits large interdecadal variability. The long-term variations of precipitation are highly seasonally dependent. In summer, a decreasing trend is observed in north China and an increasing trend is found in eastern-central China. However, these trends are almost opposite in spring. In addition, the fall precipitation decreases with time nearly everywhere in China except for the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Valley. The long-term variations of precipitation are highly seasonally dependent. In summer, a decreasing trend is observed in north China and an increasing trend is found in eastern-central China. However, these trends are almost opposite in spring. In addition, the fall precipitation decreases with time nearly everywhere in China except for the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Valley. Results also indicate that the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Arctic Oscillation (AO), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and the North Pacific (NP) fluctuation affect strongly the variations of China and US precipitation. Although these influences vary with regions and seasons, we in particular emphasize the importance of AO and NAO for China precipitation and NP and PDO for US precipitation. In fall, ENSO and PDO are the two phenomena that influence predominantly precipitation variability in both China and the United States We also identify the common phenomena that influence China and US regional precipitation and provide a better understanding of the physical mechanism for precipitation variability through the associated changes in atmospheric and oceanic conditions. Furthermore, we develop a linear regression model, based on multiple regression method by combining the regionally and seasonally varying impacts, to increase the skill of precipitation prediction.

Water samples were collected from 10 sampling points located along the median line of the lake at different depths (at surface, at 5 m, 10 m, 15 m and 20 m). The experiments were carried out in the winter, spring, summer and autumn of 2015. We determined the concentration - depth profiles, both for the heavy metals iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb) and also for sodium (Na), potassium (K), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg). We determined the concentrations of heavy metals by atomic absorption spectrometry. We found that concentrations of heavy metals increase with depth. Generally, the concentrations of heavy metals are within the legal limits for the water used as drinking water sources. Mathematical models with high correlation coefficients were obtained in the case of heavy metal concentrations depending on depth and also for the seasonality of heavy metals upload.					; Mihali, Cristina/AFK-0922-2022; Dippong, Thomas/AAL-2913-2020; Goga, Firuta/ABB-8580-2020	Dippong, Thomas/0000-0002-4625-6525; Goga, Firuta/0000-0001-8367-7874; 													1224-7154						2017	62	1					213	228		10.24193/subbchem.2017.1.19	http://dx.doi.org/10.24193/subbchem.2017.1.19													WOS:000407976200019

Seasonal transformations of dissolved organic matter and organic phosphorus in a polymictic basin: Implications for redox-driven eutrophication	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Redox-driven internal phosphorus (P) loading from lake sediments is a key process for propagating and sustaining cyanobacterial blooms in freshwater lakes. Missisquoi Bay in Lake Champlain, VT regularly experiences cyanobacterial blooms driven by internal P loading as well as from seasonal transitions, but the response of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to these changing conditions has previously not been investigated in this system and seldom in other redox-dynamic freshwaters. In this study, Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) has been employed to explore the seasonal transformation and distribution of DOM, including organic P (DOP), from spring 2017 to winter 2018 along with high-frequency geochemical monitoring. DOM was largely composed of allochthonous compounds with unique molecules from seasonal autochthonous sources and greater proportions of N,S-containing formulae after the early summer bloom season and during the winter. DOM compositions from spring to late summer was more aliphatic during the early bloom season, while DOM between late summer to winter was more aromatic with greater similarities between the two seasons. In contrast, DOP compositions from all seasons were highly dissimilar and suggested a compartmentalized water column, where riverine DOP compounds that were degraded during transport and in surface waters were largely absent in the benthic DOP. Additional sediment core incubation experiments were implemented to study the effects of short-term oxygen limitation on DOM and DOP composition to better constrain potential redox-based drivers of their mobility between sediment and the water column. Short-term incubations suggested an increase in aliphatic DOM and new DOP compounds, with little change in aromatic DOM, suggesting selective mobilization driven by microbial iron(III) and manganese(IV) reduction. Together, these detailed FT-ICRMS data show, for the first time, how DOM and DOP from various sources respond to changing physical and geochemical conditions in redox-dynamic freshwaters, demonstrating how these compounds cycle in freshwater settings and likely impact nutrient bioavailability.

Meiofauna are integral components of Baiyangdian Lake; however, their community characteristics and relationship with environmental factors have not yet been studied. The aim of the following study was to evaluate the density, spatiotemporal patterns, and habitat response dynamics of meiofauna in Baiyangdian Lake. A field investigation was conducted at 33 sites spanning various habitats, including aquatic plant-dominant, trench, and pelagic areas, across the spring, summer, and autumn seasons of 2021. The results revealed that the meiofauna in Baiyangdian Lake primarily comprise freshwater nematodes (91.78%), ostracods, and copepods, with a mean abundance of 69.40 +/- 35.20 ind. 10 cm(-2), peaking in the spring, followed by summer and autumn. The mean biomass was 164.95 +/- 99.39 dwt. 10 cm(-2), with that of ostracods being the most substantial and that of copepods being the least, with both of them exhibiting seasonal fluctuations. Notably, in the summer, the abundance of meiofauna was positively correlated with the water depth and negatively correlated with ammonia nitrogen levels (R-2 = 0.13 and R-2 = 0.24, respectively; p < 0.05 and p < 0.01; n = 33). The results of our study indicate that the distribution and abundance of meiofauna are significantly affected by environmental factors, with the water depth and ammonia nitrogen levels being potential key determinants. The results of the present study are conducive to evaluating the health status of the Baiyangdian ecosystem, protecting biodiversity, and studying the impacts of anthropogenic activities and environmental changes on the lake, and can also provide scientific support for its ecological restoration and governance as well as the assessment of ecological service functions.

The formation of lake ice affects the physical, hydrological, and biological conditions of ecological systems. Global warming may contribute to even shorter periods of ice cover in the lakes of the Frigid Zone, which adversely affects the growth of phytoplankton and primary productivity. This study was conducted for the purpose of evaluating the growth of phytoplankton and factors involved, in 28 ice-covered lakes across the Songnen Plain, in the Northeast of China, to understand how they take part in the whole-ecosystem functioning. A total of 1026 water samples were collected in April, September, and January during the period 2014-2018. In the frozen period, the concentration levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) were all comparable with the spring and autumn. Despite the limited light availability and low temperature, the phytoplankton survived in sub-ice waters during winter with a low concentration of chlorophyll a (Chla). Its average concentration was positively correlated with the concentration observed in the previous autumn (r(p) = 0.563, p < 0.01). According to the regression tree analysis, during the winter period, Chla was mainly related to the concentration of TN in sub-ice water (TNwater) and with the difference of concentration of TP between water and ice (TPcd). Furthermore, either in ice or in sub-ice water, the concentration of Chla was also significantly affected by total suspended matter (TSM) (p < 0.05). The levels of TNwater, TPcd, and TSM could explain the 77.8% of the variance in the concentration of Chla during winter with contributions in the ranges of 25.5%-35.0%, 9.2%-11.3%, and 21.5%-34.0%, respectively (p < 0.05). This research substantially contributes to comprehending how the existing conditions under-ice affect the whole ecosystem when the ice cover is reduced lakes or rivers.

Undisturbed sediment cores taken in the summer, autumn and winter from the deep and shallow profundal and from the littoral were incubated in laboratory microcosms under aerobic and anaerobic water flow conditions. An increase in the availability of oxygen in water overlying the sediments reduced the release of CH4, NH4+ and P, increased the flux of N2O and NO2- + NO3-, but did not affect CO2 production. The littoral sediments produced CO2 and CH4 at high rates, but released only negligible amounts of nutrients. The deep profundal sediments, with highest carbon content, possessed the greatest release rates of CO2, CH4, NH4+ and P. The higher fluxes of these gases in summer and autumn than in winter were probably due to the supply of fresh organic matter from primary production. From the shallow profundal sediments fluxes of CH4, NH4+ and P were low, but, in contrast, production of N2O was the highest among the different sampling sites. Due to the large areal extension, the littoral and shallow profundal zones had the greatest importance in the overall gas and nutrient budgets in the lake. Methane emissions, especially the ebullition of CH4 (up to 84% of the total flux), were closely related to the sediment P and NH4+ release. The high production and ebullition of CH4, enhances the internal loading of nutrients, lake eutrophication status and the impact of boreal lakes to trophospheric gas budgets.

J	FROST, WE				FROST, WE			BREEDING HABITS OF WINDERMERE CHARR SALVELINUS WILLUGHBII (GUNTHER) AND THEIR BEARING ON SPECIATION OF THESE FISH	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY SERIES B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												In Windermere charr, Salvelinus willughbii, are either (1) autumn spawners, main breeding period November, most spawning on the lake shore, in shallow water, some in the main inflowing stream; or (2) spring spawners, main breeding period February-March, spawning in the lake only and in deep water. The comparison of these two is mainly based on the autumn spawners netted on the lake spawning grounds at Low Wray Bay and Red Nab, and on a river spawning ground in Brathay, At Purdom''s Dub, and on the spring spawners netted on the spawning ground at Holbeck Point. Information on their breeding habits was obtained by rearing fish in hatchery ponds and on their spawning behaviour by observation in the field and in aquaria. This paper, which deals with the breeding habits of the two types of spawners and the implications arising from them, is divided into two parts, with the Discussion in between. Part I describes the breeding habits of the autumn and spring spawners and shows how these separate the two types from each other. It is concerned with the question of whether these autumn and spring spawners so isolated represent distinct populations. (There is a note on the charr from other English Lake District waters. ) The Discussion comes at the end of Part L Part II gives further details of breeding habits of autumn and spring spawners and describes early stages in the life history of the charr. Aspects of the reproductive life of autumn and spring spawners are compared between themselves and also with other Salmonidae.																			0080-4649						1965	163	991					232	+		10.1098/rspb.1965.0070	http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.1965.0070								4378483					WOS:A19656920000007

Differential lipid dynamics in stocked and wild juvenile lake trout	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												After 45 years of stocking, lake trout in Lake Champlain have started to exhibit strong natural recruitment, suggesting a recent change in limiting factors such as prey availability or overwinter survival. The abundance of juvenile wild lake trout varies among regions of Lake Champlain which suggests the prey base, or foraging success, may vary geographically within the lake. One metric that can indicate differences in resources across regions is lake trout lipid content, which reflects the availability of food and serves as an important energy reserve for overwinter survival. We quantified total lipid content of stocked and wild age-0 to age-3 lake trout among lake regions and seasons. No spatial differences in lipid content were apparent, but wild fish had higher overall mean +/- SE percent total lipid content (17.0 +/- 0.7% of dry mass) than stocked fish (15.2 +/- 0.7%). Lipids in fish stocked in November were high (35.1 +/- 0.7% of dry mass) but dropped by spring (14.9 +/- 1.3%) and continued to decline through autumn. Wild fish showed seasonal changes with winter depletion in lipids followed by summer increase, and a plateau in autumn. The lipid depletion in stocked fish poses two competing hypotheses: 1) the high lipid concentration is necessary for stocked age-0 fish to transition to foraging in the wild, or 2) the high lipid concentration is difficult to maintain on a wild diet and reduces survival in the first post-stocking year.

The reservoir, which is stratified during spring-summer and autumn seasons but gets vertically mixed during the southwest monsoon (SWM) and winter, is characterized by diverse redox nitrogen transformations in space and time. The delta N-15 and delta O-18 values of nitrate were low (delta N-15 = 2-10 %, delta O-18 = 58 %) during normoxic conditions but increased gradually (the highest at delta N-15 = 27 %, delta O-18 = 29 %) when anoxic conditions facilitated denitrification in the hypolimnion during spring-early summer. Once nitrate was fully utilized and sulfidic conditions set in, NH4+ became the dominant inorganic N species, with delta N-15 ranging from 1.3 to 2.6 %. Low delta N-15 (similar to-5 %) and delta C-13 (37 to 32 %) of POM co-occurring with high NH4+ and CH4 in sulfidic bottom waters were probably the consequence of microbial chemosynthesis. Assimilation of nitrate in the epilimnion was the major controlling process on the N isotopic composition of POM (delta N-15 = 2-6 %). Episodic low delta N-15 values of POM (2 to 0 %) during early summer, coinciding with the absence of nitrate, might arise from N fixation, although further work is required to confirm the hypothesis. delta C-13 POM in the photic zone ranged between 29 and 27% for most parts of the year. The periods of mixing were characterized by uniform delta N-15-NO3- and delta O-18-NO3- at all depths. Higher POM (particulate organic carbon, POC, as well as particulate organic nitrogen, PON) contents and C/N values with lower delta C-13 POM during the SWM point to allochthonous inputs. Overall, this study, the first of its kind in the Indian subcontinent, provides an insight into biogeochemistry of Indian reservoirs, using stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes as a tool, where the monsoons play an important role in controlling vertical mixing and dynamics of carbon and nutrients.																			1726-4170	1726-4189				FEB 20	2017	14	4					767	779		10.5194/bg-14-767-2017	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-767-2017													WOS:000395174100002

Thirty-three zooplankton species belonging to four taxa have been described from the Wadi M'zi River; Copepoda, Rotifera, Cladocera and Nematoda. The following diversity indexes were used to measure the diversity of zooplankton species in the lake; Shannon Index 3.14 to 3.8, Pielou Evenness Index 0.72 to 0.84 and Margalef Index 1.08 to 1.45. The zooplankton communities were observed to be abundant in spring and summer compared to autumn and winter. Rotifers were found to be dominant followed by copepods, cladocerans and nematods for the entire research duration. CCA analysis indicates that WT, pH, NH4+, NO3-, PO42- and conductivity were responsible for most differences in zooplankton organisms.

From 1968-1971, 275 of the tagged fish were recovered. Walleyes tagged in the spring on spawning grounds near Barcelona, New York moved northeasterly along the shore soon after spawning and spent the summer near the Buffalo-Niagara River Inlet area. Later returns indicated that they then reversed their direction of travel in late summer and fall and followed the shoreline back toward the spawning grounds off Barcelona. Young fish tagged in the fall also showed this pattern the following year. Westward movement into the central basin was insignificant, and no recoveries were reported from Canadian waters. Walleye populations in the USA waters of eastern Lake Erie are geographically separate from those in the western basin, and their management should be based on this inference.																			0028-7210						1978	25	1					16	22																WOS:A1978EM25300002

Observed soil temperature trends associated with climate change in Canada	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Trends in soil temperature are important, but rarely reported, indicators of climate change. On the basis of the soil temperature data from 30 climate stations across Canada during 1958-2008, trends in soil temperatures at 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 150 cm depths were analyzed, together with atmospheric variables, such as air temperature, precipitation, and depth of snow on the ground, observed at the same locations. There was a significant positive trend with soil temperatures in spring and summer means, but not for the winter and annual means. A positive trend with time in soil temperature was detected at about two-thirds of the stations at all depths below 5 cm. A warming trend of 0.26-0.30 C/decade was consistently detected in spring (March-April-May) at all depths between 1958 and 2008. The warming trend in soil temperatures was associated with trends in air temperatures and snow cover depth over the same period. A significant decreasing trend in snow cover depth in winter and spring was associated with increasing air temperatures. The combined effects of the higher air temperature and reduced snow depth probably resulted in an enhanced increasing trend in spring soil temperatures, but no significant trends in winter soil temperatures. The thermal insulation by snow cover appeared to play an important role in the response of soil temperatures to climate change and must be accounted for in projecting future soil-related impacts of climate change.					; Gregorich, Edward/J-9785-2012; Qian, Budong/F-2345-2011	Qian, Budong/0000-0001-5413-3114; Hopkins, David/0000-0003-0953-8643; Gregorich, Edward/0000-0003-3652-2946													2169-897X	2169-8996				JAN 21	2011	116								D02106	10.1029/2010JD015012	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2010JD015012													WOS:000286519600007

Species-specific observed relationships are established between cumulative weather severity in autumn-winter and duck population rate of change. Dynamically downscaled projections of weather severity are developed using a highresolution regional climate model, interactively coupled to a one-dimensional lake model to represent the Great Lakes and associated lake-effect snowfall. Based on the observed relationships and downscaled climate projections of rising air temperatures and reduced snow cover, delayed autumn-winter migration is expected for all species, with the least delays for the Northern Pintail and the greatest delays for the Mallard. Indeed, the Mallard, the most common and widespread duck in North America, may overwinter in the Great Lakes region by the late 21 st century. This highlights the importance of protecting and restoring wetlands across the mid-latitudes of North America, including the Great Lakes Basin, because dabbling ducks are likely to spend more time there, which would impact existing wetlands through increased foraging pressure. Furthermore, inconsistency in the timing and intensity of the traditional autumn-winter migration of dabbling ducks in the Mississippi and Atlantic Flyways could have social and economic consequences to communities to the south, where hunting and birdwatching would be affected.

J	Lau, SSS; Lane, SN				Lau, SSS; Lane, SN			Biological and chemical factors influencing shallow lake eutrophication: a long-term study	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The focus of eutrophication research has tended to be upon short-term and experimental studies. However, given the range of factors that can influence eutrophication dynamics, and that these matter over a range of time scales, some discrete, some continuous, eutrophication dynamics may only be fully investigated when long-term, time-series data are available. The present study aims to evaluate the interacting effects of abiotic processes and biotic dynamics in explaining variations of phytoplankton biomass in a eutrophic shallow lake, Barton Broad (Norfolk, UK) using a long-term data set. Multivariate statistical analysis shows that the inter-relationships between phytoplankton variability, nutrient and grazing factors were highly sensitive to seasonal periodicity. In spring phytoplankton biomass was related to phosphorus, nitrogen and silicon. In summer phytoplankton biomass was associated with phosphorus, nitrogen and zooplankton. In autumn phytoplankton was related to phosphorus, nitrogen, silicon and zooplankton. In winter, no significant relationship could be established between phytoplankton and environmental variables. This paper improves our understanding of the governing role of nitrogen, phosphorus, silicon and zooplankton upon phytoplankton variability, and hence, improves management methods for eutrophic lakes.

This study investigates concurrent hydrological drought in the Poyang lake-catchment-river system from 1960 to 2013 based on copula functions. The standard water level index (SWI) and the standard runoff index (SRI) are employed to identify hydrological drought in the lake-catchment-river system. The appropriate marginal distributions and copulas are selected by the corrected Akaike Information Criterion and Bayesian copulas selection method. The probability of hydrological drought in Poyang Lake in any given year is 16.6% (return period of 6 years), and droughts occurred six times from 2003 to 2013. Additionally, the joint probability of concurrent drought events between the lake and catchment is 10.1% (return period of 9.9 years). Since 2003, concurrent drought has intensified in spring due to frequent hydrological drought in the catchment. The joint probability of concurrent drought between the lake and the Yangtze River is 11.5% (return period of 8.7 years). This simultaneous occurrence intensified in spring, summer and autumn from 2003 to 2013 due to the weakened blocking effect of the Yangtze River. Notably, although the lake drought intensified in winter during the past decade, hydrological drought in the catchment and the Yangtze River did not intensify simultaneously. Thus, this winter intensification might be caused by human activities in the lake region. The results of this study demonstrate that the Poyang lake-catchment-river system has been drying since 2003 based on a statistical approach. An adaptation strategy should be urgently established to mitigate the worsening situation in the Poyang lake-catchment-river system. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Seasonal variability of the Western Siberia wetlands from satellite radar altimetry	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Boreal wetlands play an important role in the global water and carbon cycle but their water regime is far from being well understood. The aim of this paper is to study wetland hydrological regime over the 21 mid-size watersheds of the Western Siberia - one of the most bogged regions of the world. By using ENVISAT RA-2 radar altimetry data we analyze seasonal variability of wet zones extent, water level and storage in wetlands. We have identified three main types of wetland water regime characterized by: (1) spring inundation and following deep drainage with/without secondary peak in autumn; (2) spring inundation and low summer variation; (3) spring inundation with medium summer drainage and second autumnal peak. Our estimates show that the floodplain inundation contributes less than 8% to the total wet zones extent. Analysis of the timing of melt and freeze onset and other specific phases of hydrological regime has been done. It was found that the spring inundation lasts for almost 2 months with a latitudinal gradient of melt onset of 8 days/2. No considerable latitudinal gradient has been found for dates of full freeze onset. Our results show that seasonal amplitude of water level variation for northern part of Western Siberia from altimetry is 0.7-1.5 m for lakes and 0.2-0.5 m for bogs. This represents seasonal variation of wetland water storage of 480 mm for non-permafrost and 130 mm for permafrost-affected zones. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is strongly correlated with turbidity (an optical sensitivity parameter) in rivers. In this study, we constructed a turbidity-mediated TP retrieval model using Sentinel-2 observations and field-measured daily-scale water quality. The model was successfully applied to estimate the temporal and spatial variations of TP concentration in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River (MYR) from 2020 to 2023. Our results show: (1) the model accuracy of TP concentration retrieval with turbidity is significantly higher (R-2 = 0.71, MAPE = 15.78%) than that for the model without turbidity (R-2 = 0.62, MAPE = 16.38%); (2) the turbidity and TP concentration in the MYR is higher in summer and autumn than in winter and spring; and (3) the turbidity and total phosphorus (TP) concentration of the Yangtze River showed a significant increase after passing through Dongting Lake (p < 0.05).					; Zhang, Xiaoyang/KZI-3864-2024	Zhang, Xiaoyang/0000-0001-8456-0547; 														2072-4292				MAY	2024	16	9							1491	10.3390/rs16091491	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs16091491													WOS:001220499700001

CHEMOSPHERE												The influence of the season and the biotic factors (age and gill mass) on metal and protein levels in the gill cytosol of the young chubs (2 and 3 years old) was studied in Sava River in autumn 2005 and spring 2006. The obtained results are the first reported cytosolic concentrations of five metals and proteins for the chub gills. The average levels in autumn and spring, respectively, for total cytosolic proteins were 11.2 and 19.9 mg ml(-1), for Zn 6.3 and 10.3 pg ml(-1), for Fe 3.9 and 9.6 pg ml(-1), for Cu 68.4 and 79.0 ng ml(-1), for Mn 55.0 and 63.5 ng ml(-1), and for Cd 2.9 and 3.6 ng ml(-1). The influence of the gill mass on both the protein and the metal levels was observed, but it was seasonally dependent. In autumn, positive correlations were obtained between the gill mass and four parameters (total proteins, Mn, Zn and Fe), and negative with Cu. Contrary, in spring, even negative correlations of total proteins and some metals with the gill mass were observed. The proposed explanation for the different dependence of metal levels on the gill mass in autumn and spring was the seasonal difference in feeding intensity and metabolic rate, with presumably faster metabolism and water filtration through gills in spring. This hypothesis was further supported by the statistically significantly higher concentrations of the total proteins, Zn and Fe, as well as the Fulton condition indices in the spring period.

The record is constituted by alternations of clastic and biogenic laminae and provides a precise chronology extending back to 3607 +/- \94 varve yrs. BP. The seasonality of the boreal climatic zone, with cold winters and mild summers, is reflected in the varve structure as a succession of three laminae from bottom to top, (i) a coarse to fine-grained detrital lamina marked by detrital catchment material transported by spring floods; (ii) a biogenic lamina with diatoms, plant and insect remnants reflecting biological productivity during the season of lake productivity; and (iii) a very fine amorphous organic lamina deposited during the winter stratification. The thickness of the detrital lamina in the lake reflects changes in the rate of spring snow melt in the catchment and is, therefore, considered a proxy for winter conditions. Hence, the record allows reconstructing local climate and environmental conditions on inter annual to the multi-centennial timescales. We find that minerogenic accumulation reflected in the detrital lamina exhibits a high multi-decadal to centennial-scale spectral coherency with proxies for solar activity, such as Alt, and Total Solar Irradiance, suggesting a strong link between solar variability and sediment transport to the lake basin. Increased catchment erosion is observed during periods of low solar activity, which we ascribe to the development of more frequent atmospheric winter blocking circulation induced by solar-forced changes in the stratosphere. We suggest that soil frost in the catchment of Lake Kuninkaisenlampi related to more frequent winter blocking led to increased surface run-off and ultimately to increased catchment erosion during spring. We conclude that, during the past ca 3600 years, solar forcing may have modulated multi-decadal to centennial variations in sedimentation regimes in lakes from Eastern Finland and potentially in other North European lakes.

Weak thermal stratification developed in the lake during the warm period of 1996. The low N:P ratio suggests that nitrogen was the potential limiting nutrient of phytoplankton in the lake. In the phytoplankton of the lake, Chlorophyceae were the most species-rich group followed by Cyanophyceae. The monthly fluctuations of the total phytoplankton biomass presented high levels of summer algal biomass resembling that of other eutrophic lakes. Dinophyceae was the group most represented in the phytoplankton followed by Cyanophyceae. Diatomophyceae dominated in spring and autumn. Nanoplankton comprised around 90% of the total biomass in early spring and less than 10% in summer. The seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton generally followed the typical pattern outlined for other eutrophic lakes. R-species (small diatoms), dominant in the early phase of succession, were replaced by S-species (Microcystis, Anabaena, Ceratium) in summer. With cooling of the water in September, the biomass of diatoms (R-species) increased. The summer algal maxima consisted of a combination of H and M species associations (sensu Reynolds). Phytoplankton development in 1996 was subject to the combined effect of the thermal regime, the small depth of mixing and the increased sediment-water interactions in the lake, which caused changes in the underwater light conditions and nutrient concentrations.

J	STORCK, TW				STORCK, TW			IMPORTANCE OF GIZZARD SHAD IN THE DIET OF LARGEMOUTH BASS IN LAKE SHELBYVILLE, ILLINOIS	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Changes in food habits of largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides were compared with seasonal and annual changes in size composition of a gizzard shad population Dorosoma cepedianum to better understand the temporal dynamics of this species as prey for largemouth bass. Stomachs of 5,283 largemouth bass were examined during spring, summer, and fall from 1978 to 1981. Gizzard shad was the most important species in the diet of age-I and older largemouth bass in all years. However, the age and size composition, as well as the percentage of the volume contributed by this species to the diet, varied substantially among years and seasonally within each year. Variation of gizzard shad in the diet of yearling and older largemouth bass reflected changes in availability caused by high winter mortality of young-of-the-year gizzard shad in some years as well as by annual variation in the summer growth of this age group. Seasonal gaps in the availability of important size classes of gizzard shad reduced its value as a forage species. Fish contributed a major portion of the diet of young-of-the-year largemouth bass in all years but gizzard shad were important only in 1981. Age-0 gizzard shad grew more slowly in 1981, a larger fraction remained vulnerable to predation, and more were eaten by age-0 largemouth bass than in any other year.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				JAN	1986	115	1					21	27		10.1577/1548-8659(1986)115<21:IOGSIT>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1986)115<21:IOGSIT>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1986A934200003

Trout moved upstream 65-100 km during the spring after ice loss over a protracted 4-month period (April-July). Summer movements were minimal, and habitats were deep pools and runs with cover in the same reaches each year. Trout moved short distances (<10 km) to spawning areas in the fall (September). Downstream movements were observed for both postspawned and immature trout. By the time of the river freeze-up (January), major movements had ceased and trout wintered in the lower to middle reaches of the main river, with only one trout leaving the river. That fish remained in habitats with salinity less than 5parts per thousand during winter and returned to the river by May. By improving the scale of observation, we identified an apparent mix of tactics related to the use of marine and freshwater environments within this population. Such behavior may have important implications for the ecological and evolutionary significance of mobility and anadromy within the species and the Salmoninae.					; Curry, R./ABG-3515-2020	Curry, R.

Spatial and temporal variation in phytoplankton community structure in a southeastern US reservoir determined by HPLC and light microscopy	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Spatial and temporal variation in phytoplankton community structure within a large flood-control reservoir (Sardis Reservoir, MS, USA) was investigated in relation to variation in physicochemical properties, location within the reservoir, hydraulic residence time (HRT), nutrient concentrations, temperature, and light conditions over a 14-month period. During periods of short HRT, phytoplankton communities throughout the reservoir were homogeneous in biomass, composition, and production. With a gradual increase in HRT from spring to summer, spatially heterogeneous phytoplankton communities developed along the longitudinal axis of the reservoir. During this period of longer HRT, diatoms and chlorophytes were a larger proportion of total phytoplankton biomass at shallow and more turbid locations near the head of the reservoir, whereas cyanobacteria were a larger proportion of the community at deeper and less turbid locations closer to the outflow. Seasonal succession of the phytoplankton community was represented by high abundance of diatoms in spring, increasing biomass of cyanobacteria through summer, and a secondary bloom of diatoms in fall. Species of Cyclotella, Asterionella, Nitzschia, and Ankistrodesmus were among the first colonizers in the early growing season, closely followed by Aulacoseira, whereas species of Staurastrum and Tetraedron appeared later in the spring. Species of Synedra, Crucigenia, Selenastrum, Scenedesmus, and Merismopedia occurred throughout the sampling period. As the diatoms started to decrease during mid-spring, cryptophytes increased, prior to dominance of species of Pseudanabaena in summer. Reservoir management of HRT, in combination with spatial variation in reservoir morphology and seasonal variation in temperature and riverine nutrient inputs, creates seasonally variable yet distinct spatial patterns in phytoplankton community biomass, composition, and production.					; Zimba, Paul/O-2778-2013	Sthapit, Engela Sthapit/0009-0007-8072-6600; zimba, paul/0000-0001-6541-2055; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR	2008	600						215	228		10.1007/s10750-007-9234-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-007-9234-7													WOS:000253765200020

(1978-1979) in 2 deep oligotrophic lakes in northern Canada. The lakes were situated on the same river system, about 5 km from each other. While they exhibited similar temperature conditions, there were slight differences in the ionic content of the water. Overall, changing temperature was the most important factor influencing the duration of growth cycles of phytoplankton and zooplankton. Nutrients generally controlled the intensity but not the timing of algal blooms. A similar relationship was recorded for the effects of food supply on the development of the major species of herbivorous zooplankton. Although changing photoperiod likely initiated the growth of several important algal and zooplankton species in the spring and early summer, light had no measurable impact on the development of planktonic communities throughout the remainder of the growing season. The higher ionic content of the water in 1 lake may have promoted the growth of protozoans during fall and early winter.																			0020-9309						1981	66	5					745	770		10.1002/iroh.19810660512	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19810660512													WOS:A1981MS17000006

A systematic investigation of macroinvertebrates was conducted in the Dongting Lake during May 2004 - January 2005. Altogether 65 taxa belonging to 27 families and 53 genera were identified. The annual average density and biomass of total macroinvertebrates were 265 ind/m(2) and 2.40 g dry mass/m(2), respectively. It is demonstrated that seasonal variation existed in environmental factors structuring macroinvertebrate assemblages of the Dongting Lake. Hydrological parameters (i.e., flow velocity, water depth) were the driving factors for macroinvertebrate assemblages in spring and summer, whereas the concentrations of water nutrients (i.e., phytoplankton chlorophyll a, total dissolved phosphorus) played the leading role in governing macroinvertebrate assemblages in autumn and winter. After operation of the Three Gorges Dam in 2009, the Dongting Lake may be confronted with the threat of species diversity declining and assemblage structure changing. Thus, ecological restoration measures shall be put forward.

J	Larsson, P; Wathne, I				Larsson, Petter; Wathne, Ingrid			Swim or rest during the winter - what is best for an alpine daphnid?	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Surviving the winter is a special challenge for herbivorous aquatic invertebrates in the alpine region due to the long period of ice cover and cessation of primary production. Since there can still be open water under the ice in lakes and ponds, aquatic invertebrates can be active if they have enough stored resources. Daphnids usually survive the difficult winter period by producing and depositing resting eggs (ephippia) at the end of the summer. Some daphnids in alpine lakes and ponds, however, have a mixed strategy by both producing ephippia and living active in the water during the winter. We ask why these two strategies coexist stably: Do individuals both produce ephippia and stay active during the winter or do they only have resources for one of the strategies? We studied this phenomenon by sampling of Daphnia umbra twice per month from June to September and monthly the rest of the year in an alpine pond at Finse, Norway, 1207 m a.s.l. The species reproduced parthenogenetically in August and early September, with sexual reproduction of ephippia starting in late August. Highest ephippia densities were found in October, with about 10% females carrying such eggs. The remaining females did not carry eggs but stored large reserves of lipids. During the winter, population size decreased, as did accumulated lipids. In spring, very few winter-active daphnids had survived until the ice melted and active winter survival seemed not to be a successful strategy during the year of study. Accumulating lipid reserves is assumed to be a special adaptation to postpone reproduction until spring which is unusual in daphnids. It is in contrast to their food dependent reproduction taking place during the summer, and it appears paradoxal that those specially adapted active winter survivors almost disappeared just before ice break-up. Most likely due to year to year variation in the conditions under the ice, the relative success of the two strategies varies. Parasitism, predators and available volume of open water under the ice might be the main factors. Ephippia producing females seem to have less lipids than those without ephippia, indicating that the two strategies compete for the animals resources and that the former might have problems with surviving the winter as active animals.																			0003-9136					SEP	2006	167	1-4					265	280		10.1127/0003-9136/2006/0167-0265	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2006/0167-0265													WOS:000241402800017

In terms of the community composition at the annual average level and the spatial distribution, Cyanophyta was absolutely dominant (more than 99.4% of the total). The main dominant species in Lake Chaohu were Microcystis viridis, Microcystis flos-aquae, and Anabaena circinalis, all belonging to Cyanophyta. The average phytoplankton cell density of the dominant species showed substantial seasonal differences. In Lake Chaohu, the M. flos-aquae was dominant in spring and summer; while the M. viridis and the A. circinalis were dominant in autumn and in winter, respectively. The canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that the water temperature (T), oxidation reduction potential (ORP), dissolved oxygen (DO) and orthophosphate (PO43--P) were the environmental factors having the greatest influence on the phytoplankton community composition in Lake Chaohu, whereas T, ORP, total suspended solids (TSS) and total nitrogen (TN) were the most important environmental factors in the inflow and outflow rivers. The average species number of phytoplankton was lowest, and the average cell density of phytoplankton was highest in summer, which corresponded to the worst water quality, as indicated by physical and chemical indicators, TSS, DO, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total phosphorus (TP); while, in winter, the average species number of phytoplankton was largest, and the average cell density of phytoplankton was lowest, which corresponded to the best water quality, as indicated by TSS, DO, COD and TP. This implied that the species number and cell density of phytoplankton could serve as biological water quality indicators, which would give overall descriptions of water quality by combining with the physical and chemical indicators.

This study investigates thermal stratification and its effects on hydrochemical dynamics in Lake Fuxian, a deep plateau lake in southwest China, using monitoring data from 2015 to 2023. The lake exhibits pronounced seasonal thermal stratification, forming in spring, stabilizing in summer, weakening in autumn, and mixing in winter, categorizing it as a warm monomictic lake. During summer, the thermocline shows an average depth of 14.3 +/- 0.3 m, thickness of 18.4 +/- 0.5 m, and temperature gradient of 0.9 +/- 0.2 degrees C/m. Stratification significantly affects vertical distribution of hydrochemical parameters, including electrical conductivity (EC), pH, chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), and dissolved oxygen (DO), thereby promoting distinct seasonal patterns. Parameter sensitivity to temperature follows: EC > pH > Chl-a > DO, highlighting temperature as the primary driver of hydrochemical changes. During stratification, photosynthesis in the epilimnion enhances DO and pH levels, with an increase of 15 % in average Chl-a levels. Conversely, organic matter decomposition and mineralization in deep hypolimnetic layers (depth > 90 m) lead to oxygen depletion and hypoxic conditions with approximately a 31 % DO concentration reduction. Dimensional analysis using Wedderburn (We) and Burger (S) numbers quantify wind stress and buoyancy effects on stratification. High We values (>10) in summer indicate strong buoyancy forces suppressing vertical mixing, while S values below 1.0 throughout most periods underscore Coriolis forces' importance in internal wave dynamics. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) confirms the sensitivity of the lake's hydrochemical characteristics to temperature and stratification stability.

To address this issue, we used the SWAT model to simulate pollution loads from various sources in the Haihe River Basin, analyzing the spatiotemporal distribution of pollutants from seven nitrogen/phosphorus sources in sub-basins. Our results show that crop production is the primary contributor to nitrogen and phos-phorus loads in the Haihe River Basin, with the highest loads occurring in summer, followed by fall, spring, and winter. However, industries, atmospheric deposition, and municipal sewage treatment plants have a greater downstream impact on nitrogen/phosphorus contributions due to land use changes. The study highlights the need for targeted prevention and control policies based on the primary sources of pollution loads in different regions.					li, xianfeng/GYD-5825-2022; Sun, Jun/A-5254-2009; Song, Shuai/AAP-4732-2021														0025-326X	1879-3363				APR	2023	189								114756	10.1016/j.marpolbul.2023.114756	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2023.114756		MAR 2023						36893649					WOS:000951506900001

Their presence may result from contact with water through soil, air, and animal and human activity. The identification of microorganisms allows us to determine the biological properties, the possible epidemiological risk, and the sanitary condition of the surface water. Aim of the research: To analyse the presence of microbiological indicators in selected water samples collected in autumn, winter, and spring. Material and methods: The research sites included three rivers and two water reservoirs located in Swietokrzyskie voivodeship. The water samples were tested based on the presence of coliform, mesophilic, and psychrophilic bacteria. Results: The presence of E. coli was confirmed in all water reservoirs, but values above the standard limit were confirmed in just three cases (Wisla, Bernatka, and Emerald Lake). The results show that the changing microbiological parameters of the analysed water samples can result from different factors. The large number of bacteria in water can come from other local streams and groundwater, human and animal activity, and especially from influx of domestic wastewater. The sanitary state of surface water in Swietokrzyskie is consistent with data from other Polish voivodeships published in the literature. Conclusions: Microbiological pollution of surface water in Poland is a constant and underestimated problem. It can be a serious epidemiological threat, especially in mild winters and warmer summers.

J	Leland, HV; Berkas, WR				Leland, HV; Berkas, WR			Temporal variation in plankton assemblages and physicochemistry of Devils Lake, North Dakota	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Seasonal and annual variation in biomass and structure of algal assemblages of hyposaline Devils Lake were examined in relation to turbidity, ambient concentrations of major ions, trace elements and nutrients, and the standing crop of herbivores. Lake level declined during the early years of study, but rose markedly in subsequent years as historically large volumes of water flowed into this hydrologically-closed basin. Winter algal assemblages were dominated (in biomass) most years by small, non-motile chlorophytes (Choricystis minor; Kirchneriella lunaris or Dunaliella sp.), or Euglena sp. in the most saline sub-basin. Spring assemblages were dominated by diatoms (Stephanodiscus cf. minutulus, Surirella peisonis, Cyclotella meneghiniana and Entomoneis paludosa were especially prominent) or chlorophytes (C. minor) until the lake level rose. C. minor abundances then declined in spring assemblages and diatoms (Stephanodiscus cf. agassizensis and S. niagarae; E. paludosa in the more saline subbasins) dominated. The potential for nitrogen-deficient conditions for phytoplankton growth was evidenced most summers and early autumns by consistently high concentrations of reactive-P relative to inorganic-N and blooms of the N-fixing cyanophyte Aphanizomenon flos-aquae; Microcystis aeruginosa typically was a co-dominant (> 30% of biomass) in these assemblages. Pulses of diatoms (S. cf. agassizensis and C. meneghiniana) occurred in summers following unusually prolonged periods of calm weather or large water inflows. Physical (irradiance. turbulence) and chemical (major nutrients) variables were the primary factors associated with phytoplankton growth. Transparency and major nutrient concentrations accounted for more of the annual variation in phytoplankton structure than did salinity. Seasonal abundance patterns of the dominant zooplankton (the copepod Diaptomus sicilis; the cladocerans Ceriodaphnia quadrangula, Chydorus sphaericus, Daphnia pulex and Diaphanosoma birgei; and the rotifers Brachionus spp., Filinia longiseta, Keratella cochlearis and K. quadrata) also indicated variation in algal populations related to grazing.																			0018-8158						1998	377						57	71		10.1023/A:1003274705074	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003274705074													WOS:000076947500006
J	Li, SP; Hou, W; Feng, GL				Li, Shuping; Hou, Wei; Feng, Guolin			Atmospheric Circulation Patterns over East Asia and Their Connection with Summer Precipitation and Surface Air Temperature in Eastern China during 1961-2013	JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH												Based on the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data and Chinese observational data during 1961-2013, atmospheric circulation patterns over East Asia in summer and their connection with precipitation and surface air temperature in eastern China as well as associated external forcing are investigated. Three patterns of the atmospheric circulation are identified, all with quasi-barotropic structures: (1) the East Asia/Pacific (EAP) pattern, (2) the Baikal Lake/Okhotsk Sea (BLOS) pattern, and (3) the eastern China/northern Okhotsk Sea (ECNOS) pattern. The positive EAP pattern significantly increases precipitation over the Yangtze River valley and favors cooling north of the Yangtze River and warming south of the Yangtze River in summer. The warm sea surface temperature anomalies over the tropical Indian Ocean suppress convection over the northwestern subtropical Pacific through the Ekman divergence induced by a Kelvin wave and excite the EAP pattern. The positive BLOS pattern is associated with below-average precipitation south of the Yangtze River and robust cooling over northeastern China. This pattern is triggered by anomalous spring sea ice concentration in the northern Barents Sea. The anomalous sea ice concentration contributes to a Rossby wave activity flux originating from the Greenland Sea, which propagates eastward to North Pacific. The positive ECNOS pattern leads to below-average precipitation and significant warming over northeastern China in summer. The reduced soil moisture associated with the earlier spring snowmelt enhances surface warming over Mongolia and northeastern China and the later spring snowmelt leads to surface cooling over Far East in summer, both of which are responsible for the formation of the ECNOS pattern.

Lake-wide, annual status of the Mysis diluviana population in Lake Michigan in 2015	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Mysis diluviana is one of the most abundant zooplankton by biomass in the Laurentian Great Lakes of North America, a predator of other zooplankton and an important prey for fishes. Studies of long-term trends in Lake Michigan have shown 2005-2016 densities to be 50-80% lower than 1990s densities, but these observations have been based on annual monitoring that is either spatially or seasonally limited. We combined Lake Michigan Mysis data from three annual programs and the 2015 Cooperative Science and Monitoring Initiative to achieve broad spatial coverage during spring, summer, and fall of 2015 and broad depth coverage during spring 2016. Lake-wide, annual density and biomass were 82 (SE: 10) Mysis/m(2) and 200 (SE: 36) mg dry mass/m(2). Density and biomass estimates were highest offshore, generally higher in the north basin, and seasonally highest in summer. Annual lake-wide averages for depths >30 m were better captured by seasonally-extensive annual programs than spatially-extensive annual programs, although spring sampling may bias annual values low. Mysis cohorts grew 0.026 mm/d (age-0) and 0.007 to 0.027 mm/d (age-1). Annual mortality was 81-98%. Reproduction was fall-spring and seasonal lake-wide estimates ranged from 0.6 to 19.1% females brooding, 13-20 embryos/brood, and 3-46 embryos/m(2). Annual production (423 mg dry mass/m(2)/yr, SE: 31) was lower than all but one previous estimate from lakes Michigan, Huron, and Ontario. While Mysis tend to persist, low Mysis production may be a concern for prey fishes that feed on Mysis. (C) 2020 the US Geological Survey and International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Based on reanalysis data and the CESM1.2.2 model, we investigated the possible impacts of spring Eurasian snowmelt on recent NEA summer warming and the relevant mechanisms. Results show that increased (decreased) spring snowmelt over eastern Europe to western Siberia (EEWS) is closely linked to NEA summer warming (cooling). Increased spring snowmelt can wet the soil, weakening surface sensible heating to the atmosphere and cooling the atmosphere. The persistent anomalous soil moisture and surface sensible heat induce geopotential height decrease over EEWS and strengthen the eastward-propagating wave train. Furthermore, positive geopotential height anomalies appear in downstream NEA in summer via the adjustment of the atmospheric circulation. Controlled by the anomalous high pressure system, the west part of NEA is affected by the southerly warm advection, while the east is affected by adiabatic warming induced by the dominant descending motion. Meanwhile, decreased cloud and increased incident solar radiation over NEA favor summer land surface warming. Model results suggest that CESM1.2.2 can basically reproduce the positive correlation between NEA summer land surface temperature and EEWS spring snowmelt. With the positive spring snowmelt forcing, the simulated positive soil moisture and negative sensible heat anomalies persist from spring to summer over EEWS. Consequently, negative geopotential height anomalies appear over the snowmelt region while positive anomalies occur around Lake Baikal, resulting in evident NEA land surface warming.

Here we compare the O-18/O-16 ratios preserved in diatom silica and authigenic calcite from an open, spring-fed, freshwater lake core from Turkey which spans marine oxygen isotope stage 3. The two sets of isotope data show contrasting trends in spite of their mutual dependence on the water O-18/O-16 ratio and lake-water temperature. The most likely explanation for this divergence is difference in seasonality of biological productivity mediated by the strongly continental climate of the Anatolian plateau. Diatom silica and authigenic calcite are precipitated from solutes in the lake-water at different times of the year. Diatom productivity follows a well-defined seasonal cycle, peaking first and most importantly in the spring and then in the autumn. The precipitation of calcite follows productivity by all forms of photosynthetic organisms that deplete CO2 but in most lakes this occurs during the summer months. The delta O-18(calcite) curve shows mean summer temperature maxima at ca. 30-35 and ca. 58 ka BP while the intervening data represent a period of relatively cool summers. The delta O-18(diatom) curve shows bipolar results (15-20 and 29-33 parts per thousand), which suggests that at least two discrete sources or processes contributed to the oxygen composition of the diatoms but probably involved a dilution mechanism to shift the isotopic values. The most likely source of depleted water is from snow entering the lake during the spring thaw. We infer that many authigenic calcite curves from regions with markedly seasonal climates may be temporally limited to a few summer months and that diatom silica provides complementary data on seasonally-specific water isotopic composition rather than a substitute for analyses based on carbonate.					; Roberts, Nick/C-2694-2008; Barker, Philip/J-5938-2012	Leng, Melanie/0000-0003-1115-5166; Barker, Philip/0000-0002-5334-9201													0921-2728					APR	2001	25	3					343	349		10.1023/A:1011169832093	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1011169832093													WOS:000167852600006

Zoological Studies 51(6): 783-792. The White-headed Duck Oxyura leucocephala is a globally endangered diving duck that breeds in a few wetlands in Spain, Asia, and northern Africa. Little is known about how environmental variables affect the duck's distribution, so information is required to protect wintering and breeding areas. We attempted to assess which morphometric (open water surface and shoreline development index; [SDI]) and limnological variables (chironomid larvae biomass, macrophyte seed density, macrophyte cover, Secchi disk depth, conductivity, water depth, and chlorophyll a) were important in predicting suitable habitat conditions for this duck in an important wetland for the species in southeastern Spain. Our study included 2 periods with contrasting hydrological conditions: "wet" (winter 2003 to summer 2004) and "dry" (spring to summer 2005). Limnological variables were measured, and bird censuses were performed once a month in each water body, while morphometric variables were estimated from aerial photographs. In the wet year, the probability of the presence of wintering ducks increased with a greater open water surface area. In spring, the likelihood of the species occurring increased with the SDI, biomass of chironomid larvae, and level of eutrophication, and decreased with an increasing open water surface area. In summer, a high density of macrophyte seeds, high water transparency, and greater macrophyte cover were positively correlated with the presence of ducks. In the dry year, water depth and chironomid biomass were positively related to the bird's presence in spring and summer. White-headed Ducks were selective regarding the conditions of the water bodies, having different habitat requirements in different stages of their annual cycle. In stressful hydrological conditions (severe drought), ducks sought relatively deeper water bodies independent of their morphometry. We propose suggestions for the species' conservation in terms of local habitat management strategies. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/51.6/783.pdf					Armengol, Javier/H-2325-2015; Anton-Pardo, Maria/G-5156-2015; Barba, Emilio/I-5130-2015	Anton-Pardo, Maria/0000-0003-1722-9867; Barba, Emilio/0000-0003-2882-9788													1021-5506	1810-522X				NOV	2012	51	6					783	792																WOS:000312750200006

Seasonality and diversity patterns of microphytobenthos in a mesotrophic lake	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Investigations on the littoral microphytobenthos populations of lakes are very rare. Based on new sampling techniques, allowing the undisturbed sampling of sublittoral sediments, we present information on limnic microphytobenthos populations of the Schohsee in Northern Germany (10 degrees 26'E, 54 degrees 13'N). Investigations on microphytobenthic communities at a. sandy and a muddy site provided new insights into the community structure and seasonal variations of limnic benthic microalgae. The microphytobenthos was characterised by low chlorophyll-a contents (0.16 mu g cm(-2) to 0.74 mu g cm(-2)) and low cell numbers (25 cells cm(-2) to 266 cells cm(-2)). Both sites showed similar patterns in terms of algal biomass and seasonality; no site-specific characteristics were observed. The productivity of the sediment microflora in the Schohsee was low and most likely related to the mesotrophic lake character and to reduced light conditions in the near-shore sublittoral. The algal communities at both sites showed high diversity, distinct seasonality and succession patterns with shifts in community composition in spring, summer and autumn. The community was dominated by Fragilaria spp., Navicula spp., Nitzschia spp., and Stauroneis spp. in spring shifting to a Stauroneis spp.-dominated community in summer. In autumn the populations were dominated by Navicula spp., Nitzschia spp., and Stauroneis spp. Overall, the taxonomic composition showed a dominance of prostrate diatoms, whereas cyanobacteria, green algae and erect diatoms occurred rarely and with low abundance.

Here we describe the main patterns of seasonal variability in the ecosystems of nine lakes in Europe, and discuss the implications for recording climatic features in their sediments. Despite the diversity in latitude and size, the lakes showed a number of common features. They were ice-covered between 5 9 months, and all but one were dimictic. This particular lake was long and shallow, and wind action episodically mixed the water column throughout the ice-free period. All lakes showed characteristic oxygen depletion during the ice-covered-period, which was greater in the most productive lakes. Two types of lakes were distinguished according to the number of production peaks during the ice-free season. Lakes with longer summer stratification tended to have two productive periods: one at the onset of stratification, and the other during the autumn overturn. Lakes with shorter stratification had single peak during the ice-free period. All lakes presented deep chlorophyll maxima during summer stratification, and subsurface chlorophyll maxima beneath the ice. Phosphorus limitation was common to all lakes, since nitrogen compounds were significantly more abundant than the requirements for the primary production observed. The major chemical components present in the lakes showed a short but extreme dilution during thawing. Certain lake features may favour the recording of particular climatic fluctuations, for instance: lakes with two distinct productive periods, climatic fluctuations in spring or autumn ( e. g., through chrysophycean cysts); lakes with higher oxygen consumption, climatic factors affecting the duration of the ice-cover ( e. g., through low-oxygen tolerant chironomids); lakes with higher water retention time; changes in atmospheric deposition ( e. g., through carbon or pigment burial); lakes with longer stratification, air temperature changes during summer and autumn ( e. g., through all epilimnetic species).					; Camarero, Lluis/J-9239-2012; Müller, Beat/J-8887-2016; Buchaca, Teresa/L-1679-2014; Lotter, Andre F./C-3477-2008; Nickus, Ulrike/C-2063-2019; Stuchlik, Evzen/I-1915-2017; Catalan, Jordi/A-5420-2008; Camarero, Lluís/J-9239-2012; Ventura, Marc/A-5660-2008; Muller, Beat/J-8887-2016; Lotter, Andre/C-3477-2008; Granados, Ignacio/A-3737-2013; strunecky, otakar/M-2643-2019; Bitusik, Peter/C-3423-2019; Kopacek, Jiri/A-7373-2014	Korhola, Atte A./0000-0003-2577-6502; Camarero, Lluis/0000-0003-4271-8988; Ventura, Marc/0000-0003-1401-414X; Bitusik, Peter/0000-0002-8439-4582; Buchaca, Teresa/0000-0001-7933-8992; Thies, Hansjoerg/0000-0001-8153-2428; Lotter, Andre F./0000-0002-2954-8809; Nickus, Ulrike/0000-0001-6041-5329; Stuchlik, Evzen/0000-0003-0200-5721; Catalan, Jordi/0000-0002-2934-4013; Sorvari Sundet, Sanna/0000-0002-0704-6592; Muller, Beat/0000-0003-3696-9035; Strunecky, Otakar/0000-0001-9735-4662; Kopacek, Jiri/0000-0002-4409-4032; Granados, Ignacio/0000-0002-8669-6613; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				JUN	2002	28	1					25	46		10.1023/A:1020315817235	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1020315817235													WOS:000178212200003
J	Santonja, M; Le Rouzic, B; Thiébaut, G				Santonja, Mathieu; Le Rouzic, Bertrand; Thiebaut, Gabrielle			Seasonal dependence and functional implications of macrophyte-phytoplankton allelopathic interactions	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Invasive plant species such as Ludwigia hexapetala might have a competitive advantage if they produce allelopathically active compounds against primary producers. Both phytoplankton and plant community structure may be affected due to different, species-specific sensitivity to allelochemicals. Moreover, such allelopathic interactions could vary over the year depending on (i) the plant's phenological stage and (ii) the abilities of the native macrophytes to suppressor the non-native macrophytes to stimulatethe non-native macrophyte population. We tested the allelopathic effects of aqueous leaf extracts of L.hexapetala on the photosynthetic activity of three target phytoplankton strains (Scenedesmus communis, a toxic Microcystis aeruginosa strain and a non-toxic Microcystis aeruginosa strain) over three seasons of development (spring, summer and autumn). We also tested seasonal allelopathic effects of aqueous leaf extracts of both L.hexapetala (i.e. the non-native invasive species) and the native Mentha aquatica on L.hexapetala seed germination. Finally, we identified three main secondary compounds present in the aqueous leaf extracts of L.hexapetala and we tested each individual compound on the phytoplankton's photosynthetic activity and on L.hexapetala seed germination. We observed marked seasonal and species-specific patterns of L.hexapetala allelopathy on phytoplankton. The photosynthetic activities of S.communis and the toxic M.aeruginosa strain were stimulated by L.hexapetala aqueous leaf extracts in autumn and spring, respectively, whereas the non-toxic M.aeruginosa strain was strongly inhibited in these two seasons. In summer, photosynthesis of all phytoplankton strains was inhibited. The germination rate of L.hexapetala seeds was stimulated by both L. hexapetala and M.aquatica aqueous leaf extracts, especially in summer, concomitant with the strong negative effects observed on the three phytoplankton strains. Three flavonoid glycosides (myricitrin, prunin and quercitrin) were identified as the main secondary compounds present in the L.hexapetala aqueous leaf extracts. The photosynthetic activity of S.communis was slightly stimulated by the three compounds. The photosynthetic activity of the toxic M.aeruginosa strain was stimulated by myricitrin and quercitrin, whereas that of the non-toxic M.aeruginosa strain was inhibited by prunin. Finally, the germination rate and the germination velocity of L.hexapetala seeds were stimulated by myricitrin and prunin. These findings suggest that L.hexapetala could favour the photosynthetic activity of toxic cyanobacteria in spring and reduce their photosynthetic activity in summer, potentially leading to drastic changes in the phytoplankton communities and therewith ecological functioning of invaded ponds. Moreover, the stimulation of its seed germination could give a strong competitive advantage to L.hexapetala, thus promoting its invasiveness.

J	Guo, JB; Zhang, CJ; Zheng, GC; Xue, J; Zhang, LH				Guo, Jingbo; Zhang, Chongjun; Zheng, Guochen; Xue, Jie; Zhang, Lanhe			The establishment of season-specific eutrophication assessment standards for a water-supply reservoir located in Northeast China based on chlorophyll-a levels	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Eutrophication has become the primary problem facing most surface water bodies worldwide, especially when the water body serves as a water supply source. Substantial efforts have been made to prevent and control eutrophication from decades ago. Among them, the establishment of eutrophication assessment standards was rather essential. However, until now, there is no authoritative standard established for the assessment of eutrophication level in developing countries such as in China. For water bodies located in the Northeast China, the level of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), which is proportional to phytoplankton biomass, tends to be subjected to evident seasonal variations as the phytoplankton biomass and species composition are greatly impacted by the seasonally alternated climate, hydrology and pollutants source, which in turn complicated the eutrophication problem. The establishment of season-specific eutrophication assessment standards was thus extremely significant for water bodies located in regions with large air temperature variations. In this study, water quality parameters were detected over five consecutive years (2011-2015) to assess the seasonal trophic state of a water-supply reservoir located in Northeast China. Bivariate and multiple regression were performed between Chl-a and other water quality parameters in different seasons. The trophic state of each season was evaluated by the comprehensive trophic level index and the season-specific eutrophication assessment standards were established. The results showed that phosphorus was the predominant limiting nutrient of eutrophication and the Chl-a levels were seasonally different. The reservoir was generally in a light-eutrophic state. Mesotrophic assessment standards were established for spring, summer and autumn and light-eutrophic assessment standards for autumn based on the water quality data collected. As the predominant nutrient, the concentrations of total phosphorus for the mesotrophic state for spring, summer and autumn were 0.044, 0.028 and 0.038 mg/L, respectively. Moreover, as shown by the mesotrophic and light-eutrophic standards of the autumn, the discrepancy of different parameters between the standards of different trophic level was were not necessarily varied in the same trend. In conclusion, the establishment of season-specific eutrophication standards for water bodies located in regions with large air temperature variations was significant for scientific trophic state evaluation and effective eutrophication control.

J	Small, EE; Giorgi, F; Sloan, LC; Hostetler, S				Small, EE; Giorgi, F; Sloan, LC; Hostetler, S			The effects of desiccation and climatic change on the hydrology of the Aral Sea	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Anthropogenic desiccation of the Aral Sea between 1960 and the mid-1990s resulted in a substantial modification of the land surface that changed air temperature in the surrounding region. During the desiccation interval, the net annual rate of precipitation minus evaporation (P - E) over the Aral Sea's surface became more negative by similar to 15%, with the greatest changes occurring during the summer months. In addition, Aral Sea surface temperatures (SST) increased by up to 5 degreesC in the spring and summer and decreased by up to 4 degreesC in the fall and winter. A series of coupled regional climate-lake model experiments were completed to evaluate if the observed hydrologic changes are caused by desiccation or instead reflect larger-scale climatic variability or change, or some combination of both. If the P - E changes are the result of desiccation, then a positive feedback exists that has amplified the anthropogenic perturbation to the hydrologic system. The effects of desiccation are examined by varying the simulated area, depth, and salinity of the Aral Sea in different model experiments. The simulated changes in SST resulting from desiccation are similar to the observed changes-both simulated and observed SSTs have increased during the spring and summer and have decreased during the fall and winter. The simulated changes in the annual cycle of P - E resulting from desiccation are also similar to observed changes, but the simulated net annual decrease in P - E is only similar to 30% of the observed decrease. Warming has been observed across central Asia during the desiccation interval. The hydrologic response to this large-scale climatic variability or change was assessed by perturbing the meteorological boundary conditions (1.5 degreesC cooling with constant relative humidity) but leaving the Aral Sea characteristics unchanged. The simulated effects of warming do not closely match the observed changes on the monthly timescale-SST changes are positive and the P - E changes are negative in all months. However, the annual change in P - E is similar to the observed value. The simulated hydrologic response to the combined effects of desiccation and warming matches the observed SST and P - E changes more closely than the response to each forcing alone. This result indicates that a combination of both desiccation and climatic change or variability has produced the observed hydrological changes-the primary effect of desiccation is to alter the annual cycle of SST and P - E whereas warming has modified the hydrologic budget on the annual timescale.

The development of rapid and timely water-quality assessment tools using easily measured variables is essential for the health management of urban water bodies. In this study, we focused on the dissolved oxygen (DO) of Baiyangdian Lake using 251 sets of empirically measured water quality data and corresponding Sentinel-2 satellite images. Nine machine learning algorithms were then used to develop a rapid detection algorithm for the spatial distribution of the DO concentration in Baiyangdian Lake. This study successfully applied these methods to invert the DO concentration in Baiyangdian Lake during spring, summer, and autumn. The results indicated that extra tree regression (ETR) provided the most accurate and stable results for inverting the DO concentration among the nine machine learning methods. In contrast, AdaBoost regression (ABR), Bayesian ridge regression (BRR), and support vector machines (SVM) exhibit relatively poor regression performance and lack sensitivity to DO concentrations. Moreover, the DO concentration in Baiyangdian Lake ranged from approximately 0 to 12 mg/L, with notable spatiotemporal variations. The highest overall DO concentration was observed in the spring, particularly in the southern region. The DO concentration significantly decreased during summer compared to that in spring, with higher values in the southwestern area and lower values in the northern region. The DO concentration reached its lowest value in autumn, with slightly higher values in the southern region. This study focused on the estimation and inversion of DO concentrations in the water bodies of Baiyangdian Lake. By introducing and comparing the performances of commonly used machine learning models, a rapid estimation of the DO concentration was achieved, thereby overcoming the limitations of traditional water quality monitoring methods in DO inversion. It not only intuitively explained the temporal and spatial variation patterns of DO concentration but also laid a foundation for further in-depth exploration of the interactions between DO and other water quality parameters.

Methods: The test sites (i.e., Wabeno, Wisconsin, USA; Manistique, Michigan, USA; Pine River, Michigan, USA; Newaygo, Michigan, USA; Turkey Point, Ontario, Canada; Ganaraska, Ontario, Canada; and Orono, Maine, USA) examined in this study were part of a range-wide white pine provenance trial established in the early 1960s in the eastern United States and Canada. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to examine the main modes of variation [first (PC1) and second (PC2) principal component axes] in the standardized radial growth indices of the provenances at each test site. The year scores for PC1 and PC2 were examined in relation to an array of test site climate variables using multiple regression analysis to examine the commonality of growth response across all provenances to the climate of each test site. Provenance loadings on PC1 and PC2 were correlated with geographic parameters (i.e., latitude, longitude, elevation) and a suite of biophysical parameters associated with provenance origin location. Results: The amount of variation in radial growth explained by PC1 and PC2 ranged from 43.4% to 89.6%. Dendroclimatic models revealed that white pine radial growth responses to climate were complex and differed among sites. The key dendroclimatic relationships observed included sensitivity to high temperature in winter and summer, cold temperature in the spring and fall (i.e., beginning and end of the growing season), summer moisture stress, potential sensitivity to storm-induced damage in spring and fall, and both positive and negative effects of higher winter snowfall. Separation of the loadings of provenances on principal component axes was mainly associated with temperature-related bioclimatic parameters of provenance origin at 5 of the 7 test sites close to the climate influence of the Great Lakes (i.e., Wabeno, Manistique, Pine River, Newaygo, and Turkey Point). In contrast, differences in radial growth response to climate at the Ganaraska test site, were driven more by precipitation-related bioclimatic parameters of the provenance origin location while radial growth at the easternmost Orono test site was independent of bioclimate at the provenance origin location. Conclusions: Study results suggest that genetic adaptation to temperature and precipitation regime may significantly influence radial growth performance of white pine populations selected for use in assisted migration programs to better adapt white pine to a future climate.																			2095-6355	2197-5620				MAR 13	2018	5								18	10.1186/s40663-018-0136-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40663-018-0136-0													WOS:000427474900001
J	Lucas, MC; Batley, E				Lucas, MC; Batley, E			Seasonal movements and behaviour of adult barbel Barbus barbus, a riverine cyprinid fish: Implications for river management	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. To provide information on the movements and localized activity of barbel Barbus barbus (Cyprinidae) in a river containing potentially obstructing weirs, 31 adult barbel were radio-tracked in the River Nidd, a tributary of the Yorkshire Ouse, North East England between June 1993 and September 1994. 2. Barbel exhibited substantial movements, ranging from 2 to nearly 20 km. Four fish are known to have moved between the Nidd and the Ouse, demonstrating that at least a part of the barbel population utilize the Nidd and Ouse at different times of the year. 3. Range of upstream movement was restricted by the presence and nature of several weirs, including Skip Bridge flow-gauging weir. Low levels of spawning downstream of Skip Bridge weir appear to have been due to a lack of suitable spawning habitat. 4. Movements followed a seasonal pattern, with males and females migrating upstream in spring to spawn on gravel beds. Females moved downstream more quickly than males over the summer months. Both sexes moved downstream in autumn and winter. Day length and water temperature were the best predictors in relation to distance moved up the River Nidd. Descriptive models, relating movement to water temperature and day length, are provided. 5. For both sexes, localized activity varied greatly on both diel and seasonal scales, and was mainly associated with foraging. During summer there was typically a bimodal pattern of diel activity with peaks usually in early morning and late evening. In winter, mean daily activity was less than 20% of peak summer levels and fish were relatively dormant. In winter, diel activity patterns exhibited a single peak towards dusk. Mean daily activity levels for each month were linearly correlated with mean monthly water temperatures, even during the months where movement to and on the spawning sites occurred. 6. The importance of natural migrations and seasonal activity patterns for barbel, and likewise many other riverine cyprinids, has probably been underestimated for a wide variety of river systems. As major components of riverine fish communities, the importance of seasonal movements of mobile cyprinid species should be considered when constructing weirs and other obstructions. Greater consideration should be given to ways of mitigating effects of existing barriers to movement of non-salmonid species.																			0021-8901					DEC	1996	33	6					1345	1358		10.2307/2404775	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2404775													WOS:A1996WH51600011

Spring staging areas often overlap with those of the Bewick's Swans (Cygnus columbianus bewickii) migrating to arctic Russia. Whooper Swans occur in internationally important numbers (>600 birds) at seven wetland sites in spring, and eight sites are of national importance (100-600 birds). During the 1990s, up to 5,700 and 3,900 swans were counted at the key staging sites of Matsalu Bay and Haapsalu Bay respectively. Flocks are smaller (often <50 birds) and more scattered during autumn migration but two wetlands, Haapsalu Bay and Matsalu Bay, again hold internationally important numbers, with tip to 3,900 and 1,200 individuals at this time. The Whooper Swan is a regular but innumerous wintering species, occurring in low numbers in coastal areas. In hard winters up to 300 birds and in mild winters up to 1,000 birds have been recorded in Estonia. There is no clear trend in the number of swans present in winter. The first breeding attempt by Whooper Swans in Estonia was recorded in 1979, a steady increase in the number of breeding pairs was recorded during the 1990s and the number currently breeding is estimated at 30-40 pairs. Breeding habitats are natural and artificial pools (dyseutrophic lakes), raised bogs (43% of breeding attempts), eutrophic inland lakes (31%) and coastal lakes and bays (26%). Flocks of molting swans (mainly non-breeding birds) have been observed in western Estonia since 1993.																			1524-4695	1938-5390					2002	25			1			61	66																WOS:000180160100009

Community Composition of Microbial Eukaryotes Transported by Stemflow from Fagus grandifolia Ehrh. (American Beech) Trees in Northeastern Ohio (USA)	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Stemflow, the concentrated fraction of rainfall that drains down tree trunks, can translocate canopy biota to the forest floor, but its eukaryotic composition remains uncharacterized via eDNA methods. We collected stemflow from 18 Fagus grandifolia (American beech) trees during ten storms in northeastern Ohio (USA) and analyzed 18S rRNA eDNA to resolve transported microbial-eukaryote communities. Over 12 million reads (83 samples) revealed 920 zero-radius OTUs spanning fungi, algae, protists, and metazoans. Community composition differed significantly among storm events (PERMANOVA F = 3.6, r(2) = 0.31, p < 0.001) and among NOAA HYSPLIT modeled air-mass back-trajectories (F = 8.9, r(2) = 0.36, p < 0.001). Summer storms were dominated by fungal taxa (Entomophthoromycota, Basidiomycota, and Ascomycota comprised up to 90% of reads), whereas late-autumn and winter storms carried mainly algal stramenopiles (Ochrophyta). Large storms (> 60 mm event(-1)) mobilized conspicuously higher relative abundances of larger metazoans (tardigrades and arthropods). We infer from stemflow eDNA that (i) seasonal resource shifts in tree canopies favor parasitic fungi in summer and saprotrophic fungi in autumn; (ii) northerly winter storms entrain Great Lakes aerosol algae that deposit onto canopies; (iii) rainfall intensity and duration jointly control the detachment of well-attached canopy eukaryotes. Together, our results establish stemflow eDNA as a non-invasive window into storm-mediated linkages between above- and below-ground biodiversity, offering new scope for monitoring canopy microbiomes under intensifying hydro-climatic regimes.																			0095-3628	1432-184X				SEP 2	2025	88	1							93	10.1007/s00248-025-02593-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-025-02593-2								40892071					WOS:001565566300001

Carbon, nutrient and metal controls on phytoplankton concentration and biodiversity in thermokarst lakes of latitudinal gradient from isolated to continuous permafrost	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Shallow thaw (thermokarst) lakes abundant in regions of permafrost-affected peatlands represent important sources of carbon dioxide and methane emission to the atmosphere, however the quantitative parameters of phytoplankton communities which control the C cycle in these lakes remain poorly known. This is especially true considering the roles of permafrost, hydrochemical composition of lakes, lake sizes and season as major governing factors on phytoplankton abundance and biodiversity. In this work, we quantified phytoplankton characteristics of 27 thermokarst lakes (sizes ranging from 115 m2 to 1.24 km2) sampled in spring, summer and autumn across a permafrost gradient (isolated, sporadic, discontinuous and continuous zone) in the Western Siberia Lowland (WSL). The biodiversity indices were highest during all seasons in lakes of the continuous permafrost zone and rather similar in lakes of isolated, sporadic and discontinuous permafrost zone. Considering all seasons and permafrost zones, the biomass and cell number of phytoplankton correlated with Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC), phosphate, and some metal micro-nutrients (Ni, Zn). The strongest correlations were observed for Cyanophycea during summer, with pH, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, Ba (cell number) and Cu, Zn, Ba (biomass), and during autumn, with DOC, K, Cr, Cu, Zn, Ba, Cd, Pb (biomass). Using a substituting space for time approach for climate warming and permafrost thaw and suggesting a shift in permafrost boundaries northward, we foresee an increase in cell number and biomass in continuous permafrost zone in spring and summer, and a decrease in phytoplankton abundance in the discontinuous and sporadic permafrost zones. The biodiversity of phytoplankton in the continuous permafrost zone might decrease whereas in other zones, it may not exhibit any sizably change.However, in case of strong deepening of the active layer down to underlaying mineral horizons, and the release of some limiting nutrients (Si, P) due to enhanced connectivity of the lake with groundwater, the share of cyanobacteria and diatoms may increase.

Winter severity shapes spring plankton succession in a small, eutrophic lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Springtime in temperate lakes is characterized by a phytoplankton bloom, followed by a grazing crustacean zooplankton bloom. Timing and species composition for both phytoplankton and zooplankton peaks are likely dependent on antecedent conditions and may respond to climate change. Here, we tracked winter-spring plankton phenology for four years in a shallow, eutrophic lake. Winter conditions influenced successional events and species composition for both phytoplankton and zooplankton. Specifically, diatoms dominated around ice-out followed by cyanobacteria blooms in the late spring. Cyclopoid copepods were common under ice, whereas Daphnia increased with higher water temperature later in the season. Phytoplankton and zooplankton species composition responded to water temperature, ice-off, and exhibited inter-annual variation, while phytoplankton also responded to nutrient concentrations and biomass of some zooplankton groups. Zooplankton species composition also corresponded with secchi depth. Interestingly, the ice broke up and re-froze during the warmest winter studied, which allowed water column mixing and caused colder water temperatures than water temperatures under ice. In this particular study year, the spring Daphnia bloom was late relative to other years, indicating a possible mismatch between the phytoplankton and zooplankton blooms. Our study indicates that winter conditions have a strong impact on plankton phenology and community composition.

A significant offshore migration occurred during the day throughout much of the winter. Seasonally, fish shifted offshore during cold water temperatures; a significant inverse correlation existed between distance offshore and water temperature. During high water levels some fish moved inshore to use inundated terrestrial habitat, even at water temperatures as low as 6 C. Although fish tended to move less during colder weather, most fish remained active throughout the study; average movement between weekly tracking sessions was 298 m during the winter (17 Dec-20 Mar). Ten of 11 fish exhibited distinct home ranges, while 1 fish exhibited inter-embayment mobility and no home range. Four fish redistributed themselves to new home ranges in late fall, but returned to their prior home ranges by early spring. Permanent redistribution during the over-winter period was limited; dispersal occurred in only 1 fish.																									1997							113	122																WOS:000081833300020

These prairies have been largely reduced to four protected sites, where the federally endangered Florida Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum floridanus) and Bachman's Sparrow (Aimophila aestivalis) are year-round residents. Management of dry prairie habitat has usually involved late-fall and winter prescribed burns to maintain habitat in an early successional state, which is preferred by these sparrows. Naturally ignited fires on dry prairie ecosystems, however, occur most frequently in summer. Because this grassland evolved with summer wildfires, we sought to understand how prescribed summer burns affected the two rare emberizid sparrows that breed and winter there. Between 1994 and 1996 we studied the effects of pr escribed summer fires on Florida Grasshopper and Backman's sparrows at the Kissimmee Prairie Sanctuary and Three Lakes Wildlife Management Area. Grasshopper Sparrows were more sensitive to timing of prescribed fires than were Bachman's Sparrows. Both species increased in density following mid-June fires, but only Bachman's Sparrows responded positively to July fires. We found that both species occupied burned areas one week after burning and remained reproductively active into September.

J	Gee, H; Pickavance, JR; Young, JO				Gee, H; Pickavance, JR; Young, JO			A comparative study of the population biology of the American immigrant triclad Dugesia tigrina (Girard) in two British lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The population biology of the American immigrant triclad Dugesia tigrina was investigated in two British eutrophic lakes: Colemere, England, harbours an asexually reproducing population and Llyn Coron, North Wales, a population that reproduces both sexually and asexually. Monthly samples of triclads were taken from the undersides of stones in both lakes, and from ceramic tiles and plastic trays in Colemere and Llyn Coron, respectively, over two years. In both populations, body size-structure decreased slightly over winter, with an absence of very large and very small animals. Individual growth occurred in spring, and over summer the proportion of large and small individuals declined and increased, respectively. During September to November, size-structure was fairly stable. Increases in the size structure of the populations were associated with higher temperatures and an increased food supply; stability in size structure during the autumnal postreproductive period, when temperatures were favourable for growth, to the occurrence of intraspecific competition for food; and decreases in size structure to lower temperatures during the winter. In both populations the density of triclads increased in summer to a peak in autumn, thereafter declining to a nadir in spring. The numerical peak in autumn was due to recruitment from reproduction, and the subsequent decline to deaths following the occurrence of intraspecific competition for food in late autumn, some invertebrate predation and winter mortality. Asexual reproduction (fission) started in June and finished during August in both populations. Laboratory experiments indicated that the occurrence and rate of fission is influenced by temperature and the amount of available food. The critical temperature for the initiation and cessation of fission lay between 14 and 16 OC in laboratory studies, and in the field fissioning started as temperatures approached 15 degrees C. In Llyn Coron, cocoon deposition commenced in June, peaked in July with only a very few produced in August. Triclads collected from the field outside these months could not be induced to lay cocoons in the laboratory. Laboratory experiments showed that cocoons were deposited at temperatures of 17.5, 20, and 25 degrees C, but not at 12.5 degrees C. Thus, in the held, cocoon production started when temperatures approached 15 degrees C in June, but had ceased whilst temperatures were still in excess of 15 degrees C in late August. Termination of cocoon dsposition is associated with the disappearance of large triclads in excess of 20 mm(2), below which animals are not sexually mature; disappearance of large animals was due to fissioning, death after sexual reproduction, and probably shrinkage due to severe intraspecific competition for food. Laboratory experiments indicated that the Colemere population had, potentially, greater fission production than the Llyn Coron population. Despite this, the numerical size of the Colemere and Llyn Coron populations increased seven-fold and eleven-fold, respectively, over the reproductive period. Whether or not this difference in reproductive potential between the populations will continue is speculative; the introduction of D. tigrina to Llyn Coron is relatively recent and the population may still be expanding to reach the carrying capacity of the habitat. Its high reproductive output must have helped its successful invasion of the lake.																			0018-8158						1998	361						135	143																WOS:000073655800012

Characteristics of dissolved organic matter in the inflows and in the outflow of Lake Vortsjarv, Estonia	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												UV-Vis spectroscopy was applied to characterize the nature of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the inflows and in the outflow of the large and shallow temperate Lake Vortsjarv and to determine its temporal and spatial dynamics in 2008-2010. The concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was influenced by water temperature, precipitation, stream gradient, discharge, and percentage of peatland in the catchment area and its mean annual values by rivers varied from 9.2 to 27.7 mg L-1. Higher DOC values in the outflow in summer/autumn corresponded to periods of intensive phytoplankton development whereas lower values were observed in winter or early spring when biological processes are at a standstill. The results of specific ultraviolet absorption at 254 nm (SUVA(254)) and 285 nm (SUVA(285)) showed domination of fulvic acids in the rivers. According to our spectroscopic results, the aromaticity of DOM increased with the increasing percentage of peatland and forest and with the decreasing percentage of arable land in the river catchments.

In this study, we use pollen assemblages from a high elevation lake (3780 m.a.s.l.) in the Gongga Mountains on the southeast margin of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China, to study changes in altitudinal vegetation zones during the last 12,000 years. The relationships between vegetation belts and winter and summer climate parameters are analyzed. Results indicate that winter temperature mainly controlled the development of evergreen broadleaved forest (Cyclobalanopsis and Taxodiaceae), deciduous broadleaved forest (Betula), and sub-alpine shrubland (Rosaceae, Cyperaceae and Gramineae dominated). In contrast, the development of temperate coniferous forest (Pines and Tsuga) and alpine herbfield (Artemisia and Chenopodiaceae) was mainly controlled by summer temperature and precipitation. Results show that winter temperature gradually increased from the Greenlandian to Meghalayan, indicating that the main driving factor was winter solar insolation in the Northern Hemisphere. Meanwhile, changes in summer temperature and precipitation are consistent with the results from Indian monsoon-dominated areas of China, suggesting that the summer climate in this region is mainly driven by the migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Our findings suggest that the influence of seasonal climate changes should be considered on the evolution of montane vegetation belts.					; sun, weiwei/GQA-5041-2022; Chang, Jie/R-2763-2016; Shulmeister, James/J-2859-2015; shulmeister, james/J-2859-2015	Ni, Zhenyu/0000-0002-5362-3936; shulmeister, james/0000-0001-5863-9462													0031-0182	1872-616X				NOV 1	2019	533								109232	10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.06.005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.06.005													WOS:000487174100007

The characteristics, sources and influencing factors of riverine CDOM were determined with 56 samples collected in the Wuding River (WDR) Basin in spring and summer. The CDOM optical characteristics varied greatly during different seasons. The mean S275-295 was higher in spring than in summer, while SUVA254 exhibited the opposite result. The mean biological source index (BIX) was lower in summer than in spring, while the mean humification index (HIX) was higher in summer than in spring (p < 0.01). C1 and C3 (humic-like components) and C2 (tryptophan-like component) were extracted by parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). C1 and C3 were prominent in summer, while C2 was prominent in spring. The effects of environmental factors on CDOM showed great differences. Chlorophyll a (Chla), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), electrical conductivity (EC) and dissolved oxygen (DO) had significant effects on the CDOM concentration (p < 0.05) in spring, while only DOC exerted significant effects on the CDOM concentration in summer. However, water quality parameters played important roles in evaluating the CDOM fluorescence components in summer. Total suspended matter (TSM) and turbidity (Tur) exerted significant effects on the humic-like fluorescence peaks (p < 0.05), while pH, Chla, DO, and EC had significant influences on tryptophan-like substances during this period. Based on redundancy analysis, precipitation, water erosion area and human activity intensity greatly affected the CDOM concentra-tion, C1 and C3, while human activity intensity significantly affected C2 in the sub-basins in summer. CDOM was not significantly influenced by the surrounding environmental factors in spring except for the human activity intensity, which greatly influenced C1 and C3.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				APR	2023	148								110080	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110080	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110080		MAR 2023											WOS:000961896200001

The results show that the spring precipitation over southern China has experienced an obvious change from an active to a quiet period since the late 1980s. The entire data set is divided into two subperiods, that is, 1972-1987 (P1) and 1988-2009 (P2). The interannual variation of the spring precipitation of southern China is found to be significantly related to Eurasian SCE anomalies around northwest of Lake Baikal. Less-than-normal SCE northwest of Lake Baikal corresponds to more-than-normal spring precipitation over southern China. The result of a numerical experiment performed using a baroclinic atmospheric model indicates that the Eurasian snow anomalies around northwest of Lake Baikal can impact the variation of spring precipitation over southern China by modulating the atmospheric circulations over eastern Asia and the western North Pacific region. Further examination shows that the SCE anomalies around Lake Baikal contribute differently to the variation of spring precipitation over southern China before and after the late 1980s. During P1, the SCE anomalies around Lake Baikal contribute to the variation of spring precipitation over China in the form of a mono-sign pattern, which is similar to the first empirical orthogonal function mode of spring precipitation, while in P2, the SCE anomalies around Lake Baikal favor a north-south dipole mode of the spring precipitation variation, which bears considerable similarity to the second empirical orthogonal function mode of spring precipitation over China.

Effect of Seasonal Changes in Heavy Metals on the Histomorphology of the Liver and Gills of Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus L.) in Burullus Lake, Egypt	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE												THIS study aimed to assess the impact of seasonal changes on heavy metal concentrations in water and their effects on Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) liver and gill histomorphology in Burullus Lake, Egypt in 2021. Six designated points were selected for water and fish (length +/- 5cm) sampling in both summer and winter. The results indicated that Iron (f.e) had the highest overall levels across all seasons and sites, while Zinc (Zn), Lead (Pb), Copper (Cu), and Cadmium (Cd) showed variations. Notably, Pb, Cu, and Cd exhibited the widest ranges in concentration. Bioaccumulation of heavy metals in O. niloticus muscles revealed that Zinc concentrations were significantly highest in summer and winter at Site 3 (p < 0.05), while Iron levels were significantly highest in winter and lowest in summer (p < 0.05). Cadmium content varied, and lead concentrations remained low level. Histomorphological analysis of Nile tilapia liver and gills showed significant differences between summer and winter months. In summer, the liver exhibited severe hepatocyte degeneration, pancreatic blood vessel congestion, and pancreatic acinar cell degeneration, affecting liver development stages. Winter liver histomorphology was comparatively better than summer but showed some signs of central vein congestion, mononuclear cell infiltration, vacuolar degeneration, hypertrophy, and pancreatic acinar cell degeneration. Gill histomorphology in summer showed mild to severe congestion, hyperplasia, desquamation, edema, fusion, and degenerative changes, while winter gills displayed mild degeneration in secondary lamellae, hyperplasia of the epithelial lining, congested branchial blood vessels, and interstitial edema. Conclusively, these findings highlight the impact of seasonal changes on the health of Nile tilapia, with more severe consequences observed during the summer months.

Historical trends and extremes in boreal Alaska river basins	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Climate change will shift the frequency, intensity, duration and persistence of extreme hydroclimate events and have particularly disastrous consequences in vulnerable systems such as the warm permafrost-dominated Interior region of boreal Alaska. This work focuses on recent research results from nonparametric trends and nonstationary generalized extreme value (GEV) analyses at eight Interior Alaskan river basins for the past 50/60 years (1954/64-2013). Trends analysis of maximum and minimum streamflow indicates a strong (>+50%) and statistically significant increase in 11-day flow events during the late fall/winter and during the snowmelt period (late April/mid-May), followed by a significant decrease in the 11-day flow events during the post-snowmelt period (late May and into the summer). The April-May-June seasonal trends show significant decreases in maximum streamflow for snowmelt dominated systems (<-50%) and glacially influenced basins (-24% to 33%). Annual maximum streamflow trends indicate that most systems are experiencing declines, while minimum flow trends are largely increasing. Nonstationary GEV analysis identifies time-dependent changes in the distribution of spring extremes for snowmelt dominated and glacially dominated systems. Temperature in spring influences the glacial and high elevation snowmelt systems and winter precipitation drives changes in the snowmelt dominated basins. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation was associated with changes occurring in snowmelt dominated systems, and the Arctic Oscillation was linked to one lake dominated basin, with half of the basins exhibiting no change in response to climate variability. The work indicates that broad scale studies examining trend and direction of change should employ multiple methods across various scales and consider regime dependent shifts to identify and understand changes in extreme streamflow within boreal forested watersheds of Alaska.

The water budget indicates that precipitation, discharge, runoff and evaporation dominate the water balance in seasonal succession, each associated with an appropriate minimum or maximum in the lake water storage. The annual energy budget is dominated by the net radiation and evaporation terms with 93% of the radiation input used to evaporate water. The seasonal energy budget indicates that energy storage is in phase with the radiation input and is a dominant term in the periods Nov.-Jan. and May-July; evaporation reaches a maximum value in the fall, 3 mo. after the radiation maximum; upward transfer of sensible heat from the lake surface reaches a maximum another 3 mo. later, in the winter; and the sensible heat flux is downward in late spring and early summer, indicating stable stratification in the atmospheric surface layer over the lake during this period. This is a result of possible significance to air quality in the Tahoe basin. The energy storage and sensible heat transfer terms show large fluctuations in the fall which may be associated with large-scale meteorological events during a season in which energy is trapped in the surface waters by stable stratification in the thermocline layer.																			0043-1397	1944-7973					1979	15	6					1499	1508		10.1029/WR015i006p01499	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/WR015i006p01499													WOS:A1979JC38700024

Tuz Lake, the second biggest lake in Turkiye, is a talassohaline (over 32% [w/v]) lake with near-neutral pH. The aim of study was to investigate the composition of the eukaryotic microbial community in Tuz Lake by 18S rDNA amplicon sequencing, as well as its relationship and change with environmental factors during 1-year period. Next-generation sequencing and bioinformatic analysis were applied to describe the eukaryotic microbial community in Tuz Lake. As a result of bioinformatics analysis, Archaeplastida (39%) and Stramenopiles, Alveolata, Rhizaria (SAR) (51%) were the most abundant taxa represented in the dataset. The Archaeplastida phylum showed a significant difference between winter and summer and higher abundance in summer in contrast to the SAR group, which represented higher abundance in winter. Genus level assessment showed that the most abundant genera were Navicula, Chlorophyta;unclassified_taxa, Dunaliella, Cladosporium, Paraphelidium, Scuticociliates;unclassified_taxa, and Chlamydomonadales;unclassified_taxa. Navicula abundance was significantly different and overwhelmingly dominant in winter. On the other hand, Cladosporium and Chlorophyta; unclassified_taxa represented a significant difference between seasons and high abundance in summer. Furthermore, Dunaliella populations were not detected in midsummer and early fall when the temperature increased and water volume in the lake decreased.

J	GOLDMAN, CR; WETZEL, RG				GOLDMAN, CR; WETZEL, RG			A STUDY OF PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY OF CLEAR LAKE LAKE COUNTY, CALIFORNIA	ECOLOGY												Photosynthetic carbon fixation by phytoplankton was measured with C14 during 1959 and 1960 as part of a limnological study. The annual mean primary productivity of the lake was 0.44 g C/m2/day, ranging from 0.002 in February to 2.44 g C/m2/day in October. The annual productivity of the lake was 1597.8 kg C/hectare. These values are probably underestimated because of the stationary position of samples during incubation. Seasonal variations in transparency, temperature, water chemistry, light intensity, and rainfall are considered in relation to productivity. Alkalinity and pH showed a positive relationship to productivity and an inverse one to turbidity and rainfall. Relative contribution to the total carbon fixation by "ultra-plankton" (<5-10 [mu]) was determined. In the summer and fall most of the productivity in the surface layers was by plankton >5-10 [mu], whereas smaller forms dominated in deeper water during all seasons and in the surface layers during winter and spring. Of the macro- and micro-nutrients tested only nitrate and sulfate stimulated photosynthesis.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1963	44	2					283	+		10.2307/1932175	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1932175													WOS:A1963P326000010

The concentration of soluble unreactive P in sediment pore water (SUPpore) was significantly higher in winter than in summer, whereas the concentration of soluble reactive P (SRPpore) was significantly higher in summer than in winter. In summer, when the concentration of SRPpore was high, the concentration of orthophosphate was greatest (similar to 80 %) among the P compound groups. The concentration of orthophosphate diesters had a significant negative correlation with SUPpore concentration and was significantly lower in winter (high SUPpore concentration) than in summer. Such relative abundance of P compound groups in sediment could have resulted from adsorption of orthophosphate in summer and degradation of orthophosphate diesters in winter; these seasonal processes could contribute significantly to the changes in the concentrations of SRPpore and SUPpore, possibly influencing the P concentrations in the water column in Lake Kasumigaura.

J	OKLAND, KA				OKLAND, KA			LIFE-HISTORY AND GROWTH OF ASELLUS-AQUATICUS (L) IN RELATION TO ENVIRONMENT IN A EUTROPHIC LAKE IN NORWAY	HYDROBIOLOGIA												A new life history pattern for A. aquaticus is described from Lake Ostensjovatn in Oslo. Overwintering specimens (generation A) breed in spring. The next generation (B) matures, breeds and dies in 1st summer, giving rise to the overwintering generation C, which breeds next spring and dies. The death of generation B in its 1st summer could be shown by a study of oostegit development in the females. The end of the breeding season in autumn is thus accomplished by a complete replacement of generations. This pattern can be light stimulated, or a pre-determined cycle, uninfluenced by environmental factors. Breeding starts in spring when water temperature reaches about 7-8.degree. C. Estimated incubation time was 23-35 days, corresponding to about 300 degree-days above 4.degree. C. No growth took place from Nov. to March-April. Growth started when water temperature reached 3-5.degree. C. Growth increments per degree-day above 3.degree. C were the same for the 3 generations followed, in spite of their different life spans and different temperatures. The total number of degree-days above 3.degree. C available to the generations seemed to regulate the maximum length of the specimens in the respective generations. Comparison with life histories of the species in other lakes suggests that the different patterns described reflect an evolutionary adaptation to major environmental factors.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1978	59	3					243	259		10.1007/BF00036504	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00036504													WOS:A1978FE58300012

However, non-standard hydroacoustic surveys could lead to biased results, and the factor of the sampling period (e.g., season and diel cycle) is extremely critical as it can greatly affect hydroacoustic results. Efforts to improve the accuracy and credibility of the hydroacoustic survey results are getting more and more attention. Thus, we conducted two diel hydroacoustic surveys in situ in summer and winter to detect whether there were diel and seasonal differences in density, Target Strength (TS) and vertical distribution of fish. The results indicated that nighttime had significantly higher fish mean density than daytime in summer and winter. No significant difference between summer and winter daytime, however, significant difference between summer and winter nighttime, but this bias could be accepted from the fisheries management perspective; The mean TS of the summer daytime was significantly higher than that of summer nighttime, winter daytime and winter nighttime, but there were no significant differences among summer nighttime, winter daytime, and winter nighttime, mainly due to mean TS may be overestimated from fish schooling behavior during summer daytime; The fish vertical distribution had significant seasonal correlations and was more dispersed in different water layers during the nighttime, proving that the assessment was better at nighttime than during the daytime. Consequently, the hydroacoustic surveys in Yudong Reservoir and other similar plateau deep water reservoirs should be performed at nighttime, which will yield relatively accurate density and TS, and dispersed vertical distribution of fish.

A hundred and eight samples were collected from 36 sampling sites and analyzed for the 31 PCB and 10 PBDE congeners. Concentrations of both PCBs and PBDEs showed obvious seasonal variations. The average PCB concentrations in the East Lake ranged from 3.17 to 6.09 ng L-1 in winter and 0.19 to 0.99 ng L-1 in summer. CB-44, 105, 118 and 179 were dominant in both winter and summer. The average PBDE concentrations in the East Lake ranged from 2.92 to 5.54 ng L-1 in winter and 0.67 to 1.51 ng L-1 in summer. BDE-47 was predominant in both winter and summer, which accounted for more than 37% of the total PBDEs concentration from all sampling sites. Independent-Samples t-test showed statistical significance of Sigma PCBs and Sigma PBDEs between winter and summer samples. The analysis of distribution, pattern and seasonal variations indicated the different potential sources of PCBs and PBDEs in the East Lake. The potential eco-toxicological risk was also discussed in the study. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

At both stations, lowest prevalences and densities of the cestode were observed during summer months. Densities rose sharply in the fall and peaked by early winter, after which they began to decline. Recruitment of the parasite at each site was also seasonal, beginning in late spring and continuing into Oct. of both years of the study. Recruitment at the thermally altered site began .apprx. 2 wk sooner, lasted .apprx. 2 wk longer, and was interrupted for several weeks in late summer when water temperatures exceeded 35.degree. C. Using a special sampling program, prevalence and density of B. acheilognathi were estimated for the overall mosquitofish population; estimated values closely approximated observed values. The seasonal changes in prevalence, density, and recruitment coincided with temperature changes. Population dynamics were also apparently related to foraging strategies and prey availability, which varied seasonally and among size classes. Release from predation pressure allowed mosquitofish to expand their lateral spatial distribution. Mosquitofish exposed to copepods collected from limnetic areas of the reservoir became infected, suggesting that the spatial distribution of copepod intermediate hosts is not a factor in affecting the population biology of the cestode in Belews Lake.																			0018-0130						1983	50	2					205	218																WOS:A1983RH40400001
J	Hegg, A; Radersma, R; Uller, T				Hegg, Alexander; Radersma, Reinder; Uller, Tobias			Seasonal variation in the response to a toxin-producing cyanobacteria in Daphnia	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Many populations of water fleas (Daphnia) are exposed to algal blooms dominated by microcystin-producing cyanobacteria. However, the severity of these effects on Daphnia fitness remain poorly understood in natural populations. We investigated seasonal changes in body size, reproduction and survival of D. longispina individuals from five eutrophic lakes in southern Sweden. We tested whether individuals collected before, during or following algal blooms differed in their reproduction and survival when experimentally exposed to microcystin-producing cyanobacteria. The concentration of microcystin in the lakes was significantly higher during summer and autumn compared to spring, but there were substantial differences between lakes. The reproductive output of individuals declined consistently over the season, and this decline was stronger for Daphnia collected during periods of, or from lakes with, high microcystin concentration. There was little evidence that individuals adapted to the toxin over the season. The strong seasonal changes in body size, reproduction and survival in these D. longispina appear to be caused partly by variation in the abundance of toxin-producing cyanobacteria. Populations were unable to adapt sufficiently quickly during summer and autumn to recover from the negative effects of microcystin. We therefore suggest that seasonal increases in tolerance to microcystin-producing cyanobacteria have limited effects on the eco-evolutionary dynamics between Daphnia and phytoplankton.

Intensive fish tracking conducted from June to August 1978 produced 1178 contacts, the basis for summer home range determinations. Eight fish established summer home ranges by the time surface water temperatures rose above 17.degree. C in mid-June, and by early July all fish exhibited home range behavior. Individual summer home ranges were 39 to 443 ha (mean = 146 ha) in area as determined by the minimum convex polygon method, and 27 to 73 ha (mean = 63 ha) as estimated by the grid-square method. Six fish had home ranges comprised of two distinct activity centers, 2.0 to 3.5 km apart. Some home ranges spatially overlapped, but occurrences of two fish at a common location were rare. In autumn, six of eight surviving fish remained within or near their summer home ranges. Observations on these eight fish during spring and summer 1979 provided evidence of reproductive and nonreproductive homing behavior.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				AUG 30	1986	16	4					243	255		10.1007/BF00842978	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00842978													WOS:A1986D965100003

The environmental factors were different in the two seasons, as seen when using one-way ANOVA testing, principal component analysis, and cluster analysis. The temperature and levels of dissolved oxygen and soluble solids were higher in autumn, and the ammonia (NH4-N) level was much higher in spring (4.66 +/- 0.97 mu mol/L), which led to a higher concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen in the northeast area. A total of 118 species of phytoplankton were found, with 47 common species in both seasons and more species in spring. Bacillariophyta (diatom) contributed to over 80% of the relative abundance in both seasons. The species of Chrysophyta and Xanthophyta were endemic species in autumn and spring, respectively. Skeletonema costatum and Chaetoceros curvisetus were the common dominant species, with nine dominant species in both seasons. Higher abundance and biodiversity of phytoplankton appeared in spring, and their differences were mostly determined by NH4-N level, hydrodynamic conditions and artificial activities in the coastal area in the Qiongzhou Strait.

However, there are still relatively few data describing the winter season patterns in detail, as the focus has been mostly on spring to autumn conditions. Ice cover is often the crucial factor limiting light availability for winter phytoplankton, but in warm monomictic lakes is usually lacking and the gradually increasing solar radiation should, theoretically, drive phytoplankton growth. In this study conducted in 2002-2010, we documented regular sharp increases in phytoplankton chlorophyll a, starting just after the winter solstice and lasting throughout the total circulation and/or unstable inverse stratification period in the mono-mictic Slapy reservoir (Czechia). Chlorophyll a concentrations analysed in one-week intervals reached their yearly minimum of 0.2-0.8 mu g L-1 in the solstice period, and the spring peak occurred before the onset of stable thermal stratification. The regular pattern was slightly disrupted in some years, associated with short periods of ice cover. Winter phytoplankton were species poor and dominated by diatoms, cryptophytes, green algae, and cyanobacteria. Using semiparametric regression approach, we aimed to test if selected environmental parameters had a significant effect on the observed winter trend. The resulting model revealed that solar radiation and water temperature positively influenced log chlorophyll a concentrations, whereas water age had a significant negative effect. On the other hand, zooplankton density and ice cover effects were not significant. The shapes of the marginal effects of water temperature and solar radiation were nonlinear, and the interaction of these two major factors was significant. The model-based estimated chlorophyll a concentrations showed a shift from radiation dominance to temperature-positive effects along the temperature gradient. This might represent as yet neglected pattern of phytoplankton seasonal development in warm monomictic lakes worldwide.

Climate change effects on hydroecology of Arctic freshwater ecosystems	AMBIO												In general, the arctic freshwater-terrestrial system will warm more rapidly than the global average, particularly during the autumn and winter season. The decline or loss of many cryospheric components and a shift from a nival to an increasingly pluvial system will produce numerous physical effects on freshwater ecosystems. Of particular note will be reductions in the dominance of the spring freshet and changes in the intensity of river-ice breakup. Increased evaporation/evapotranspiration due to longer ice-free seasons, higher air/water temperatures and greater transpiring vegetation along with increase infiltration because of permafrost thaw will decrease surface water levels and coverage. Loss of ice and permafrost, increased water temperatures and vegetation shifts will alter water chemistry, the general result being an increase in lotic and lentic productivity. Changes in ice and water flow/levels will lead to regime-specific increases and decreases in habitat availability/quality across the circumpolar Arctic.

There is rising concern among the Cree about changes in inland ice conditions as they pose challenges to Cree livelihood, health and culture. Here we contrast Crees' observations of inland ice conditions and long-term measurements obtained to foster interdisciplinary climate change research between scientists and Cree communities. We compiled qualitative observations of inland ice conditions and compared them with long-term measurements (> 25 years) of air temperature, precipitation and snow depth from three meteorological stations in the Cree territory. Cree hunters observed a weakening of lake ice cover (e.g., change in ice composition and structure, increased rain in winter). Trend analysis of long-term measurements showed a significant increase in mean autumn air temperature as well as in winter and autumn precipitation. By contrasting Cree hunters' observations with climate data, we identified that an increase in fall and winter precipitation could be causing a weakening of inland ice through a change in its composition (i.e., snow ice instead of congelation ice). We conclude that Cree and scientific knowledge are complementary when investigating and understanding climate change in the Subarctic.

Liver energy reserves were highest in spring and decreased during summer, with greater LSI values at natural reefs in spring. While female red snapper LSI was greater than males at the natural reefs, indicating a larger energetic investment for spawning, it did not differ between males and females at the artificial reefs. Females at natural reefs have the ability to invest more energy in reproduction than females at artificial reefs, which is reflected in larger female LSI values at the natural reefs. Caloric density was highest in winter and decreased through fall at the natural reefs, with the opposite trend observed at artificial reefs. Muscle energy reserves are likely utilized for gonad development, while stored liver energy is utilized during and after spawning. Female red snapper at natural reefs can exhibit greater energy reserves, and thus a higher energetic condition than females at artificial reefs. Recognizing that energetic condition differs between habitats could enhance future red snapper stock assessments.

During the autumn and winter of 1998, the migration of six adult loons that were radio marked in northern Wisconsin and Minnesota was monitored. The results of this work offer insight into autumn movement patterns of Common Loons. Timing of autumn staging and migration to wintering grounds appeared to be related to low pressure systems that delivered winter weather to the Upper Midwest. Most of the radiomarked birds staged on the Great Lakes and then followed one of two distinct migration routes to the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coasts. Several of the birds used lakes and reservoirs in the southeastern United States during migration. This study provides a basis for more extensive studies of Common Loon migration.

Because of warming within the thermal bar zone, the spring succession at the northshore station was early relative to the midlake station, but after stratification the northshore station lagged behind due to frequent upwelling events. Thermal bar formation along the south shore was followed by downwelling throughout the summer, giving a deeper epilimnion. These events may have contributed to not only the greater biomass at this location, but also succession which preceded that at the other stations during summer and fall. The species composition and the timing of the summer succession were very similar to those reported for 1970. Lake Ontario zooplankton did not change markedly in response to changes in nutrient loading and salmonid predators during the 1970''s.

J	Hadas, O; Altabet, MA; Agnihotri, R				Hadas, Ora; Altabet, Mark A.; Agnihotri, Rajesh			Seasonally varying nitrogen isotope biogeochemistry of particulate organic matter in Lake Kinneret, Israel	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Large temporal variations in the nitrogen isotopic composition (delta N-15) of particulate organic matter (POM) and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) species in Lake Kinneret occurred in response to seasonal phasing of dominant nitrogen cycle processes. The lowest delta N-15 POM values (-5.5 parts per thousand) were observed in early winter, a consequence of isotopic fractionation by chemoautotrophic microbial NH4+ assimilation, and during the first phase of the nitrification period, by seasonally dominant NH4+ oxidizers. Nitrification itself was strongly fractionating, producing N-15-depleted NO3- and strongly enriching water-column NH4+ in N-15. Toward the end of nitrification and into the phytoplankton bloom period in later winter and early spring, there was a corresponding 15-30 parts per thousand jump in POM delta N-15 because of assimilation of high-delta N-15 NH4+. Maximal delta N-15 POM values were thus measured during the algal blooms of Peridinium gatunense in 2004 and Debarya sp. and Microcystis sp. in 2005. Toward the end of the blooms in mid- to late spring, POM delta N-15 values decreased to values similar to delta N-15 for NO3- (8-12 parts per thousand), indicating a switch to this DIN source. NO3- assimilation into POM appeared to occur without isotopic fractionation. Late spring was also the denitrification period with NO3- removal in the newly suboxic hypolimnion. Though delta(NO3-)-N-15 increased in the residual NO3-, complete consumption by denitrification suggests no net effect, as supported by a lack of increase in delta N-15 POM at this time. Oligotrophic conditions are found in the epilimnion in late summer and early autumn and low (3.3 parts per thousand) delta N-15 POM was found during the bloom of the filamentous N-2-fixing cyanobacteria Aphanizomenon ovalisporum and Cylindrospermopsis cuspis. The delta N-15-dissolved organic nitrogen isotopic signature at this time was significantly higher, 8-12 parts per thousand, suggesting a phytoplankton source from earlier in the seasonal cycle. Overall, the largest known seasonal variations in N isotope composition have been observed in Lake Kinneret, providing a uniquely useful biogeochemical tool for studying N cycling in lakes as well as detecting long-term changes in N source and cycling in response to watershed land use changes and climate change.

Spatial and seasonal variability in trophic relationships and carbon sources of two key invertebrate species in Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Mysids (Mysis diluviana) and dreissenids (Dreissena polymorpha and mostly D. bugensis) are important invertebrate taxa in the food webs of the Laurentian Great Lakes but there are uncertainties about the seasonal and spatial variability in their stable isotope signatures. We quantified delta 13C and delta 15N in 304 mysid and 366 dreissenid samples across five spatial ecoregions, varying site depth, and three seasons (spring, summer, and fall) in Lake Ontario in 2012 and 2013. Particulate organic matter (POM) was also collected across site depth and season from the Deep Hole ecoregion for use as an isotopic baseline. Lipid normalization models for delta 13C were generated for both taxa to reduce lipid bias in our statistical analysis. Season was a significant predictor of POM stable isotopes, with delta 13C lower in the summer and delta 15N decreasing from spring to summer before increasing into fall. Mysid lipid normalized delta 13C varied by site depth and ecoregion while delta 15N decreased across season and did not vary by site depth or ecoregion. Dreissenid stable isotopes varied significantly across season, depth, and ecoregion, with site depth having positive relationship with delta 15N. Mysids and dreissenids were two trophic positions higher than POM based on delta 15N; this comparison was restricted to the one region where POM was collected. Isotopic variability suggested selective feeding within POM and differing trophic pathways between mysids and dreissenids. Collecting an appropriate taxon across all observed variables to serve as an isotopic baseline, particularly in spatial and temporal studies, is critical to the correct interpretation of trophic relationships.

J	Casagranda, C; Dridi, MS; Boudouresque, CF				Casagranda, C; Dridi, MS; Boudouresque, CF			Abundance, population structure and production of macro-invertebrate shredders in a Mediterranean brackish lagoon, Lake Ichkeul, Tunisia	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Abundance, population structure and production of the macro-invertebrates belonging to the functional feeding group of the shredders were studied in the Ichkeul wetland, northern Tunisia, from July 1993 to April 1994. Mean above-ground macrophyte biomass was at a maximum in September followed by a complete breakdown of the Potamogeton pectinatus L. meadow from October onward due to high salinity following an exceptionally dry winter. Only the meadow of Ruppia cirrhosa (Petagna) Grande at Tinja remained in place. Abundance of Gammarus aequicauda (Martynov 1931), Idotea chelipes (Pallas 1766) and Sphaeroma hookeri Leach 1814 was significantly related to the R. cirrhosa biomass. Gammarus aequicauda presented two recruitment periods in spring and autumn, and S. hookeri a third one in winter. The population of I. chelipes was renewed during winter by continued reproduction without any spring generation. Recruitment of all three species was not very successful during the study period. Life span of all three species was between 12 and 15 months. Despite their relatively low biomass and production rate, the shredders have a key function in processing macrophyte matter to different trophic levels through fragmentation and accelerating the decomposition of macrophyte biomass accumulated at the end of the growth season in the Ichkeul lagoon.

Statistical analysis of the data only revealed a few consistent relationships between these variables. The phytoplankton biomass was correlated with chlorophyll a only in the summer and fall as was primary production with chlorophyll a and biomass. There was no correlation between these 3 variables during the spring. There was also no consistent relationship between biomass and soluble nutrients. The primary production and activity coefficient (mg Cassimilated per milligram phytoplankton biomass per day) were unrelated to temperature. Factor analysis showed that in the spring, primary production correlated with the P and N soluble nutrients only, whereas during summer, primary production correlated with biomass, chlorophyll a, the major plankton groups (Cyanophyta, Chlorophyta, Chrysomonadinae and Diatomeae) and the P nutrients. In the fall, production was positively correlated with phytoplankton biomass and with the Chlorophyta in particular. The use of chlorophyll a and temperature as variables in the equation to estimate phytoplankton growth in Lake Erie was questionable.																									1976	33	3					601	611		10.1139/f76-076	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f76-076													WOS:A1976BJ94800019

The aim was to investigate the interaction between the community features of macroinvertebrates and bryophyte cover associated with the selective retention and accumulation of particulate organic matter affected by different water flow conditions. In the tufa barrage habitats, depending on current velocity, bryophyte biomass varied seasonally from 55 g AFDW m(-2) to 256 g AFDW m(-2). Bryophyte biomass decreased in the tufa habitats exposed to higher current velocity. In the temporal succession from spring to autumn bryophyte biomass decreased, whereas in winter the biomass increased in all studied rheotopes. Regression analysis suggested that the bryophyte biomass significantly decreased linearly with an increase in current velocity. The bryophyte mats, which retained coarse (CPOM), fine (FPOM) and ultra fine (UPOM) benthic particulate organic matter as a food source for the detritial benthic macroconsumers, were significantly related to current velocity. CPOM and FPOM content of the bryophyte mats showed a tendency to increase in habitats with a lower current velocity. Conversely, UPOM content increased in bryophyte habitats with a higher current velocity. Regression analysis suggested that CPOM and FPOM increased whereas UPOM decreased significantly in habitats with a greater bryophyte biomass. In bryophyte habitats the community composition of macroinvertebrates was characterized by small forms of oligochaetes, dipterans and coleopterans constituting from 64.1% to 98.7% of the total number of macroinvertebrate individuals. Regression analysis suggested that macroinvertebrate density increased in faster water flow conditions associated with a decrease in bryophyte biomass, CPOM and FPOM, and an increase of UPOM. Macro invertebrate community composition and species diversity showed significant differences among the four seasons and four water flow conditions associated with selective retention and accumulation of POM. In bryophyte habitats macro invertebrate functional feeding composition was characterized by collector fauna increasing their density with faster water flow conditions. In spring and summer collector-gatherers were dominant whereas collector-filterers dominated in autumn and scrapers showed a maximum in winter. Regression analysis, using the power model (y = ax(b)), suggested that densities of collectors and predators showed a positive relationship with the quantity of their food sources.

J	Sen, B				Sen, Bulent			The seasonal periodicity of the diatom Asterionella formosa Hassall in a moderately eutrophic lake	NOVA HEDWIGIA												Asterionella formosa Hassall, was a conspicuous member of the phytoplankton, with a distinct seasonal cycle, in a moderately eutrophic lake (Shearwater, England). It was present on most occasions. The coldest and the stet illuminated periods were favourable for the growth of this alga. There were two maxima (late winter/spring [the largest and sometimes under ice] and spring/summer). Dissolved silica supported growth until the vernal maximum was achieved but the influence of phosphate was complex. The size of the vernal maxunum was correlated with nitrate availability suggesting that nitrate did not limit growth. The number of cells per colony increased with the vernal development of Asterionella and reached a peak at the vernal maximum.

J	Hambright, KD; Blumenshine, SC; Shapiro, J				Hambright, KD; Blumenshine, SC; Shapiro, J			Can filter-feeding fishes improve water quality in lakes?	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. In this paper we examine the potential of a cichlid fish species (Sarotherodon galilaeus ) to both maintain positive growth rates through filter-feeding on phytoplankton and improve water quality in Lake Kinneret through suppression of dinoflagellate (Peridinium gatunense ) blooms. 2. Seasonal plankton consumption by S. galilaeus from Lake Kinneret was examined experimentally by monitoring changes in plankton assemblages during 24 h in 5-m(3) mesocosms containing varying densities of fish. Taxon-specific grazing rates ranged from 0 to 17 mg g(fish) day(-1), with mean total consumption of 1.6% fish body weight per day. During the spring bloom of P. gatunense, S. galilaeus consumed mostly (94%) netphytoplankton (greater than or equal to20 mum). The remaining 6% consisted mostly of nanophytoplankton (<20 μm). During the summer and fall, net- and nanophytoplankton accounted for 54 and 42%, respectively, of the diet of S. galilaeus . Zooplankton and flagellated and ciliated protozoans made up the remaining 4%. 3. Simulations using a fish bioenergetics model indicated that consumption rates (C) were near maximum in spring (90%C-max), while consumption was reduced in summer-fall (59%C-max). Sarotherodon galilaeus obtains sufficient energy through filter-feeding year-round, although most growth (≥60%) occurs during the spring P. gatunense bloom. 4. Despite efficient feeding on P. gatunense and nanophytoplankton by S. galilaeus , estimates of instantaneous plankton mortality caused by ingestion were two orders of magnitude lower than maximum potential plankton growth rates. Thus the potential for the S. galilaeus population in Lake Kinneret to positively affect water quality through algal suppression is low.					; Goren, Menachem/GQZ-3762-2022; Hambright, Karl/D-4086-2012	Blumenshine, Steve/0000-0003-4975-4500; Hambright, K.

The highest concentration of PFASs in water (207.59 ng L-1) was found in summer. The composition of PFASs in water changed with time, perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) was the predominant compound in spring and summer, while long-chain PFASs, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), started to increase in autumn and winter. The PFASs concentration in sediments ranged from 0.96 to 4.05 ng g(-1) dw. The proportion of long-chain PFASs was higher than that of short-chain PFASs in sediments, the dominant component in sediments was PFOA with a contribution of 24.6-75.4% to total PFASs in sediments, followed by PFOS. The concentrations of PFASs in roots of emergent plants were relatively higher than those in submerged plants. However, the translocation effect of PFASs was not remarkable. Bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) of the aquatic plants indicated the absorption of PFASs were effective. BAFs in submerged plants basically increased with increasing chain length accordingly. In general, aquatic plants had the absorption preference for long-chain PFASs, especially PFOS, which was the predominant compounds in both submerged and emergent plants. Based on the results above, hornworts were selected to be cultivated indoor in the nutrient solution spiked gradient concentrations of PFOS to assess the general ecological risk. The results revealed that hornworts were resistant to PFOS and might be used as remediation flora to eliminate PFOS contamination. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

One of the species adaptation strategies to survive is to change their phenology. In temperate climate, most aquatic plants show their peak of biomass in summer. In our study, we hypothesised that the rare charophyte Lychnothamnus barbatus and the partially invasive vascular plant Myriophyllum spicatum may apply a different seasonality and cause a decrease in the biodiversity of submerged macrophytes. The object of our study was a mesotrophic temperate lake in Western Poland with abundant submerged vegetation, where macrophyte seasonality was studied from November 2015 to November 2019 (autumn, spring, summer). Altogether, 29 taxa of plants were recorded, including 13 species of charophytes (40 % of the Polish charophyte flora) but only four species co-dominated, two eutrophic vascular plants, Ceratophyllum demersum and M. spicatum, and two charophytes, the rare mesotrophic L. barbatus and common Nitellopsis obtusa. M. spicatum due to its expansiveness in the shallow littoral decreased biodiversity in the study lake. Moreover, C. demersum negatively affected the endangered L. barbatus by direct competition for habitats in the lake. L. barbatus and M. spicatum dominated in vegetation in autumn while the further two species co-dominated in summer. L. barbartus and M. spicatum seem to avoid high competition in summer, which proves a high adaptive potential with respect to climate warming. However, further study in other lakes is needed to verify the relevance of our findings in terms of the conservation of rare macrophyte species.					; Pełechaty, Mariusz/HDN-8393-2022; Brzozowski, Michał/AAB-2500-2022	Pelechaty, Mariusz/0000-0002-4075-6561; 													1642-3593	2080-3397				JAN	2025	25	1					225	237		10.1016/j.ecohyd.2024.03.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecohyd.2024.03.003		JAN 2025											WOS:001414897800001

While the response of lake surface water temperatures to climate change is well documented from satellite and summer in situ measurements, our understanding of how water temperatures in large lakes are responding at depth is limited, as few large lakes have detailed long-term subsurface observations. We present an analysis of three decades of high frequency (3-hourly and hourly) subsurface water temperature data from Lake Michigan. This unique data set reveals that deep water temperatures are rising in the winter and provides precise measurements of the timing of fall overturn, the point of minimum temperature, and the duration of the winter cooling period. Relationships from the data show a shortened winter season results in higher subsurface temperatures and earlier onset of summer stratification. Shifts in the thermal regimes of large lakes will have profound impacts on the ecosystems of the world's surface freshwater. This study presents hourly data from a thermistor string in Lake Michigan, inspecting its response at depth to surface warming. Based on the data, the study suggests bottom lake temperatures respond to changes in turnover and re-stratification, with the ultimate possibility of the lake shifting from dimictic to monomictic.

J	Chigbu, P				Chigbu, P			Assessment of the potential impact of the mysid shrimp, Neomysis mercedis, on Daphnia	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Neomysis mercedis, an important invertebrate predator in some lakes and estuaries in North America, occurred at high densities (>2 mysids m(-3)) in Lake Washington in the early 1960s, a period when Daphnia were scarce in the lake. Because Neomysis feed selectively on Daphnia, it was hypothesized that mysid predation contributed significantly to the scarcity of Daphnia. To evaluate this hypothesis, mysid abundance was monitored in the lake (July 1989-February 1992), and whole lake predation impacts on Daphnia were estimated. Mysid abundance varied from 319 million, similar to0.1 mysids m(-3) (February 1992) to 4276 million, similar to1.7 mysids m(-3) ( June 1991), and mysid biomass ranged from 1153 (October 1991) to 4700 kg dry weight (November 1990). A peak in Daphnia consumption was noted during autumn, when total mysid biomass was high. In late autumn/winter mysid consumption month(-1) accounted for 28-95% of Daphnia biomass and 13-38% of production. Mysid densities in this study were 18x and 5x lower than in 1962 and 1975, respectively. By extrapolation, at a density of 3.5 mysids m(-3) observed in the early 1960s, total Neomysis consumption demand month(-1) exceeded 100% of Daphnia biomass (late autumn-early spring), and 100% of Daphnia production (late autumn-winter). Estimates of the total mysid consumption demand in this study are thus in accord with the hypothesis that Neomysis could control Daphnia abundance in Lake Washington.

However, for many surface water environments such as lakes, rivers, and reservoirs, the contribution of MPs through atmospheric deposition is unclear, partly because the methods and technologies available for particle tracing have not been adequately developed. Herein, a multi-component approach was utilized to investigate atmospheric MP sources, inputs, and depositional characteristics to Wuliangsuhai Lake located within a cold and arid climatic region. The methods that were utilized include field monitoring experiments, HYSPLIT backward trajectory modeling, bivariable polar coordinate modeling, orthogonal matrix decomposition modeling (PMF), and dry settlement numerical modeling. These methods were combined with an assessment of particle morphology and composition. The results show that the atmospheric depositional flux of MPs to Wuliangsuhai Lake varied seasonally, with spring > summer > autumn. The deposited MPs were dominated by fibers. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyethylene (PE) were the most common polymer types. Microplastic sources also varied seasonally, although fibrous MPs were consistently derived mainly from small towns or cities. The PMF model defined four MP sources, including living, transportation, agricultural, and building sources. Sedimentation modeling showed that the dry atmospheric deposition of MPs in spring, summer, and autumn within the lake was 6.75 t, 5.34 t, and 3.88 t, respectively. This study shows that atmospheric deposition importantly contributes to MPs in cold areas lakes, and wind speed and direction are among the key factors influencing the amount, sources, and morphotype of atmospheric MPs deposited in lakes.

The subglacial hydrology associated with soft -bedded glaciers is particularly poorly understood, even though numerous modern and palaeo-glaciers flow over unconsolidated sediments. We have investigated glacier dynamics at two adjacent soft-bedded Icelandic glaciers via a study of surface velocity. This included short-term changes in surface velocity using a custom-built low-cost GNSS system, as well as with Sentinel-1 velocity data. In addition, we have used PlanetScope scenes to investigate the occurrence of sediment plumes in a glacial lagoon as a proxy for meltwater discharge and modelled the hydrology associated with the lake. Our results show that at Fjallsjokull and Brei & eth;amerkurjokull West, there is a pattern of winter speed-up events associated with warmer days (termed winter events) and similar events in spring. At Brei & eth;amerkurjokull East and Central, there are fewer winter speed-up events and a distinct spring event. We suggest there are at least two different styles of soft-bedded glacier behaviour related to subglacial meltwater storage. At Fjallsjokull and Brei & eth;amerkurjokull West, we propose there is a multichannel distributed subglacial hydrological system, whereby during summer, excess meltwater is stored within the subglacial hydrological system and the till, which is partly released throughout the year resulting in speed-up events. In contrast, at Brei & eth;amerkurjokull East and Central, it is proposed there is a summer channelized drainage, caused by a combination of the presence of the deep proglacial lagoon and high meltwater flux and subglacial transmissivity. As a consequence of this, subglacial meltwater storage is limited, resulting in fewer winter speed-up events and a distinct spring event. Thus, we suggest that these different subglacial hydrological systems associated with soft-bedded glaciers can be distinguished via distinct variations in their seasonal velocity.					; Hart, Jane/J-4321-2012	Andrews, Amelia/0000-0003-4916-4279; Baurley, Nathaniel/0000-0002-0444-8721; Hart, Jane/0000-0002-2348-3944													0197-9337	1096-9837				FEB	2025	50	2							e70014	10.1002/esp.70014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/esp.70014													WOS:001416725800001

We analysed changes in energy reserves ( lipid and glycogen) and length - weight relationships of burrowing mayflies (Hexagenia spp.) in 1997 - 99 to compare an established population in Lake St Clair with a recovering population in western Lake Erie of the Laurentian Great Lakes. In addition, we measured changes in water temperature and potential food in both water columns and sediments. 2. Although overall mean values of lipid and glycogen levels of Hexagenia nymphs from Lake St Clair and western Lake Erie were not significantly different, there were differences in seasonal patterns between the two lakes. In Lake St Clair, levels were highest in early spring, declined throughout the year, and reached their lowest levels in fall during all 3 years of study. In contrast, levels in western Lake Erie were lower in spring, increased to a maximum in summer, then declined in fall. Seasonal patterns in length - weight relationships were similar to those for lipid and glycogen. 3. Total lipid as a percentage of dry weight did not increase with developmental stage of nymphs until just prior to metamorphosis and emergence from water. However, the major reserve lipid, triacylglycerols, increased systematically with development stage. In the final stage of development, triacylglycerols declined, probably as a result of energy consumption and its conversion to other biochemical components for metamorphosis and reproduction. 4. Indicators of potential food ( algal fluorescence in the water column and chlorophyll a and chlorophyll a/phaeophytin ratio in sediments) suggest that Hexagenia in Lake St Clair have a food source that is benthic based, especially in early spring, whereas in western Lake Erie nymphs have a food source that is water column based and settles to the lake bottom during late spring and summer.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				OCT	2003	48	10					1726	1738		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01119.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01119.x													WOS:000185347900002

Polar environments differ to all other cold environments by experiencing 24-h sunlight in summer and no sunlight in winter. The Vestfold Hills in East Antarctica contains hundreds of lakes that have evolved from a marine origin only 3000-7000 years ago. Ace Lake is a meromictic (stratified) lake from this region that has been intensively studied since the 1970s. Here, a total of 120 metagenomes representing a seasonal cycle and four summers spanning a 10-year period were analyzed to determine the effects of the polar light cycle on microbial-driven nutrient cycles. Results: The lake system is characterized by complex sulfur and hydrogen cycling, especially in the anoxic layers, with multiple mechanisms for the breakdown of biopolymers present throughout the water column. The two most abundant taxa are phototrophs (green sulfur bacteria and cyanobacteria) that are highly influenced by the seasonal availability of sunlight. The extent of the Chlorobium biomass thriving at the interface in summer was captured in underwater video footage. The Chlorobium abundance dropped from up to 83% in summer to 6% in winter and 1% in spring, before rebounding to high levels. PredictedChlorobiumviruses and cyanophage were also abundant, but their levels did not negatively correlate with their hosts. Conclusion: Over-wintering expeditions in Antarctica are logistically challenging, meaning insight into winter processes has been inferred from limited data. Here, we found that in contrast to chemolithoautotrophic carbon fixation potential of Southern Ocean Thaumarchaeota, this marine-derived lake evolved a reliance on photosynthesis. While viruses associated with phototrophs also have high seasonal abundance, the negative impact of viral infection on host growth appeared to be limited. The microbial community as a whole appears to have developed a capacity to generate biomass and remineralize nutrients, sufficient to sustain itself between two rounds of sunlight-driven summer-activity. In addition, this unique metagenome dataset provides considerable opportunity for future interrogation of eukaryotes and their viruses, abundant uncharacterized taxa (i.e. dark matter), and for testing hypotheses about endemic species in polar aquatic ecosystems.					; Panwar, Pratibha/JFJ-6910-2023; Eloe-Fadrosh, Emiley/AAP-8019-2021; Roux, Simon/ABE-6255-2020; Hancock, Alyce/AAX-3151-2020; Huntemann, Marcel/HCH-8928-2022; Paez-Espino, David/I-8297-2019; Woyke, Tanja/S-7870-2018; Kyrpides, Nikos/A-6305-2014; Bevington, James/JMQ-9208-2023; Cavicchioli, Ricardo/D-4341-2013; Schulz, Frederik/HOF-4050-2023	Berg, Maureen/0000-0002-0745-2742; Eloe-Fadrosh, Emiley/0000-0002-8162-1276; Huntemann, Marcel/0000-0002-1284-3748; Nayfach, Stephen/0000-0003-4625-4164; Allen, Michelle/0000-0002-8852-1454; Williams, Timothy/0000-0002-2738-3019; Woyke, Tanja/0000-0002-9485-5637; Kyrpides, Nikos/0000-0002-6131-0462; Panwar, Pratibha/0000-0002-7437-7084; Cavicchioli, Ricardo/0000-0001-8989-6402; 													2049-2618					AUG 9	2020	8	1							116	10.1186/s40168-020-00889-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40168-020-00889-8								32772914					WOS:000560886100001

Identifying the key covariates of Chl a concentrations is essential to understand the mechanisms that drive eutrophication and to develop forecasting tools that guide the restoration process. In this study, we present a novel ensemble modeling framework founded upon the complementary features of Random Forest (RF) and Generalized Additive modeling (GAMs). A series of RF models are first developed to forecast Chl a concentrations based on the antecedent values of a multitude of environmental predictors. GAMs are then used to explore the presence of non-linearities in the seasonal relationships between Chl a and the identified predictors. The optimal RF models using a 0-8 day time lag displayed high predictive skills with adjusted R2 values consistently above 0.80. Analyses of the RF models revealed that the modulating factors of Chl a display significant seasonality. Dissolved oxygen (DO) and turbidity were the key covariates of Chl a in the spring, while the water level fluctuations predominantly regulated phytoplankton biomass in the summer and winter. The occurrence and severity of algal blooms in the summer and autumn were associated with threshold levels of 0.06 and 1.50 mg/L for total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations, respectively. These results reveal the potential of the introduced modeling framework to shed light on the regulatory factors of algal biomass as well as to establish real-time predictions in the Nanji wetland waters of Poyang Lake.

The impact of the sedimentary compartment, as source and sink of essential nutrients for the water column, is often neglected in the study of their dynamics and water purification capacity of the systems. This work compared monthly (between February 2020 and April 2021) the benthic and pelagic primary producers' dynamics in two anthropised freshwater marshes (Marans and Genouille'), with the simultaneous follow-up of physico-chemical parameters of the water column and nutrient fluxes at the sediment-water (SWI) interface. It was suggested a strong contribution of phytoplankton (pumping) and the benthic compartment (denitrification) to the water purification of these two nitrates (NO3-)-rich marshes. Total phytoplankton production fluctuated between-5 (winter) and 1500 mg C m(- 3) d(-1) (fall) at Marans and between 40 (winter) and ~ 750 mg C m(- 3) d(-1) (spring) at Genouille'. At Marans, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) benthic effluxes (-2.10(1) to-6.10(2) mu mol m(- 2) d(-1) in fall and summer, respectively) coincided with phytoplankton bloom periods. These effluxes were inhibited by NO3- penetration in the sediment (0 to 5.10(4) mu mol m(- 2) d(-1)), by inhibiting iron respiration. At Genouille', inhibition of SRP effluxes depended on denitrification rate and on P stocks in the sediment, where slight SRP effluxes (-10(1) mu mol m- 2 d(-1)) could have co-occurred with slight NO(3)(- )influxes (5.10(2) mu mol m(- 2) d(-1)) in spring. The presence of PB (between 10-60 and 40-120 mg g(sed)(-1) at Marans and Genouille', respectively), suggested a strong contribution of the benthic compartment to the total primary production (benthic and pelagic through resuspension processes) in these environments. This work encourages to consider the benthos and the pelagos as a unicum to provide better sustainable management of such systems and limit eutrophication risks in coastal areas.					metzger, edouard/D-1700-2010	metzger, edouard/0000-0002-5838-4540													0043-1354	1879-2448				AUG 1	2022	221								118718	10.1016/j.watres.2022.118718	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2022.118718								35749922					WOS:000815779300001

Diel and seasonal movements of silver eels, Anguilla dieffenbachii, emigrating from a lake subject to hydro-electric control	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												To investigate the behaviour and fate of silver female longfin eels Anguilla dieffenbachii in relation to flow variations from New Zealand's largest (700 MW) hydro-electric station, 210 A. dieffenbachii were tagged with acoustic transmitters during summer and autumn over 6 years from 2005 to 2010. A shoreline array of receivers (2005-2008) was supplemented by positioning systems near the power station and natural outlet (2009-2010) that enabled continuous tracking of A. dieffenbachii within these areas. Tagged A. dieffenbachii (total length 785-1372 mm) emigrated from the lake over an 8 month period, either in the same season they were tagged (75%) or the following spring after over-wintering for up to 7 months (25%). Most A. dieffenbachii (67%) emigrated via the natural outlet. Swimming activity was related to water temperature and was greatest during the summer months. Activity was strongly diel, although less so at the outlet where A. dieffenbachii migrating at depths greater than 20 m often did so during daylight. To analyse searching behaviour, sustained periods of continuous swimming activity (termed forays) were examined in the vicinity of the outlet. Most successful forays (where the A. dieffenbachii exited the lake via the lower Waiau River) were associated with outflows; such outflows were sometimes <10 m(3) s(-1) although most successful forays took place at flows >50 m(3) s(.)(-1) The timing of successful forays was related to outflow, the day of year and whether the A. dieffenbachii had delayed migration or not, but not lunar phase or rainfall. Passage time from the lake to the lower Waiau River 81 km downstream decreased from an average of 58 days early in the season to <1 day in late autumn. The wide range of behaviours and responses displayed by female silver A. dieffenbachii were interpreted as an inherent form of bet-hedging to spread the risks associated with silvering and seaward migration in this slow-growing species.																			0022-1112	1095-8649				JUL	2017	91	1					219	241		10.1111/jfb.13335	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfb.13335								28543274					WOS:000405242900010
J	Lafleur, PM; Humphreys, ER				Lafleur, Peter M.; Humphreys, Elyn R.			Spring warming and carbon dioxide exchange over low Arctic tundra in central Canada	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Tundra-atmosphere exchanges of carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapour were measured near Daring Lake, Northwest Territories in the Canadian Low Arctic for 3 years, 2004-2006. The measurement period spanned late-winter until the end of the growing period. Mean temperatures during the measurement period varied from about 2 degrees C less than historical average in 2004 and 2005 to 2 degrees C greater in 2006. Much of the added warmth in 2006 occurred at the beginning of the study, when snow melt occurred 3 weeks earlier than in the other years. Total precipitation in 2006 (163 mm) was more than double that of the driest year, 2004 (71 mm). The tundra was a net sink for CO2 carbon in all years. Mid-summer net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) achieved maximum values of -1.3 g C m(-2) day(-1) (2004) to -1.8 g C m(-2) day(-1) (2006). Accumulated NEE values over the 109-day period were -32,-51 and -61 g C m(-2) in 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. The larger CO2 uptake in 2006 was attributed to the early spring coupled with warmer air and soil conditions. In 2004, CO2 uptake was limited by the shorter growing season and mid-summer dryness, which likely reduced ecosystem productivity. Seasonal total evapotranspiration (ET) ranged from 130 mm (2004) to 181 mm (2006) and varied in accordance with the precipitation received and with the timing of snow melt. Maximum daily ET rates ranged from 2.3 to 2.7 mm day(-1), occurring in mid July. Ecosystem water use efficiency (WUEeco) varied slightly between years, ranging from 2.2 in the driest year to 2.5 in the year with intermediate rainfall amounts. In the wettest year, increased soil evaporation may have contributed to a lower WUEeco (2.3). We speculate that most, if not all, of the modest growing season CO2 sink measured at this site could be lost due to fall and winter respiration leading to the tundra being a net CO2 source or CO2 neutral on an annual basis. However, this hypothesis is untested as yet.

Microfacies analysis and varve-based chronology reveal a variable 14C reservoir effect in Lake Shira, northern Inner Asia, over the past 2500 years	QUATERNARY SCIENCE ADVANCES												Here, we present the first fully varve-based chronology for the deposits of the deep-water Lake Shira (ChulymYenisei Basin, South Siberia), derived from a new sediment core. The very well-preserved varves show typical properties of the clastic-biogenic and endogenic types that can be subdivided into four sublayers representing winter-early spring, late spring, early summer and late summer-autumn. The analysed sediment section of 147 cm length comprises 2491 varve years with a total counting error of 1.6 % (i.e. +/- 40 years), making the new sediment core from Lake Shira a unique high-resolution archive for multi-proxy studies of past climate/environmental change and human-environment interactions. Direct comparison of nine AMS radiocarbon (14C) dates based on sediment bulk organic fractions with an age-depth model based on varve counting made it possible to examine the 14C reservoir effect in the lake. The reservoir effect is a common issue when estimating the age of environmental proxies from lacustrine sedimentary archives in Inner Asia. Although a constant reservoir effect is commonly used to correct the 14C dates from a single core or lake basin, our results from Lake Shira demonstrate that it varies significantly over the last 2500 years, ranging from 240 +/- 30 to 1045 +/- 30 years. The spatiotemporal variability of the reservoir effect can considerably reduce the accuracy of age-depth models based solely on the bulk organic sediment fraction. Where varved sediment is unavailable, as is usually the case, lignin phenols, terrestrial plant remains and purified pollen concentrates should be considered as alternative dating materials.

J	Doll, JC; Lauer, TE; Clark-Kolaks, S				Doll, Jason C.; Lauer, Thomas E.; Clark-Kolaks, Sandra			Covariates of age-0 walleye Sander vitreus fall recruitment from stocked populations in six midwestern reservoirs	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Walleye Sander vitreus are native to central North American freshwater habitats. Introductions within and outside their native range have occurred in all of the lower 48 states. These stockings have occurred due to the increasing popularity of this species, leading to the demand surpassing the supply. Despite the popularity of this species for anglers, and extensive research on the distribution, life history, population dynamics, culture, and stocking strategies, there is disparate information on first year survival of stocked populations. The objective of this study was to test for associations between biotic and abiotic variables for recruitment of age-0 fish in the fall. We tested for the influence of the number of stocking events, moronid stocking density, spring/summer warming rate, and spring/summer maximum discharge on electrofishing catch rates in the fall of age-0 walleye. We used a hierarchical generalized linear model with the Poisson distribution to evaluate these relationships. Parameters of the model were estimated using Bayesian inference. Our model suggested the number of stocking events, moronid stocking density, and maximum discharge/rainfall were the most important factors influencing walleye recruitment. Fall catch rates of age-0 walleye were positively related to stocking events, negatively related to moronid stocking density, and negatively related to maximum discharge/rainfall. However, these relationships were not concordant across all reservoirs. Further, variability we observed across reservoirs support the conclusion that walleye populations must be managed at individual reservoirs. This study will assist managers locally and regionally to determine stocking strategies for walleye to improve recruitment in midwestem reservoirs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Permafrost hydrology in changing climatic conditions: seasonal variability of stable isotope composition in rivers in discontinuous permafrost	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Role of changing climatic conditions on permafrost degradation and hydrology was investigated in the transition zone between the tundra and forest ecotones at the boundary of continuous and discontinuous permafrost of the lower Yenisei River. Three watersheds of various sizes were chosen to represent the characteristics of the regional landscape conditions. Samples of river flow, precipitation, snow cover, and permafrost ground ice were collected over the watersheds to determine isotopic composition of potential sources of water in a river flow over a two year period. Increases in air temperature over the last forty years have resulted in permafrost degradation and a decrease in the seasonal frost which is evident from soil temperature measurements, permafrost and active-layer monitoring, and analysis of satellite imagery. The lowering of the permafrost table has led to an increased storage capacity of permafrost affected soils and a higher contribution of ground water to river discharge during winter months. A progressive decrease in the thickness of the layer of seasonal freezing allows more water storage and pathways for water during the winter low period making winter discharge dependent on the timing and amount of late summer precipitation. There is a substantial seasonal variability of stable isotopic composition of river flow. Spring flooding corresponds to the isotopic composition of snow cover prior to the snowmelt. Isotopic composition of river flow during the summer period follows the variability of precipitation in smaller creeks, while the water flow of larger watersheds is influenced by the secondary evaporation of water temporarily stored in thermokarst lakes and bogs. Late summer precipitation determines the isotopic composition of texture ice within the active layer in tundra landscapes and the seasonal freezing layer in forested landscapes as well as the composition of the water flow during winter months.					; Streletskiy, Dmitry/C-3333-2017; Shiklomanov, Alexander/C-5521-2014; Opel, Thomas/O-9037-2014; Tananaev, Nikita/J-3471-2012; Tokarev, Igor/B-1474-2013; Streletskaya, Irina/L-9207-2015	Shiklomanov, NIkolay/0000-0002-8609-0240; Streletskiy, Dmitry/0000-0003-2563-2664; Shiklomanov, Alexander/0000-0001-9790-3510; Opel, Thomas/0000-0003-1315-8256; Tokarev, Igor Vladimirovich/0000-0003-1095-0731; Tananaev, Nikita/0000-0003-2997-0169; 													1748-9326					SEP	2015	10	9							095003	10.1088/1748-9326/10/9/095003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/10/9/095003													WOS:000367141000031

The hydrochemical data analysis showed that all water samples of springs and shallow wells have freshwater chemistry, Ca-HCO3 to Ca-Mg-HCO3 types. This is mainly controlled by dissolution/hydrolysis of silicate minerals. The analyzed stable isotope data indicate that springs water, except Dengel Mesk, Kurt Bahir and Bility springs, and well waters, except Dangila well, fall close to the LMWL. This clearly shows that the infiltrated rainwater did not undergo much evaporation and 8180 values for spring water and groundwater are nearly equal to the value of Ethiopian summer rainfall, which is -2.5 parts per thousand. Therefore, generally both stable isotope and hydrochemical data show the recharge source to springs and shallow groundwater is primarily from precipitation. Furthermore, data suggest that rock-water interaction has remained relatively limited, pointing to relatively short residence times, and local recharge rather than regional recharge.

J	Huang, W; Chen, X; Wang, K; Jiang, X				Huang, Wei; Chen, Xing; Wang, Kun; Jiang, Xia			Seasonal characteristics of phosphorus sorption by sediments from plain lakes with different trophic statuses	ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE												Phosphorus (P) sorption in sediments plays a significant role in trophic status of a lake. This study investigated the characteristics of P sorption in sediments from three lakes with different trophic statuses (moderately eutrophic, lightly eutrophic and moderately trophic) through kinetic, batch equilibrium and thermodynamic experiments. Results show that pseudo-second-order kinetics best describe P sorption in sediments from the three lakes. Fitting by modified Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms indicates that the moderately trophic lake sediment has higher sorption capacity (maximum of 0.848 mg g(-1) at 35 degrees C) than the sediments of the other two lakes at different temperatures (5, 15, 25 and 35 degrees C). Thermodynamic results indicate that the processes of P sorption of the three sediments are spontaneous, entropy-driven and endothermic reactions. The risk of P release in sediments was analysed according to the calculated results of isotherms combined with the change in P fraction. Sediments from the moderately eutrophic lake act as a source in summer. The lightly eutrophic and moderately trophic lakes act as sources in spring and winter, and a pool in summer and autumn, respectively. Furthermore, the amounts of reductant-soluble P, calcium-bound P and iron-bound P are significantly related to the sorption capacity of sediments from the three lakes (p < 0.05). The different sediments have different P release risk, and P fraction in sediment is one of the significant factors of P sorption.

Gear and Seasonal Bias Associated with Abundance and Size Structure Estimates for Lentic Freshwater Fishes	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												All freshwater fish sampling methods are biased toward particular species, sizes, and sexes and are further influenced by season, habitat, and fish behavior changes over time. However, little is known about gear-specific biases for many common fish species because few multiple-gear comparison studies exist that have incorporated seasonal dynamics. We sampled six lakes and impoundments representing a diversity of trophic and physical conditions in Iowa, USA, using multiple gear types (i.e., standard modified fyke net, mini-modified fyke net, sinking experimental gill net, bag seine, benthic trawl, boat-mounted electrofisher used diurnally and nocturnally) to determine the influence of sampling methodology and season on fisheries assessments. Specifically, we describe the influence of season on catch per unit effort, proportional size distribution, and the number of samples required to obtain 125 stock-length individuals for 12 species of recreational and ecological importance. Mean catch per unit effort generally peaked in the spring and fall as a result of increased sampling effectiveness in shallow areas and seasonal changes in habitat use (e.g., movement offshore during summer). Mean proportional size distribution decreased from spring to fall for white bass Morone chrysops, largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, and black crappie Pomoxis nigromaculatus, suggesting selectivity for large and presumably sexually mature individuals in the spring and summer. Overall, the mean number of samples required to sample 125 stock-length individuals was minimized in the fall with sinking experimental gill nets, a boat-mounted electrofisher used at night, and standard modified nets for 11 of the 12 species evaluated. Our results provide fisheries scientists with relative comparisons between several recommended standard sampling methods and illustrate the effects of seasonal variation on estimates of population indices that will be critical to the future development of standardized sampling methods for freshwater fish in lentic ecosystems.																			1944-687X					DEC	2014	5	2					394	412		10.3996/082013-JFWM-054	http://dx.doi.org/10.3996/082013-JFWM-054													WOS:000346052300017
J	Smith, SB; DeSando, SA; Pagano, T				Smith, Susan B.; DeSando, Samantha A.; Pagano, Todd			The Value of Native and Invasive Fruit-Bearing Shrubs for Migrating Songbirds	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST												The success of annual migrations for songbirds is greatly affected by habitat quality at stopover sites, particularly in relation to food needed for rapid refueling. The abundance and nutritional quality of important food resources may be linked to the presence of deciduous shrub species that provide seasonal fruits in the fall and support insects in the spring. The objective of this study was to determine whether migrating songbirds benefit from resources provided by native or invasive fruit-bearing shrubs found at 2 bird-banding stations in Rochester, NY. We conducted nutritional analyses (energy density, fat content, total soluble solids) on the fruits of common shrub species at the study sites, monitored removal of the fall fruits of focal native and invasive shrub species in the field, and measured the abundance of midges-a common insect resource for migrating songbirds-supported by the focal shrub species in the spring. The highest fat content and energy densities were found in fruits of native shrubs, ranging from 6.57 to 48.72% fat and 18.83 to 28.68 kJ/g of energy. All invasive fruits had <= 0.99% fat and <= 17.17 kJ/g of energy. We also found a significant positive correlation between fat and energy content of the fruits. Native dogwood fruits were consumed by migrating songbirds at higher rates than invasive fruits over the fall migration period. However, there was no clear pattern of midge abundance between native and invasive shrub species during the spring migration period. Our results suggest that fruits of native shrubs are of greater nutritional value to migrating songbirds than the fruits of invasive shrubs during fall migration, which is supported by the higher removal rates by songbirds of native dogwood fruits than fruits of the 4 other invasive fruit species. This finding suggests that removal of invasive fruit-bearing shrubs or plants will not negatively impact migrating birds when high-quality native fruit-bearing shrubs are available. However, additional study on the relative value of these shrubs in the spring and over multiple seasons is needed to provide insight into their overall value for birds during annual migrations.

J	Zhao, QH; Xu, J; Wang, JJ; Liu, L				Zhao, Qiaohua; Xu, Jia; Wang, Jianjian; Liu, Ling			Temporal-spatial features and key factors' analysis of vertical eddy diffusivities in Taihu Lake, China	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Vertical eddy diffusivity (VED) is used to quantify the vertical mixing of water column, which has a profound influence on the evolution of aquatic ecosystems. Based on half-hourly water temperature measured at -20 cm and -150 cm depths from 2015 to 2017 at stations of Pingtaishan (PTS), Dapukou (DPK), Bifenggang (BFG), and Xiaoleishan (XLS) in Taihu Lake, the daily average VED is calculated according to the phase lag of water temperature series at two depths. The temporal and spatial features and possible evolution characters of vertical turbulences are then deliberated. The results show that the VED in Taihu Lake varies by several orders of magnitude. The weak VED exhibits stronger spatial heterogeneity and high frequency characteristics and vice versa for the strong VED. The VED in the center region of the lake is stronger, in comparison to bay areas. On seasonality, the VED is the strongest in winter, moderate in spring and autumn, and the weakest in summer. Analyses show that solar radiation and wind forcing are the key meteorological factors regulating VED changes, with the solar effect somewhat stronger than wind. It is also discussed potential roles of vertical mixing in cyanobacteria becoming dominant population in Taihu Lake.																			0944-1344	1614-7499				SEP	2021	28	33					45506	45518		10.1007/s11356-021-13810-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-13810-z		APR 2021						33866486					WOS:000640949200001

J	Nawrot, D; Mieczan, T				Nawrot, Dorota; Mieczan, Tomasz			Ciliates versus other components of the microbial loop in the psammolittoral zone: horizontal distribution	TURKISH JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												The objective of this study was to determine the abundance and biomass of microbial loop components in 2 lakes of different trophic status. The lakes (mesotrophic and eutrophic ones) were located in the Leczna-Wlodawa Lakeland. The effect of selected physical and chemical water parameters on this group of organisms was also analyzed. Psammon samples were collected during 3 seasons: spring, summer, and autumn 2011. In each of the lakes, samples were collected in the euarenal, higroarenal, and hydroarenal zones. The highest abundance and biomass of the microbial loop components were recorded in spring in the eutrophic lake. The mesotrophic lake showed an increase in flagellates in autumn with a decline in the abundance of ciliates. In the mesotrophic lake, the density of individual elements of the microbial loop was correlated with temperature and total organic carbon, and in the eutrophic lake with pH, chlorophyll a, and ammonium nitrogen. In both lakes, a significant correlation occurred between bacteria and ciliate abundances. In both trophic types of lakes, the highest correlations between bacteria and heterotrophic protists were noted in hydroarenal zone. In the euarenal and higroarenal zones, the correlations were weaker.

Trace element transport in western Siberian rivers across a permafrost gradient	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Towards a better understanding of trace element (TE) transport in permafrost-affected Earth surface environments, we sampled similar to 60 large and small rivers (< 100 to <= 150 000 km(2) watershed area) of the Western Siberian Lowland (WSL) during spring flood and summer and winter baseflow across a 1500 km latitudinal gradient covering continuous, discontinuous, sporadic and permafrost-free zones. Analysis of similar to 40 major and TEs in the dissolved (< 0.45 mu m) fraction allowed establishing main environmental factors controlling the transport of metals and TEs in rivers of this environmentally important region. No statistically significant effect of the basin size on most TE concentrations was evidenced. Two groups of elements were distinguished: (1) elements that show the same trend throughout the year and (2) elements that show seasonal differences. The first group included elements decreasing northward during all seasons (Sr, Mo, U, As, Sb) marking the underground water influence of river feeding. The elements of the second group exhibited variable behavior in the course of the year. A northward increase during spring period was mostly pronounced for Fe, Al, Co, Zn and Ba and may stem from a combination of enhanced leaching from the topsoil and vegetation and bottom waters of the lakes (spring overturn). A springtime northward decrease was observed for Ni, Cu, Zr and Rb. The increase in element concentration northward was observed for Ti, Ga, Zr and Th only in winter, whereas Fe, Al, rare earth elements (REEs), Pb, Zr, and Hf increased northward in both spring and winter, which could be linked to leaching from peat and transport in the form of Fe-rich colloids. A southward increase in summer was strongly visible for Fe, Ni, Ba, Rb and V, probably due to peat/moss release (Ni, Ba, Rb) or groundwater feeding (Fe, V). Finally, B, Li, Cr, V, Mn, Zn, Cd, and Cs did not show any distinct trend from S to N. The order of landscape component impact on TE concentration in rivers was lakes > bogs > forest. The lakes decreased export of Mn and Co in summer and Ni, Cu, and Rb in spring, presumably due to biotic processes. The lakes enriched the rivers in insoluble lithogenic elements in summer and winter, likely due to TE mobilization from unfrozen mineral sediments. The rank of environmental factors on TE concentration in western Siberian rivers was latitude (three permafrost zones) > season > watershed size. The effect of the latitude was minimal in spring for most TEs but highly visible for Sr, Mo, Sb and U. The main factors controlling the shift of river feeding from surface and subsurface flow to deep underground flow in the permafrost-bearing zone were the depth of the active (unfrozen) seasonal layer and its position in organic or mineral horizons of the soil profile. In the permafrost-free zone, the relative role of carbonate mineral-bearing base rock feeding versus bog water feeding determined the pattern of TE concentration and fluxes in rivers of various sizes as a function of season. Comparison of obtained TE fluxes in WSL rivers with those of other subarctic rivers demonstrated reasonable agreement for most TEs; the lithology of base rocks was the major factor controlling the magnitude of TE fluxes. Climate change in western Siberia and permafrost boundary migration will essentially affect the elements controlled by underground water feeding (DIC, alkaline earth elements (Ca, Sr), oxyanions (Mo, Sb, As) and U). The thickening of the active layer may increase the export of trivalent and tetravalent hydrolysates in the form of organo-ferric colloids. Plant litter-originated divalent metals present as organic complexes may be retained via adsorption on mineral horizon. However, due to various counterbalanced processes controlling element source and sinks in plant-peat-mineral soil-river systems, the overall impact of the permafrost thaw on TE export from the land to the ocean may be smaller than that foreseen with merely active layer thickening and permafrost boundary shift.					; Kolesnichenko, Larisa/O-4074-2017; Loiko, Sergey/E-3871-2014; Лойко, Сергей/E-3871-2014; Kirpotin, Sergey/E-4095-2014; Pokrovsky, Oleg/W-4934-2019; Kopysov, Sergey/N-8043-2014; Krickov, Ivan/AAG-8605-2019; Manasypov, Rinat/S-2135-2016; Vorobyev, Sergey/M-8202-2016	Vorob'ev, Sergei/0000-0003-2547-9663; Loiko, Sergey/0000-0003-2020-4716; Kolesnichenko, Larisa/0000-0001-9797-8985; Kritskov, Ivan/0000-0001-8818-0496; Manasypov, Rinat/0000-0001-5191-2817; Pokrovsky, Oleg/0000-0002-3155-7069; Vorobyev, Sergey/0000-0001-7884-2433													1726-4170	1726-4189					2016	13	6					1877	1900		10.5194/bg-13-1877-2016	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-1877-2016													WOS:000377274100010

Here, ikaite forms submarine tufa columns rising up to 18 m above the fjord bottom. The columns are spectacular examples of abiogenic carbonate precipitation in a cold seawater environment and so far represent the only known formation of ikaite in seawater. We have analyzed the H-2, C-13, C-14, O-18 and Sr-87 contents and major-element and minor-element compositions of ikaite and of the different water types in and around Ikka Fjord in order to understand the formation of the Ikka columns. Water from inside the columns is fresh but alkaline, rich in ions of sodium, bicarbonate, and carbonate, and has a stable-isotope composition identical to precipitation falling on the nearby Gronnedal-Ika igneous complex, and we conclude that the tufa columns form over submarine springs issuing from the bottom of Ikka Fjord, Dissolution of unidentified sodium carbonate minerals in carbonatites in the igneous complex probably accounts for the peculiar chemistry of the springs. Ikaite supersaturation and precipitation is controlled by mixing of spring water and seawater at the cold (< 6<degrees>C) fjord bottom, and precipitation is accelerated by the formation of hydrated CaCO(3)degrees (aq) ion pairs, while phosphate ions in the spring water act as inhibitor for precipitation of anhydrous carbonates, We propose that the spring water seeps in Ikka Fjord literally create their own conduits in the form of the vertical, chimney-like columns with ikaite forming continuously at the tops of the columns. The only limits to upward growth are winter ice and the fresh-water layer capping the fjord during summer.

Periphyton and macroinvertebrate assemblage responses to flow regime in spring-fed headwaters	INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF THEORETICAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY, VOL 30, PT 8, PROCEEDINGS: NOW: INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF LIMNOLOGY	International Association of Theoretical and Applied Limnology Proceedings				30th Congress of the International-Association-of-Theoretical-and-Applied-Limnology	AUG 12-18, 2007	Montreal, CANADA	Int Assoc Theoret & Appl Limnol				Dry weather is common during summer in the Pacific Northwest of North America. As a result, biota of headwater streams have evolved various adaptations in response to these predictable periods of low flow (baseflow; BOULTON 2003). Headwater streams may have a determinate source (spring), or flow may be dominated by shallow groundwater input generated by relatively recent precipitation. These 2 types of systems vary in the permanence of flow, with spring streams typically supporting continuous year-round flow to the channel head. In headwater streams not sourced by a spring, the upper extent of surface flow varies seasonally and clear differences have been noted between the communities utilizing areas with permanent flow and areas that dry in summer (DELUCCI & PECKARSKY 1989). However, the extent to which summer low flow influences stream biota in headwater spring streams has not been fully evaluated. Spring-fed headwater streams usually support surface flow throughout the year. The proportion of spring water changes with season and distance from the spring. Near the spring and during extended periods of low precipitation there is a higher proportion of spring water. Even some spring streams may experience periodic dewatering during severe droughts; therefore, despite the relatively consistent flow in spring-fed headwater streams, summer low flow may still serve as an important environmental attribute dictating long-term species persistence and shaping the biotic assemblage (LAKE 2003). We examined macro invertebrate communities in spring-fed, headwater streams in the Oregon Coast Range in early and late summer, during the driest part of the year. We also characterized the composition and biomass of the periphyton assemblage in spring, examined invertebrate and periphyton assemblages with a focus on taxa resilience in these habitats at the head of the fluvial network, and explored how seasonal low flow and periodic droughts might influence assemblage characteristics.

Seasonal changes in European whitefish muscle and invertebrate prey fatty acid composition in a subarctic lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Ambient light and temperature show extreme seasonal variation in subarctic lakes due to the midnight sun period in summer and cold polar night period in winter. These changes have clear impacts on fish feeding and reproduction cycles, potentially affecting the fatty acid (FA) composition of muscle. Despite extensive research into fish FA over recent decades, we know little about intra-annual changes of fish FA profile and content. We studied intra-annual changes in the FA profile (mol%) and content (mg g(-1) dry weight) of sexually mature European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) muscle in a large and deep subarctic lake located in northern Fennoscandia. We collected fish, zooplankton, and benthic macroinvertebrate samples during 3 ice-covered months, including December (during whitefish spawning), and 3 open-water months. Fish size, age, sex, stomach content and fullness, and gonadosomatic index were also assessed as co-variates. Whitefish changed diet from benthic macroinvertebrates in winter to zooplankton in summer. Generally, whitefish somatic growth was slow and most energy was used for gonad growth. Zooplankton had higher total content and different profile of FA compared to benthic macroinvertebrates. Increased zooplanktivory in summer was detected with higher alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3n-3) and stearidonic acid (SDA, 18:4n-3) percentage and content as well as increased the ratio of polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) of n-3 and n-6 family (n-3/n-6 ratio) in fish muscle. Whitefish gonadal growth and development occur during the summer growing season and continue until the initiation of spawning in early winter. We found that the content of physiologically crucial PUFA, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3), and arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4n-6) decreased by c. 60% between late summer and the spawning period in early winter. After spawning, total FA content of whitefish muscle increased rapidly, reaching the maximum recorded level in mid-summer. Intra-annual changes in whitefish muscle FA profiles and contents were modified both by available diet and reproductive phase; however, reproductive physiology was clearly a stronger driver of the changes in muscle FA composition. Results suggest marked changes in intra-annual FA composition of fish muscle, an important factor that should be considered in future studies and especially in long term monitoring programs. Future studies are needed to determine whether these inter-annual FA patterns revealed in this study can be extended to different regions and to e.g. adipose or spring spawning species.

We used carbon isotopes (C-13, C-14) to evaluate the production and cycling of DIC in an acid-sensitive lake watershed of the Precambrian Shield. Soil CO2, groundwater and stream DIC were characterized chemically and isotopically. Soil CO2 concentration profiles reflect both changes in production and in losses due to diffusion. DeltaC-13 soil CO2 profiles (deltaC-13 values of -23 parts per thousand in summer, slightly enriched during the fall and -25 parts per thousand during the winter) are a reflection of the isotopic composition of the sources and changes in isotopic fractionation due to diffusion. Carbon isotopic composition (C-13, C-14) of the groundwater and stream DIC clearly indicate that weathering of silicates by soil CO2 is the main source of DIC in these watersheds. C-14 data show that, in addition to recent groundwater, an older groundwater component with depleted C-14 activity is also present in the bedrock. The carbon isotope pattern in the groundwater also implies that, besides the main springtime recharge events, contributions to the groundwater may also occur during late winter/early spring.

The pollutant concentrations in water and sediment were at high level and changed obviously with season. TOC, NO2-N and NH4-N exhibited a strong correlation with other environmental factors in water. TC, TOC and TN had a strong correlation with other environmental factor in sediments. The total biomass of aquatic macrophytes reached its maximum value of 2411.6 g/m(2) in spring and the total species number achieved its maximum in summer. Potamogeton pectinatus was the most dominant species in three seasons. From RDA analysis, the top three water chemical factors that influence aquatic macro-phytes were Chla, NO3-N and TN (contributions of 14.6%, 13.8% and 10.5%, respectively). The top three environmental factors in sediment were TOC, IP and NH4-N (contributions of 35.6%, 25.7% and 20.7%, respectively). The aquatic macrophytes also had distinct major environmental factors. The diversity indexes of the aquatic macrophytes had less than 0.5 fluctuations. This work might provide more insights into the control and remediation of lake pollution in North China.

J	Lehtonen, KK				Lehtonen, KK			Ecophysiology of the benthic amphipod Monoporeia affinis in an open-sea area of the northern Baltic Sea: Seasonal variations in body composition, with bioenergetic considerations	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												A deep-living, open-sea population of Monoporeia affinis from the northern Baltic Sea was studied for seasonal variations in the gross biochemical, lipid class and elemental composition during 1991 to 1993. The seasonal cycle in the composition of this benthic, deposit-feeding amphipod was largely determined by the brief period of spring phytoplankton bloom sedimentation and the longlasting deficiency of good-quality nutrition during late autumn-early spring. The level (% dry wt) of lipid was lowest in March-April (21 to 30%, range: interannual variation), increased rapidly in early summer (27 to 43%) and peaked in the autumn (38 to 44%). Reciprocal to lipid, the level of protein was highest in the spring (19 to 29%) and lowest in the autumn (17 to 23%). Carbon and nitrogen levels followed closely the patterns of lipid and protein, respectively. Triacylglycerols were invariably the main lipid class (67 to 95% of total lipids), while phospholipids formed 4 to 23% and other classes <7% each. Due to high variability in biochemical composition, the energetic value of the body matter of M. affinis showed great seasonal variation. Using body composition and previously determined metabolic rates, calculations showed distinct seasonal and life-cycle variability in the bioenergetic strategy of the amphipods. Interannual variability in the body composition of the amphipods was noted, especially between 1991 and the 2 following years. Previously recorded long-term oscillations in the abundance and biomass of M. affinis populations and the relation of these oscillations to pelagic events and sedimentation is discussed in the light of the present results.

A multifaceted sampling approach was undertaken to (1) evaluate the persistence of stocked largemouth bass, (2) estimate fidelity of stocked largemouth bass to release sites, and (3) compare return rates of the two age classes. Although stocked largemouth bass comprised the majority (81%) of all bass captured in electrofishing surveys of the stocked embayments during fall 1998, catches declined rapidly during winter 1998, and by spring and summer 1999 stocked largemouth bass were virtually absent from electrofishing surveys. Creel surveys indicated no catch of stocked largemouth bass in the release sites after winter 1998. Electrofishing surveys, creel surveys, and angler call-ins all suggested stocked fish did not persist and either moved out of the stocked embayments or died. The results suggest that stocking advanced-size largemouth bass into these embayments only provided a limited and short-term enhancement of the fishery in those areas.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				DEC	2006	21	4					627	637		10.1080/02705060.2006.9664124	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2006.9664124													WOS:000242201300010

In order to introduce agriculture to the area, man was forced to create polder systems. This led to a number of changes in water relations along certain segments of the coastline including altered runoff patterns and magnitudes. The main goal of the research was to assess the impact of polder management on water relations across coastal lowlands. The direct drainage basin of Lake Gardno was selected for research purposes. Most of the research work consisted of an analysis of primary sources and fieldwork. The hydrographic entities selected are not only different in terms of drainage area size but also in terms of quantity of outflow. The amount of water exiting each given polder depends on the number of hours of operation of the pumping station, which in turn, depends on changes in local hydro-meteorological conditions. Atmospheric precipitation, spring snowmelt, and seawater intrusions affect the operation of engineering structures that help maintain the polders. The pumps tend to work more during the autumn and winter. Polder management is not that important during the spring and summer.

J	Santos, MCR; Muelle, H; Pacheco, DMD				Santos, Maria C. R.; Muelle, Helena; Pacheco, Dina M. D.			Cyanobacteria and microcystins in lake Furnas (S. Miguel island-Azores)	LIMNETICA												This study investigated the changes in the cyanobacterial population and quantified the occurrence of microcystins in Lake Furnas during the first decade of the 21st century. The eutrophication of Lake Furnas has been recognized since the 1980s. The lake's phytoplankton population increased over the years in relation to this process of nutrient enrichment. Cyanobacteria began to dominate the phytoplankton and blooms of greater than 20 . 10(3) cells/ml occurred. After 2004, cyanobacterial blooms occurred regularly in the lake throughout the year. From 2000 through 2009, 30 blooms were detected. Of these blooms, 13 were dominated by Microcystis aeruginosa and 11 by Woronichinia naegeliana. In the other 6 blooms, the dominant cyanobacteria were Microcystis spp., Anabaena spp., Aphanocapsa spp. and Coelosphaerium kuetzingianum. A number of blooms involved more than 2 species simultaneously. The highest cell density (12.3 . 10(6) cells/ml) occurred during winter 2007. The predominant species in this bloom were M. aeruginosa (11.9 . 10(6) cells/ml) and W. naegeliana (83.8 . 10(3) cells/ml). Because almost all of the cyanobacteria cited were considered toxin producers, a search for microcystins, the hepatotoxins most often found in freshwaters, was initiated in 2001. Samples were collected at four depths: surface, 2.5 m, 5.0 m and 0.5 m above the sediments. From 2001 through 2009, soluble microcystins were detected six times during the summer, four times during the winter and autumn and three times during the spring (25 % of 129 samples). The average concentrations of soluble microcystins in the water column ranged from 0.1 mu g/l to 0.5 mu g/l. Intracellular microcystins were detected in 84 To of the samples. All samples collected after 2004 contained these cyanotoxins. The average concentrations of intracellular microcystins in the water column ranged from 0.1 mu g/l to 11.2 mu g/l. The highest value (154.5 mu g/l) was found in a water sample collected from the lake surface during the winter of 2009, during a bloom dominated by W naegeliana. The amounts of microcystins produced by cyanobacteria, expressed on a seston dry weight basis, varied between 24 mg/kg and 9737 mg/kg and showed an increase in 2008 and 2009. The concentrations of microcystins in samples from M. aeruginosa blooms ranged from 86 mg/kg to 1171 mg/kg and the highest values were recorded during the spring and summer of 2008.																			0213-8409	1989-1806				JUN	2012	31	1			SI		107	118																WOS:000305547600011
J	Tucker, CL; Young, JM; Williams, DG; Ogle, K				Tucker, Colin L.; Young, Jessica M.; Williams, David G.; Ogle, Kiona			Process-based isotope partitioning of winter soil respiration in a subalpine ecosystem reveals importance of rhizospheric respiration	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Deep snow in sub-alpine ecosystems may reduce or eliminate soil freezing, thus contributing to the potential for winter soil respiration to account for a significant fraction of annual CO2 efflux to the atmosphere. Quantification of carbon loss from soils requires separation of respiration produced by roots and rhizosphere organisms from that produced by heterotrophic, decomposer organisms because the former does not result in a net loss of stored carbon. Our objective was to quantify winter soil respiration rates in a sub-alpine forest and meadow, and to partition that flux into its rhizosphere and heterotrophic components. We were particularly interested in comparing early winter soil respiration to late winter/early spring soil respiration of each component because previous work has shown a consistent increase in soil respiration of subalpine systems from early winter to late winter/spring. Field data on the total soil CO2 flux and its carbon isotope composition were coupled with data from laboratory incubations using a novel process-based stable isotope mixing model implemented in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. We found that soil respiration generally increased from early to later winter and was greatest mid-summer. After correcting for the effect of wind on snowpack delta C-13-CO2, the delta C-13 of soil-respired CO2 varied little over winter, and the contributions of rhizospheric (35 %) and heterotrophic (65 %) respiration were relatively constant. The significance of winter respiration from the rhizosphere and apparent coupling of increases in rhizospheric and heterotrophic respiration in late winter are likely to be important for predicting changes in soil carbon in sub-alpine ecosystems.

Decreased oxygenation demand following hypolimnetic oxygenation operation	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Gantzer PA, Preece EP, Nine B, Morris J. 2019. Decreased oxygenation demand following hypolimnetic oxygenation operation. Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XX-XX. We analyzed long-term oxygenation dynamics in 3 waterbodies: Spring Hollow Reservoir (SHR) and Carvins Cove Reservoir (CCR), which are water supply reservoirs, and North Twin Lake (NTL), a natural lake. Bubble plume line diffuser hypolimnetic oxygenation system (HOS) operation was for 13, 10, and 7 yr for SHR, CCR, and NTL, respectively. Water column profiles were measured in all 3 waterbodies. Additionally, remotely deployed sensors were used to monitor dissolved oxygen (DO) in NTL year-round, specifically to capture winter conditions during ice cover. Hypolimnetic oxygen demand (HOD) was observed to decrease after several years of HOS operation in all 3 waterbodies. Annual HOD decreased more for HOS operated year-round compared to recovery-based operation where HOS was started after DO decreased below 5.0 mg/L. Additionally, HOD throughout the summer stratified period was lower following maintenance of higher DO during spring prior to onset of stratification. An analogous result was observed during winter ice cover relative to DO conditions following fall turnover. Prior work showed increased HOD during HOS operation compared to pre-HOS. The increased HOD during HOS operation was termed diffuser-induced oxygen demand and implied the HOS was inducing oxygen demand. However, the current work shows HOS operation is not actually inducing oxygen demand; rather, it is addressing the existing oxygen demand already in the sediments. Our data suggest that a HOS is an effective tool to maintain hypolimnion DO in stratified lakes and reservoirs. When operated year-round or before DO decreases, HOS can decrease HOD and reduce overall long-term operational costs.																			1040-2381	2151-5530				JUL 3	2019	35	3			SI		292	307		10.1080/10402381.2019.1648614	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2019.1648614		AUG 2019											WOS:000482492700001

Season, molt, and body size influence mercury concentrations in grebes	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												We studied seasonal and physiological influences on mercury concentrations in western grebes (Aechmophorus occidentalis) and Clark's grebes (A. occidentalis) across 29 lakes and reservoirs in California, USA. Additionally, at three of these lakes, we conducted a time series study, in which we repeatedly sampled grebe blood mercury concentrations during the spring, summer, and early fall. Grebe blood mercury concentrations were higher among males (0.61 +/- 0.12 mu g/g ww) than females (0.52 +/- 0.10 mu g/g ww), higher among Clark's grebes (0.58 +/- 0.12 mu g/g ww) than western grebes (0.51 +/- 0.10 mu g/g ww), and exhibited a strong seasonal pattern (decreasing by 60% from spring to fall). Grebe blood THg concentrations exhibited a shallow, inverse U-shaped pattern with body size, and was lowest among the smallest and largest grebes. Further, the relationship between grebe blood mercury concentrations and wing primary feather molt exhibited a shallow U-shaped pattern, where mercury concentrations were highest among birds that had not yet begun molting, decreased approximately 24% between pre-molt and late molt, and increased approximately 19% from late molt to post-molt. Because grebes did not begin molting until mid-summer, lower grebe blood mercury concentrations observed in late summer and early fall were consistent with the onset of primary feather molt. However, because sampling date was a much stronger predictor of grebe mercury concentrations than molt, other seasonally changing environmental factors likely played a larger role than molt in the seasonal variation in grebe mercury concentrations. In the time series study, we found that seasonal trends in grebe mercury concentrations were not consistent among lakes, indicating that lake-specific variation in mercury dynamics influence the overall seasonal decline in grebe blood mercury concentrations. These results highlight the importance of accounting for sampling date, as well as ecological processes that may influence mercury concentrations, when developing monitoring programs to assess site-specific exposure risk of mercury to wildlife.

The study presents adaptive and acclimatory changes observed in Cyprinus carpio communis L with respect to ovarian cycle and serum levels of electrolytes, calcium, total proteins and albumin as a consequence of wide temperature and sunshine variation in the natural environment of Dal lake in Srinager, Kashmir (India). 2. The atmospheric temperatures in Srinagar show well-defined seasonal and diurnal variations. During the period of study, the mean monthly average temperature in summer (June-August) was 24.degree. C whereas in winter (December-February) it fell to 3.6.degree. C. The total hours of sunshine during the winter months were abut half of those found in summer. 3. Under local thermal and photo conditions the fish was found to spawn once a year compared to biannual spawning in tropical climates. 4. A significant decrease was found in serum sodium, potassium and chloride concentrations during the months of January and February when the mean minimum atmospheric temperatures reached -2.5.degree. C and -1.2.degree. C respectively. 5. The serum calcium levels showed a marked increase during the period corresponding to ovarian maturity and spawning of fish. 6. A significant rise in total serum protein concentration was induced by decreased environmental temperatures. Serum albumin levels were found to exhibit a sharp fall coinciding with the spawning period.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				AUG	1988	20	1					61	67		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1988.tb01717.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1988.tb01717.x													WOS:A1988P721000007
J	Khedr, E; Abou Elmagd, K; Halfawy, M				Khedr, Ezzat; Abou Elmagd, Kamal; Halfawy, Mamdoh			Rate and budget of blown sand movement along the western bank of Lake Nasser, southern Egypt	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Three sets of Landsat (TM) satellite images for the years 1993, 1998, and 2003 show that the sand dunes at the southwestern Desert of Egypt are generally moving towards southeast direction with a mean annual creeping speed over ground attaining 15 m/year. The manual-stickled field measurements show that the net annual extension of the longitudinal dunes in the coastal area is between 4 and 5 m/year, while the inland longitudinal dunes showed a net movement ranging between 5 and 6 m/year. Seasonal variations of drift potential and sand movement refer to a strongly high energy wind desert environment in the spring season, high energy wind desert environment in the summer season, and relatively high to intermediate in the autumn and winter seasons, respectively. The total annual estimated volume of transported sand which falls down into Lake Nasser basin attains 16,225,808 m(3) as calculated by Bagnold's equation and quantities of sand collected from the sand traps. Comparing this value with the total volume of Lake Nasser Basin, which attains 120 x 10(9) m(3), we can conclude that the sand sheets or sand accumulations may represent serious natural hazards to Lake Nasser in some locations. However, the sand drifting towards the lake may be obstructed by high contour topography hindrance, and the mean grain size of the sand sheets is bigger than 0.25 mm, which needs high wind velocity more than 4 m/s. In addition, the direction of the prevailing wind is N-NNW to S-SSE, and this direction sometimes is parallel to Lake Nasser in some places according to the meandering of the lake. The total lengths of hazardous areas along the western bank of Lake Nasser, which receive the most amounts of the drifted sands, attain 43.6 km only.

J	Ferber, LR; Levine, SN; Lini, A; Livingston, GP				Ferber, LR; Levine, SN; Lini, A; Livingston, GP			Do cyanobacteria dominate in eutrophic lakes because they fix atmospheric nitrogen?	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The sources of nitrogen for phytoplankton were determined for a bloom-prone lake as a means of assessing the hypothesis that cyanobacteria dominate in eutrophic lakes because of their ability to fix nitrogen when the nitrogen : phosphorous (N : P) supply ratio is low and nitrogen a limiting resource. 2. Nitrogen fixation rates, estimated through acetylene reduction with N-15 calibration, were compared with N-15-tracer estimates of ammonium and nitrate uptake monthly during the ice-free season of 1999. In addition, the natural N stable isotope composition of phytoplankton, nitrate and ammonium were measured biweekly and the contribution of N-2 to the phytoplankton signature estimated with a mixing model. 3. Although cyanobacteria made up 81-98% of phytoplankton biomass during summer and autumn, both assays suggested minimal N acquisition through fixation (<9% for the in-situ incubations; <2% for stable isotope analysis). Phytoplankton acquired N primarily as ammonium (82-98%), and secondarily as nitrate (15-18% in spring and autumn, but <5% in summer). Heterocyst densities of <3 per 100 fixer cells confirmed low reliance on fixation. 4. The lake showed symptoms of both light and nitrogen limitation. Cyanobacteria may have dominated by monopolizing benthic sources of ammonium, or by forming surface scums that shaded other algae.

A 1000-yr record of environmental change in NE China indicated by diatom assemblages from maar lake Erlongwan	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Past environmental changes based on diatom relative abundances have been inferred from the maar Lake Erlongwan in northeast China. The limnology of Lake Erlongwan is affected by the strongly seasonal regional climate. The composition of diatom assemblages, in turn, responds to changes in the seasonal duration of ice cover in winter, water-column turnover in spring and autumn, and thermal stratification in summer. Statistical analysis of the sedimentary diatom assemblages reveals three significant stratigraphic zones over the past 1000 yr. The highest abundance of the planktonic species Discostella species occurs between AD 1050 and 1400 and suggests an annual ice-free period of long duration and well-developed summer stratification of the water column. This planktonic diatom peak between ca. AD 1150 and 1200 suggests that this period was the warmest over the past 1000 yr. The interval between AD 1400 and 1800 is marked by a decline in planktonic diatoms and suggests shorter duration of the ice-free season, weaker water stratification and possibly generally cold conditions. After AD 1800 relative abundances of planktonic diatoms, including Puncticulata praetermissa and Asterionella formosa, increase again, which indicates lengthening of the duration of the annual ice-free period and a stronger overturn of the water column. All these data imply that the pattern of the seasons is different between the MWP and the 20th century. (C) 2012 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Love, JW; Rees, BB				Love, JW; Rees, BB			Seasonal differences in hypoxia tolerance in gulf killifish, Fundulus grandis (Fundulidae)	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Many estuarine habitats are characterized by episodes of hypoxia, the frequency and severity of which may vary seasonally. Accordingly, resident fish species may show seasonal differences in their capacity to tolerate hypoxia. We have tested this hypothesis in the gulf killifish, Fundulus grandis, sampled from the Lake Pontchartrain estuary (Louisiana) at different times of the year. We measured 2 indicators of hypoxia tolerance, the frequency of aquatic surface respiration (ASR) during gradual reduction in dissolved oxygen (D.O.) and survival time during severe hypoxic stress, and found both to be significantly affected by season. Fish collected during the summer did not engage in ASR until the D.O. concentration dropped to values lower than that required to elicit ASR by fish collected during other seasons. Laboratory acclimation of fish to low oxygen did not change the relationship between ASR behavior and D.O., suggesting that the observed seasonal effect on ASR was not simply due to previous exposure of summer fish to environmental hypoxia. Furthermore, fish collected during the summer and winter had significantly longer survival times during exposure to severe hypoxia than fish collected during the fall. Survival analysis indicated that the condition of fish was positively associated with survival time, and seasonal variation in condition accounted for about half of the observed difference between survival times of fish collected during the summer and fall. Seasonal variation in ASR and survival, when taken together, demonstrate that hypoxia tolerance in F. grandis may be subject to acclimatization. An increase in hypoxia tolerance during the summer could increase survivorship of fish when exposed to elevated temperatures and low oxygen concentrations which prevail during the summer months.					; Rees, Bernard/AAB-9343-2019	Rees, Bernard/0000-0001-5636-1700; 													0378-1909	1573-5133				JAN	2002	63	1					103	115		10.1023/A:1013834803665	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1013834803665													WOS:000173466700013

Reproductive seasonal periodicity of the endemic Bermuda killifish Fundulus bermudae in an anchialine pond	JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM												A total of 245 individuals from a population of the endemic Bermuda killifish Fundulus bermudae in an isolated anchialine pond (Mangrove Lake) were trapped between November 2004 and November 2005. Laboratory analysis of gonad development allowed determination of the seasonal reproductive cycles of both females and males. A distinctive annual pattern was evident, with female and male gonadal cycles synchronous throughout the study period. The results indicate that the E bermudae males and females began their spawning season in February, but reached primary peaks in May and June respectively. Gonadal indices abruptly fell afterjune and continued to fall at a steady rate until September, marking the end of the spawning season. Gonad recrudescence, as indicated by basal gonad indices, occurred in September and lasted throughout the autumn and early winter months.																			0025-3154					JUN	2007	87	3					797	800		10.1017/S0025315407053982	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0025315407053982													WOS:000247354100023

However, the role played by atmospheric water (AW) transport on the hydrological status over the ETP is poorly understood. In this study, the AW source to the ETP was tracked with the Water Accounting Model-2 layers (WAM-2) and AW transport to the ETP through its boundaries was quantified, with three reanalysis products (ERA-I, MERRA-2, and JRA-55) during 1979/1980-2015. It is found that total AW input to the ETP is about 13-25%, 59-71%, 10-13%, and 3-7% of mean annual totals in spring, summer, autumn, and winter, respectively. At annual scales, the AW source from land (52-54%) dominates the AW contribution to the ETP, while local recycling of AW over the ETP accounts for about 17-22% of the mean annual total AW contribution. Increased precipitation over the ETP during 1979-2015 was mostly attributed to the significantly increased AW contribution from the Indian Ocean, especially from increased AW inputs transported from the western and southern boundaries in summer. Comparisons between the AW budget and terrestrial water storage changes indicate that the AW budget change over the ETP modulated the variations of terrestrial water storage change during 2002-2014 and annual lake mass change during 1989-2015.

By mid-June the Secchi depth had increased up to 2.6 m indicating the achievement of the 'clear water phase', which persisted thoughout the rest of the vegetation period. The biomass of 'edible' phytoplankton formed on average 53% of the total phytoplankton biomass, and the share of herbivorous zooplankton was on average 61% of the total zooplankton biomass. In spring zooplankton removed daily 27% of the total B-p and 29% of PP by grazing while in summer these values rarely exceeded 5%. Zooplankton grazing was responsible for the decrease of 'edible' (<31 mu m) phytoplankton after its spring peak as well as for maintaining its biomass at a very low level during the whole vegetation period. Depletion of mineral forms of nitrogen and phosphorus that occurred most probably because of the development of charophytes by the end of May supported the collapse of the whole phytoplankton community and kept the water clear throughout the summer and autumn.

They are present the whole year at low density, but sometimes - mainly during autumn and spring - some species can become frequent and very numerous to form real water blooms. In this study, seven species of silica-scaled chrysophytes have been recorded and identified by electron microscopy of phytoplankton samples from some rivers and shallow lakes in Hungary. Most of these silica-scaled chrysophytes have previously been found in eutrophic and hypertrophic localities, and almost all of them are common and widely distributed, even cosmopolitan. Only Synura echinulata Korshikov has not previously been recorded from Hungary. Some of them as Synura curtispina (Petersen and Hansen) Asmund, S. petersenii Korshikov, Mallomonas acaroides Perty emend. Ivanov, M. tonsurata Telling were frequently found in the phytoplankton samples. Sometimes in autumn and winter Synura petersenii was the most abundant species in the phytoplankton and formed blooms.																			0018-8158					SEP 9	1994	289	1-3					157	162		10.1007/BF00007416	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007416													WOS:A1994PK72300014
J	Tokano, T; Lorenz, RD				Tokano, Tetsuya; Lorenz, Ralph D.			Modeling of Seasonal Lake Level Fluctuations of Titan's Seas/Lakes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS												Seasonal variations in lake levels of Titan's hydrocarbon seas/lakes are predicted by an ocean circulation model in an effort to understand the observed temporal changes in lake size or lack thereof. Three different ground permeabilities are assumed so as to change the relative importance of precipitation, evaporation, river runoff, and groundwater seepage for the lake methane budget. The lake level generally rises in the rainy season around the summer solstice and falls or stagnates during long dry periods in autumn and winter. The annual lake level range in the northern hemisphere amounts to 50-120cm depending on geographic location and size of the lakes and ground permeability. If the hydraulic connection between Punga Mare and Kraken Mare is weak, the lake level range of Punga Mare amplifies at the expense of other seas and also establishes a large lake level difference between these two seas, which is not compatible with the observation by the Cassini spacecraft. On-lake precipitation would cause the lake level of Ontario Lacus to vary seasonally by merely 15 cm, yet river runoff from the huge catchment area can increase the annual lake level range to several meters. The shrinkage of Ontario Lacus observed by Cassini is more likely to be caused by lakebed seepage than by evaporation. The ultimate cause of the difference in the seasonal behavior between northern and southern lakes may be the hemispheric asymmetry in precipitation, be it caused astronomically or topographically. Plain Language Summary Saturn's moon Titan has many hydrocarbon lakes in the polar region, but only one lake near the south pole has so far shown evidence of lake size change. In order to understand the possible difference in the temporal variation between the northern and southern lakes, we simulated numerically the seasonal lake level change of all major lakes on Titan. The lake level generally rises in spring and summer during the rainy season and falls in dry seasons due to evaporation. However, the magnitude of lake level variation strongly depends on the geographic location and size of the lakes as well as how the ground outside the lakes and lake bottom are made of. Large seas near the north pole experience moderate lake level changes of about 1m as a response to spatially averaged precipitation and evaporation. Ontario Lacus in the southern hemisphere is located in a dry environment and rapidly grows after sporadic rainfall but also rapidly shrinks by leakage from the lake bottom. This difference ultimately reflects the north-south asymmetry in Titan's climate.					; Lorenz, Ralph/B-8759-2016	Tokano, Tetsuya/0000-0002-7518-9245; Lorenz, Ralph/0000-0001-8528-4644													2169-9097	2169-9100				FEB	2019	124	2					617	635		10.1029/2018JE005898	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JE005898													WOS:000461856500020

Ninety-five species were recorded. Most birds occurred from October to December and during March and April. Diving ducks occurred primarily during fall and winter and were more abundant than surface-feeding waterfowl. Surface-feeding ducks occurred mostly during early and mid fall. Shorebird numbers were highest during spring and fall. The American coot was the most abundant species recorded. Of all birds recorded, 69% used open water and 11% used flooded or bare mud and sand flats. Sand shores supported the highest densities of birds. Eleven species used six of the seven available habitat types. Freshwater marsh, mud/sandflat, and sand shore habitat types were preferred over other available habitat types. The lakes are an important wetland to migrating birds.																			0008-1078	2331-0405				APR	1989	75	2					85	101																WOS:A1989AR75100003

Effect of a moderate-size reservoir on transport of trace elements in a watershed	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Wildman RA, Forde NA. 2016. Effect of a moderate-size reservoir on transport of trace elements in a watershed. Lake Reserve Manage. 32:353-365. We assessed the extent to which Grand Lake, Oklahoma (>30 m deep, >80 km long), retains Fe, Mn, P, As, Zn, Pb, and Cd. Filtered water samples and suspended sediment samples were collected upstream of, within, and downstream of the reservoir. We then estimated instantaneous, seasonal, elemental fluxes. In winter and spring, when storms brought high flows to the reservoir, Grand Lake modified flood water minimally. During these seasons, trace element distributions were determined by the passage of storm inflows through the reservoir. In summer, Fe, Mn, P, and As were enriched in anoxic bottom water and exported through the dam, which draws water from below the surface mixed layer. Concentrations of aqueous elements in the water column were lower following autumn overturn, perhaps due to precipitation of metal oxides and settling. Unlike Fe, Zn was retained in Grand Lake during all seasons. Concentrations of Cd and Pb in filtered samples were often below our detection limit. Logistic regression indicated that Zn predicted detectable Cd, and so Grand Lake probably sequesters Cd. Sequestration of Pb was unclear because detectable Pb was predicted by both Zn and Fe. This study shows that watershed hydrology determines the transport of trace elements through a reservoir during times of high flow but that vertical circulation and biogeochemistry dominate during summertime and autumn low flows. Understanding these mechanisms can aid reservoir managers who seek to reduce downstream loads of trace elements.																			1040-2381	2151-5530					2016	32	4					353	365		10.1080/10402381.2016.1204397	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2016.1204397													WOS:000388610500004
J	Nürnberg, GK; LaZerte, BD; Olding, DD				Nürnberg, GK; LaZerte, BD; Olding, DD			An artificially induced Planktothrix rubescens surface bloom in a small kettle lake in Southern Ontario compared to blooms world-wide	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												To combat hypolimnetic anoxia and sediment phosphorus release in a small, mesotrophic kettle take on the Oakridge Moraine north of the Metropolitan Toronto, Southern Ontario, oxygenation and aeration was applied to the hypolimnion alternately during the summer of 1998 until mid-November and then to the entire water column until the end of December. This treatment coincided with the proliferation of a toxic strain of the purple cyanobacterium, Planktothrix rubescens, from almost undetectable values to bloom conditions under ice in the following winter and spring. Although small numbers of P. rubescens have been detected during several years before the treatment, prolonged artificial mixing in the fall and winter of 1998 distributed numerous filaments throughout the water column and to the surface when light was suit-ably low for these algae to survive and grow. Algae were supported by simultaneous entrainment and mixing of nutrients from the enriched bottom water. Such blooms of P. rubescens and related bluegreens have been found in many lakes with comparable characteristics and during similar episodes like those of the study lake. Lakes were typically stratified, mesotrophic hardwater lakes, with phosphorus levels that have recently been increasing to levels above 20 mug.L-1. Blooms occurred during periods of low light and enhanced mixing, in several cases after treating the take with whole-lake aeration and mixing. Recommendations to prevent such blooms in Lake Wilcox are (1) the discontinuation of artificial mixing during periods of natural destratification in the fall and winter, (2) the prevention of further eutrophication, and (3) the installation of an in-lake treatment, such as hypolimnetic withdrawal, to decrease internal phosphorus loading from anoxic sediment surfaces.

J	Svensson, BW				Svensson, BW			Seasonal fat content fluctuations in a gyrinid beetle:: comparison between an arctic and a temperate zone population (Coleoptera: Gyrinidae)	AQUATIC INSECTS												Seasonal fluctuations in fat content ( percentage of dry body weight) of adult Gyrinus opacus were compared between a lake population at the northern range limit of the species in Greenland ( G) and a rock pool population in south-central Sweden ( S) near its southern range limit. From equally low values at emergence in summer, beetles of both populations accumulated substantial fat reserves, especially during their first weeks as adults. Hardened S-beetles were fatter than G-beetles at time of onset of hibernation. For late emerging ( soft) G-beetles, however, the situation was severe because of an immediate freeze-up of the lake. There was a similar winter fat decline in both populations. During the first month after hibernation there was a significant decrease in fat content of the S-beetles, because they were still utilizing their fat deposits from the previous autumn. This trend was broken at the first emergence peak of chironomids in spring. Hibernating G-beetles used their lesser fat storage to the same extent, and led to some reproductive females reaching extremely low levels of fat. Still lower fat content and smaller body size of beetles in a closely situated small lake to G in early spring shows a between locality variation related to differences in habitat quality at the northern range limit.																			0165-0424					MAR	2005	27	1					11	19		10.1080/01650420400000304	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01650420400000304													WOS:000231567900002

Atlantic Sturgeon Spatial and Temporal Distribution in Minas Passage, Nova Scotia, Canada, a Region of Future Tidal Energy Extraction	PLOS ONE												In the Bay of Fundy, Atlantic sturgeon from endangered and threatened populations in the USA and Canada migrate through Minas Passage to enter and leave Minas Basin. A total of 132 sub-adult and adult Atlantic sturgeon were tagged in Minas Basin during the summers of 2010-2014 using pressure measuring, uniquely coded, acoustic transmitters with a four or eight year life span. The aim of this study was to examine spatial and seasonal distribution of sturgeon in Minas Passage during 2010-2014 and test the hypothesis that, when present, Atlantic sturgeon were evenly distributed from north to south across Minas Passage. This information is important as tidal energy extraction using in-stream, hydrokinetic turbines is planned for only the northern portion of Minas Passage. Electronic tracking data from a total of 740 sturgeon days over four years demonstrated that Atlantic sturgeon used the southern portion of Minas Passage significantly more than the northern portion. Sturgeon moved through Minas Passage at depths mostly between 15 and 45 m (n = 10,116; mean = 31.47 m; SD = 14.88). Sturgeon mean swimming depth was not significantly related to bottom depth and in deeper regions they swam pelagically. Sturgeon predominately migrated inward through Minas Passage during spring, and outward during late summer-autumn. Sturgeon were not observed in Minas Passage during winter 2012-2013 when monitoring receivers were present. This information will enable the estimation of encounters of Atlantic sturgeon with in-stream hydrokinetic turbines.																			1932-6203					JUL 6	2016	11	7							e0158387	10.1371/journal.pone.0158387	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0158387								27383274					WOS:000379809400046

A permanent connection with the river promotes the use of these water bodies by ichthyofauna as spawning grounds, shelter for fry, feeding and wintering grounds. The aim of this study was to determine which rheophilic species inhabit oxbow lakes and how environmental conditions affect habitat selection and fish behavior. Analyses were conducted on six oxbow lakes of the Warta River in the Kolo-Poznan section. Fish and water samples were collected for three years, in spring, summer and late autumn. Variation in environmental conditions in the analyzed water bodies results in a considerable diversity of the ichthyofauna, including rheophilic species, in individual seasons of the year. In the course of the study, nine rheophilic fish species were recorded, including four from the lithophilic reproductive guild having the highest environmental requirements. Relative abundance of rheophilic species in the dominance structure ranged from 0 to 100%, depending on the reservoir and seasons, with an average of 7% for all catches. For comparison, their relative abundance in the adjacent parts of the river was 12 and 23%.

Seasonal variability of invertebrate prey diet and selectivity of the dominant forage fishes in Lake Huron	FOOD WEBS												Predators can shift their diets and even selectivity in response to changing environmental conditions. Since the early 2000s, Lake Huron experienced major food-web shifts that have caused changes in the prey availability and quality for consumers at multiple trophic levels. Previous studies have reported declining energetic condition for key planktivorous fishes, such as bloater (Coregonus hoyi) and rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), which play a key role in supporting commercially and recreationally important piscivorous fishes. To improve understanding of how changes in the invertebrate prey community have influenced foraging by rainbow smelt and bloater, we processed diets and calculated selectivity along two transects in Lake Huron during 2012. Diet proportions for both species varied seasonally and consisted of mostly calanoid copepods during spring and summer, specifically Leptodiaptomus sicilis and diaptomid copepodites, and Daphnia galeata mendotae in autumn. Bloater selectivity varied primarily by season and transect with Limnocalanus macrurus or Mysis diluviana as the most preferred prey during spring, Chironomidae pupae or L. sicilis during summer, and Chironomidae pupae or Mysis during autumn. Rainbow smelt selectivity was consistent across seasons and transects with Mysis being the species most commonly selected and Bythotrephes longimanus the second most. Both fish species selected for relatively large invertebrate prey, but declining densities of Mysis and the benthic amphipod Diporeia have caused fish to consume smaller prey with much lower energy density. Our results illustrate how food-web changes underlie the reduced energetic condition of bloater and rainbow smelt, which ultimately reduces the growth potential for recreationally and commercially important piscivorous fish.					; Warner, David/C-8858-2009	Dieter, Patricia M./0000-0003-1686-2679; 													2352-2496					MAR	2022	30								e00215	10.1016/j.fooweb.2021.e00215	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fooweb.2021.e00215		DEC 2021											WOS:000749946000001

Furthermore, the observational data record is often short. This makes it difficult to assess the relationships between external forcing factors and their impact on the biological succession. Cycle-stationary maximum cross-covariance analysis (MCCA) allows the effects of seasonality to be modeled in a flexible way, and we describe this statistical technique in detail. MCCA offers an objective method to approximate the high-dimensional total cross-covariance structure by defining "weighting" patterns. With a predictor set of reduced dimension, a suitable regression between forcing variables and ecological response variables can be set up. Cyclo-stationary MCCA is used here to analyze the influence of meteorological variables (air temperature, wind speed, global radiation, humidity, and precipitation) on 13 biological and biogeochemical indicator variables of Plussee, a small lake in northern Germany. The main weather influence on the indicator variables was found to be connected to winter temperature. From the covariance structure the following major signals were detected to be related to higher winter temperature: a more intense spring algal maximum, a higher zooplankton biomass during the algal maximum, a less intense loss of nutrients to the hypolimnion, a higher summer bloom together with changes in the nutrient concentrations, and stronger oxygen consumption in autumn.																			0012-9658	1939-9170				JUN	2000	81	6					1720	1735		10.2307/177319	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/177319													WOS:000087446100020

Boreal lakes moderate seasonal and diurnal temperature variation and perturb atmospheric circulation: analyses in the Community Earth System Model 1 (CESM1)	TELLUS SERIES A-DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We used a lake thermal physics model recently coupled into the Community Earth System Model 1 (CESM1) to study the effects of lake distribution in present and future climate. Under present climate, correcting the large underestimation of lake area in CESM1 (denoted CCSM4 in the configuration used here) caused 1 degrees C spring decreases and fall increases in surface air temperature throughout large areas of Canada and the US. Simulated summer surface diurnal air temperature range decreased by up to 4 degrees C, reducing CCSM4 biases. These changes were much larger than those resulting from prescribed lake disappearance in some present-day permafrost regions under doubled-CO2 conditions. Correcting the underestimation of lake area in present climate caused widespread high-latitude summer cooling at 850 hPa. Significant remote changes included decreases in the strength of fall Southern Ocean westerlies. We found significantly different winter responses when separately analysing 45-yr subperiods, indicating that relatively long simulations are required to discern the impacts of surface changes on remote conditions. We also investigated the surface forcing of lakes using idealised aqua-planet experiments which showed that surface changes of 2 degrees C in the Northern Hemisphere extra-tropics could cause substantial changes in precipitation and winds in the tropics and Southern Hemisphere. Shifts in the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone were opposite in sign to those predicted by some previous studies. Zonal mean circulation changes were consistent in character but much larger than those occurring in the lake distribution experiments, due to the larger magnitude and more uniform surface forcing in the idealised aqua-planet experiments.

Johnson Pond and Lake Sheelar lie in north Florida. Lakes Tulane and Verona are in south-central Florida. All four lakes were strongly stratified thermally in summer and weakly stratified or isothermal during winter. Sheelar displayed winter isothermy at similar to 17 degrees C and Johnson Pond at similar to 13 degrees C. The southern lakes were isothermal at similar to 19 degrees C. Surface water temperatures exceeded 30 degrees C in all lakes in summer. Annual heat budgets for each lake were calculated twice, using heat loss from summer to winter and heat gain from winter to summer in 2006 and 2007. Three lakes showed similar annual heat budgets despite differences in latitude and size: Sheelar (9069 and 9955 cal cm(-2)), Tulane (8459 and 9319 cal cm(-2)), and Verona (7948 and 8444 cal cm(-2)). Johnson Pond displayed lower values of 5105 and 6049 cal cm(-2). Johnson Pond had lower isothermic winter temperatures. It also had smaller annual heat budgets because heat is not transferred effectively to great depth in the take during the period when thermal stratification is established. This is a consequence of wind protection by surrounding vegetation, short fetch, and high amounts of dissolved and suspended material in the water. All four study basins have annual heat budgets that are low compared with temperate lakes of similar size and depth, but similar to values for many tropical basins. During winter circulation, oxygen penetrates to great depths in Lakes Sheelar, Tulane and Verona. The entire water column was oxygenated in Lake Sheelar during winter isothermy. Lakes Tulane and Verona, however, failed to oxygenate completely during winter mixing. Furthermore, oxygen was quickly depleted in deep waters of these relatively unproductive lakes after the onset of thermal stratification in spring. Johnson Pond was nearly completely deoxygenated during winter mixing. This was probably a consequence of dilution of oxygen in surface waters by deeper anoxic water and consumption of O(2) by reduced ions that accumulate in the hypolimnion.

J	Nassar, MZA; Fahmy, MA				Nassar, Mohamed Zein Alabdein; Fahmy, Mamdouh Amin			Effects of some environmental factors on the population density and species diversity of phytoplankton in Bitter Lakes, Egypt	RENDICONTI LINCEI-SCIENZE FISICHE E NATURALI												The assessment of the phytoplankton community structure in the Bitter Lakes during 2012-2013 indicated about 150 species belonging to 73 genera. These are classified as 89 species of diatoms, 27 dinoflagellates, 19 chlorophytes, 13 cyanophytes, and one of euglenophytes as well as one rare species of silicoflagellates. Diatoms were the leading and most dominant group forming about 81.67 % of the total number of individuals due to the high flourishing of Rhizosolenia alata variety gracillima, Thalassionema nitzschioides, Skeletonema costatum, Thalassiothrix frauenfeldii, and Chaetoceros lorenzianus. Abu-Rommanh was the most productive area in the phytoplankton counts, whereas the area of Shandoura was the lowest productive one, coincided principally with the types and amounts of pollutants as well as the highest human and fishing activities at this area of the Bitter Lakes. Seasonally, summer 2012 was the most productive season with an average of 8464 unit/L followed by autumn 2012 with an average of 6199 unit/L. Whereas, the winter and spring of 2013 were observed with approximately similar averages of 5527 and 5194 unit/L, respectively. Analysis of diversity indicated that the Bitter Lakes sustained good variations of phytoplankton species. It fluctuated between the averages of 2.4 in the spring of 2013 and 3.21 during the autumn of 2012, which may reflect the healthy state and ecosystem stability of Bitter Lakes during autumn. The results revealed that the total density of phytoplankton slightly increased from the average counts of 6286 unit/L during 2002-2003 to 6346 unit/L in the present study, while the number of species significantly increased from 108 species in 2002-2003 to 150 species in the present study. This may be due to the relative increase in the eutrophication state of the Bitter Lakes during the last 10 years. Generally, the seasonal fluctuations of phytoplankton positively correlated with the water temperature (22-24.2 A degrees C), dissolved oxygen (4.85-11.11 mg/L), and reactive nitrate (0.04-1.00 mg/L), but it inversely correlated with the ammonium (0.05-0.2 mg/L) and reactive silicate (0.10-1.44 mg/L). The stepwise multiple regressions indicated that the reactive silicate, nitrate, and ammonium were the most effective factors that controlled the seasonal fluctuations and species diversity of phytoplankton in the Bitter Lakes during 2012-2013.						nassar, mohamed/0000-0002-8972-216X; Fahmy, Mamdouh/0000-0001-8536-9090; nassar, mohamed/0000-0003-4681-2656													2037-4631	1720-0776				JUN	2016	27	2					291	298		10.1007/s12210-015-0476-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12210-015-0476-4													WOS:000376410300014

Contrasting Winter Versus Summer Microbial Communities and Metabolic Functions in a Permafrost Thaw Lake	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Permafrost thawing results in the formation of thermokarst lakes, which are biogeochemical hotspots in northern landscapes and strong emitters of greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere. Most studies of thermokarst lakes have been in summer, despite the predominance of winter and ice-cover over much of the year, and the microbial ecology of these waters under ice remains poorly understood. Here we first compared the summer versus winter microbiomes of a subarctic thermokarst lake using DNA-and RNA-based 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and qPCR. We then applied comparative metagenomics and used genomic bin reconstruction to compare the two seasons for changes in potential metabolic functions in the thermokarst lake microbiome. In summer, the microbial community was dominated by Actinobacteria and Betaproteobacteria, with phototrophic and aerobic pathways consistent with the utilization of labile and photodegraded substrates. The microbial community was strikingly different in winter, with dominance of methanogens, Planctomycetes, Chloroflexi and Deltaproteobacteria, along with various taxa of the Patescibacteria/Candidate Phyla Radiation (Parcubacteria, Microgenomates, Omnitrophica, Aminicenantes). The latter group was underestimated or absent in the amplicon survey, but accounted for about a third of the metagenomic reads. The winter lineages were associated with multiple reductive metabolic processes, fermentations and pathways for the mobilization and degradation of complex organic matter, along with a strong potential for syntrophy or cross-feeding. The results imply that the summer community represents a transient stage of the annual cycle, and that carbon dioxide and methane production continue through the prolonged season of ice cover via a taxonomically distinct winter community and diverse mechanisms of permafrost carbon transformation.					; Kalenitchenko, Dimitri/ABF-3371-2020; Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019; Cruaud, Perrine/U-9631-2019; Lovejoy, Connie/A-3756-2008	Vigneron, Adrien/0000-0003-3552-8369; Cruaud, Perrine/0000-0001-8628-3600; Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938; Kalenitchenko, Dimitri/0000-0002-8316-0784; 														1664-302X				JUL 16	2019	10								1656	10.3389/fmicb.2019.01656	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01656								31379798					WOS:000475797400001
J	SOSNOWSKA, J				SOSNOWSKA, J			QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE STUDIES ON PHYTOPLANKTON AND CHLOROPHYLL CONTENT IN PELAGIC WATER OF LAKE ZARNOWIECKIE IN 1974	ACTA SOCIETATIS BOTANICORUM POLONIAE												Species composition of phytoplankton, its biomass, share of nannoplankton, and concentration of chlorophyll and pheophytin in phytoplankton and nannoplankton were assessed, based on the materials collected from 2 pelagic stations of Lake Zarnowieckie [Poland] from 30th March to 6 Dec., 1974. Average and maximal values of phytoplankton biomass (4-5 and 10-11 mg/l, respectively), as well as the concentration of chlorophyll (1.7-10.0 .mu.g/l together with pheophytin) point to slightly advanced eutrophication of the lake. Sharing of nannoplankton in total phytoplankton biomass was low (as a rule below 3%) with an increase to 15% only in spring. The eutrophic character of the lake is due to: relatively slight taxonomic differentiation of phytoplankton (164 taxa), predominence of Cyanophyceae in summer and of Bacillariophyceae in spring and autumn and also seasonal succession of algae.																			0001-6977	2083-9480					1977	46	3					403	422																WOS:A1977ES25400002

In general, vertical water temperature profiles in shallow subtropical lakes can vary significantly because typhoons frequently induce vertical mixing across the entire lake due to strong winds and rapid flushing from river inputs. Since C fluxes are driven by dissolved inorganic C (DIC), it is necessary to understand stratification's influence on DIC dynamics in shallow subtropical lakes. Therefore, we aimed to clarify the impact of stratification on DIC in Yuan-Yang Lake, a typical shallow subtropical mountain lake, by developing a net ecosystem production (NEP) model. We measured the vertical profile of water temperature and DIC once or twice a month from July 2004 to December 2017. We applied a three-dimensional hydrological model to estimate residence time and NEP, which revealed that large amounts of DIC are stored in the lower layer from spring to summer due to the suppression of vertical mixing by stratification. In autumn and winter, the lake was well mixed, and DIC was evenly distributed in the water column due to vertical mixing. This was confirmed by vertical DIC profiles.

Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis revealed remarkable seasonal fluctuations in bacterio-planktonic composition. A total of 1498 clones were obtained from 16 water samples, and most of clones belonged to the clusters alpha-Proteobacteria, beta-Proteobacteria, gamma-Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, and Cyanobacteria. Among these groups, alpha-Proteobacteria was the identified as most dominant group in spring and summer. However, the structure shifted toward a beta-Proteobacterium-dominant community in autumn and winter. The clone libraries were found having the greatest diversity in winter, and some species only appeared in their specific seasons. The number of operational taxanomic uints (OTUs) predicted for the Lake Erhai ranged from 42.7 to 98.0, significantly lower than the samples from low-altitude lakes. The results of partial redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that environmental factors associated with nitrogen could play an important role in driving the conversion of two major groups in Lake Erhai. The present study indicated that the bacterio-plankton communities of Erhai Lake were similar to other freshwater ecosystems as many sequences showed 93.8% - 100% homology with known sequences found in other freshwater ecosystems, but had many unique characteristics. And also part of communities predicted to be from marine ecosystems.These findings provided fundamental and specofic information on the structure of bacterioplankton and the microfood web in Lake Erhai.

Hydrologic implications of projected changes in rain-on-snow melt for Great Lakes Basin watersheds	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Rain-on-snow (ROS) melt events reduce the amount of water stored in the snowpack while also exacerbating flooding. The hydrologic implications of changing ROS events in a warming climate, however, are still uncertain. This research used a calibrated and validated Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrologic model, modified with energy budget equations to simulate ROS melt and forced with a climate model ensemble representing moderate greenhouse gas concentrations, to simulate changes to ROS melt in the North American Great Lakes Basin from 1960-2069. The changes to ROS events between the historic period (1960-1999) and mid-century (2040-2069) represent an approximately 30 % reduction in melt in warmer, southern subbasins but less than 5 % reduction in melt in colder, northern subbasins. Additionally, proportionally more rainfall reduces the formation of snowpacks, with area-weighted combined winter and spring rain-to-snow ratios rising from approximately 1.5 historically to 1.9 by the mid-21st century. Areas with historic mean combined winter and spring air temperatures lower than -2 C-? have ROS regimes that are resilient to mid-21st century warming projections, but ROS occurrence in areas that have mean combined winter and spring temperatures near the freezing point are sensitive to changing air temperatures. Also, relationships between changes in the timing of ROS melt and water yield endure throughout spring but become weak by summer. As the influence of ROS melt events on hydrological systems is being altered in a changing climate, these conclusions are important to inform adaptive management of freshwater ecosystems and human uses in regions of the globe that are sensitive to changes in ROS events.

Comparison of cropland and forest surface temperatures across the conterminous United States	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Global climate models (GCM) investigating the effects of land cover on climate have found that replacing extra-tropical forest with cropland promotes cooling. We compared cropland and forest surface temperatures across the continental United States in 16 cells that were approximately 1 degrees x 2 degrees using 1 km(2) MODIS land surface temperature (LST) data and land cover from the 0.0009 km(2) National Land Cover Database (NLCD). We found that forest surface temperatures tended to be cooler than cropland surface temperatures. This relationship held for spring, summer, fall, and annually. In winter, cropland surface temperatures were cooler than forest surface temperatures except in the southeastern United States, where forest surface temperatures were also cooler in winter. The difference between cropland and forest surface temperatures was driven by daytime maxima, which tended to be twice as large as differences in nighttime minima. The dominance of daytime maxima was influenced by the degree of continentality. For cells on coastal margins or with a high proportion of inland lakes, differences between cropland and forest nighttime minima tended to be very small. In more continental locations croplands were noticeably cooler at night which often led to insignificant differences between cropland and forest average surface temperatures.

Divergent oxygen trends in ice-covered lakes driven by ice-cover decline and ecological memory	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Dissolved oxygen (DO) is an essential resource in ice-covered lakes, regulating water quality and biodiversity, including the survival of economically important fish species. Most of the world's lakes seasonally freeze, often resulting in oxygen depletion as ice cover inhibits water column ventilation and snow cover limits photosynthesis while respiration continues. Widespread shortening of ice-cover duration in a warmer world might improve winter oxygenation, but this hypothesis remains untested. Here, we performed a systematic analysis of 6.6 million physical and chemical observations from 19,645 lakes in the Northern Hemisphere during 1960 to 2022. Contrary to expectations, under-ice DO trends ranged from significantly negative in small lakes (A(surf) <10 ha) (-0.14 +/- 0.05 mg L-1 decade(-1)) to significantly positive in large lakes (>= 10(4) ha) (0.11 +/- 0.03 mg L-1 decade(-1)). This morphometric scaling emerged partly because ice-cover periods have shortened 2.2 times faster in large lakes compared to small lakes. Hierarchical modeling revealed that in smaller lakes, increasingly oxygen-depleted conditions in summer carried over to the ice-cover season, because fetch size limited wind-driven aeration in fall. As a result of this cross-seasonal ecological memory, under-ice hypoxic zones have expanded. Oxygen trended most negative in small eutrophic and humic lakes with high seasonal oxygen depletion rates. In larger lakes (>= 10(3) ha), negligible summer deoxygenation, prolonged ventilation in fall, and shortening of the oxygen drawdown period in winter explained positive DO trends. However, in the vast majority of seasonally ice-covered lakes, which are small, continued climate warming is likely to exacerbate deoxygenation.					; Weyhenmeyer, Gesa/Y-6135-2019; Jansen, Joachim/IXN-4782-2023; Prairie, Yves/B-9108-2008; del Giorgio, Paul/AAD-1315-2019	Weyhenmeyer, Gesa/0000-0002-4013-2281; 													0027-8424	1091-6490				JUL 2	2025	122	27							e2426140122	10.1073/pnas.2426140122	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2426140122								40601624					WOS:001531511500001
J	Dockendorf, KJ; Allen, MS				Dockendorf, KJ; Allen, MS			Age-0 black crappie abundance and size in relation to Zooplankton density, stock abundance, and water clarity in three Florida lakes	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Crappies Pomoxis spp. are popular sport fishes but are often difficult to manage due to highly variable recruitment. To assess the factors influencing recruitment, we investigated the size and abundance of age-0 black crappie P. nigromaculatus in relation to zooplankton density, adult stock abundance, and water clarity in three productive Florida lakes. Age-0 black crappies were collected at Lakes Wauberg, Lochloosa, and Tarpon by use of surface and bottom trawls during the spring, summer, and fall of 2000 and 2001. Zooplankton abundance was measured concurrently with trawl sampling. Early-summer juvenile abundance was positively related to stock abundance during the previous fall among lakes, indicating a relationship between stock size and juvenile black crappie abundance. Early- sum me juveni le abundance was positively related to juvenile abundance in the fall (i.e., at the end of the first summer), suggesting that year-class strength was set by early summer in all lakes. Lake Lochloosa had the highest crustacean zooplankton abundance in both years. but this lake had the smallest age-0 black crappie size and intermediate age-0 fish abundance, Thus, we found no relationship between crustacean zooplankton density and black crappie size across lakes. Reduced Secchi depths due to high chlorophyll-a values and wind resuspension of sediments may have reduced feeding efficiency for age-0 black crappies at Lake Lochloosa relative to the other lakes. Age-0 black crappie abundance and size during fall were not predicted solely by food availability, stock abundance, or water clarity, suggesting that these factors interacted to influence recruitment through the first year of life.

Distribution, habitat, life cycle and identification of species of Hydrobiini and Hydrophilini (Hydrophilidae: Hydrophilinae)	GREAT LAKES ENTOMOLOGIST												Nine genera and 30 species of Hydrobiini and 3 genera and 12 species of Hydrophilini were found in Wisconsin, including a new species of Laccobius. Life cycles of all species of lentic Hydrobiini were similar; adults overwinter in terrestrial habitats, return to aquatic sites in spring to mate, oviposit adjacent to these sites, and eventually die. The riparian larvae complete development, pupate, and emerge sometime during the summer depending on the species and habitat, and teneral adults disperse to suitable aquatic habitats. Adults enter overwintering sites in late summer or early autumn. Lotic species of Cymbiodyta have a similar life cycle, with larvae probably developing along stream banks. Other lotic species, Crenitis digesta, Hydrobius melaenus, and Sperchopsis tessellata, apparently are semivoltine with both larvae and adults overwintering along margins of streams. In Hydrophilini, life cycles of Hydrochara and Hydrophilus are the same as described above for lentic Hydrobiini, except larvae are aquatic, developing in lentic habitats. Life cycles of Tropisternus also differ in having aquatic larvae; they differ further in having adults that overwinter in aquatic habitats, especially streams, deep ponds, and lakes, which they enter in late summer and autumn. Tropisternus ellipticus is lotic, with larvae and adults inhabiting streams, and larvae completing development in mid-summer. Keys to species of adults are included along with information about each species, which includes distribution and abundance in Wisconsin, range in North America, habitat, life cycle, and notes on identification.																			0090-0222					SUM	1995	28	2					97	126																WOS:A1995TK84500001
J	BOIKOVA, OS				BOIKOVA, OS			HORIZONTAL DISTRIBUTION OF CRUSTACEANS IN LAKE GLUBOKOE	HYDROBIOLOGIA												A study has been made on the distribution of crustaceans along a profile of 6-9 stations from depths of less than 2 m to 20 m, in summer, autumn and early spring. The species composition, abundance, size-frequency distribution, biomass and diurnal dynamics were estimated. Many species abundant in the pelagic zone were found to be absent or scarce out to depths of 5 m. In the daytime, at depths out to 3 m, crustaceans greater than 1.0 mm were seldom found, while those 0.15-0.40 mm long were most abundant. At depths out to 5 m, not only was the total average size of crustceans found to be smaller, but also that of individual species, including small ones: Ceriodaphnia and Chydorus. The biomass of crustaceans in shallow water and in the open lake differs in summer by more than 100 times, and in later autumn and early spring by more than 10 times. At the depth of 1 m, in none of the seasons did it exceed 0.026 mg l-1. All the crustaceans except for nauplii and Chydorus considerably increased in numbers in the shallow water at night. The impoverishment of the littoral plankton in Lake Glubokoe is regarded as a specific case of the well-known phenomenon of ''avoidance of the littoral'' by euplankton (Hutchinson, 1967; Kiselyov, 1980). It is pointed out that there is a possible relationship between diurnal horizontal migrations of plantivorous fish and the impoverishment of plankton near the shore. An attempt has been made to substantiate the assumption that the ''avoidance of the littoral'' by pelagic crustaceans is due to high numbers of fish in shallow water.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				OCT 20	1986	141	1-2					113	123		10.1007/BF00007484	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007484													WOS:A1986F597000012

There are many evapotranspiration models that have been developed and validated but the efficiency is not high enough for poor estimation results or difficult data collection. While, the Shuttleworth-Wallace (S-W) model can consider two coupled sources in a resistance network and some researchers show that the S-W model can receive a good results. In addition, the S-W model is physically-based and all required data are publicly available and can be applied to data-poor or ungauged basins. As such, the S-W model was used to estimate the potential ET of Poyang lake basin for the period 1982 to 2001. The results show that the averaged ET fluctuate at 900 mm and appear an inflexion in 1992. The variation of averaged ET (also ET in particular land cover type) is inconspicuous hi autumn and winter, while prominent in spring and summer. The ET is maximal in July and August and minimal in winter. The interannual distribution form is consistent with the temperature distribution. The spatial distribution of ET is largely uneven with larger values M south than M north and has a close relationship with the distribution of LAI. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, concentrations of transparent exopolymer particles (TEP), chlorophyll, particulate organic carbon (POC), and the species composition of phytoplankton and zooplankton in the ambient water were determined. In addition, the formation of aggregates was studied in laboratory experiments by incubating water samples in rolling tanks. The abundance and composition of aggregates showed a pronounced seasonal and vertical pattern in close relation to phytoplankton and zooplankton dynamics and wind conditions. Numbers of aggregates ranged between <1 and 50 liter(-1), with maximum concentrations at 6 m depth in summer and fall. In spring, the peak of TEP concentration occurred simultaneously with that of lake snow, whereas the peaks in summer and fall followed those of aggregate abundance. More detailed analyses indicated that the role of TEP in aggregate formation varies through out the season. The laboratory experiments revealed an inverse correlation between time of aggregate formation and the concentration of POC. Two different correlations, one for the spring bloom and one for the rest of the year, were established. The results show that multiple mechanisms of aggregate formation occurred throughout the seasons due to variations in source particles and physical conditions.

Relatively high variability in biomass (DM) and chlorophyll a contents in epiphyton on particular plants was noted. Generally, the biomass of epiphytic algae was much higher in spring and autumn than in summer. In total, 335 taxa were found on the studied macrophytes with representatives of the Chlorophyta (143 taxa) and Heterokontophyta class Bacillariophyceae (131 taxa) dominating. The species composition of epiphytic algae was related to host plant and seasons, the highest species richness was observed on Stratiotes aloides in spring and on Potamogeton lucens in autumn. The Jaccard similarity index revealed differentiation of diatom communities between the macrophytes. Our data suggest that in the studied lake S. aloides and P. lucens can provide better habitat conditions for higher numbers of epiphytic taxa, abundances and epiphyton standing crop than Ceratophyllum demersum and Chara spp. can. The dominance of diatom species (e. g. Pseudostaurosira brevistriata (Grun.) Williams & Round, Achnanthidium minutissimum (Kutz.) Czarnecki, and Cocconeis placentula Ehrenb.) that are known as bioindicators of slightly alkaline, sufficiently oxygen-saturated and meso-eutrophic waters corresponds well with the physico-chemical parameters of Lake Skomielno.					; Toporowska, Magdalena/T-9828-2018; Toporowska, Magdalena/AAO-6763-2020; Wojtal, Agata/J-2829-2012	Wojtal, Agata Z./0000-0002-5233-2205; Toporowska, Magdalena/0000-0002-2653-9376; Pawlik-Skowronska, Barbara/0000-0002-6485-2099; 													1730-413X	1897-3191					2008	37	2					51	63		10.2478/v10009-007-0048-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10009-007-0048-8													WOS:000261671600004

The lake is at latitude 65.degree.35''N and at 278 m above sea level. Retention time for the north-basin was 14 d[days], and the south-basin 24 d. Radiation was 79 kcal m-2 yr-1. The temperature amplitude was 18.degree. C yr-1 and 3.degree. C d-1. Average ice-cover was 190 d yr-1. Resuspension is high and varies with depth, and it was 3 times higher in the north than the south basin. Nutrient input was 1.4, 1.5 and 340 g m-2 yr-1 for N, P and Si, respectively. At the outlet the N:P ratio was 8:1. Availability of P seems to limit the phytoplankton production. The phytoplankton succession was: diatoms in spring and autumn, chrysophyceans in early summer and autumn, Anabaena flos-aquae in summer. The relatively low chlorophyll a content was highest during the Anabaena bloom. Diel production was measured at all seasons. High production, due to Anabaena, coincided with high radiation, high temperature and time of ice break. Peak values were similar all years (1971-1976) in south basin. Production was low at other seasons despite considerable biomass. The interrelationship between chlorophyll a, biomass, production and turnover time of phytoplankton is discussed.																			0030-1299	1600-0706					1979	32	1-2					113	138		10.2307/3544223	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3544223													WOS:A1979HJ61200007
J	Jones, JR; Knowlton, MF; An, KG				Jones, JR; Knowlton, MF; An, KG			Trophic state, seasonal patterns and empirical models in South Korean reservoirs	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Data from 59 reservoirs in South Korea, sampled monthly during 1993-2000, showed that about onk-third were mesotrophic, nearly one-half were eutrophic and the remainder were hypereutrophic based on conventional criteria for total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll (Chl) and Secchi depth. Most reservoir; had >1 mg.L-1 total nitrogen (TN) resulting in high mass ratios of TN:TP (range 23 to 243, median 76) relative to many temperate lakes. To compensate, conventional TN criteria were provisionally adjusted upward by about 2.5-times to classify Korean reservoirs uniformly across all trophic state metrics. During the summer monsoon, TP and TN typically peaked in mesotrophic reservoirs and declined in the hypereutrophic group. The inference is that monsoon inflow produces these patterns by increasing non-point external inputs that dominate the nutrient budgets of mesotrophic reservoirs while diluting point-source inputs important in hypereutrophic impoundments. Eutrophic reservoirs showed both response patterns, so that taken in aggregate a seasonal response was not apparent. The log relation between Chl and TP was linear and showed an average yield of Chl per unit of TP on par with other temperate lakes. Seasonally, the Chl TP relation was strongest during summer and weaker during fall-winter which is consistent with increased light-limitation during mixis in these monomictic impoundments. Seasonal development of Chl did not show strong evidence of a spring or fall bloom. About half of the time maximum Chl values were measured during the monsoon or post-monsoon (July-September). Maximum Chl was similar to3 times the annual mean and during summer maximum Chl was similar to double the mean. The log relation between Chl and Secchi depth matched that found in North American lakes and the seasonal phenology for Secchi depth was the opposite of Chl and suspended solids. The analysis confirms that the monsoon is a major source of variation within and among Korean reservoirs.

P concentrations in the receiving lake build up during the winter, ice-cover period and the lake waters become anoxic. Spring flushing is rapid and pronounced; throughout the summer lake P concentrations remain relatively low. Fe-rich groundwater inflow to the lakes promotes sedimentation of P as Fe-phosphates in the spring when lake waters are re-oxygenated. Sedimentation in the receiving lake accounts for 80% of the annual sewage P load and only 12% passes out of the 3-lake chain studied.																			0049-6979	1573-2932					1980	14	DEC					331	337		10.1007/BF00291846	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00291846													WOS:A1980KY53700026

Samples of fish at ten stations were taken by electroshocker once a month, from January to December, 1996. The fish species whose food composition in the gut was examined in this study were: Tilapia zillii, Gambusia affinis, Clarias gariepinus, Cyprinus carpio, Pseudophoxinus kervillei, Acanthobrama lissneri, Hemigrammocapoeta nana and Oreochromis aureus. Food components were deter-mined qualitatively and quantitatively. Assessment of the organism biomass in the gut contents was based on available data of phytoplankton and zooplankton. The food of G. affinis changed during the year, consisting high level of algae in winter and spring, and insects and crustaceans in summer. In T. zillii, a high percentage of algae were found in winter, and a high percentage of plants in summer. The food of H. nana consisted mainly of phytoplankton, but included high plants during most months: P. kervillei ingested mainly insects and crustaceans, with a high percentage of Daphnia spp.; and the diet of C. gariepinus comprised fish and invertebrates species, which varied with the seasons. C, carpio ate mainly invertebrates; O. aureus are vegetarian, and A. lissneri fed on both animals and plants.																			0018-8158						1998	380						49	57		10.1023/A:1003225210226	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003225210226													WOS:000078946700006
J	Xin, YF; Liu, G; Jin, QH				Xin Yu-Fei; Liu Ge; Jin Qi-Hua			Individual Variations of Winter Surface Air Temperature over Northwest and Northeast China and Their Respective Preceding Factors	ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCE LETTERS												Based on monthly mean surface air temperature (SAT) from 71 stations in northern China and NCEP/NCAR and NOAA-CIRES (Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences) twentieth century reanalysis data, the dominant modes of winter SAT over northern China were explored. The results showed that there are two modes that account for a majority of the total variance over northern China. The first mode is unanimously colder (warmer) over the whole of northern China. The second mode is characterized by a dipole structure that is colder (warmer) over Northwest China (NWC) and warmer (colder) over Northeast China (NEC), accounting for a fairly large proportion of the total variance. The two components constituting the second mode, the individual variations of winter SAT over NWC and NEC and their respective preceding factors, were further investigated. It was found that the autumn SAT anomalies are closely linked to persistent snow cover anomalies over Eurasia, showing the delayed effects on winter climate over northern China. Specifically, the previous autumn SAT anomalies over the Lake Baikal (LB; 50-60 degrees N, 85-120 degrees E) and Mongolian Plateau (MP; 42-52 degrees N, 80-120 degrees E) regions play an important role in adjusting the variations of winter SAT over NWC and NEC, respectively. The previous autumn SAT anomaly over the MP region may exert an influence on the winter SAT over NEC through modulating the strength and location of the East Asian major trough. The previous autumn SAT over the LB region may modulate winter westerlies at the middle and high latitudes of Asia and accordingly affects the invasion of cold air and associated winter SAT over NWC.																			1674-2834	2376-6123					2014	7	4					346	351		10.3878/j.issn.1674-2834.14.0010	http://dx.doi.org/10.3878/j.issn.1674-2834.14.0010													WOS:000433715900016

Taking total nitrogen (TN) of Biliuhe reservoir in Northeast China as an example, we developed a model to simulate TN accumulation characteristics influenced by ice and sediments during the freezing period (NACISF), and quantified contributions of TN from ice and sediments. Model parameters of ice and sediments were determined by laboratory freeze-up simulation experiment and sediment release flux simulation experiment, and water quality data were obtained from field investigations. Results showed that the annual average amount of TN input during the ice-covered period from 2015 to 2020 was 220.77 t, the output was 400.11 t, and the accumulated amount was 589.52 t. TN excluded from ice and released from sediments contributed 8.12% and 7.17% of the total TN inputs in winter, respectively. Analysis showed that the TN excluded from ice was positively correlated with ice thickness and initial TN concentration. The maximum ice thickness of Biliuhe reservoir had a 13 year cyclic feature, and the proportion of TN excluded from ice to the total TN inputs in different periods ranged from 10.68% to 17.30% (mean 13.18%). Meanwhile, TN accumulated seasonally as summer > autumn > winter > spring. The TN exclusion effect in 2050 would be weakened when considering the combined effects of climate change and human activities, with a reduction of about 40.85% compared to the current. It is concluded that the NACISF model took into account the influences of both ice and sediments, which provided a detailed understanding of the accumulation characteristics of TN during freezing period, and had important reference significance for water quality management in winter.

Highest concentrations of PCBs in the mussel were found in the Westerschelde estuary, with much lower concentrations in the Oosterschelde and the brackish lake Grevelingenmeer. Spatial differences were strongly related to salinity; lower concentrations were found at the more saline stations, pointing to freshwater inputs as being the origin of the PCBs in mussels. The PCB concentration in mussels, on the basis of dry or total weight, in general increased during summer, autumn and winter and decreased strongly during spring. The strong decrease is related to the spawning of gametes. Seasonal changes to the PCB concentrationon the basis of the dry weight were not related to changes in the fat content or the condition of the animals. Only PCBs on a fat basis were negatively related to fat content, indicating a dilution of PCBs during seasonal fat accumulation and concentration of PCBs during fat utilization, in such a way that the total PCB concentration in the animal remains the same. It seems that, besides reproduction, equilibrium partitioning is the most probable mechanism that determines the PCB content of mussels.

To evaluate the importance of CO2 and CH4 emissions during late winter and spring among the whole year, surface water CO2 and CH4 concentrations were measured with the headspace method in ten thermokarst lakes and ponds in 2020-2021 on the TP. The concentrations of CH4 and CO2 under ice in winter (CH4, 1.05-127.16 & mu;mol/L, CO2, 13.24-95.57 & mu;mol/L) were 3-4 orders of magnitude and several times higher than those in summer (CH4, 0.02-2.34 & mu;mol/L, CO2, 7.26-49.18 & mu;mol/L), respectively. The CH4 concentrations and fluxes during ice-melt increased with as the depth of the thermokarst lakes and ponds increased. However, the variation in CO2 concentration was not significant in depth. Snowfall events played an important role in influencing gas exchange during ice-melt. In the ten lakes researched, 42.2% and 19.2% of the annual CH4 and CO2 fluxes occurred during ice-melt, respectively. Our results indicated that CH4 and CO2 accumulation in winter should be considered when evaluating annual carbon budgets in thermokarst lakes and ponds on the TP and similarly high fluxes during icemelt might occur in other thermokarst lakes and ponds.

J	Goedkoop, W; Sonesten, L; Markensten, H; Ahlgren, G				Goedkoop, W; Sonesten, L; Markensten, H; Ahlgren, G			Fatty acid biomarkers show dietary differences between dominant chironomid taxa in Lake Erken	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. In this field study, diatom-specific and bacteria-specific fatty acids were used as biomarkers to evaluate the differences in diet between Chironomus plumosus (a spring-emerging cohort) and C. anthracinus (an autumn-emerging cohort), and Procladius spp. Furthermore, total lipid content of Chironomus larvae was analysed. 2. Individual dry mass of the spring cohort of C. plumosus rapidly increased during spring and early summer. Surprisingly, the autumn-emerging cohort showed remarkably little growth over the same time interval. The individual dry mass of C, anthracinus initially declined in early spring, but then increased during April and May. 3. Accumulation of the diatom-specific fatty acid palmitoleic acid (16 :1 omega 7) during spring was much higher in C. plumosus (> 3-fold increase) than in C. anthracinus (1.5-fold). Conversely, the bacterial indicating iso form of septadecanoic acid (17 : 0i) was higher in C, anthracinus than in the spring-emerging cohort of C. plumosus. This shows that C, plumosus assimilates energy from the spring diatom bloom to a greater degree, whereas C. anthracinus feeds more exclusively on detritus in the sediment. 4. Concentrations of 17: 0i in Procladius larvae were 0.54 +/- 0.13 mg g(-1), i.e. consistently higher than for both Chironomus taxa, indicating that this predator gains a relatively high fraction of its energy through detrital pathways (from bacteria). 5. These results show that fatty acid biomarkers can be an appropriate tool to detect differences in larval diet between coexisting chironomid species, between two closely related Chironomus species and between different cohorts. 6. The different feeding modes of both Chironomus species may be important for among-lake distribution patterns, with filter-feeding C. plumosus being dominant in relatively shallow lakes and deposit-feeding C. anthracinus more common in deeper lakes with stable stratifications. This conjecture was supported by a compilation of data from Lake Malaren.																			0046-5070					AUG	1998	40	1					135	143																WOS:000075462200012

A better understanding of the growth and drivers of settlement of zebra mussel is necessary for a more efficient management of this invasive species, but seasonal data are still relatively scant. We monitored the seasonal changes in settlement rates, density, and growth of zebra mussel in artificial substrates over 1 year in Cardiff Bay (United Kingdom), an artificial amenity lake invaded by zebra mussels in 2004, where the species is rapidly expanding. Mean settlement rates varied from 4,200 to 6,200 mussel m(-2)over June to September mirroring changes in water temperature, and peaked at 17,960 mussels m(-2), the highest density reported in Britain. Density was highest at the deepest panels (3 m). Growth varied significantly among sampling stations, taking place during the summer and ceasing during winter and spring. Mixture analysis reveals the existence of multiple cohorts displaying different growth and settlement rates that follow different density dependent mechanisms, being positive density-dependent at low densities, and negative density-dependent at high densities. We suggest this creates the conditions necessary for source and sink metapopulations to develop which may need to be considered in management. Targeting mussels for removal in deep waters during the summer and early autumn might prove beneficial, but the existence of contrasting density-dependent mechanisms suggests that removal may be beneficial or counterproductive depending on local conditions.					de Leaniz, Carlos/AAQ-4171-2020; Consuegra, Sofia/G-1788-2010	Consuegra, Sofia/0000-0003-4403-2509; Rolla, Matteo/0000-0003-4045-8289													2296-701X					JUN 9	2020	8								159	10.3389/fevo.2020.00159	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2020.00159													WOS:000543472200001

In the arid Pacific southwestern United States (PSW), which includes southern California, there exist a variety of Holocene records that can be used to infer past winter conditions (moisture and/or temperature). Holocene records of summer climate, however, are rare from the PSW. In the future, climate changes due to anthropogenic forcing are expected to increase the severity of drought in the already water stressed PSW. Hot droughts are of considerable concern as summer temperatures rise. As a result, understanding how summer conditions changed in the past is critical to understanding future predictions under varied climate forcings. Here, we present a c. 10.9 kcal BP delta O-18((calcite)) record from Lake Elsinore, California, interpreted to reflect delta O-18((lake water)) values as controlled by over-water evaporation from summer-to-early fall. Our results reveal three millennial scale intervals: (1) the highly evaporative Early Holocene (10.55-6.65 kcal BP), (2) the less evaporative Mid-Holocene (6.65-2.65 kcal BP); and (3) the evaporative Late Holocene (2.65-0.55 kcal BP). These results are coupled with an inferred winter precipitation runoff (sand content) record from Kirby et al. (2010). Using these data together, we estimate the duration and severity of centennial-scale Holocene droughts and pluvials (e.g., high delta O-18((calcite)) values plus low sand content = drought and vice versa). Furthermore, the coupled delta O-18((calcite)) and sand data provide a generalized Holocene lake level history. The most severe, long-lasting droughts (i.e., maximum summer-to-early fall evaporation and minimum winter precipitation runoff) occur in the Early Holocene. Fewer, less severe, and shorter duration droughts occurred during the Mid-Holocene as pluvials became more common. Droughts return with less severity and duration in the Late Holocene. Notably, the Little Ice Age is characterized as the wettest period during the Late Holocene.

J	Martin-Puertas, C; Brauer, A; Dulski, P; Brademann, B				Martin-Puertas, Celia; Brauer, Achim; Dulski, Peter; Brademann, Brian			Testing climate-proxy stationarity throughout the Holocene: an example from the varved sediments of Lake Meerfelder Maar (Germany)	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Lake Meerfelder Maar (Germany) provides a varved record from the Last Glacial/Interglacial transition back to ca 1500 years BP. This study shows results for the Holocene sequence from new cores collected in 2009 based on varve counting, microfacies and micro-XRF analyses. The main goal of combining those analyses is to provide a new approach for interpreting long-term palaeolimnological proxy data and testing the climate proxy stationarity throughout the current interglacial period. Varve counting provides a new independent Holocene chronology (MFM2012) with an estimated counting error of 1 -0.5% and supported by C-14 dating. Varve structure and thickness and geochemical composition of the varves give information about the main environmental processes that affect the lake and its catchment as well as the possible climate variability behind. Varves are couplets of i) a spring/summer laminae composed of monospecific diatom blooms and ii) an autumn/winter sub-layer made of minerogenic material and reworked sediments. Thickness of the varves and sub-layers reflect lake variability and allow seasons to be distinguished as well as seasonal proxies. Changes in the winter minerogenic influx into the lake are reflected by Ti intensities and the Si/Ti ratio as an indicator for diatom concentration, which can be used as a proxy for water circulation during the early spring. Long-term variability of geochemical composition shows a reduction of the detrital material input (Ti) at 5000 varve yrs BP and a visible sensitivity to water mixing (Si/Ti) during the Late Holocene. Variations of Ti intensities during the early and mid-Holocene do not show a clear relationship with climate. In contrast, higher values of the Si/Ti ratio together with thicker varves have been interpreted as wind-stress phases, which coincide with centennial variability of European cold/wet episodes during the late Holocene. Our findings show that a long-term change in the lake and/or variability of the climate system can influence proxy sensitivity of a lacustrine record. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To get insight into how adult perch used and selected their habitat in an environment subject to water-level (WL) fluctuations, 21 perch were continuously tracked using acoustic telemetry over 2 years in the Bariousses Reservoir (France). The different available habitats were characterized by depth classes and substrate types, presence of emerging trees and presence of tree stumps in the littoral zone. We showed that perch habitat preferences were strongly dependent on the season, except for substrate type, and in line with their habitat use. Surprisingly we did not find any influence of the WL which, however, reduced the structural complexity of the littoral zone when lowering. In spring and summer, whatever the WL, we observed a strong preference for the littoral zone and complex habitats. In autumn and winter, perch migrated into deeper waters. However, the individual variability of the habitat preferences was quite high. This type of research helps to understand the spatial ecology of fish and provides useful guidance to hydromorphological restoration for fish populations.					westrelin, samuel/JEO-8076-2023; Christine, Argillier/Z-1282-2019	TISSOT, Laurence/0000-0001-5689-3766; Berges, Laurent/0000-0003-0408-7900													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR	2018	809	1					121	139		10.1007/s10750-017-3454-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-017-3454-2													WOS:000424203000011

The lake is used as a reservoir for the surrounding ricefield cultivation. It is continuously dominated by three filamentous blue-green algae, Planktothrix agardhii, Pseudanabaena galeata and Geitlerinema sp. Horizontal differences of the phytoplankton were less important than annual and seasonal variations. An annual increasing trend was observed for Planktolyngbya subtilis, Planktolyngbya contorta, Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, Microcystis incerta, Nitzschia palea var. tenuirostris and Rhodomonas lacustris var. nannoplanctica, whereas Anabaenopsis elenkinii, Scenedesmus acuminatus, Scenedesmus quadricauda and Cyclotella meneghiniana showed an opposite trend. This pattern seems related to the increase of nitrogen and phosphorus loading in the lake and certain hydrological changes occurred in the latter years of the study. Seasonal pattern of the subdominant species showed the presence of Cyclotella meneghiniana, Scenedesmus species and Chlamydomonas spp. in spring, during moderate water renovation rates and phosphate availability. Periodicity shifted to blue-green algae and Nitzschia species in summer and early autumn, during reduced phosphate levels and initial low but later high water renewal. Autumn and winter species, such as Monoraphidium contortum, Nitzschia gracilis, Rhodomonas lacustris var. nannoplanctica and Cryptomonas erosa, were mainly related to light intensity and temperature. Although the lake has a typical hypertrophic phytoplankton assemblage, the general seasonal variation of the species is similar to that often described in temperate lakes. Diatom species composition differs to that cited in other shallow hypertrophic lakes of Europe.

Nearshore, ciliates increased from less than 1 g .cntdot. m-2 in early spring to a maximum of about 5 g .cntdot. m-2 (wet weight) inside the thermal bar in late May and early June. Summer values varied around 2 g .cntdot. m-2 and declined event further in October. Offshore ciliate biomass was relatively constant; the observed range was only 2.8-6.5 g .cntdot. m-2. Early spring biomass was much higher than nearshore, suggesting that a significant population persists through the winter, but the spring biomass increase was later. Although biomass concentration was greater in the epilimnion, on an areal basis most of the population resided in the hypolimnion. The hypolimnetic population declined during the summer period of thermal stratification. The observed number of taxa ranged from 15 to 30 per sample. Most had distinct seasonal and vertical distributions. The majority appear to be algivores, but the role of ciliates in the food web of Lake Ontario remains largely unknown. Their biomass is comparable with that of metazoan zooplankton, and with their higher metabolic rates, they probably perform much more of the total grazing.

J	Salmaso, N; Braioni, M				Salmaso, Nico; Braioni, Maria G.			Factors controlling the seasonal development and distribution of the phytoplankton community in the lowland course of a large river in Northern Italy (River Adige)	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												The principal environmental factors influencing the seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton were examined from September 1997 to July 1998 in three stations along a 26-km stretch of the lowland course of River Adige (northeast Italy). Nutrient concentrations did not appear to be limiting for the phytoplankton growth. Annual minimum concentrations of reactive and total phosphorus, and dissolved inorganic nitrogen were 22 mu g P l-1, 63 mu g P l-1 and 0.9 mg N l-1, respectively. The most critical forcing factors were physical variables, mainly water discharge and other variables related to hydrology, i.e. suspended solids and turbidity, which acted negatively and synchronously by diluting phytoplankton cells and decreasing light availability. Higher algal biomass was recorded in early spring, in conditions of lower flow velocity and increasing water temperature. In late spring and summer, higher water discharge caused a decrease in phytoplankton biomass. Conversely, low algal biomass in late autumn and winter, during low discharge, was mainly related to low water temperatures and shorter photoperiod. Physical constraints had a significant and measurable effect not only on the development of total biomass, but also on the temporal dynamics of the phytoplankton community. Abiotic and biotic variables showed a comparable temporal development in the three sampling stations. The small number of instances of spatial differences in phytoplankton abundance during the period of lower flow velocity were related to the increasing importance of biological processes and accumulation of phytoplankton biomass.

J	SEELBACH, PW				SEELBACH, PW			POPULATION BIOLOGY OF STEELHEAD IN A STABLE-FLOW, LOW-GRADIENT TRIBUTARY OF LAKE-MICHIGAN	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												I examined the characteristics and dynamics of a population of wild steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss in the Little Manistee River, an extremely stable-flow, low-gradient (sandy) tributary of Lake Michigan. I monitored autumn parr populations by electrofishing (1981-1983), and I monitored spring emigrant populations at a weir near the river mouth (1982-1984) and both autumn- and spring-returning adults at this weir (1979-1987). Relative to other Great Lakes populations, steelhead in the Little Manistee River had several notable characteristics that are probably linked to abundant groundwater and stable flows: (1) high abundances of age-1 parr, smolts, and adults, (2) constant autumn age-1 parr densities, (3) few emigrant parr, (4) fast growth when in the stream environment, and (5) relatively late age at maturity (after 3 years in the lake). An excessive sand bed load occurs in the low-gradient sections of the river, limiting gravel spawning areas to higher-gradient sections. This limited spawning area likely caused the relatively low abundance of age-0 parr, and may also be a factor in late age at maturity. Abundance and age structure of returning adults varied because of (1) variable survival during the presmolt winter (13-90%), (2) variable survival from smolt to maiden adult (6-29% for spring-run maiden spawners), and (3) variable survival to repeat spawn (3-58%). Most adults returning from a marked smolt cohort originated in the Little Manistee River (mean +/- 95% confidence limit, 71 +/- 28%). Management of such populations needs to focus on protecting and enhancing the stream environment, and on managing sport harvest. Modeling population dynamics will require development of long-term data sets.																			0002-8487					MAR	1993	122	2					179	198		10.1577/1548-8659(1993)122<0179:PBOSIA>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1993)122<0179:PBOSIA>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1993LL92100002

Long term creel survey and gill netting sampling programs were used to measure characteristics of the smallmouth bass fishery and recruitment patterns of the smallmouth bass population. Creel survey results found total smallmouth bass catch approximately doubled from 1988 to 2000. Both the annual spring and summer-fall smallmouth bass catch (kept + released) and fishing effort totals both expanded following the establishment of spring bass angling regulations. However, the smallmouth bass harvest remained relatively static throughout 13 years of observation, despite the addition of approximately 1,000 bass to the annual harvest with the onset of springtime bass angling regulations. We also found a relationship between mean June-August water temperature during the age-0 life stage for smallmouth bass and subsequent recruitment to the adult population (r(2)= 0.67 and p = 0.002). Following a doubling in observed fishing effort and catch-and-release angling, smallmouth bass recruitment closely matched the patterns expected based on mean summer water temperature. We conclude that the observed increases in smallmouth bass catch and angling effort since establishing the early black bass season have remained modest relative to the smallmouth bass resource in the New York waters of Lake Erie and that the objectives of spring black bass season had been achieved.																			0892-2284		1-888569-38-7				2002	31						603	614																WOS:000180817600050

During 1971-1975 the P concentration averaged 27 .mu.g/l, in contrast to the prediversion (1964-1966) concentration of 33 .mu.g/l, and may be equilibrating near the predicted steady state concentration of 22 .mu.g/l. Neither phytoplankton biomass or Secchi visibility has changed following diversion; the blue green component of the phytoplankton decreased by nearly 50%. The failure of biomass and visibility to improve is probably a result of similar pre- and postdiversion winter-spring epilimnetic P concentrations. The marked reduction in P since diversion occurred during and prior to fall overturn and may have represented a supply of P for later summer-early fall blue green algal populations that declined after diversion. Runoff from a rapidly developing westside portion (18%) of the watershed is contributing substantially to P loading of the lake. Development to a density of about 10 dwellings/ha has increased loading, possibly on the order of 14%. Future development of the eastside portion (26% of watershed) may increase loading by 20% and be equivalent to nearly 1/2 of the P previously diverted in 1968.																			0043-1354	1879-2448					1980	14	7					821	828		10.1016/0043-1354(80)90263-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(80)90263-8													WOS:A1980JZ60800019

Organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), char-EC, and soot-EC were analyzed using the thermal/optical reflectance (TOR) method with different temperature plateaus and oxidation atmospheres. TC, OC, EC, and char-EC concentrations of TSP and PM2.5 showed seasonal variations with the highest concentrations in winter and the lowest in Summer, while soot-EC reveals a little different variation, with the highest concentration in spring, indicating different source contributions from other parameters. OC/EC correlations were weaker at Daihai than those from urban areas. Although little differences existed in TSP and PM2.5, average OC/EC ratios varied seasonally and ranged from similar to 9.0 in winter to similar to 5.0 in spring. Char-/soot-EC ratios showed similar pattern, with the highest average ratios (> 3.0) in winter, consistent with the contributions from residential biomass burning and coal combustion. Back trajectories related the highest carbon concentrations with the southeasterly air masses and the lowest carbon levels with northward flows. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The spatio-temporal dynamics of fish in Pskov Lake	ZHURNAL OBSHCHEI BIOLOGII												Inter-annual and intra-seasonal patterns of spatio-temporal dynamics of main commercial fishes from Pskov Lake - one of the most productive water bodies in North-West Russia - are investigated. The results of cartographic analysis are presented on summer-fall fish distributions in the lake. As input data, the results of trawl surveys conducted in years differing by water level (2003, 2006, and 2008) were used. Initial data were aggregated into the tables of attributes which contain the information on trawling dates, trajectories, duration, average speed, water temperature, and catch specific and size composition. These tables were used for mapping the spatial distribution of seven fish species (bream, pike-perch, roach, perch, white bream, burbot, and ruff). For roach, pike-perch, bream, pike, and perch, cartographic estimates of abundance are obtained. The attempt has been made to assess the reproduction efficiency of several fish species (pike-perch, perch, and pike) on basis of the analysis of their abundance changes from spring to autumn. For pike-perch, maps of spatial distribution are made up, which account for size composition of the population. Discrepancy in localization of different age groups in different seasons, along with their moving patterns, is ascertained. Patterns of fish spatio-temporal dynamics are matched with available hydrological characteristics.																			0044-4596					JAN-FEB	2020	81	1					3	19		10.31857/S0044459620010042	http://dx.doi.org/10.31857/S0044459620010042													WOS:000649355500001
J	SANTER, B; LAMPERT, W				SANTER, B; LAMPERT, W			SUMMER DIAPAUSE IN CYCLOPOID COPEPODS - ADAPTIVE RESPONSE TO A FOOD BOTTLENECK	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												1. Summer diapause in freshwater cyclopoid copepods is often regarded as an adaptation to avoid fish predation. We tested the alternative hypothesis that the ultimate reason for fourth instar copepodites to enter the sediment during summer is to avoid a food bottleneck for herbivorous juvenile stages caused by the grazing of competing cladocerans. 2. Seasonal life cycles of three co-existing cyclopoid copepod species, Cyclops kolensis, C. vicinus and C. abyssorum, which spend the summer in anoxic sediments, were studied in a eutrophic lake. 3. All three species undergo an ontogenetic shift in their feeding habits from herbivory in the naupliar stages to omnivory in the later juvenile and adult stages. Nauplii depend on flagellates as food. 4. Copepods were cultured in the laboratory without a diapause. Nauplii were subjected to lake water containing seston that was freshly collected during the different seasons, and their growth and development was recorded. 5. Nauplii developed quickly into copepodites in lake water that was drawn in late winter (February/March), when they were abundant in the lake. In late spring and early summer, when cladocerans dominated the plankton, lake water did not support naupliar growth. Development of C. abyssorum was retarded and nauplii from the other two species died before they reached the first copepodite stage. 6. However, all species developed nearly optimally during spring and summer if the water was supplemented with flagellates. We conclude that all species must pass a serious bottleneck as they need high concentrations of flagellates for their naupliar development. 7. Hence, summer diapause may be an adaptation to avoid poor food conditions for nauplii. Fish predation may be important for shaping the timing of diapause in C. abyssorum, as this is the largest species and is least affected by food limitation. This hypothesis is supported by a comparison of diapause behaviour of cyclopoids in lakes of varying trophy.																			0021-8790					SEP	1995	64	5					600	613		10.2307/5803	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/5803													WOS:A1995RY35100006

The highest phosphorus content was found in epilimnetic suspended matter with maximum mean concentration in summer. There was a gradual decrease in total P content from suspended matter to settling particles and surficial sediment. Phosphorus extracted with sodium hydroxide was the dominant fraction showing organic phosphorus to be most important. Labile phosphorus was a significant fraction and contributed more in epilimnetic suspended matter and in material from the uppermost traps in comparison to hypolimnetic material and surficial sediment. There was a seasonal variation in P forms with maximal shares of labile P and organic P in summer. The findings clearly indicate a dominance of phytoplankton and detritus in the epilimnetic particulate matter during summer, while inorganic and resuspended material is more important during mixing periods. The P composition of settling particles and suspended matter show similar trends, but the total content and shares of labile and organic P are significantly higher in the latter.

Physiological correlates of seasonal growth patterns in lake trout Salvelinus namaycush	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Physiological correlates of seasonal growth patterns were measured in lake trout Salvelinus namaycush from two populations with contrasting diets (zooplankton-dominated diet in Louisa Lake; fish-dominated diet in Opeongo Lake). Fish in Opeongo Lake grew faster and were in better condition than fish in Louisa Lake. The most prominent biochemical difference between populations was higher citrate synthase (CS) and cytochrome c oxidase activity in the white muscle of fish from Opeongo Lake, indicating greater sustained swimming activity in this lake. In contrast, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in white muscle, an indicator of capacity for burst swimming, was similar between lakes. Nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) activity in white muscle, an indicator of protein synthesis, was higher in Opeongo Lake than in Louisa Lake but only in the autumn. In both lakes, protein concentration and therefore nutritional status increased as the growing season progressed from spring to summer to autumn. Biochemical indicators of growth and activity showed similar seasonal patterns in the two lakes with the spring characterized by high NDPK, high CS and high LDH activities (i.e. high levels of protein synthesis in association with high aerobic and anaerobic activities). These results suggest high foraging effort and allocation to growth early in the growing season in both lakes.

Only walleye, Stizostedion vitreum, from Silver Lake were infected with both Bothriocephalus formosus (a new host record) and B. cuspidatus. Green sunfish, Lepomis cyanellus, from Tichigan Lake canal were also infected with B. formosus. The description of B. formosus is addended from autumn and spring collections. Available museum specimens were examined critically and some were reidentified. The relationship between growth and development of B. formosus was related to season (temperaturee) and host species. Bothriocephalus formosus was more dominant than B. cuspidatus. It was present in walleye all year, but its major recruitment and reproductive seasons were autumn and summer, respectively. Bothriocephalus cuspidatus, which competed with B. formosus for pyloric ceca, was absent from walleye during summer when B. formosus reached its peak intensity of infection and reproductive activity. Peak reproductive season of B. cuspidatus was in the autumn. This is considered to be a case of temporal segregation of reproductive niches. Prevalence and intensity of infection of both Bothriocephalus species did not appear to be related to host size or sex.

During that period of time, 691 Muskellunge were angled, tagged, and released by members of the Saint John River Chapter of Muskies Canada Inc. By the end of the 2015 angling season, a total of 64 (9.3%) tagged Muskellunge had been recaptured by angling. An additional four tagged fish were captured at the Mactaquac Dam fishway. Most Muskellunge were observed to establish discrete summer home ranges from which there was little, if any, movement. Transitional movements were believed to occur during the spring and fall, associated with spawning as well as the establishment of summer and winter ranges. Muskellunge movements that were documented in this study occurred in both upstream and downstream directions in equal proportion. Muskellunge also demonstrated the ability to move long distances both upstream and downstream, including passage over/through the Mactaquac Dam. Observations of Muskellunge behavior and movements from this study are generally consistent with observations (small home ranges, males more sedentary than females, movements seasonal in nature, capable of long distance movements, etc.) reported from similar tagging studies in other North American jurisdictions. Future efforts will be directed to obtaining additional information on recaptured fish. With additional recapture information, a more detailed analysis of Muskellunge in the Saint John watershed can be completed.																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-46-2				2017	85						39	50																WOS:000422891800004

Combined sediment microfacies analyses and high-resolution micro-X-ray fluorescence element scanning allow us to identify 157 detrital event layers deposited in spring-summer and to discriminate between regional flood and local debris flow deposits. Higher spring-summer flood activity with a mean event recurrence of 3-5 yr occurred in several well-confined multidecadal episodes during the Dark Ages Cold Period and Medieval time (A.D. 450-480, 590-640, 700-750, and 1140-1170) as well as during the early Little Ice Age (LIA; A.D. 1300-1330 and 1480-1520). In contrast, lowest spring-summer flood activity with an event recurrence of only 30-100 yr is observed during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (A.D. 1180-1300) and the coldest interval of the LIA (A.D. 1600-1700). These findings indicate a complex relationship between temperature conditions and extreme hydro-meteorological events and suggest that enhanced summer Mediterranean cyclogenesis triggers large-scale floods in the northeast Alps during climatic transitions. The Lake Mondsee data demonstrate the climatic sensitivity of spring-summer floods and prove the potential of varved sediment records to investigate the impact of changing climate boundary conditions on seasonal flood activity for pre-instrumental time.					; von Grafenstein, Ulrich/F-6991-2010; Martin-Puertas, Celia/I-4580-2014	Brauer, Achim/0000-0002-6655-9451; von Grafenstein, Ulrich/0000-0002-3338-5627; Martin-Puertas, Celia/0000-0002-1349-5669; Swierczynski, Tina/0000-0003-4998-8331; Lauterbach, Stefan/0000-0003-4131-0366													0091-7613	1943-2682				NOV	2012	40	11					1047	1050		10.1130/G33493.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/G33493.1													WOS:000310411000023

It has not been proven that the explanation for why carbon assimilation in productive lakes exceeds carbon supply and causes a rise in pH also applies to oligotrophic freshwater lakes. Regardless, this may have been caused by changes in the solute composition of inflowing rivers as a result of changes in land use in catchment areas. Beimiao Reservoir in Baoshan City, Yunnan Province, where pH has increased significantly in summer and fall over the past few years, was chosen for this research in order to verify this hypothesis. This paper evaluates the status quo of water quality and nutrition in this reservoir. In addition, this paper analyzes the effects of water temperature, the metabolism of aquatic organisms, and river input on the horizontal and vertical spatial differences, diurnal variations, seasonal changes, and annual changes in the pH of the reservoir. It was discovered that one of the primary causes of the pH increase in natural freshwater lakes in the subtropical monsoon climate region during summer and autumn can be summarized as follows: A large amount of nitric acid and sulfuric acid are produced in the soil when chemical fertilizers are overused in runoff areas, particularly during intensive horticultural crop cultivation. Therefore, the subtropical monsoon climate region's soil loses calcium and magnesium ions, whose combined equivalent concentrations significantly exceed those of bicarbonate ions. The combined equivalent concentrations of calcium ions and magnesium ions in the inflowing rivers in summer and autumn are also significantly higher than those in the lake, resulting in the depletion of free carbon dioxide caused by calcium carbonate precipitation and an increase in pH. The conclusion of this research casts new light on the preservation and treatment of the ecological environment of lake water with similar issues.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				OCT	2023	154								110477	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110477	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110477		JUN 2023											WOS:001025671700001

We found 51 taxa, including 29 that accounted for over 10% of the total in at least one collection. The taxa were fitted into one of five seasonal patterns. Patterns I and II represented taxa restricted to warm (pattern I) or cold (pattern II) months, respectively. Pattern III represented organisms that began growth in the summer, persisted through autumn and disappeared with the onset of an ice cover. Pattern IV was an extension of pattern III, in which the taxon remained in the plankton throughout the winter and disappeared soon after ice out. Species without a clear seasonal pattern were grouped as pattern V. The seasonal periodicity of the flora, as examined with ordination analyses, was found to remain remarkedly similar during the 58-month study. Except for episodes of low pH during spring snow melt and unseasonally warm or cold weather, sample scores followed a fairly consistent pattern along the first and second primary axes. Water temperature, specific conductance, and pH were important variables that controlled changes in the species composition during the course of a given year. The flora was used to develop an inference model for water temperature. According to the analyses, the remains of a surface sediment sample represented a flora that grew primarily during the late autumn period at 7.6-degrees-C. Ways in which seasonal data could be utilized to improve paleolimnological inference work are discussed.																			0022-3646					APR	1992	28	2					186	198		10.1111/j.0022-3646.1992.00186.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0022-3646.1992.00186.x													WOS:A1992HN90200006

Daphnia are key species in lake ecosystems and are a model system in ecology. Their ecological success is very much due to their dual reproductive mode: females reproduce parthenogenetically when environmental conditions are favourable but switch to sexual reproduction and resting egg production in unfavourable conditions such as winter. Phases of clonal reproduction lower the overall genotypic diversity of Daphnia populations due to the random loss of genotypes. During phases of sexual reproduction, new genotypes enhance the genotypic variability of the population and compensate for the loss of clonal lineages. 2. We hypothesised that clonal diversity should be low during the winter months due to high mortality rates (clonal erosion) but will be restored in the spring most likely from the resting egg bank. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the clonal composition of a Daphnia pulex population in a small mesotrophic lake in Norway. Daphnia were sampled every month from September 2007 to September 2010, and c. 60 individuals per month were genotyped using 11 microsatellite markers. Marker resolution was high, and 582 different genotypes could be detected in the 936 individuals analysed. 3. An unexpected complication for the study was the illegal introduction of planktivorous fish into the lake between autumn 2006 and spring 2007. This led to significant predation pressure on the D. pulex population and shifted the cladoceran community to smaller species. However, while the D. pulex population density declined severely over the study years, the overall genotypic variability increased. We observed very high turnover rates, with many clones being present for only a single month. Nevertheless, and as expected, genotypic diversity was higher during summer and lower during winter, and some parthenogenetic individuals seemed to be able to survive the winter. The large majority of new genotypes came from the resting egg bank. 4. We conclude that, due to the new predation pressure, the resting egg bank has become much more important in restocking genotypic diversity as well as for D. pulex abundance. However, despite the buffering capacities of the resting egg bank, the predation pressure will most likely lead to the extinction of D. pulex in Lake Myravatn.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				AUG	2014	59	8					1735	1743		10.1111/fwb.12378	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12378													WOS:000339385100014
J	Mills, AM				Mills, Alexander M.			Banding data reveal bias in age-class sampling of songbirds during spring migration	JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY												Population age structure and vital statistics are important for understanding songbird demography and for developing conservation strategies. Field-based estimates of survival rates based on mark-recapture methods are conservative because they are constrained by problems associated with detection probabilities and emigration. However, data collected at bird-banding stations during spring and fall migration can potentially provide useful demographic information. I used banding data collected over a 6-yr period (2005-2010) at Long Point Bird Observatory on the north shore of Lake Erie in Ontario, Canada, and Powdermill Avian Research Center in southeastern Pennsylvania, U.S.A., to determine if banding records could be used to estimate vital statistics for several species of songbirds. As reported in previous studies, I found the proportion of juveniles captured during fall migration to be unrealistically high to be representative of true proportions, especially at Long Point. The proportion of juvenile songbirds captured remained implausibly high during spring migration, with related estimates of longevity and generation time implausibly low and of fecundity implausibly high. Based on apparent adult survival estimates from the literature that suggest an average age structure for songbirds of >55% adults and <45% juveniles, I found that capture rates for juveniles during spring migration were at least twice as high as that for adults. A slower pace of spring migration by juveniles likely accounts for some of this bias. Because the data cannot be assumed to represent unbiased samples with respect to the age structure of populations, my results indicate that banding data collected at bird-banding stations during migration are not suitable for use in demographic studies.																			0273-8570	1557-9263				SEP	2016	87	3					323	336		10.1111/jofo.12156	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jofo.12156													WOS:000383685000007

Both Arctic charr and brown trout predominantly used the littoral zone during winter time. Despite very cold winter conditions (water temperature < 1A degrees C) and poor light conditions, both fish species fed continuously during the ice-covered period, although at a much lower rate than during the summer season. No somatic growth could be detected during the ice-covered winter period and the condition factor of both species significantly declined, suggesting that the winter feeding rates were similar to or below the maintenance requirements. Also, the species richness and diversity of ingested prey largely decreased from summer to winter for both fish species. The winter diet of Arctic charr < 20 cm was dominated by benthic insect larvae, chironomids in particular, and Gammarus lacustris, but zooplankton was also important in December. G. lacustris was the dominant prey of charr > 20 cm. The winter diet of brown trout < 20 cm was dominated by insect larvae, whereas large-sized trout mainly was piscivorous, feeding on juvenile Arctic charr. Piscivorous feeding behaviour of trout was in contrast rarely seen during the summer months when their encounter with potential fish prey was rare as the small-sized charr mainly inhabited the profundal. The study demonstrated large differences in the ecology and interactions of Arctic charr and brown trout between the winter and summer seasons.

Annual values ranged from 160 g C m(-2) y(-1) in the lower West Passage to 619 g C m-2 y(-1) at the mouth of the Providence River. The annual bay-wide, area mean fell near the middle of this range at 323 g C m(-2) y(-1) and was not apparently different from previous surveys. In the 1998 warm, El Nino winter, no bay-wide winter-spring phytoplankton flowered. Bloom limitation was correlated with warm temperatures which may have stimulated grazing rates. The lack of a bloom did not change annual levels of primary production but this alteration in carbon flow may impact macrofauna in the benthic infauna community. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Physicochemical simulation of the evolution of small lakes in a cold climate	GEOCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL												The paper presents a generalized algorithm for the simulation of multiyear cycles in variations of the chemical composition of lake waters with regard for the seasonal specifics of hydrogeochemical processes. Data were obtained on the behavior of the hydrogeological system during a time span of 500-1000 years. Each of the simulated model cycles involved a successively alternating "summer-winter" time periods. Terrestrial exchange fluxes between reservoirs, groundwater inflow, falls of atmospheric precipitate, and the evaporation of lake water were taken into account for summer periods, whereas winter conditions were simulated as corresponding to the development of the ice phase, the absence of water exchange fluxes, a change from oxidizing to reducing conditions, and the burial of solid phases in the sediments. The results of our physicochemical simulations with the use of data on the composition of natural hydrogeological systems are in good agreement with natural observations and make it possible to realistically predict the evolution of small lakes in the Ol'khon area.

This study describes aspects of the life-history of Elimia comalensis, specifically population density in relationship to water velocity and depth, and seasonal change. Also examined are spatial segregation of different E. comalensis age groups and the relationship of snail size (proxy for age) to flow, depth, and seasonal change. The study was carried out in the lotic portion of spring run 3, Comal Springs, New Braunfels, Texas, by quadrat sampling at 10 m intervals from the spring head to Landa Lake in Fall, Winter, and Spring 2005-2006. The length of snails was strongly influenced by physical characteristics of the stream with stream depth, water velocity, and distance from the spring head accounting for similar to 43% of the individual variability for shell length (p <0.001). A significant relationship between snail size, stream depth and water velocity was found, with spatial segregation of juvenile snails into the deepest, fastest moving water. Snail population densities did not change across sampling seasons (p = 0.285).

Twenty-four species were recorded but 5 were very rare. The remaining species were divided into 3 groups according to their seasonal occurrence: spring to autumn species (Keratella quadrata, K. cochlearis, Gastropus stylifer, Asplanchan priodonta, Kellicottia longispina, Conochilus hippocrepis), spring to early summer species (Polyarthra Dolichoptera, Synchaeta tremula, S. pectinata, S. stylata, S. oblonga, C. unicornis), summer to autumn species (Polyarthra vulgaris, P. major, Filinia terminalis, S. grandis, Ploesoma hudsoni, Trichocerca capucina, T. similis). The months in which each species was abundant are given. K. quadrata and F. terminalis were most abundant in the deepest stratum, K. longispina and Conochilus spp. were most abundant in the upper and middle strata, Trichocerca spp. showed no pronounced vertical distribution, and all the remaining species were most abundant in the upper stratum. K. cochlearis and K. longispina attained their highest densities over a wide range of temperature and O2 concentration. F. terminalis, Conchilus spp., A. priodonta, K. quadrata and Polyarthra spp., attained their highest densities within a narrow range of temperature and O2 concentration. Optimum ranges are given for each species. Major changes occurred between 1971-1972 when A. priodonta, K. longispina, C. unicornis and F. terminalis increased in abundance, whilst K. quadrata, G. stylifer, C. hippocrepis, Polyarthra spp., Synchaeta spp. and P. hudsoni decreased in abundance. These changes are discussed in relation to the temperature and O2 requirements of each species and also to the probable enrichment of the lake after the opening of a new sewage works in June 1971.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1977	7	2					147	166		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1977.tb01665.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1977.tb01665.x													WOS:A1977DH22000005

Relationships among Utricularia foliosa, periphyton assemblage structure and its nutrient (C, N, P) status	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The macrophyte-periphyton complex has great importance for the functioning of shallow lakes and reservoirs. Several observations in the field have suggested that macrophyte life-form and architecture seem to be very important for periphytic algal community organization. To test the influence of macrophytes on periphyton, we compared the algal community structure and nutrient status (C, N, P) of periphyton on the stem and leaves of Utricularia foliosa L., and on a nylon thread utilized as an artificial substrate. Furthermore, this study aims to assess the seasonal variation of limnological conditions and their influence on Utricularia-periphyton complex. Spring and summer had higher light conditions, P availability and macrophyte cover than autumn and winter. Algal biomass, total density, and biovolume were higher on natural substrate than on artificial. Algal assemblages changed with season and species descriptors differed among substrates types. Phosphorus content of periphyton was generally more correlated with water nutrient availability than with N and C content. Periphyton on free-floating submersed macrophytes may have great importance on the functioning of shallow tropical reservoirs, particularly in the clear water state. Moreover, seasonal variation of limnological conditions determines the periphyton-Utricularia relationships and either intensifies or minimizes the macrophyte influence on periphyton.

Three main Microcystis morphospecies (Microcystis ichthyoblabe, Microcystis aeruginosa and Microcystis wesenbergii) were identified during the study period. The results showed that the large colonial M. aeruginosa (D-50 was 300-700 mu m, D-50 defined as colony size: 50% of the total mass of the particles smaller than this size) and M. wesenbergii (D-50 was 300-700 mu m) dominated in summer and autumn when heavy bloom were formed; but small colonial M. ichthyoblabe (D-50 was 100-400 mu m) and other/unidentified Microcystis morphospecies (D-50 was 50-200 mu m) were more abundant in winter and spring. Moreover, the results also indicated that the colony size of each Microcystis morphospecies increased constantly from April and reached its largest size in October; then, it decreased rapidly after November. The seasonal succession of Microcystis morphospecies may be caused by the change of morphological characteristics along with the age. The massive accumulation of Microcystis at the water surface of Lake Taihu is always accompanied by large Microcystis colonies suggesting that they favor bloom formation.					; Zhu, Wei/P-3555-2015; Li, Ming/JPA-5759-2023	Gao, Li/0000-0001-5827-5814; Zhu, Wei/0000-0002-2907-6020; 													1018-4619	1610-2304					2013	22	12					3474	3483																WOS:000329084600005

Water Colour Analysis of Lake Kummerow Using Time Series of Remote Sensing and In Situ Data	PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE												Monitoring water constituents of lakes using satellites is gaining increasing importance. Image archives of historic satellites represent valuable data sources to analyse the development of constituent concentrations over time and to derive trends. This study presents an analysis of the MERIS archive (2003-2011) using a neural network algorithm (FUB/WeW) to retrieve concentrations of Chlorophyll-a, total suspended matter and absorption by coloured dissolved organic matter (440 nm) at Lake Kummerow. All three constituents showed a clear seasonality: Chlorophyll-a (0.3-45.8 exhibited a spring bloom and multiple blooms during summer. Total suspended matter (0.1-10.0 and coloured dissolved organic matter (0.01-0.94 revealed highest values during summer and lower values during autumn/winter. While total suspended matter (- 1.3 and chlorophyll-a (- 3.4 showed a decreasing tendency from 2003 to 2011, coloured dissolved organic matter showed no clear trend. Chlorophyll-a retrieved from MERIS was around 20% higher than in situ measurements. The other constituents (total suspended matter and coloured dissolved organic matter) were obtained by qualitative analysis due to the absence of in situ measurements. This analysis provides a first multi-year time series on these constituents over the whole lake and all seasons. Both, its size and its form, make Lake Kummerow a suitable lake for remote sensing validation activities.

The objective of this study was to quantify responses of surface energy and hydrologic fluxes 2-3 yr following a spruce beetle outbreak using measurements and modeling. The authors used observations at the Rocky Mountains Glacier Lakes Ecosystem Experiments Site (GLEES), where beetles killed 85% of the basal area of spruce from 2005-07 (prebeetle) to 2009/10 (postbeetle). Observations showed increased albedo following tree mortality, more reflected solar radiation, and less net radiation, but these postoutbreak radiation changes are smaller than or comparable to their annual preoutbreak variability. The dominant signals from observations were a large reduction (27%) in summer daytime evaporation and a large increase (25%) in sensible heat fluxes. Numerous Noah LSM with multiparameterization options (Noah-MP) simulations incorporating beetle-caused tree mortality effects were conducted to assess their impact on the surface hydrological cycle components that were not directly observed. Model results revealed substantial seasonal variations: more spring snowmelt and runoff, less spring-summer transpiration, and drier soil in summer and fall. This modeled trend is similar to observed runoff changes in harvested forests where reduced forest density resulted in more spring snowmelt and annual water yields. Model results showed that snow albedo changes due to increased litter cover beneath killed trees altered the seasonal pattern of simulated snowmelt and snow water equivalent, but these changes are small compared to the effect of leaf loss. This study highlights the need to include the transient effects of forest disturbances in modeling land-atmosphere interactions and their potential impacts on regional weather and climate.

J	Grey, J; Jones, RI; Sleep, D				Grey, J; Jones, RI; Sleep, D			Seasonal changes in the importance of the source of organic matter to the diet of zooplankton in Loch Ness, as indicated by stable isotope analysis	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Seasonal variations in the stable isotope composition (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of crustacean zooplankton and their putative food sources in oligotrophic Loch Ness were recorded during 1998. Bulk particulate organic matter (POM) showed delta C-13 values consistent with a terrestrial plant origin from the catchment and exhibited little seasonal variation, whereas POM delta N-15 was more variable, probably due to associated microbial action. In contrast, phytoplankton delta C-13 was relatively light and showed some seasonal variation, but delta N-15 values were more constant. The isotopic signatures of both POM and phytoplankton remained sufficiently distinct from each other throughout the period of study to allow their relative contributions to zooplankton diet to be assessed. Zooplankton isotopic signatures shifted seasonally, reflecting a dietary switch from a reliance on allochthonous carbon derived from POM during winter and early spring to heavy dependence on algal production during summer. Annually, crustacean zooplankton in Loch Ness derive approximately 40% of their body carbon from allochthonous sources, likely mediated via microbial links. Separate determination of isotope ratios for the main zooplankton species allowed a more detailed trophic investigation. The most abundant zooplankton species in the loch, Eudiaptomus gracilis, incorporated appreciable allochthonous carbon even during the peak of phytoplankton productivity. By contrast, Daphnia hyalina grew mainly in late summer and autumn and derived almost 100% body carbon from algal sources. This study is the first to quantify such a seasonal switch in zooplankton dependence between allochthonous and autochthonous sources of organic matter in a large lake.					; Jones, Roger/C-7703-2011; Grey, Jonathan/B-3346-2012	Grey, Jonathan/0000-0001-9069-2271; Jones, Roger/0000-0002-0835-8264; 													0024-3590					MAY	2001	46	3					505	513		10.4319/lo.2001.46.3.0505	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2001.46.3.0505													WOS:000168511500004

Early and late cyanobacterial bloomers in a shallow, eutrophic lake	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS												Cyanobacterial blooms present challenges for water treatment, especially in regions like the Canadian prairies where poor water quality intensifies water treatment issues. Buoyant cyanobacteria that resist sedimentation present a challenge as water treatment operators attempt to balance pre-treatment and toxic disinfection by-products. Here, we used microscopy to identify and describe the succession of cyanobacterial species in Buffalo Pound Lake, a key drinking water supply. We used indicator species analysis to identify temporal grouping structures throughout two sampling seasons from May to October 2018 and 2019. Our findings highlight two key cyanobacterial bloom phases - a mid-summer diazotrophic bloom of Dolichospermum spp. and an autumn Planktothrix agardhii bloom. Dolichospermum crassa and Woronichinia compacta served as indicators of the mid-summer and autumn bloom phases, respectively. Different cyanobacterial metabolites were associated with the distinct bloom phases in both years: toxic microcystins were associated with the mid-summer Dolichospermum bloom and some newly monitored cyanopeptides (anabaenopeptin A and B) with the autumn Planktothrix bloom. Despite forming a significant proportion of the autumn phytoplankton biomass (>60%), the Planktothrix bloom had previously not been detected by sensor or laboratory-derived chlorophyll-a. Our results demonstrate the power of targeted taxonomic identification of key species as a tool for managers of bloom-prone systems. Moreover, we describe an autumn Planktothrix agardhii bloom that has the potential to disrupt water treatment due to its evasion of detection. Our findings highlight the importance of identifying this autumn bloom given the expectation that warmer temperatures and a longer ice-free season will become the norm.

The effect of seasonally low photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) and cold but nonfreezing temperature on whole-plant physiology was studied. Net photosynthesis was measured at six temperatures and 12 PPFDs. Net photosynthesis, soluble protein concentration, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) protein concentration, and Rubisco activity of winter plants were 32, 31, 33, and 70% lower, respectively, than those of plants collected in the summer. Optimum temperatures for net photosynthesis of winter and summer plants were 5 and 30-degrees-C, respectively. Dark respiration of winter plants was up to 313% greater than that of summer plants. Reduced Rubisco activity and increased dark respiration interacted to reduce net photosynthesis. Interaction of reduced net photosynthesis and increased dark respiration increased CO2 and light compensation points and the light saturation point of winter plants. Growth of C. demersum was limited by the ambient phosphorus concentration of lake water during summer. Apical stem segments of winter-collected plants had 54 and 35% more phosphorus and nitrogen, respectively, than summer-collected plants. Physiologically active perennation beneath ice enabled C. demersum to accumulate phosphorus during the winter when it was most abundant. Partial uncoupling of phosphorus acquisition from utilization may reduce phosphorus limitation upon growth during the summer when phosphorus concentration is seasonally the lowest.																			0032-0889					MAR	1993	101	3					985	991		10.1104/pp.101.3.985	http://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.101.3.985								12231751					WOS:A1993KR45000034

Temperature Adaptation of Aquatic Bacterial Community Growth Is Faster in Response to Rising than to Falling Temperature	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Bacteria are key organisms in energy and nutrient cycles, and predicting the effects of temperature change on bacterial activity is important in assessing global change effects. A changing in situ temperature will affect the temperature adaptation of bacterial growth in lake water, both long term in response to global change, and short term in response to seasonal variations. The rate of adaptation may, however, depend on whether temperature is increasing or decreasing, since bacterial growth and turnover scale with temperature. Temperature adaptation was studied for winter (in situ temperature 2.5 degrees C) and summer communities (16.5 degrees C) from a temperate lake in Southern Sweden by exposing them to a temperature treatment gradient between 0 and 30 degrees C in similar to 5 degrees C increments. This resulted mainly in a temperature increase for the winter and a decrease for the summer community. Temperature adaptation of bacterial community growth was estimated as leucine incorporation using a temperature Sensitivity Index (SI, log growth at 35 degrees C/4 degrees C), where higher values indicate adaptation to higher temperatures. High treatment temperatures resulted in higher SI within days for the winter community, resulting in an expected level of community adaptation within 2 weeks. Adaptation for the summer community was also correlated to treatment temperature, but the rate of adaption was slower. Even after 5 weeks, the bacterial community had not fully adapted to the lowest temperature conditions. Thus, during periods of increasing temperature, the bacterial community will rapidly adapt to function optimally, while decreasing temperature may result in long periods of non-optimal functioning.

The streams are more or less acidified, and some have been treated with lime. The aluminium fractions (total monomeric Al, organic monomeric Al, inorganic monomeric Al) were determined colourimetrically with pyrocatechol violet combined with cation exchange using Continuous Flow Analysis (Autoanalyzer I). The levels of inorganic monomeric aluminium varied substantially, between <3 to 271 mug/l. The levels were higher in untreated than in limed waters and twice as high in the most humic waters as in less humic waters. The importance of aluminium mobilisation from the catchments was obvious, with higher aluminium concentrations in surface runoff (unbalanced stream waters) compared to lake outlets (balanced and precipitated lake water). The highest mean levels were measured at spring, whereas the highest single peaks occurred during summer. Inorganic monomeric and total monomeric aluminium was best correlated to ion ratio and pH whereas acid soluble aluminium and organic monomeric aluminium was best correlated to TOC, water colour and iron.																			0049-6979					AUG-SEP	2001	130	1-4	3				1715	1720		10.1023/A:1013931230368	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1013931230368													WOS:000172012000134
J	Mace, RD; Waller, JS				Mace, RD; Waller, JS			Grizzly bear distribution and human conflicts in Jewel Basin Hiking Area, Swan Mountains, Montana	WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN												Telemetry data obtained from grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) were used to evaluate resource selection within the Jewel Basin Hiking Area (JBHA) of western Montana. Logistic regression models were constructed using Geographic Information System maps of elevation zones, dominant cover types, and distance to hiking trails and lakes. Fourteen radiocollared grizzly bears used the JBHA between 1987-1994 primarily during summer. Using univariate statistics, we determined that grizzly bears were significantly farther than expected from trails and from lakes with campsites during spring, summer, and autumn. In multivariate models however, distance to trails and lakes were significant variables only during summer and autumn. During these 2 seasons the relative probability of grizzly bear use increased as distances to trails and lakes with campsites increased. For each season, grizzly bears selected relatively open habitats compared to the predominant forest habitat type in which most of the trail system occurred. We found no historical records of conflicts between grizzly bears and recreationists in the !BHA; bears did not appear to be conditioned to or habituated to food. No radiocollared bears lived solely within the JBHA; each individual's home range included multiple-use lands with roads and where many human activities occurred. We concluded that several factors together precluded human-bear conflicts in the JBHA. These included low visitor-use levels, trail placement, an educated public, and the bears' negative conditioning towards a host of human activities occurring within and outside the area. Therefore, while in the JBHA, grizzly bears minimized their interaction with recreationists by avoiding high-use areas.																			2328-5540					FAL	1996	24	3					461	467																WOS:A1996VK74000011
J	Zhang, EL; Wang, YB; Sun, WW; Shen, J				Zhang, Enlou; Wang, Yongbo; Sun, Weiwei; Shen, Ji			Holocene Asian monsoon evolution revealed by a pollen record from an alpine lake on the southeastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												We present the results of pollen analyses from a 1105 cm long sediment core from Wuxu Lake in southwestern China, which depict the variations of the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) and the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) during the last 12.3 ka. During the period of 12.3 to 11.3 cal ka BP, the dominance of Betula forest and open alpine shrub and meadow around Wuxu Lake indicates a climate with relatively cold winters and dry summers, corresponding to the Younger Dryas event. Between 11.3 and 10.4 cal ka BP, further expansion of Betula forest and the retreat of alpine shrubs and meadows reflect a greater seasonality with cold winters and gradually increasing summer precipitation. From 10.4 to 4.9 cal ka BP, the dense forest un-derstory, together with the gradual decrease in Betula forest and increase in Tsuga forest, suggest that the winters became warmer and summer precipitation was at a maximum, corresponding to the Holocene climatic optimum. Between 4.9 and 2.6 cal ka BP, Tsuga forest and alpine shrubs and meadows expanded significantly, reflecting relatively warm winters and decreased summer precipitation. Since 2.6 cal ka BP, reforestation around Wuxu Lake indicates a renewed humid period in the late Holocene; however, the vegetation in the catchment may also have been affected by grazing activity during this period. The results of our study are generally consistent with previous findings; however, the timing and duration of the Holocene climatic optimum from different records are inconsistent, reflecting real contrast in local rainfall response to the ISM. Overall, the EAWM is broadly in-phase with the ISM on the orbital timescale, and both monsoons exhibit a trend of decreasing strength from the early to late Holocene, reflecting the interplay of solar insolation receipt between the winter and summer seasons and El Nino-Southern Oscillation strength in the tropical Pacific.					; Zhang, Youchi/M-6989-2016; sun, weiwei/GQA-5041-2022	Zhang, Enlou/0000-0002-8057-7760; 													1814-9324	1814-9332					2016	12	2					415	427		10.5194/cp-12-415-2016	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-12-415-2016													WOS:000371625400013

The ecosystem was confirmed as oligotrophic with mesotrophic conditions developed below 20 m in Small Lake (autumn). The euphotic zone was characterised by frequent P-limitation of phytoplankton growth and absence of P-limitation in PO4 concentration maxima in autumn. Temperature had great impact on chemical and biological variables. Abundance and biomass of picophytoplankton were significantly different between lakes rather than seasons. This was mainly assigned to nutrient limitation and specific trophic interactions which differ two lakes mutually and Mljet Lakes from the coastal sea. Picophytoplankton Chl a was dominantly attributed to autotrophic picoflagellates and did not show deviation from model estimated importance in total Chl a. sAPA maxima in Small Lake were greater than in Great Lake. In autumn it was most probably related to significantly greater abundance of cyanobacteria with low content of CM a (depth 10 m), while in spring difference was weak and most likely defined by photoadaptation of phytoplankton (low Chl a) and hazardous impacts of UV-B radiation on APA in surface layer. Autotrophic picoflagellates, autotrophic nanoflagellates and nanoplanktonic cyanobacteria showed significant correlations with inorganic nitrogen species. Minimum of average CM a concentration and APA were found together with maximum of average PO4 concentration (Great Lake, autumn).

The analysis of this morphology is based on observations and measurements of the impact of seasonal lake level rises of 0-0.2 m and 0.7-2 m in normal versus exceptionally wet winters, respectively. We conducted repeated detailed topographic surveys of the shores for characterizing the evolving morphology with time, and coupled them with wind speed and wave amplitude during cliff formations. The detailed lake-level curve and the almost monotonic level decline allow associating each cliff with the exact year and season of its formation. This detailed chronology allowed, in turn, to identify and associate the pronounced and well-documented seasonality in the lake-level fall with the wind and wave data during specific seasons, years, and multi-year episodes. As a result, we can point at the controlling processes and environmental conditions for cliff formation. Under the regional Mediterranean climate with its distinct seasonality, winters are characterized by eastern Mediterranean low-pressure systems, generating the Jordan River flow in its northern headwaters and its discharge into the lake; this discharge controls the level fluctuations. At the Dead Sea area, these winter systems precipitate little. However, they generate high winds and storm waves that erode an additional coastal cliff at the base of the preexisting staircase every winter. Therefore, at the seasonal scale, a clear separation exists between (a) individual, cliff-forming, stronger wind storms operating only during winters under relatively stable water levels, and (b) the-1-m annual lake-level fall, mostly during summers. This pronounced seasonality in both the wind and lake level (a) dictates the seasonal pace of cliff formation at vertical intervals similar to the magnitude (-1 m) of the annual lake-level fall by evaporation and artificial brine diversion, and (b) facilitates the cliff separation in the landscape. This regular pacing by winter storms, the minor lake-level rises, and the annual evaporation and diversion support the preservation of the individual cliffs that assemble into the staircase morphology in the coarse-clastic delta fronts and mudflats characterizing the recently emerging coast. Anomalous lake-level rises during exceptionally wet winters are more erosive, even with regular wind storms; they create the largest lateral erosion. Under the emerging shore topography, which results from the steep bathymetry, the outcome is cliffs often much higher than the respective amplitude of their causative lake-level rises. This depends on the duration of the rise and of individual storms and indicates that under the variance of the modern hydroclimatology, the abnormal seasonal lake-level rises operating with regular winter storms, can aggressively erode the shore. Proposed plans to stabilize or raise the falling water level of the Dead Sea would induce coastal erosion and stream incision, which would threaten the existing highway and other infrastructure built close to its shore.

The Nanfei River and Zhaohe River are two main inlets of Chaohu Lake, Anhui, East China. We selected estuaries of the two rivers as representative areas to study temporal and spatial changes of bacterial communities. In August (summer) and November (autumn) 2016 and February (winter) and May (spring) 2017, 16 water and sediment samples were collected from the estuaries. Physicochemical characteristics indicate significant differences in the nutritional status and eutrophication index of the estuaries due mainly to organic input. Examination of the number of operational taxonomic units, the diversity index, the community composition, and redundancy analysis revealed the following. First, the existence of varying degrees of seasonal differences in the distribution of almost all bacteria. In addition, the species diversity in the sediment samples was higher than that in the water samples, and the dominant species differed also among these samples. Second, a large number of unknown genera were detected, especially in the sediment samples, such as unclassified Xanthomonadales incertae sedis, unclassified Anaerolineaceae, and unclassified Alcaligenaceae. Last, TP, TN, and TOC were the main influential factors that affected the bacterial community structure.																			2096-5508	2523-3521				MAY	2020	38	3			SI		745	758		10.1007/s00343-019-9096-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-019-9096-7		NOV 2019											WOS:000500379800001

Vladimir			Emergent wetland vegetation data recording: Does an optimal period exist?	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Aims Certain parts of the growing season have been proposed as optimal for recording relevant releves of forests and dry grasslands and so the monitoring of these vegetation types has become more time- and cost-effective. We investigated whether it is possible to propose an optimal period during the year for making relevant releves of emergent wetland vegetation. Location Marshlands of the central Balkan Peninsula. Methods One hundred and eighty-five permanent vegetation plots were investigated in three distinct time periods: spring, summer and autumn. In order to identify the communities, cluster analyses were carried out, and diagnostic species for each cluster were determined. The potential for temporal change of the communities regarding the species and life form composition was assessed using PERMANOVA and NMDS analyses. The Friedman test was used to assess the significance of seasonal change in the communities regarding their species richness, recordability and Shannon diversity. Results The level of floristic similarity among the 11 phytocoenoses analyzed significantly varied over the growing season while the composition in terms of their diagnostic species remained unchanged. The majority of the communities showed statistically significant seasonal changes in the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the vegetation, life form composition and cover. Although different communities expressed significant modifications in these parameters between different pairs of seasons, all of them showed changes in the mentioned parameters between spring and autumn. The degree of intra-annual variation in the species richness, species recordability and Shannon diversity was low in almost all phytocoenoses. Conclusions Summer is the optimal period for recording most of the species from the total list of the communities developed on hydrologically stable habitats, while spring is more appropriate for making releves on periodically inundated habitats. The sampling time has negligible impact on the classification of associations but it could have important implications for the classification of higher-ranked syntaxonomic units of the class Phragmito-Magnocaricetea.

Ice cover reorganizes lake ecosystems by altering thermal stratification and solar radiation, creating conditions that support different organisms, food webs, and potential trophic cascades. We investigated seasonal shifts in biomass and vertical distribution of heterotrophic and autotrophic micro-organisms (heterotrophic bacteria, picoautotrophs, colorless and pigmented nanoflagellates) and zooplankton across winter in relation to limnological characteristics and hydrodynamics. Boreal Lake Simoncouche was sampled at five depths on six dates between autumn overturn (November 2020) and spring overturn (April 2021) for temperature, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll-a, and plankton. Low chlorophyll-a and high heterotroph-to-autotroph biomass ratios indicated dominance of the heterotrophic energy pathway under ice. Heterotrophic micro-organisms also dominated during well-lit overturns, emphasizing the role of the microbial loop in all seasons. Zooplankton richness remained high under ice (18-22 taxa), with most species favoring deeper, warmer layers. Several species of rotifer and cladoceran sustained egg production through winter, ceasing only briefly in February. These findings highlight strong vertical and seasonal heterogeneity in winter-active plankton communities, shaped by stratification, light, and resources, and support the view that winter is biologically dynamic, with consequences for the subsequent open-water season.

All borrow pits had uniform habitats without shelter, and with limited spawning and nursery areas. Spawning and nursery habitat conditions in three borrow pits were experimentally improved by managed flooding during spring and summer, while the other three borrow pits were not flooded. Adult (>1 year) fish were surveyed in spring and autumn by beach seining and 0+ fish were monitored monthly by dipnetting and fry beach seine nets. Flooded borrow pits had slightly higher adult species richness, considerably higher adult fish abundance and considerably higher 0+ fish species richness and abundance.

J	KATTELMANN, R; ELDER, K				KATTELMANN, R; ELDER, K			HYDROLOGIC CHARACTERISTICS AND WATER-BALANCE OF AN ALPINE BASIN IN THE SIERRA-NEVADA	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												A water balance prepared for the Emerald Lake basin illustrates the absolute and relative magnitudes of the main water transfers in this alpine catchment in the Sierra Nevada over two water years. The water balance over both years, expressed as equivalent water depths averaged over the catchment area, was total precipitation (3670 mm) - total losses in the atmosphere (800 mm) = total streamflow (2830 mm) + residual (40 mm). Snow dominated the water balance during the study period, accounting for 95% of the precipitation. The spring snowmelt periods accounted for more than 85% of the annual streamflow and were followed by long recessions through summer, autumn, and winter. Estimated total evaporation from snow, water surfaces, soil, and vegetation at Emerald Lake was 22% of the estimated precipitation. Evaporation from snow was the principal water loss to the atmosphere, accounting for about 80% of the total evaporation. Actual evapotranspiration estimated over 15 nonwinter months was less than 4% of the precipitation during the two water years. Groundwater storage and release accounted for only a small portion of the total quantity of water in the annual water balance of this largely impermeable basin.

The results showed that AOB were the main ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms in water, and significantly higher copy numbers of the AOB amoA gene were observed in the summer (Aug 2012), while no significant differences were detected among the other three seasons. AOA showed low abundances throughout the year. The predominance of AOB in aquaculture water was suggested to be related to photoinhibition. Both the AOB and AOA amoA genes in aquaculture pond sediments showed typical seasonal patterns. The maximum density of AOB was observed in the autumn (Nov 2012) and winter (Jan 2013), while the maximum density of AOA was observed in winter. The minimum densities of both AOA and AOB occurred in the summer. The concentration of the AOA amoA gene was higher than that of the AOB amoA gene in sediments by almost one order of magnitude, which indicates that AOA are the dominant ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms in the aquaculture pond sediments. Dissolved oxygen is suggested to be the key factor determining the predominance of AOA in pond sediments.					; Li, Dapeng/K-6315-2018	he, xu gang/0000-0001-7123-2165; Li, Dapeng/0000-0002-8232-3094													1590-4261	1869-2044				JUN	2015	65	2					651	657		10.1007/s13213-014-0903-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13213-014-0903-2													WOS:000354724300005
J	Gasiunaite, ZR; Razinkovas, A				Gasiunaite, ZR; Razinkovas, A			Temporal and spatial patterns of crustacean zooplankton dynamics in a transitional lagoon ecosystem	HYDROBIOLOGIA					17th Baltic Marine Biologists Symposium	NOV 25-29, 2001	Stockholm, SWEDEN					Patterns and mechanisms of plankton crustacean seasonal succession in the eutrophic freshwater Curonian lagoon (south-eastern Baltic Sea) were analysed on the basis of four-year (1995, 1996, 1998 and 1999) field sampling results. The seasonal crustacean zooplankton succession in the lagoon appears to be the consistent six-stage sequence of four distinct species complexes. Each stage is characterised by its individual species composition and quantitative characteristics. The uniform and periodic pattern of the limnetic zooplankton crustacean successional stages in the lagoon indicates that the seasonal succession of the limnetic zooplankton is not disturbed by unpredictable environmental fluctuations, such as brackish water inflows. Seasonal zooplankton succession is also comparatively uniform at a spatial scale. Not more than two adjacent successional stages were found across the northern part of the lagoon during each of 11 seasonal surveys. Comparison between monthly water residence time and dominant plankton crustacean species life cycle duration points to a more transitory plankton community in spring while in the summer it is not much influenced by lagoon hydrodynamics. Consequently, the Curonian lagoon crustacean community quite closely follows the Plankton Ecology Group (PEG)-described freshwater lake seasonal succession in summer and turns into a lentic-like system in spring and autumn.					; Gasiunaite, Zita/AAT-7108-2021	Gasiunaite, Zita R./0000-0002-8598-0524; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB 15	2004	514	1-3					139	149		10.1023/B:hydr.0000018214.93205.32	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:hydr.0000018214.93205.32													WOS:000220784400014

Danjiangkou Reservoir is the water source area of the middle route of China's South-to-North Water Diversion project. In order to explore the spatial and temporal distribution and know the governing factors of the diatom community, 18srRNA sequencing was carried out from seven sampling sites of the reservoir. At the same time, the concentration of nutrients present in the collected sample water was also determined. The results showed that a total of 51 genera and 96 species were thriving the community of diatoms in Danjiangkou Reservoir. Discostella was dominant in summer and autumn, accounting for 98.84% and 62.71% of the diatom abundance, respectively. Aulacoseira was dominant in spring and winter, accounting for 60.62% and 60.90%, respectively. Discostella and Aulacoseira showed significant differences in seasonal variation (p < 0.05). The colinear network of diatoms changed significantly with the seasons, mainly consisting of Aulacoseira, Discostella, and Stephanodiscus. RDA redundancy analysis showed that water temperature (WT), total nitrogen (TN), NH4+-N, pH, and electrical conductivity (Cond) were the main environmental factors driving the changes in diatom community structure.

Bacterial production was calculated by the (H-3) thymidine method. For the water column, integrated estimates of bacterioplankton abundance ranged from 2.3 10(9) to 4.6 10(9) cells l-1, and carbon biomass from 0.037 to 0.068 mg C l-1; the thymidine incorporation rates ranged from 0.8 to 17.2 picomoles l-1 h-1, leading to net bacterial production estimates of less than 0.7-mu-g C l-1 d-1 in winter to 18-mu-g C l-1 d-1 in summer. About 55% of the production occurred in the euphotic layers. Over the year, the bacterial carbon requirement represented 90% of the autotrophic production for the whole lake. It was five times lower than autotrophic production in spring, but twice as high in summer. This important temporal lack of balance suggests that not all the spring primary production products are consumed immediately and/or that other carbon sources probably support bacterial growth in summer.																			0018-8158					NOV 22	1990	207						79	86		10.1007/BF00041443	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00041443													WOS:A1990EW45800010
J	ANDRLE, RF				ANDRLE, RF			NORTH AMERICAN MIGRANTS IN SIERRA DE TUXTLA OF SOUTHERN VERACRUZ MEXICO	CONDOR												The Sierra de Tuxtla, an isolated volcanic mountain range in southern Veracruz, Mexico, occupies a geographic position favorable for the occurrence of many North American birds that normally migrate through the Gulf coastal plain. The Sierra''s low relief and the generally parallel alignment of its major peaks with the coastline prevent it from acting as a barrier to most migrants. A variety of humid and drier habitats in the Sierra provides suitable conditions for many migrants. The majority of land-bird migrants frequent forest edge, thickets, and semi-open places in preference to the unbroken forest which covers many of the peaks and much of the Gulf-facing slopes. Although the 2 large water bodies, Lake Catemaco and Bahia Sontecomapan, do not possess extensive marsh habitat, they attract some migrant water and marsh birds. Northers in late winter and early spring cause concentrations of some water and land-bird transients, but the birds tend to disperse more in the autumn when there are usually less severe weather disturbances. Hawks take advantage of the updrafts over the Sierra, and large flights occasionally occur in spring. High densities of small passerines occasionally occur, and the number of migrants passing through the Sierra can be compared favorably with the number moving through areas of similar size in central and eastern United States. One hundred and thirty-one spp. of migrant birds have been reported from the Sierra de Tuxtla and coastal areas of its base. Information on abundance in the Sierra is supplied for many of the 67 spp. in the selective annotated list. Three spp. are believed to be new for Veracruz. New seasonal dates and some earlier and later spring and autumn migration dates than have heretofore been published for later spring and autumn migration dates than have heretofore been published for migrants in Veracruz are given for 26 spp. Six spp. have apparently not been previously recorded in Veracruz outside of the west-central mountains, and records are included of at least 15 spp. for which there have been few reports in the state.																				1938-5129					1966	68	2					177	+		10.2307/1365716	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1365716													WOS:A19668090500005
J	Tan, ZQ; Tao, H; Jiang, JH; Zhang, Q				Tan, Zhiqiang; Tao, Hui; Jiang, Jiahu; Zhang, Qi			Influences of Climate Extremes on NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) in the Poyang Lake Basin, China	WETLANDS												Based on long-term NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) derived from Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Study (GIMMS) and daily meteorological observations from 14 stations in the Poyang Lake Basin, this study investigated the relationship between vegetation variation and climatic extremes during 1982-2006. Ten typical indices were adopted to describe climatic extreme, including two precipitation-related and eight temperature-related indices. Correlation analysis shows that monthly averaged NDVI variations are generally determined by temperature but not precipitation extremes. Positive correlations appear between NDVI and temperature indices, and the correlations are more significant in spring and autumn. Significant negative correlations are found in summer and winter between NDVI and precipitation-related indices. In addition, spatial heterogeneity analysis shows that NDVI is more vulnerable to climate change for the middle basin than other regions. Finally, we demonstrate that NDVI can currently responds to temperature extremes or with a lag of 1 month. With respect to precipitation extremes, the strongest response may occur 2 months later. Our study highlights the role of climate extremes to the NDVI, and is helpful to improve the understanding of vegetation vulnerability to climate fluctuations.

Previous studies have highlighted substantial variations in fish quality across diverse cage culture regions. This study evaluated water quality, trophic status, heavy metal pollution in sediment and fish from five major large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea) cage culture regions in China -DJ (30 degrees 12 ' 00 '' N, 122 degrees 41 ' 54 '' E), DC (28 degrees 28 ' 07 '' N, 121 degrees 51 ' 57 '' E), DT (27 degrees 58 ' 49 '' N, 121 degrees 11 ' 43 '' E), NJ (27 degrees 28 ' 46 '' N, 121 degrees 02 ' 37 '' E), and ND (26 degrees 41 ' 21 '' N, 119 degrees 42 ' 32 '' E)-over different seasons. Results revealed significant eutrophication and poor water quality in the ND aquaculture area, characterized by high nutrient concentrations, low pH, and dissolved oxygen. Heavy metal analysis showed that sediments in ND contained the highest levels of Fe, Cu, Hg, Cd, Pb, and Cr, with the muscle of L. crocea in ND exhibiting elevated levels of Cd, Fe, and As, posing potential ecological risks. In contrast, other aquaculture areas, particularly NJ, exhibited lower pollution levels in water, sediment, and fish muscle, reflecting a more favorable environment for fish farming compared to ND. Seasonal analysis showed a decline in essential metals (Ca, Fe, Cu, Zn) during summer, with recovery in autumn and winter, while toxic metals (As, Cd, Pb, Hg) accumulated in autumn and winter. Additionally, Trophic levels in water and sediments peaked in summer and autumn, displaying region-specific variations. Some correlations between sediment-water nutrients and sediment-fish muscle metals further emphasized the interconnections among sediments, water, and biological systems. These findings emphasize the necessity of enhanced management practices to mitigate pollution and promote sustainable aquaculture.

Because of the relationship between biotic and abiotic factors, the determination of the trophic level of lakes is important. In this study, the trophic level of Lake Uluabat was determined using different trophic states indices (TSISD, TSICHL, TSITp, and TSITN) in 8 stations between May-2008 and May-2009. As a result, the indices were above the eutrophic level during the year. With regard to the seasonal variations of the indices, the highest values were in the summer and autumn (hypertrophic), while the lowest values were in the spring and winter seasons (hypertrophic-eutrophic). It was seen that in addition to nitrogen and phosphorus, temperature affected the growth of algae in the summer. For this reason, Chl-a (maximum 43.87 mg/m(3)) and alkalinity (maximum 282.85 mg/L) concentrations raised, and the dissolved oxygen (minimum 5.08 mg/L) concentrations decreased in the summer. It was observed that the diversity of the aquaculture species (fish and algae) decreased and the species having low economic value were dominant with an increase of the eutrophication level. According to the ratio between the nitrogen and phosphorus and a significant statistical correlation between nitrogen forms and chl-a, the algae species were co-limited by nitrogen with phosphorus the whole year and might be species that were each limited by different nutrients. The high diversity of species in the Lake, discharging of untreated domestic wastewater and chemical fertilizer usage were determined as the reasons of the co-limitation of the nitrogen with phosphorus. Also according to the trophic level and concentration values, Lake Uluabat exceeded the limit for potable water and water-oriented recreation.

To protect the wetland and the creatures in Poyang Lake, Jiangxi Province of China, it is essential for local officials to get more reference data and evidence to make a more scientific and sustainable development of them. Methods: A comprehensive survey was made on the time patterns of waterfowl communities using a UAV drone. And statistical analyses of the data included the Shannon-Wiener index and the Pielou index were computed. Result: The results of the study show that 211 species of birds were recorded, representing 13 orders and four families, accounting for 45.4% of the total 465 species of birds in Jiangxi Province. The bird community diversity index for the year was 3.19 and the uniformity index was 0.61, which was the highest in spring, followed by autumn, winter and summer.

Surface water temperature of the lake varied from 7-25.degree. C. The lake, which is fed by Wombat Creek (a small permanent stream), was cheimomictic with stratification occurring between summer and early autumn. In most years classical turnover would be unlikely; rather, epilimnetic water would be flushed from the lake by inflowing creek waters approximately 12 times/yr. Surface waters were always well oxygenated but the hypolimnion was anoxic between Dec. 1976 and March 1977. Transparency was greatest in winter and early spring and least in summer and early autumn, this reduction being caused by autochthonously produced algal matter and allochthonously derived suspended material. In common with many other Australian lakes, Lake Daylesford had a shallow euphotic zone 1-2 m deep that would limit phytoplankton production. In March and June 1977, over 99% of the incident visible light was absorbed in the top 1 m of the water column. The lake was classified as eutrophic on the basis of chlorophyll a levels, productivity, total P loadings and algal species. Chlorophyll a levels ranged from < 1 .mu.g l-1 in June 1977 to 79 .mu.g l-1 in Feb. 1977; the productivity maximum was 210 mg C m-3 day-1 (560 mg O2 m-3 day-1) in March 1977 and the estimated total P loading was 2.8 g P m-2 yr-1. The algal community was dominated by 3 genera: the blue-green alga Anabaena, the euglenoid Trachelomonas and the diatom Asterionella. Reduction of the P loading to the lake may do much to eliminate the annual algal blooms. Provision of sewerage facilities for the township of Daylesford may achieve the required reduction. The lake sediments contain elevated levels of P, mainly a result of past discharges of waste material from a potato-processing factory; the contribution of this sediment P to the water column is unknown but should be investigated.																			0067-1940						1980	31	5					573	587																WOS:A1980KV43300002

Discordant spatiotemporal dynamics of functional and phylogenetic diversity of rotiferan communities exposed to aquaculture effluent	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												The growth of the human population brought about the global intensification of aquacultural production, and aquaculture became the fastest growing animal husbandry sector. Effluent from aquaculture is an anthropogenic environmental burden, containing organic matter, nutrients and suspended solids that affect water quality especially in the water bodies of high biodiversity and conservation value. Water quality assessment often relies on bioindicators, analysing changes in taxonomic diversity of various freshwater organismal groups. Stepping beyond taxon diversity, we used functional and phylogenetic diversities of rotifers to identify factors affecting their community organization in response to an aquaculture effluent gradient in the largest oxbow lake in the Carpathian Basin, Hungary. Sampling was carried out three times per season at five points along a 3.5 km section of the oxbow lake, including the point of effluent inflow. We used eight traits to evaluate functional diversity: body size, trophi type, feeding mode, protection type, body wall type, corona type, habitat preference and tolerance level. Functional and phylogenetic distances among the 24 species identified indicated trait conservatism. Rotiferan diversity increased with increasing distance from the point of influx in spring and summer. Among the factors affecting community organization in spring and summer, we find examples of environmental filtering, while in autumn the role of biotic interaction is more frequent. Under nutrient-rich conditions in spring and summer, organisms belonging to the same functional group were dominant, whereas under oligotrophic conditions, more diverse but less abundant groups were present. Considering functional and phylogenetic traits allowed us to identify organising forces of rotifer communities in the largest oxbow lake of the Hungarian Lowland.

Daily average O-3 ranged from 21.8 ppbv to 653 ppbv with an annual average of 41.0 ppbv. Seasonal average of O-3 followed a decreasing order of summer > autumn > spring > winter. Diurnal variations of O-3 showed low concentrations during daytime and high concentrations during late night and early morning. An intensive campaign was also conducted during Aug. 13-31, 2010 to investigate correlations between meteorological or chemical conditions and O-3. It was found that O-3 was poorly correlated with solar radiation due to the insufficient NOx in the ambient air, thus limiting O-3 formation under strong solar radiation. In contrast, high O-3 levels always coincided with strong winds, suggesting that stratospheric O-3 and long range transport might be the main sources of O-3 in this rural area. Back-trajectory analysis supported this hypothesis and further indicated the transport of air masses from northwest, northeast and southeast directions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Strong P-deficiency was detected in summer (June - September), moderate to strong deficiency also during the spring phytoplankton maximum. The concentration of SRP < 5 mug.l-1 indicates phosphorus deficiency in the Rimov reservoir.

J	Beyene, MT; Jain, S				Beyene, Mussie T.; Jain, Shaleen			Wintertime weather-climate variability and its links to early spring ice-out in Maine lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												In recent decades, Maine lakes have recorded their earliest ice-out dates in over a century. In temperate regions, seasonal lake ice-cover is a critical phenomenon linking climate, aquatic ecosystem and society. And the lengthening of the ice-free period due to warmer climate has been linked to increased algal growth and declining lake water quality, warming of water temperatures leading to alterations in aquatic biodiversity, and the shortening of ice-fishing period and other traditional winter activities over lakes. In this study, historical record of eight lakes and six benchmarked meteorological stations in Maine for the period 1950-2010 were analyzed to (1) investigate the relationship between antecedent winter (January-February) temperatures, degree-day variables, and spring-time ice breakup dates, including the identification of thresholds and (2) determine the influence of the extreme phases of select atmospheric teleconnection patterns (Tropical Northern hemisphere- TNH and North Atlantic Oscillation- NAO) on the winter degree-day quantities and spring ice-out dates. The influence of antecedent winter degree-days on spring ice-out dates was characterized by determining the threshold winter accumulated freezing and melting degree-day (AFDD and AMDD), the exceedance (non-exceedance) of which engenders early (late) spring ice-out dates. Statistical analysis between teleconnection indices and winter AFDD and/or AMDD quantities for Maine revealed an asymmetric relationship. Strongly negative phases of TNH and, to a lesser extent, positive phases of NAO are linked with spatial and temporal pattern of early spring ice breakup events in Maine lakes. These relationships taken together with observed warming trends have the potential to accelerate the decline in water quality in Maine lakes.

It reflects the changes of available terrestrial energy in the context of global warming, and thus can serve as an indicator of regional climate change. The recently developed HIRS (High-resolution infrared radiation sounder onboard NOAA satellites) LST product is among the longest LST records. We have analysed the HIRS LST against ground measurements from 66 stations in the Poyang Lake basin, China, considering the temporal variations at daily and interannual time scales during 1980-2009. The error metrics of correlation coefficient, Bias and unbiased Root Mean Square Deviation (ubRMSD) are used, together with the long-term linear trends. The two data sets have considerable agreement with respect to daily variations. Their correlation coefficients are higher than 0.95 for all stations; and those for daily anomalies range from 0.73 to 0.85 across the basin. The Bias and the ubRMSD have indicated that the HIRS data have generally underestimated the LST across the basin, mainly because of its large underestimation of the occurrences of temperature higher than 35 degrees C. Nevertheless, the HIRS LST has largely overestimated the occurrences of summer days with temperature ranging 20-30 degrees C. The Bias and the ubRMSD appear to be smaller in the cropped plains and much larger in the afforested mountain areas. As for the interannual variations, the HIRS LST shows highest correlations with ground measurement in spring; they are lowest in summer, possibly due to the interference of monsoonal precipitation. Both the HIRS LST and ground measurements show significant increasing trends with similar patterns in spring and winter. However, the long-term trends are significantly overestimated across the basin in summer, but underestimated in autumn in the HIRS LST data.

Importance of a Lake-Wetland Complex for a Resilient Walleye Fishery	WETLANDS												Wetlands serve as unique habitats that can support high biodiversity. Large-scale loss of wetland habitats can threaten important linkages between lake and wetland habitats that could affect diversity and growth of aquatic organisms. In this study, we compare prey diversity and abundance as well as Walleye (Sander vitreus) diets and condition in a large glacial lake (Lake Kampeska, South Dakota) with a connected wetland to better understand seasonal changes in the benefits provided by each habitat. We examined seasonal differences (spring, summer, and fall) through two years (summer 2021 through fall 2022) between the habitats using prey fish catch per unit effort, richness, Shannon diversity, and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity as well as Walleye relative weight, percent of empty stomachs, diet weight, stomach fullness, diet energy, and diet taxa importance. The prey fish community was more diverse and abundant in the wetland, and Walleye consumed more prey (by weight) in the wetland during all seasons except spring. Wetland reconnection can be a tool for managers to improve water quality while providing seasonal habitat needs for fish. Additionally, the diversity of prey resources provided by wetlands, many of which are unique, support resilience in the face of ecological change. Protection of wetlands may be critical for maintaining healthy and resilient fisheries into the future.

J	SPATARU, P				SPATARU, P			FOOD AND FEEDING-HABITS OF TILAPIA-ZILLII (GERVAIS) (CICHLIDAE) IN LAKE KINNERET (ISRAEL)	AQUACULTURE												Analysis of the gut content of 329 specimens of T. zillii (Cichlidae) collected from Lake Kinneret, has shown great variation in the sorts of food. A study of seasonal dynamics has proved the prevalence in the food of Chironomida pupae (Diptera) in winter and spring and of zooplankton forms in summer and autumn. The additional food consisted of the various groups of algae, the most frequently found being Cyanophyta (100%) and Pyrrophyta (64.16%). An extremely voracous species, it consumes anything that comes its way in the water: algae, scraps of macrophytes, autochthonous and allochthonous insects, and forms of benthic origin, such as Nematoda, Ostracoda, Porifera and Chironomida (larvae). The satiation index is high (4.08-5.63), in contradiction to the low values of the coefficient of condition (3.05-3.51), and with the slow rate of growth in Lake Kinneret. The main food of T. zillii, consists of arthropod species with a chitin content (which is eliminated unchanged) of more than 50% of the total weight, and this may account for the poor exploitation of the trophic base. This species of fish may be considered detrimental to others (i.e. commercially important species) because of its successful competition for food, not because it is an aggressive consumer of their spawn and fry.																			0044-8486	1873-5622					1978	14	4					327	338		10.1016/0044-8486(78)90015-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0044-8486(78)90015-7													WOS:A1978FP81500004

During five sampling campaigns, we measured N2O fluxes froma 0.53 ha off-stream CW treating nitrate-richwater fromthe intensively fertilized watershed in Rampillon, France, using automated chambers with a quantum cascade laser system, and manual chambers. Sediment samples were analysed for potential N-2 flux using the He-O-2 incubation method. Both inlet nitrate (NO3-) concentrations and N2O emission varied significantly between the seasons. In the Autumn and Winter inlet concentrations were about 11 mg NO3--N L-1, and < 6.5 mg NO3--N L-1 in the Spring and Summer. N2O emission was highest in the Autumn (mean +/- standard error: 9.7 +/- 0.2 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)) and lowest in the Summer (wet period: 0.2 +/- 0.3 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)). The CW was a very weak source of N2O emitting 0.32 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1) and removing around 938 kg NO3--N ha(-1) yr(-1), the ratio of N2O-N emitted to NO3--N removed was 0.033%. The automated and manual chambers gave similar results. From the potential N2O formation in the sediment, only 9% was emitted to the atmosphere, the average N-2 N O-2 ratio was high: 89:1 for N-2-N-potential: N2O-N-potential and 1353:1 for N-2-N-potential: N2O-N-emitted. These results indicate complete denitrification. The focused principal component analysis showed strong positive correlation between the gaseous N2O fluxes and the following environmental factors: NO3--N concentrations in inlet water, streamflow, and nitrate reduction rate. Water temperature, TOC and DOC in thewater and hydraulic residence time showed negative correlations with N2O emissions. Shallow off-stream CWs such as Rampillon may have good nitrate removal capacity with low N2O emissions. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Luo, WG; Xu, SY; Lu, J; Zhu, SL				Luo, Wenguang; Xu, Suyao; Lu, Jing; Zhu, Senlin			Seasonal sediment phosphate release flux of shallow lakes impacted by dual environmental factors	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS												PurposeIt is a difficult task to predict the phosphate release flux from sediments in shallow lakes in different seasons due to the uncertainty of seasonal changes in phosphate release, especially considering the combined influence of water temperature and dynamic disturbance. Therefore, it is worth investigating the spatiotemporal changes of phosphate release from sediments under the combined impacts of hydrodynamic processes and water temperature.Materials and methodsTo analyze the seasonal patterns of phosphate release in shallow lakes, a physical model of sediment release in Chaohu Lake was established, and the phosphate release rates of 12 original sediment columns were observed under the combined effects of three levels of hydrodynamic disturbance intensity and temperature.Results and discussionThe experimental results showed that under the three hydrodynamic conditions, when the temperature increases from 10 to 30 degrees C, the phosphate release rate decreases at first and then increases. Through linear fitting, it is found that when the disturbance increases from weak to strong (three levels: I disturbed -> II disturbed -> III disturbed), the temperature corresponding to the minimum phosphate release rate (Vmin) of the sediment decreases (24.64 degrees C -> 24.14 degrees C -> 23.68 degrees C). The corresponding tables of sediment release rate under five water temperatures and three hydrodynamic disturbances were developed, and then, the seasonal release flux of phosphate could be estimated.ConclusionsAccording to the estimates, the phosphate release was the largest in summer, with little difference in spring and autumn, and was the smallest in winter. Future warming will induce the greatest impact in spring. The results of this study are of great significance to the scientific diagnosis of the phosphate cycle in shallow lakes.

J	Thompson, BE; Ferreri, CP				Thompson, BE; Ferreri, CP			Population biology of steelhead spawning runs in three Pennsylvania tributaries to Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Little is currently, known about the population biology, of steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) that spawn in Pennsylvania's Lake Erie tributaries or the role of natural reproduction in supporting this fisher), despite its popularity and importance. The goal of this study, was to describe the population characteristics of steelhead spawning runs in Crooked Creek, Godfrey, Rim, and Trout Run, three Pennsylvania Lake Erie tributaries that are annually, stocked with 80,000 to 200,000 yearling steelhead. From fall 1997 to spring 1999, returning adult steelhead were sampled during both fall and spring spawning runs using seines and backpack electrofishing gear. Sex was determined using external characteristics, total length was measured, and a scale sample was collected from each fish. Scales were analyzed to determine age, life history, patterns, and relative contributions of wild and hatchet-reared fish to seasonal spawning runs. Male steelhead dominated sex ratios in both Godfrey, Rim and Trout Run during both seasons, while female steelhead were more prevalent in Crooked Creek. Stream-age I steelhead were predominant in both fall and spring runs in all three streams. During both seasons in all streams, the majority, of males returned after spending only, one summer in Lake Eric while most female steelhead returned at lake-age-2. The relative contribution of wild steelhead to Pennsylvania spawning runs was minimal in all three streams for both seasons. As a result, future success of Pennsylvania's steelhead fishery, will likely, require the continuation of annual tributary, stocking of steelhead smolts.																			0380-1330						2002	28	2					264	275		10.1016/S0380-1330(02)70582-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(02)70582-0													WOS:000176424300014
B	Mihu-Pintilie, A	MihuPintilie, A			Mihu-Pintilie, Alin	MihuPintilie, A		The Seasonal Variation of Physical-Chemical Parameters and Water Quality Assessment (WQI)	NATURAL DAM LAKE CUEJDEL IN THE STANISOAREI MOUNTAINS, EASTERN CARPATHIANS: A LIMNOGEOGRAPHICAL STUDY												The physico-chemical analysis of Cuejdi hydrographic basin and the Cuejdel lake basin was realized based on a monitoring program which consisted of analysing the seasonal variation of main physico-chemical parameters, with major implications in establishing the degree of trophicity in which the lacustrine ecosystem is located and also regarding the qualitative identification of the biotic component. The scientific approach consisted of two distinct methods: measurements in situ and sampling evidences for laboratory research. In situ, the measurements were made with a portable multi-parameter (Hach Lange device) to collect physico-chemical data. Based on this, Cuejdel Lake acts as a dimictic reservoir with direct thermal stratification during the summer, spring and autumn, and reverse stratification during the winter. At the lowest depths, the temperature is constant all year (5 degrees C). The surface water is influenced by the air temperature. The water is slightly alkaline with values that oscillate around 8. The alkalinity of the water is caused by the elements that are transported in the water as the hydrographic basin drains. The water in the upper section of the lake is very rich in oxygen. Below 10-11 m, dissolved oxygen is not present. The assessment of water quality from Cuejdi River was performed through 13 parameters. 30 samples were collected during spring and autumn, measurements being made both in situ aquatic ecosystem (Multi 350i/SET WTW) and in the laboratory (bench meter Hanna HI 4421, Titroline 700 SI Analytics and WTW Turb 555IR). The main fact is that a water quality parameter has no equal contribution to the final stage of water quality in all seasons; they can be different from both natural and anthropogenic causes. The analysis, especially the spatial distribution of the nitrate levels, revealed an important degradation of the water quality owed to the anthropogenic pressure. Furthermore, the findings confirm that the natural contamination of the Cuejdi River is less harmful than the contamination with compounds resulted from anthropogenic activities.

Thermal, chemical, and optical properties of Crater Lake, Oregon	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Crater Lake covers the floor of the Mount Mazama caldera that formed 7700 years ago. The lake has a surface area of 53 km(2) and a maximum depth of 594 m. There is no outlet stream and surface inflow is limited to small streams and springs. Owing to its great volume and heat, the lake is not covered by snow and ice in winter unlike other lakes in the Cascade Range. The lake is isothermal in winter except for a slight increase in temperature in the deep lake from hyperadiabatic processes and inflow of hydrothermal fluids. During winter and spring the water column mixes to a depth of about 200-250 m from wind energy and convection. Circulation of the deep lake occurs periodically in winter and spring when cold, near-surface waters sink to the lake bottom; a process that results in the upwelling of nutrients, especially nitrate-N, into the upper strata of the lake. Thermal stratification occurs in late summer and fall. The maximum thickness of the epilimnion is about 20 m and the metalimnion extends to a depth of about 100 m. Thus, most of the lake volume is a cold hypolimnion. The year-round near-bottom temperature is about 3.5 degrees C. Overall, hydrothermal fluids define and temporally maintain the basic water quality characteristics of the lake (e.g., pH, alkalinity and conductivity). Total phosphorus and orthophosphate-P concentrations are fairly uniform throughout the water column, where as total Kjeldahl-N and ammonia-N are highest in concentration in the upper lake. Concentrations of nitrate-N increase with depth below 200 m. No long-term changes in water quality have been detected. Secchi disk (20-cm) clarity varied seasonally and annually, but was typically highest in June and lowest in August. During the current study, August Secchi disk clarity readings averaged about 30 m. The maximum individual clarity reading was 41.5 m in June 1997. The lowest reading was 18.1 m in July 1995. From 1896 (white-dinner plate) to 2003, the average August Secchi disk reading was about 30 m. No long-term changes in the Secchi disk clarity were observed. Average turbidity of the water column (2-550 m) between June and September from 1991 to 2000 as measured by a transmissometer ranged between 88.8% and 90.7%. The depth of 1% of the incident solar radiation during thermal stratification varied annually between 80 m and 100 m. Both of these measurements provided additional evidence about the exceptional clarity of Crater Lake.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2007	574						69	84		10.1007/s10750-006-0346-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0346-2													WOS:000242361600005
J	Woods, CMC				Woods, CMC			Natural diet of the seahorse Hippocampus abdominalis	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												This investigation examined the diet of adult wild seahorses, Hippocampus abdominalis Leeson 1827, from Wellington Harbour, New Zealand. Diet of seahorses (n = 59) collected from shallow subtidal macroalgal stands consisted largely of crustaceans, in particular amphipods (e.g., caprellid and ischyrocerid amphipods), caridean shrimp (i.e., Hippolyte bifidirostris), and peracarids (i.e., the mysid Tenagomysis similis). There were no differences in diet between male and female seahorses. Smaller seahorses consumed a greater amount of crustaceans than larger seahorses, as a result of the greater proportion of amphipods in their gut contents. There were some seasonal differences in diet, with amphipod consumption peaking in spring and summer, and decapod consumption lowest in autumn.

Anders; Hansson, Lars-Anders; Skov, Christian; Brodersen, Jakob; Bronmark, Christer			Timing and synchrony of migration in a freshwater fish: Consequences for survival	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												Animal migration is one of the most spectacular and visible behavioural phenomena in nature with profound implications for a range of ecological and evolutionary processes. Successful migration hinges on the ability to exploit temporary resources (e.g. food) and evade threats (e.g. predators) as they arise, and thus the timing of migration is often regarded as a dominant predictor of individual migratory success. However, with the exception of intensively studied taxa (mainly birds), relatively few studies have investigated inter-individual annual and seasonal variation in migratory timing and performance, or tested predictions on how migration across high and low predation-risk habitats may exert selection on migratory timing. In particular, studies that assess the survival consequences of variation in migratory timing remain rare, which is most likely due to the logistical challenges associated with monitoring survival success and population-level characteristics simultaneously. Here, we address the above-mentioned questions using roach Rutilus rutilus, a fish that migrates from lakes characterised by high predation risk into low-risk streams during winter. Specifically, we used individual-based tracking of roach in two European lake systems over multiple migration periods (9 and 7 years respectively), to obtain highly detailed (year-round scheduling, repeat journeys and the fate of individuals) data on the variability/synchrony of migratory timing in spring and autumn respectively. We report seasonal differences in the variability of migratory timing, with lower variance and higher migration synchrony in spring lake arrival timing as compared to autumn lake departure timing. Furthermore, the timing of autumn migration is more variable across years than the timing of spring migration. Second, we find that later arrival to the lake habitat is positively associated with apparent survival from 1 year to the next, whereas we found no effect of lake departure timing on survival probability. These findings represent rare evidence showing how intraspecific variation in timing in migratory fish differs across years and seasons, and how variation in timing can translate into survival consequences for prey in systems characterised by high predation risk.

Because of the virulence and pathogenicity of VHSV IVb, follow-up testing was conducted between 2007 and 2010. This testing found no further evidence of VHSV IVb presence. Similar patterns (i.e., initial mortality events followed by no evidence of additional infections) have been observed in other waterbodies, which leads to questions regarding the implications that these patterns could have for fisheries management (e. g., could stocking naive fish lead to additional epizootic occurrences?). This study was conducted to determine whether VHSV IVb was still present in Budd Lake by intensively sampling across multiple seasons, locations, and size-groups of Muskellunge Esox masquinongy, Northern Pike Esox lucius, and Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides. Individuals were tested for both active VHSV IVb infection and antibody production. We found that VHSV IVb was still present in Budd Lake, as active infections were detected from samples in spring, summer, and fall 2011, with highest infection prevalence in spring 2011. Spring 2011 infection prevalence was 17% for esocids and 33% for Largemouth Bass. Between 74% and 80% of collected esocids produced antibodies, depending on the sampling season. Antibody production in Largemouth Bass ranged from 12% in spring and fall 2011 to 20% in spring 2012. Based on these results, we recommend sustained vigilance in the management of VHSV IVb-positive systems to limit the risk of virus spread as it is perhaps questionable whether systems that have experienced an outbreak will ever be virus-free.					faisal, M/GQB-4757-2022; Brenden, Travis/B-2186-2012														0275-5947	1548-8675					2015	35	3					503	511		10.1080/02755947.2015.1020077	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2015.1020077													WOS:000357389100009

In females, the mean fork length of potential (subsequent) 1+ smolts and potential 1+ parr (1+ parr show fish that neither smolted nor matured until 1 + autumn) always differed after their first summer (0+ summer), the former being larger. In males, the juveniles that grew faster during their first spring became 0+ mature male parr. After their first summer, potential I + smolts were always larger in body length than potential 1 + mature parr and potential 1 + parr. These results were similar to previous reports of anadromous masu salmon, suggesting that the lacustrine masu salmon studied seems to have maintained the phase differentiation as in the original fish, likely because only 60 years have passed since the formation of the lacustrine population.																			1341-8998					NOV 25	2002	49	4					397	400		10.1007/s102280200061	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s102280200061													WOS:000183076600017

Phenotypic variation in the molt characteristics of a seasonal coat color-changing species reveals limited resilience to climate change	OECOLOGIA												The snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) possesses a broad suite of adaptations to winter, including a seasonal coat color molt. Recently, climate change has been implicated in the range contraction of snowshoe hares along the southern range boundary. With shortening snow season duration, snowshoe hares are experiencing increased camouflage mismatch with their environment reducing survival. Phenological variation of hare molt at regional scales could facilitate local adaptation in the face of climate change, but the level of variation, especially along the southern range boundary, is unknown. Using a network of trail cameras and historical museum specimens, we (1) developed contemporary and historical molt phenology curves in the Upper Great Lakes region, USA, (2) calculated molt rate and variability in and among populations, and (3) quantified the relationship of molt characteristics to environmental conditions for snowshoe hares across North America. We found that snowshoe hares across the region exhibited similar fall and spring molt phenologies, rates and variation. Yet, an insular island population of hares on Isle Royale National Park, MI, completed their molt a week earlier in the fall and initiated molt almost 2 weeks later in the spring as well as exhibited slower rates of molting in the fall season compared to the mainland. Over the last 100 years, snowshoe hares across the region have not shifted in fall molt timing; though contemporary spring molt appears to have advanced by 17 days (similar to 4 days per decade) compared to historical molt phenology. Our research indicates that some variation in molt phenology exists for snowshoe hares in the Upper Great Lakes region, but whether this variation is enough to offset the consequences of climate change remains to be seen.

Winter ecology of specialist and generalist morphs of European whitefish, Coregonus lavaretus, in subarctic northern Europe	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												European whitefish is a model species for adaptive radiation of fishes in temperate and subarctic lakes. In northern Europe the most commonly observed morphotypes are a generalist (LSR) morph and a pelagic specialist (DR) morph. The evolution of a pelagic specialist morph is something of an enigma, however, as this region is characterized by long, dark winters with pelagic primary production limited to a brief window in late summer. We conducted the first winter-based study of polymorphic whitefish populations to determine the winter ecology of both morphs, and we combined seasonal diet and stable isotope analysis with several proxies of condition in three polymorphic whitefish populations. The generalist LSR morph fed on benthic and pelagic prey in summer but was solely reliant on benthic prey in winter. This was associated with a noticeable but moderate reduction in condition, lipid content and stomach fullness in winter relative to summer. In contrast, the DR whitefish occupied a strict pelagic niche in both seasons. A significant reduction in pelagic prey during winter resulted in severe decrease in condition, lipid content and stomach fullness in DR whitefish in winter relative to summer, with the pelagic morph apparently approaching starvation in winter. We suggest that this divergent approach to seasonal foraging is associated with the divergent life-history traits of both morphs.					; Harrod, Chris/A-8830-2008	Hayden, Brian/0000-0002-8524-7373; Kahilainen, Kimmo/0000-0002-1539-014X; 														1095-8649				AUG	2022	101	2			SI		389	399		10.1111/jfb.14999	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfb.14999		FEB 2022						35142375					WOS:000753432300001

In this study, the variations of 15 frequently used antibiotics in Honghu Lake and surrounding ponds were investigated seasonally to figure out the impact of pond farming on antibiotics distributions in Honghu Lake. Results showed that the antibiotic concentrations in fish ponds ranged from 11.76 to 389.8 ng/L, while in crab and crayfish ponds were lower than 30.49 ng/L. The predominant antibiotic in fish ponds was florfenicol, followed by sulfonamides and quinolones, with generally low concentrations. Sulfonamides and florfenicol were the main antibiotics in Honghu Lake, affected by the surrounding aquaculture water partially. The antibiotics residue in aquaculture ponds showed obvious seasonal characteristics, with the lowest in spring. From summer, the concentrations of antibiotics in aquaculture ponds gradually increased and reached a peak in autumn, and the seasonal variation of antibiotics in the receiving lake was also related to the antibiotics in the aquaculture ponds. Risk assessment analysis showed that antibiotics such as enrofloxacin and florfenicol in fish ponds posed a medium and low risk to algae, and Honghu Lake acted as a natural reservoir of antibiotics and poses increased risks to algae. In general, our study demonstrated that aquaculture represented by pond farming brought significant risks of antibiotic pollution to natural water bodies. Therefore, reasonable control of the fish antibiotics usage in autumn and winter, as well as the rational use of antibiotics in aquaculture and the use of antibiotics before pond cleaning, is required to reduce the migration of antibiotics from aquaculture surface water to the receiving lake.

Organic matters, nutrients load and oxygen concentration fluctuated highly along the river and over time because of WWTPs discharge. Tag pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes revealed the significant effect of seasonality on the richness, the bacterial diversity (Shannon index) and BCC. The major grouping: -winter/fall samples versus spring/summer samples-could be associated with fluctuations of in situ bacterial activities (dissolved and particulate organic carbon biodegradation associated with oxygen consumption and N transformation). BCC of the samples collected upstream from the WWTPs discharge were significantly different from BCC of downstream samples and WWTPs effluents, while no significant difference was found between BCC of WWTPs effluents and the downstream samples as revealed by ANOSIM. Analysis per season showed that allochthonous bacteria brought by WWTPs effluents triggered the changes in community composition, eventually followed by rapid post-disturbance return to the original composition as observed in April (resilience), whereas community composition remained altered after the perturbation by WWTPs effluents in the other seasons.

J	Xia, LL; Zhu, YL; Zhao, ZH				Xia, Liling; Zhu, Yuelong; Zhao, Zhenhua			Understanding the Ecological Response of Planktic and Benthic Epipelic Algae to Environmental Factors in an Urban Rivers System	WATER												Many studies have been concentrated on the distribution of algae in lakes, rivers, and seas, however, few studies have been concerned about their distribution and relation with polluted urban rivers. In this study, the spatio-temporal variation characteristics of water quality and algae community in Nanjing city were investigated with microscopic examination for one year. Results showed that the water pollution in this area was mainly related to high concentration of nitrogen (NH3-N and TN (Total nitrogen). There was a total of 77 species of algae in the studied rivers from June 2016 to May 2017, among which 73 species of planktic algae and 34 species of epipelic algae, in which the abundance and biomass of the latter were 1925 and 904 times that of the former, respectively. The two kinds of algae had different change tendencies which were related to seasons. For planktic algae, the abundance and biomass decreased in this season sequence: summer, spring, autumn, and winter. For epipelic algae, the abundance and biomass were relatively higher in winter. The dominant community of planktic algae was Chlorophyta-Bacillariophyceae-Cyanobacteria type, while that of epipelic algae was Bacillariophyceae-Cyanobacteria type. Most of the present algae were bi-trophic species, and were tightly related to the pollution characteristics of the rivers. The key environmental factors for planktic algae are T, TN, and TP, and those for Epipelic algae are N:P and TN. The relation between the community composition of planktic and epipelic algae and environmental parameters are highly complex, and it is worth carrying out further study to clarify their interaction mechanism.

J	Hand, RE; Nell, JA				Hand, RE; Nell, JA			Studies on triploid oysters in Australia - XII. Gonad discolouration and meat condition of diploid and triploid Sydney rock oysters (Saccostrea commercialis) in five estuaries in New South Wales, Australia	AQUACULTURE												The relative performance, in terms of meat condition, of triploid compared to diploid Sydney rock oysters varied among five widely distributed sites in New South Wales (NSW). Over the final year on leases, ploidy, month and the ploidy x month interaction had a significant effect on meat condition at all sites except for ploidy at the southern, Lake Pambula site. From March to December (autumn to the first month of summer), triploid condition indices were higher, or not significantly different from those of diploids at all sites. Condition indices of triploids were higher than those of diploids from May to November/December at four of the five sites. A higher condition index (CI) of triploids became apparent later in the sampling period for the Lake Pambula site in comparison to the remaining four sites. Triploid Sydney rock oysters were susceptible to brown discolouration of the gonad surface. Discolouration occurred in localised areas of the gonad and was not correlated to CI except for triploids at Lake Pambula, As discolouration was less noticeable during cooler months of the year, thus, coinciding with the generally superior condition of triploids relative to diploids during winter and spring, triploids remain a viable winter crop for farmers throughout NSW.

Temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and EC (electrical conductivity) were measured. DORM 3 and DOLT 4 reference material showed good accuracy. In the water, Fe had the highest level, while Cd had the lowest. Generally, heavy metal levels increased in spring. Both positive and negative correlations were detected between their content in water and physico-chemical parameters. Results of the heavy metal levels were compared with national and international water quality guidelines. In sediment, Fe was the highest too. In fish, high levels of heavy metals were found in liver of pikeperch while low levels in muscle and gill samples depended on metal properties. In season, the metal levels were highest in autumn in muscle, in summer in liver, and in winter in gill. Positive and negative relationships were found between metal levels and fish size. Metal concentrations in the muscle of examined fish were compared with Turkish Food Codex and EC standarts.

Previous studies were conducted for individual cases or specific periods. At present, there is a lack of global assessments on the influence of climate warming in different seasons on thermal stratification. The ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) dataset was used to estimate the variability of water body mixing and its drivers in different seasons and regions. Results indicate that global warming could enhance thermal stratification and decrease the MLD globally in summer. Wind speed was the primary driver of MLD changes, followed by temperature. However, ice melt due to global warming enhanced the mixing in ice-covered waters in the Northern Hemisphere, and early ice melt led to early mixing. Ice depth was the primary driver of MLD changes in the Northern Hemisphere due to delayed ice formation and earlier melting, while wind speed was the primary driver in other regions or during ice-free seasons. The enhanced mixing due to earlier ice melt out in late winter and early spring could promote water circulation and nutrient turnover, and replenish dissolved oxygen in deep water, thereby promoting the maximum biomass of cyanobacteria and advance harmful algal blooms.

Throughout the study, rotifer species and individuals dominated the zooplankton. The abundance of the zooplankton tended to remain high when Hydrilla biomass was at its seasonal low during late winter and early spring. When hydrilla growth increased in the late spring and summer months causing a decrease in total alkalinity, specific conductivity, water color, turbidity, Pi and chlorophyll a concentrations; the abundance of the zooplankton declined. During this time, there was a shift from limnetic to littoral species, principally rotifers, Hydrilla growth did not affect the mean number of cladoceran or copepod species, but may have led to an increase in rotifer species.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1984	111	2					127	132		10.1007/BF00008625	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008625													WOS:A1984SQ38000007
J	Gerten, D; Adrian, R				Gerten, D; Adrian, R			Differences in the persistency of the North Atlantic Oscillation signal among lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Large-scale climatic fluctuations, such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), are known to influence variability in abiotic site conditions and organism population dynamics in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Here we demonstrate that the influence of the NAO on lake water temperatures-one of the major factors controlling ecological processes in lakes-differs substantially among lake types of different thermal structures and mixing regimes, even under identical climatic forcing. A frequently circulating polymictic lake was found to be least influenced by the winter effects of the NAO, with an effect lasting only into early spring. In contrast, in a deep dimictic lake with stable summer stratification, the NAO signal persisted in the hypolimnion until the following winter. A shallow dimictic lake revealed an intermediate response, as weather conditions both in April and midsummer probably modified the strength and persistency of the NAO signal in the hypolimnion of that lake. Based on these results, it is to be expected that NAO effects on ecological processes vary significantly among lakes. Because the study period (1979-1998) includes a series of uncommonly warm winter and spring seasons, our findings also suggest that the influence of anticipated climate warming will vary substantially among lake types.

The research covered seven lakes in Murmansk, subject to various levels of anthropogenic load. Field studies were conducted in 2019-2020. Water samples were taken both in summer and in winter/spring seasons. The most polluted lake was Lake Ledovoe, where the highest concentrations of V, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, W, and Mn were found. Lake Yuzhnoe, which is characterized by the lowest concentrations of studied heavy metals, was the least subject to anthropogenic load. In total, V, Ni, Zn, Fe, and Mn were above the background levels in the lakes of Murmansk. The analysis of the seasonal variation showed that the highest concentrations of heavy metals were found in winter/spring season and reached their maximum during the period of melt water intake from the catchment area.

A comprehensive year-long study conducted in the wetlands of Yangcheng Lake unveiled a stratified pollutant removal pattern governed by hydraulics regulated by microtopography: deep-water zones exhibited pronounced seasonal variability in nutrient removal efficiency, with significantly higher contributions during winter-spring compared to summer-autumn, while shallow areas demonstrated superior capabilities in degrading organic pollutants. The shallow zones, characterized by higher densities and biomass of submerged plants, played a pivotal role in supporting biologically mediated purification processes. Additionally, benthic communities, predominantly composed of pollution-tolerant insects (30.6 %) and gastropods (22.2 %), further enhanced nutrient cycling and ecosystem functionality. Through innovative application of structural equation modeling, this study identified micro-topography as the dominant factor driving pollutant removal and ecological restoration. For every 0.1 m increase in microtopographic water depth, the total nitrogen (TN) removal rate increases by 0.313 %. These findings provide a transformative perspective on optimizing wetland restoration through engineered microtopographic design and offer valuable theoretical insights for advancing the development and implementation of ecological restoration technologies.																			2214-7144					MAY	2025	73								107701	10.1016/j.jwpe.2025.107701	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jwpe.2025.107701		APR 2025											WOS:001473146100001

The Eubacteria domain dominated over the Archaea domain (< 15 %) at the highest phylogenetic level. The Sphingo-bacteria-Flavobacteria group of the Bacteroidetes phylum (SFB) numerically dominated in spring and early summer. The alpha-Proteobacteria dominated from late summer to winter. The SAR11 clade represented similar to 13% of the microbial community throughout the year and accounted for up to 69% of a-Proteobacteria in late spring. Annually, gamma-Proteobacteria were 2 or 3 times less abundant than the other groups and showed no obvious seasonal trend. The SAR86 cluster accounted for up to half of gamma-Proteobacteria when it peaked in summer. Consequently, we found that community structure at higher taxonomic level did not change dramatically with season but lower level phylogenetic groups showed pronounced seasonal peaks.

However, there are relatively few temperature reconstructions from the East Asian Monsoon region, which has hindered our mechanistic understanding so far. To address this issue, a new time series of paleo-temperature was developed, based on the analysis of branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) from the well-dated sedimentary record of Sihailongwan maar lake (Lake SHL). This was achieved in two steps. Firstly, the sources and timing of seasonal production of brGDGTs were evaluated in the modern settings of Lake SHL. Secondly, using this information, we attempted to correct the temperature bias from soil derived brGDGTs using a binary mixing model, and a quantitative reconstruction of the paleo-temperature was derived from the Lake SHL brGDGTs sequence for the period of similar to 60-8 ka BP. The results show that brGDGTs in Lake SHL are produced predominantly in summer and autumn (June-November). The sediment record reveals several important points: 1) the summer-autumn temperatures over the period similar to 60-8 ka BP varied between similar to 7 degrees C and similar to 12.5 degrees C and the coldest period occurred during similar to 25-21 ka BP when the mean summer-autumn temperature was similar to 8.2 degrees C, 2) the summer-autumn temperature in Northeast China began to increase at similar to 21 ka BP, and gradually warmed until the early Holocene in agreement with what has been recorded in southern China, most likely forced by summer insolation at 65 degrees N.

We investigated how profundal redox conditions determine the inter-annual variation in methane oxidising bacteria (MOB) contribution to zooplankton production in a deep subtropical reservoir. Two hydrological regimes which affect MOB activity are considered: (i) reduced MOB activity resulting from high profundal oxygen saturation promoted by water column disturbance during the period of summer stratification; and (ii) increased MOB activity due to high profundal oxygen saturation during winter mixing. 2. Four years of field stable-isotope analyses revealed that oxygen saturation of profundal waters during summer stratification was negatively correlated with winter MOB contribution. This relationship is consistent with our theoretical ecosystem modelling. 3. Although the ecosystem model simulation predicted positive effects of profundal oxygen supply during winter mixing on MOB contribution, the stable isotope mixing model indicated that the effects were secondary. Winter oxygen supply did not enhance MOB activity when methane accumulation during the preceding summer was low. 4. Our findings suggest that summer profundal hypoxia plays the primary role in determining methanotrophic food-web activity and methane-derived carbon cycling in deep lakes.

J	Chubarenko, I; Demchenko, N				Chubarenko, I.; Demchenko, N.			On contribution of horizontal and intra-layer convection to the formation of the Baltic Sea cold intermediate layer	OCEAN SCIENCE												Seasonal cascades down the coastal slopes and intra-layer convection are considered as the two additional mechanisms contributing to the Baltic Sea cold intermediate layer (CIL) formation along with conventional seasonal vertical mixing. Field measurements are presented, reporting for the first time the possibility of denser water formation and cascading from the Baltic Sea underwater slopes, which take place under fall and winter cooling conditions and deliver waters into intermediate layer of salinity stratified deep-sea area. The presence in spring within the CIL of water with temperature below that of maximum density (Tmd) and that at the local surface in winter time allows tracing its formation: it is argued that the source of the coldest waters of the Baltic CIL is early spring (March-April) cascading, arising due to heating of water before reaching the Tmd. Fast increase of the open water heat content during further spring heating indicates that horizontal exchange rather than direct solar heating is responsible for that. When the surface is covered with water, heated above the Tmd, the conditions within the CIL become favorable for intralayer convection due to the presence of waters of Tmd in intermediate layer, which can explain its well-known features - the observed increase of its salinity and deepening with time.

J	Kisand, V; Noges, T				Kisand, V; Noges, T			Seasonal dynamics of bacterio- and phytoplankton in large and shallow eutrophic Lake Vortsjarv, Estonia	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY												The seasonal dynamics of bacterioplankton abundance, biomass and production was measured in the large (surface area 270 km(2)) and shallow (mean depth 2.8 m) Lake Vortsjarv during one year. Bacterial biomass and heterotrophic activity (production) was measured using thymidine and leucine incorporation methods. The bacterial biomass production was estimated by leucine incorporation, the cell number production by thymidine incorporation. Primary production and photosynthetic extracellular release was measured simultaneously to evaluate their role on heterotrophic bacterial activity. Relationships between released fraction of primary production and heterotrophic bacteria, as well as between biomass of bacteria and biomass/composition of phytoplankton are discussed. In terms of the carbon balance, the total primary production could support carbon need of heterotrophic bacteria in Lake Vortsjarv. Neither biomass nor activity of bacteria showed tight coupling to primary production over the whole investigation period. In spring and summer the relationship between bacterial production and primary production was weak. The development of cyanobacterial bloom in summer provided more substrates for heterotrophic bacteria than diatoms in spring. In autumn both activity of bacteria and algae decreased rapidly in a coupled manner.

We repeatedly satellite-tracked 11 adult Relict Gulls from the Ordos sub-population in Hongjian Nur, China, over 33 migration seasons and conducted extensive ground surveys. Relict Gulls traveled similar to 800 km between Hongjian Nur in northern China to the coast of eastern China in a predominantly longitudinal migration, following a clockwise loop migration pattern. The gulls migrated faster in spring (4 2 d) than in autumn (15 13 d) due to a time-minimization strategy for breeding, and they showed considerable between-individual variation in the timing of the autumn migration, probably due to differences in the timing of breeding. Gulls that made at least two round trips exhibited high flexibility in spring migration timing, suggesting a stronger influence of local environment conditions over endogenous controls. There was also high route flexibility among different years, probably due to variations in meteorological or habitat conditions at stopover sites. Relict Gulls stayed for a remarkably long time (234 17 d) on their major wintering grounds in Bohai Bay and Laizhou Bay, between which there were notable dispersals. Pre-breeding dispersals away from the breeding area were distinct, which seemed to be a strategy to cope with the degradation of breeding habitat at Hongjian Nur. Overwhelming lake shrinkage on the breeding ground and at stopover sites and loss of intertidal flats on the wintering grounds are regarded as the main threats to Relict Gulls. It is crucial to make protection administrations aware of the great significance of key sites along migration routes and to promote the establishment of protected areas in these regions.					; LIU, JUN/JVZ-4445-2024	Liu, Dongping/0000-0002-6654-3839; 													2167-8359					MAY 25	2017	5								e3380	10.7717/peerj.3380	http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.3380								28560115					WOS:000402559100007

D.; Engelmann, Julia C.; Ptacnik, Robert; Wilken, Susanne			Contrasting responses of different mixotrophic protists to light and nutrient availability	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Mixotrophic protists are important members of aquatic microbial food webs where they can dominate bacterivory and strongly impact energy and nutrient flow. While light and nutrient availability are known to impact grazing rates by mixotrophs in laboratory studies, little is known about how changes in resource availability affect mixotrophic organisms in natural communities. Here, we performed a short-term grazing assay using fluorescently labeled bacteria in a phosphorus-limited subalpine mountain lake to test how the availability of light and nutrients affect mixotroph grazing rates. High grazing rates by a Pseudopedinella-like dictyochophyte were unaffected by nutrient or light manipulation. In contrast, grazing rates by pigmented cryptophytes significantly decreased upon phosphorus addition, light deprivation, and a combination of both. We compare these findings with the seasonal analysis of a 4-yr time-series dataset of 18S rRNA gene amplicon abundances. While cryptophytes dominated in autumn and winter and were negatively related with water column stability, Pseudopedinella amplicon abundances showed a consistent spring-summer peak and were positively related with chlorophyll a concentrations. These results demonstrate the diversity in nutritional strategies among co-occurring mixotrophic protists, which cannot be resolved by quantification of bulk grazing rates. Moreover, these different strategies result in distinct seasonal dynamics and coexistence of different mixotrophs, suggesting their respective trajectories into future aquatic ecosystems will also differ.					; Engelmann, Julia/AAF-5049-2021; Wilken, Susanne/C-4351-2013; Huisman, Jef/A-1089-2013; Bengtsson, Mia/AFN-0548-2022; Ptacnik, Robert/B-1347-2012; Bengtsson, Mia/F-3944-2014	Brussaard, Corina/0000-0002-6320-9229; Wilken, Susanne/0000-0002-3852-557X; Huisman, Jef/0000-0001-9598-3211; Ivankovic, Marina/0000-0001-5534-8408; Bengtsson, Mia/0000-0002-2115-9139; Koppelle, Sebastiaan/0000-0003-3973-7176													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAY	2024	69	5					1233	1246		10.1002/lno.12565	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.12565		APR 2024											WOS:001200384700001
J	Diaz, S; Kitzberger, T				Diaz, Soledad; Kitzberger, Thomas			High Nothofagus flower consumption and pollen emptying in the southern South American austral parakeet (Enicognathus ferrugineus)	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												We describe extraordinary aspects of the feeding ecology of the austral parakeet, Enicognathus ferrugineus - the most southerly distributed psittacid in the world - that allow this endemic species to inhabit and become a common bird in relatively species-poor temperate and subantarctic Nothofagus forests of South America. We used two sources of information to analyse temporal and spatial dietary changes of austral parakeets in subalpine forests near Lake Distric of southern Argentina: (i) relative abundance of parakeet foraging on the forest floor along an altitudinal transect from 1000 to 1420 m; and (ii) faeces analyses of seasonal collections. Austral parakeets largely relied on a protein-rich pollen-based spring-early summer diet by destructively harvesting large quantities of wind-pollinated Nothofiagus puntilio flowers and efficiently emptying pollen grains - specializations previously described only in pollinating nectarivorous vertebrates. Pollen emptying rates (c. 65%) were the highest reported for psittacids and among the highest for vertebrates in general. Parakeets made extended use of short-lived X pumilio flowers by tracking the altitudinal shifts in flowering phenology. Additionally, parakeets complemented their diet with carbohydrates from N. pumilio insect exudates. By late summer, parakeets switched to a lipid-rich diet based on N. pumilo seeds. This resource remained available through mid-autumn because parakeets also followed in altitude the phenological delays in fruiting. In winter, parakeets fed on N. pumilio parasitic Misodendrum mistletoe buds and leaves and Cyttaria sp. parasitic canopy fungi. These results suggest that stringent food availability in these relatively high latitudes may have led to behavioural and physiological specializations of austral parakeets to obtain year-round food resources efficiently from Nothofagus trees.

J	Dong, J; Zhou, WC; Song, LR; Li, GB				Dong, Jing; Zhou, Weicheng; Song, Lirong; Li, Genbao			Responses of phytoplankton functional groups to simulated winter warming	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												We investigated the seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton functional groups and the relevant environmental factors (water temperature, total nitrogen content, total phosphorous content and water transparency) in Dianchi Lake, China. We also examined the growth rates and physiological characteristics of representative species in laboratory cultures. In the field experiment, five dominant functional groups, including M (mainly consisted of Microcystis aeruginosa; Microcystis wesenbergii and Microcystis flos-aquae), H1(mainly consisted of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae), J (mainly consisted of Scenedesmus; Pediastrum and Coelastrum), F (mainly consisted of Oocystis and Kirchneriella) and P (mainly consisted of Melosira), were determined. Groups M and J were prevalent throughout the year and comprised more than 90% of the total biomass. Group M was prevalent at a relatively high temperature in summer and autumn; by contrast, group J was dominant at low temperature in winter and early spring. Co-cultivation laboratory experiments revealed that the biomass and the density of Microcystis sp., which is the representative species of the functional group M, were higher at 18 degrees C than at 13 degrees C. Conversely, the density and the biomass of the representative species of the functional group J (consisted of Pediastrum duplex, Coelastrum microporum and Scenedesmus obliquus) were higher at 13 degrees C than at 18 degrees C. At low temperatures, group M (Microcystis spp.) cannot successfully survive and grow at low temperatures, exhibiting various stress responses, such as inhibited photosynthetic activities and reduced phosphorous utilization. However, low temperature increased soluble carbohydrate contents of Microcystis, which favored the fast development of Microcystis, once the temperature warmed. Currently, climate warming is occurring in the Dianchi Lake basin; thus, future climate warming in winter (+/- 5 degrees C) may compromise the advantages of group J and promote the abundance of group M. The water transparency, dissolved oxygen and biodiversity in the lake would be further reduced. Furthermore, the increased microcystin and odor produced by Microcystis would considerably threaten the food web structure and lake ecosystem functions.

Carbon cycling in coastal areas is essential for understanding climate change. Here, we used a three-dimensional hydrodynamic-ecosystem model to investigate CO2 dynamics and its controlling factors in Lake Obuchi, a brackish lake in Aomori Prefecture, Japan. The model successfully reproduced the seasonal variations in water temperature, salinity, nutrients, chlorophyll-a, and carbonate system components in the lake. The simulation results show that the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) in Lake Obuchi remained below atmospheric levels throughout the year, suggesting that the lake functions as a CO2 sink. The pCO2 variability is dominated by spatially uniform seasonal patterns (90% of variance) driven by temperature changes, while summer periods exhibit distinct spatial patterns (6.0% of variance) that vary with river discharge magnitude. In Lake Obuchi, pCO2 is maintained at low levels because of the carbonate system components of water masses formed by mixing river water and seawater. Additionally, primary production within these water masses further reduces pCO2. This primary production is sustained by nitrogen-rich river water, combined with seasonal phosphorus supply from sediments during summer and autumn and from the sea during winter and spring. Our findings reveal that the seasonal combination of these nutrient sources maintains year-round primary production, which in turn contributes to the reduction in pCO2 in Lake Obuchi.

Seasonal changes of the crustacean zooplankton from 22 sampling stations were investigated during September 2002 and August 2003, and 23 species belonging to 20 genera were recorded. Daphnia spp. dominated in spring but disappeared in mid-summer, while Bosmina coregoni and Ceriodaphnia cornuta dominated in summer and autumn. Both maximum cladoceran density (310 ind. l(-1)) and biomass (5.2 mg l(-1)) appeared in autumn. Limnoithona sinensis, Sinocalanus dorrii and Schmackeria inopinus were the main species of copepods. Microcystis spp. were the dominant phytoplankton species and formed dense blooms in the warm seasons. In the laboratory, inhibitory effects of small colonial Microcystis on growth and reproduction of Daphnia carinata were more remarkable than those of large ones, and population size of D. carinata was negatively correlated with density of fresh large colonial Microcystis within a density range of 0-100 mg l(-1) (r = -0.82, P < 0.05). Both field and experimental results suggested that seasonal and long-term changes in the community structure of crustacean zooplankton in the lake were shaped by cyanobacterial blooms and biomass of the small algae, respectively, i.e., colonial and filamentous cyanobacteria contributed to the summer replacement of dominant crustacean zooplankton from large Daphnia spp. to small B. coregoni and C. cornuta, while increased small algae might be responsible for the increased abundance of crustacean zooplankton during the past decades.

J	Bell, EM; Weithoff, G				Bell, EM; Weithoff, G			Benthic recruitment of zooplankton in an acidic lake	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY					International Scientific Meeting on Benthic Dynamics: In Situ Surveillance of the Sediment-Water Interface	MAR 25-29, 2002	UNIV ABERDEEN, ABERDEEN, SCOTLAND		UNIV ABERDEEN			In recent years, most studies of the benthic microbial food web have either been descriptive or were restricted to the measurement of within sediment process rates. Little is known about benthic-pelagic coupling processes such as recruitment. We, therefore, developed an ex situ core incubation procedure to quantify the potential for microbial recruitment from the benthos to the pelagic in an acidic mining lake, Mining Lake 111 (ML 111; pH 2.6), in eastern Germany. Our data suggest that considerable zooplankton recruitment from the benthos takes place. Heliozoan and rhizopod recruitment in both summer and winter sediment cores was highest when they were incubated at 20 degreesC. Maximum heliozoan recruitment was 23 (+/-9 S.E.) individuals cm(-2) day(-1) (40% initial standing stock daily) in the winter 20 degreesC incubation. Maximum rhizopod recruitment was 6 (+/-2 S.E.) individuals cm(-2) day(-1) in the summer 20 degreesC incubation. Little or no recruitment was apparent for either taxa when winter cores were incubated at 5 degreesC, implying a temperature cue. Conversely, the rotifer, Cephalodella hoodi, exhibited a maximum recruitment of 6 (+/-2 S.E.) individuals cm(-2) day(-1) during the winter 5 degreesC incubation, representing 30% of initial standing stock daily, but little recruitment when incubated at 20 degreesC. Cephalodella may have responded to an increased winter benthic food supply; in situ winter Chl a concentrations in the benthos were 3.4 times higher than those in the summer. The importance of this was reinforced by the poor pelagic food supply available in ML 111. In situ, Heliozoa, rhizopods and Cephalodella were first observed in the epilimnion of ML 111 in spring or early summer, suggesting active or passive recruitment following lateral transport from littoral sediments. Benthic-pelagic coupling via recruitment is potentially important in understanding the pelagic food web in ML 111 and warrants further investigation in this and other aquatic environments.

Assessing aquatic ecosystem health through the analysis of plankton biodiversity	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Healthy plankton communities are the foundation of many freshwater food webs. Their biodiversity is often used to directly reflect the health of the rivers. Globally, river ecosystem restoration is a critical issue and many freshwater ecosystems, especially in cities, are degraded because of intensive human activities. This is true for Jinan, China's first pilot city for the Water Ecological Civilisation Project. The outcomes of aquatic ecosystem restoration in the city will directly affect the success or failure of the construction of aquatic ecological civilisations across the entire country; therefore, there is an urgent need for research on the assessment of river health in Jinan based on plankton biodiversity. As such, this study gathered data on the distribution of plankton (phytoplankton and zooplankton) in Jinan by collecting three sets of samples from 59 aquatic ecosystem monitoring stations in spring, summer and autumn of 2015. In all, 104 species of phytoplankton and 56 species of zooplankton were identified. Diatoms, Chlorophyta, and Cyanophyta accounted for 50, 31 and 15% respectively of phytoplankton, and rotifers, Protozoa and cladocerans accounted for 39, 31 and 17% respectively of zooplankton. We constructed a plankton health assessment model based on the Shannon-Wiener diversity index for analysis of the temporal and spatial distribution. According to the overall health distribution diagram, spatially health status was significantly better in north and south Jinan than in the city centre; temporally, spring water ecosystem health was better than in summer and autumn. These conclusions provide a theoretical basis and direction for the restoration of aquatic ecosystems in Jinan, and the methods used in this study can serve as a reference for aquatic ecosystem evaluation in developing countries.

J	Li, YL; Zhang, Q; Tao, H; Yao, J				Li, Yunliang; Zhang, Qi; Tao, Hui; Yao, Jing			Integrated model projections of climate change impacts on water-level dynamics in the large Poyang Lake (China)	HYDROLOGY RESEARCH												This study outlines a framework for examining potential impacts of future climate change in Poyang Lake water levels using linked models. The catchment hydrological model (WATLAC) was used to simulate river runoffs from a baseline period (1986-2005) and near-future (2020-2035) climate scenarios based on eight global climate models (GCMs). Outputs from the hydrological model combined with the Yangtze River's effects were fed into a lake water-level model, developing in the back-propagation neural network. Model projections indicate that spring-summer water levels of Poyang Lake are expected to increase by 5-25%, and autumn-winter water levels are likely to be lower and decrease by 5-30%, relative to the baseline period. This amounts to higher lake water levels by as much as 2 m in flood seasons and lower water levels in dry seasons in the range of 0.1-1.3 m, indicating that the lake may be wet-get-wetter and dry-get-drier. The probability of occurrence for both the extreme high and low water levels may exhibit obviously increasing trends by up to 5% more than at present, indicating an increased risk in the severity of lake floods and droughts. Projected changes also include possible shifts in the timing and magnitude of the lake water levels.					; ZHANG, Qi/MFJ-8647-2025	Li, Yunliang/0000-0002-0708-9138; 													1998-9563	2224-7955				FEB	2021	52	1			SI		43	60		10.2166/nh.2019.064	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/nh.2019.064													WOS:000621369000004

At present, the reservoir is eutrophic. It has a period of stratification in spring and summer and it is fully mixed in fall and winter. Seasonal variations are large. Diatoms are dominant during homothermous periods, while primary production seems to be light-limited. Aphanocapsa sp. is dominant during periods of stratification, at the end of which nutrient exhaustion (specially inorganic nitrogen) limits production. At present, mean inorganic nitrogen, total phosphorus and chlorophyll concentrations are lower than before the power plant started operating. It is suggested that this improvement in water quality is due to a change in water management. Extensive drawdown of the reservoir was allowed before 1983. Since large volumes of water are required for cooling purposes in the nuclear power plant, water level fluctuations have strongly diminished.

Disentangling Migratory Routes and Wintering Grounds of Iberian Near-Threatened European Rollers Coracias garrulus	PLOS ONE												Long-distance migrants are suffering drastic declines in the last decades. Causes beneath this problem are complex due to the wide spatial and temporal scale involved. We aim to reveal migratory routes, stopover areas, wintering grounds, and migratory strategies for the most southwestern populations of the near-threatened European Roller Coracias garrulus in order to identify conservation key areas for the non-breeding stage of this species. To this end, we used tracking data from seven satellite transmitters fitted to birds breeding in different populations throughout the Iberian Peninsula and four geolocators fitted to individuals in a southeastern Iberian population. Precise satellite data were used to describe daily activity patterns and speed in relation to the main regions crossed during the migration. Individuals from the most southwestern Iberian populations made a detour towards the Atlantic African coast whereas those from northeastern populations followed a straight north-to-south route. We identified important stopover areas in the Sahel belt, mainly in the surroundings of the Lake Chad, and wintering grounds on southwestern Africa farther west than previously reported for the species. Concerning the migratory strategy, satellite data revealed: 1) a mainly nocturnal flying activity, 2) that migration speed depended on the type of crossed habitat, with higher average speed while crossing the desert; and 3) that the migration was slower and lasted longer in autumn than in spring. The studied populations showed weak migratory connectivity, suggesting the confluence of birds from a wide range of breeding grounds in a restricted wintering area. Therefore, we suggest to target on defining precisely key areas for this species and identifying specific threats in them in order to develop an appropriate global conservation programme for the European Roller.

J	Beck, HD; Willis, DW				Beck, HD; Willis, DW			Biotelemetry of white bass in a South Dakota glacial lake	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Biotelemetry was used to track daily and monthly distributions of white bass (Morone chrysops) in Lake Poinsett, a South Dakota glacial lake. Ultrasonic transmitters were implanted into 30 adult white bass (332-450 mm, total length) during May 1997. White bass distribution was monitored from June to October 1997, January and February 1998, and April and May 1998. Distributions were quantified using depth and distance from shore at fish location. Fish distance from shore was significantly different among dates and diel periods (P<0.05), and the interaction term was also significant. White bass in Lake Poinsett were offshore during the summer and winter. During the spring and fall, white bass were near shore in shallow waters, which may be related to spawning and feeding activities. White bass tended to be nearer the shore during the evening crepuscular period across seasons. Significant (P less than or equal to 0.05) but weak (r less than or equal to 0.50) correlations were found between white bass distance from shore and environmental parameters. Temperature, cloud cover, precipitation, and moon phase were significant contributors to multiple regression models, but no model explained more than 26% of the white bass distribution.

J	FUCHS, EH				FUCHS, EH			LIFE HISTORY OF EMERALD SHINER NOTROPIS ATHERINOIDES IN LEWIS AND CLARK LAKE SOUTH DAKOTA	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The age, rate of growth, reproduction, feeding habits, and population dynamics of the emerald shiner (Notropis atherinoides) were studied from 10,375 fish collected in Lewis and Clark Lake, South Dakota. The population in this 28,000-acre reservoir consisted of four age groups dominated by young-of-the-year during the summer and fall and by age-group I during the spring and early summer. Age-group II was common only in the spring and early summer while age-group III was rarely encountered. Average lengths at first and second annulus formations were 66 and 84 mm. Females attained larger sizes than males after the first year. The spawning season extended from June through Aug. A rapid and precise method was devised for conducting food-habit determinations that could be analyzed statistically. Adult emerald shiners fed selectively on large zooplankton. A gradual change in young-of-the-year food habits was evident; fish smaller than 40 mm fed primarily on algae, whereas larger fish fed chiefly on cladocerans and copepods. Populations of emerald shiners were characterized by high mortality that caused drastic changes in age-class structure. Males had a higher mortality rate than females during their 2nd and 3rd years of life.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1967	96	3					247	+		10.1577/1548-8659(1967)96[247:LHOTES]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1967)96[247:LHOTES]2.0.CO;2													WOS:A19679674800003

Nitrate reduction in groundwater and isotopic investigation of denitrification in integrated tree-grass riparian buffers in Taihu Lake watershed, eastern China	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Riparian buffer strips can play an important role in reducing nitrate (NO3-) contamination of groundwater from agricultural fields to the adjacent inland water system. Our objective was to investigate the temporal and spatial variation of NO3- concentrations and delta nitrogen (N) 15 (delta N-15)-NO3- in groundwater at the integrated poplar-grass buffer strips with three different tree planting densities, and to assess in situ denitrification rate in riparian soils in Taihu Lake watershed of China under a subtropical climate. Nitrate concentrations and delta N-15-NO3- values in groundwater were monitored along transects of piezometers installed from field edge to ditches at 5 m (16.4 ft) spacing in the integrated poplar-grass buffers. We found that groundwater NO3- concentrations declined by 67.5% to 88% while the delta N-15-NO3- values enriched along the subsurface flow paths within the 15 m (49.2 ft) poplar -grass riparian buffers in Taihu Lake watershed throughout the year. Nitrate was removed more efficiently in spring and summer than in autumn and winter owing to vegetation uptake in the growing season combined with high denitrification rates due to higher groundwater table level and soil temperature. The isotopic enrichment factors for NO3- retention varied seasonally, with the highest absolute value in winter (-8.95 parts per thousand) and lowest in summer (-4.53 parts per thousand). The difference between poplar planting densities in buffers did not significantly affect their capacity to reduce groundwater NO3-. Riparian soil denitrification rate was highly seasonal and significantly different in the different soil depths. Our results indicate that the upper soil layer (10 to 35 cm [3.9 to 13.8 in]) in the riparian zones were hot spots for denitrification, and denitrification was strongly influenced by hydrological conditions and soil temperature in the integrated poplar-grass buffers in the Taihu Lake watershed.

J	Schwefel, R; MacIntyre, S; Cortés, A				Schwefel, Robert; MacIntyre, Sally; Cortes, Alicia			Summer temperatures, autumn winds, and thermal structure under the ice in arctic lakes of varying morphometry	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Ice-covered lakes differ strongly from their ice-free counterparts in their temperatures, heat budgets, and hydrodynamics. Nevertheless, due to a lack of detailed measurements, processes under the ice and their drivers are still understudied. Here we present a multiyear study of five arctic lakes ranging from 1 to 150 ha focusing on temperature and thermal stratification during similar to 200 d of ice cover. Mean water temperatures during the ice-covered period, calculated from ice-on until the end of February, ranged from 1.5 degrees C to 3.1 degrees C. They depended on lake size, water temperatures in summer, and conditions during the weakly stratified period before ice-on. Temperatures of the smaller lakes were primarily controlled by water temperatures in summer, while heat loss during the weakly stratified period contributed more for the two comparably larger lakes whose surface area exceeded 10 ha and depth 10 m. Heat budgets indicated consistent losses of similar to-1 W m(-2) through the ice. Solar radiation during fall contributed significantly to the heat budget in years with reduced snow cover and drove penetrative convection. Sediment heat fluxes during early winter were up to 6 W m(-2) in the smaller lakes and more than 10 W m(-2) in 150 ha Toolik Lake. The extent of stratification at ice-on depended on the magnitude of winds in the preceding day or two. The combined factors led to strong interannual and between-lake variability in lakes of the same geographical region and will improve the understanding of arctic lakes in a changing environment.

Sedimentary pellets as an ice-cover proxy in a High Arctic ice-covered lake	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Sediment aggregates ("sedimentary pellets") within the sedimentary record of Lake A (83A degrees 00'A N, 75A degrees 30'A W), Ellesmere Island, Canada, are used to construct a 1000 year proxy record of ice-cover extent and dynamics on this perennially ice-covered, High Arctic lake. These pellets are interpreted to form during fall or early winter when littoral sediment adheres to ice forming around the lake's periphery or during summer through the development of anchor ice. The sediment likely collects in ice interstices and is concentrated in the upper ice layers through summer surface ice melt and winter basal ice growth. The pellets remain frozen in the ice until a summer or series of summers with reduced ice cover allows for their deposition across the lake basin. Sedimentary pellet frequency within multiple sediment cores is used to develop a chronology of ice-cover fluctuations. This proxy ice-cover record is largely corroborated by a record of unusual sedimentation in Lake A involving iron-rich, dark-orange to red laminae overlying more diffuse laminae with a lighter hue. This sediment sequence is hypothesized to represent years with reduced ice cover through increased chemocline ventilation and iron deposition. During the past millennium, the most notable period of inferred reduced ice cover is ca. 1891 AD to present. Another period of ice cover mobility is suggested ca. 1582-1774 AD, while persistent ice cover is inferred during the 1800s and prior to 1582 AD. The proxy ice-cover record corresponds well with most regional melt-season proxy temperature and paleoecological records, especially during the 1800s and 1900s.					; Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019	Antoniades, Dermot/0000-0001-6629-4839; Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				JAN	2009	41	1					225	242		10.1007/s10933-008-9255-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-008-9255-x													WOS:000262505400015

Host-dependent variations in the seasonal prevalence and intensity of heterophyid encysted metacercariae (Digenea: Heterophyidea) in brackish water fish in Egypt	VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY												The prevalence of heterophyid (Digenea: Heterophyidae) encysted metacercariae (EMC) in its second intermediate host, the fish Mugil spp. and Tilapia spp. was studied in a subtropical permanent Lake in northeastern Egypt. Seasonal changes in the occurrence of the EMC in different fish hosts were monitored in a longitudinal field survey lasting 12 months from June 2006 to May 2007. This study tested two hypotheses; (i) prevalence and intensity of heterophyid EMC fluctuate seasonally throughout the year and (h) variation in the prevalence and intensity of heterophyid EMC is host-dependent. A total of 832 fish specimens comprising 5 species collected from Manzala Lake, northeastern Egypt were examined by artificial gastric juice digestion for EMC. All five species of brackish water fish examined were found to harbor the EMC of the family Heterophyidae in their muscles. The overall infection prevalence of EMC over 12 months was 23.2%. The adult flukes recovered from puppies experimentally infected with morphologically different metacercariae from different fish species were compatible with six species belong to five genera of Heterophyidae, namely, Heterophyes heterophyes, Heterophyes aequalis, Pygidiopsis genata, Phagicola sp., Haplorchis sp. and Stictodora sp. EMC of H. heterophyes were most abundant, detected in 56% of the total fish examined. P. genata was ranked second, followed by Phagicola sp., H. aequalis, Haplorchis sp., and Stictodora sp., respectively. Seasonal differences in infection were observed for all heterophyid species studied in all fish species examined. Heterophyid infections reached peak prevalences during the summer season 38.2% followed by spring 26.6% and autumn 19.3% seasons, whereas the lowest prevalence was recorded in the winter 8.7%. Intensity of heterophyid EMC followed the same seasonal pattern, being high during summer months and low in winter months. All fish species were infected with all the heterophyid digeneans, but with different prevalence. Possible reasons for these findings are discussed with reference to host, climatic and biotic factors. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

J	Zhang, Z; Xu, YY; Liu, SY; Ding, J; Zhao, JB				Zhang, Zhen; Xu, Yangyang; Liu, Shiyin; Ding, Jing; Zhao, Jinbiao			Seasonal variations in glacier velocity in the High Mountain Asia region during 2015-2020	JOURNAL OF ARID LAND												Velocity is an important component of glacier dynamics and directly reflects the response of glaciers to climate change. As a result, an accurate determination of seasonal variation in glacier velocity is very important in understanding the annual variation in glacier dynamics. However, few studies of glacier velocity in the High Mountain Asia (HMA) region were done. Along these lines, in this work, based on Sentinel-1 glacier velocity data, the distribution of glacier velocity in the HMA region was plotted and their seasonal variations during 2015-2020 were systematically analysed. The average glacier velocity in the HMA region was 0.053 m/d, and was positively correlated with the glacier area and slope. Glaciers in the Karakoram Mountains had the fastest average flow velocity (0.060 m/d), where the glaciers exhibited the largest average area and average slope. Moreover, glaciers in the Gangdise Mountains had the slowest velocity (0.022 m/d) and the smallest average glacier area. The glacier flows were the fastest in spring (0.058 m/d), followed by summer (0.050 m/d), autumn (0.041 m/d), and winter (0.040 m/d). In addition, the glacier flows were the maximum in May, being 1.4 times of the annual average velocity. In some areas, such as the Qilian, Altun, Tibetan Interior, Eastern Kunlun, and Western Kunlun mountains, the peak glacier velocities appeared in June and July. The glacier velocity in the HMA region decreased in midsummer and reached the minimum in December when it was 75% of the annual average. These results highlight the role of meltwater in the seasonal variation in glacier flows in late spring and early summer. The seasonal velocity variation of lake-terminating glaciers was similar to that of land-terminating ones, but the former flowed faster. The velocity difference close to the mass balance line between the lake- and land-terminating glaciers was obviously greater in spring than in other seasons. In summer, the difference between the lake- and land-terminating glaciers at a normalized distance of 0.05-0.40 from the terminus was significantly greater than those of other seasons. The velocity difference between the lake- and land-terminating glaciers is closely related to the variable of ice thickness, and also to the frictional force of the terminal base reduced by proglacial lakes. Thus, it can be concluded that in addition to the variation of the glacier thickness and viscosity, the variation of glacier water input also plays a key role in the seasonal variation of glacier velocity.

However, studies addressing the impacts of reservoirs and thermal stratification on DBP precursors are scarce. We conducted a seasonal study along a river-reservoir interconnected system, to investigate the effects of hydraulic residence time (HRT), thermal stratification, and seasonality on the levels and speciation of carbonaceous and nitrogenous DBP formation potential (FP) in source waters. Formation of 4 trihalomethanes (THMs), 4 haloacetonitriles (HANs), 2 haloketones and N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) was measured on filtered lake water. Total THMs (TTHMs) FP was below 93 mu g L-1, of which 59-87% of it was trichloromethane (TCM). Formation of dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN), 1,1,1-trichloropropanone (TCP), and NDMA was under 12 mu g L-1, 13 mu g L-1 and 73 ng L-1, respectively. The FP of the remaining DBPs was under 2 mu g L-1. While the effect of depth on DBP FP was insignificant, inter-system and seasonal effects were conspicuous. The most significant variable affecting DBP formation was season, where carbonaceous DBP FP was higher in autumn and summer than in winter. TTHM FP ranged from a 160% median increase in the river upstream of the reservoirs, to a 31% median increase in the last reservoir of the system, from winter to summer. On the contrary, NDMA FP ranged from a 145% median decrease in the river upstream of the reservoirs to an 11% median decrease in the middle reservoir, from winter to summer. TTHMs FP increased from the river upstream of the reservoirs to the last reservoir of the system (40.6% median increase), whereas the opposite trend was also observed for NDMA FP (63% median decrease).

Griseb. We incubated them for 65 days in an eutrophic lake in summer and winter respectively. The average decomposition rate was significantly higher in summer than in winter, and was significantly higher in mixtures than in F. virens monocultures in both seasons. The presence of A. philoxeroides in the mixture significantly increased invertebrate density and microbial respiration rates in summer but not in winter. Furthermore, contribution of invertebrates to decomposition was higher in the early stage of decomposition and lower in the late stage in summer, yet that of microbes was relatively constant in winter. Contribution of microinvertebrates increased in summer but that of meio-, macroinvertebrates increased in winter. Our findings indicate that the presence of an invasive plant altered litter decomposition, which may depend on seasonal variations, invertebrate density and decomposition stages.					huan-yu, Zhou/KPY-0318-2024; yang, jinghao/HLG-6281-2023	Chen, Shaojun/0000-0002-6699-121X; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2022	849	19					4153	4165		10.1007/s10750-022-04956-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-022-04956-z		SEP 2022											WOS:000849168800002

This evolution observed in the south-central Mediterranean shows strong similarities to that recognized in the eastern Mediterranean. But, it contrasts with that reconstructed in north-central Italy, where the mid-Holocene appears to be characterized by a winter (summer) precipitation maximum (minimum), while the late Holocene coincided with a decrease (increase) in winter (summer) precipitation. Maximum precipitation at ca. 10 000-4500 cal a BP may have resulted from (i) increased local convection in response to a Holocene insolation maximum at 10 000 cal a BP and then (ii) the gradual weakening of the Hadley cell activity, which allowed the winter rainy westerlies to reach the Mediterranean area more frequently. After 4500 cal a BP, changes in precipitation seasonality may reflect non-linear responses to orbitally driven insolation decrease in addition to seasonal and inter-hemispheric changes of insolation.

Flux was highest in the spring (due in part to resuspension), lowest in the summer during stratification, and intermediate during autumn months. Organic content of the particles ranged from 10% ash free dry weight (AFDW) in March through May samples to 17-19% in July-August samples. During the summer, microbial degradation of organic materials occurred in the trap bottles without added preservative, as evidenced by less AFDW in nonpreserved trap bottles than in similar chloroform-preserved bottles. The percentage of AFDW occuring as lipid ranged from 3.5% in April-May up to 14% during May through August. Dominant lipid classes were hydrocarbons, polar lipids including phospholipids and chlorophyll a, and free fatty acids. The ratio of n-alkane C-17 (algal indicator) to n-alkane C-29 (terrestrial or resuspension indicator) and the ratio of biogenic silica to AFDW in preserved samples both reached a maximum in May, shortly before lipid content peaked in the benthic amphipod, Pontoporeia hoyi. This observation agrees with the hypothesis that P. hoyi receives much of its nutrition from the spring algal bloom.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JUL	1989	46	7					1118	1124		10.1139/f89-145	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f89-145													WOS:A1989AD52000006

A total of sixty European chub samples and twelve sediment and water samples were taken and analysed seasonally between June 2011 and May 2012. Heavy metals were analysed by ICP-AES. The distribution of the IMBI values ranged from 0.040 to 0.418. Distribution patterns of IMBI in seasons and stations of European chub follow the sequence: spring> winter> summer> autumn, Station III> I> II, respectively. Result of high IMBI values in all seasons and stations can be explained by the fact that increasing MPI value of Zn, Fe and Mn. Among the heavy metals studied Cd and Co were below the detection limits in most seasons. The heavy metal concentrations in the edible tissue of European chub were compared with the tolerable national and international values in fish. The results obtained, showed that the heavy metal concentrations in edible tissue were excessive and were not safe within the limits for human consumption.

Growth-mediated seasonal energy allocation patterns of young-of-year largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides)	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												In temperate environments, seasonal selective sources of mortality (e.g., starvation and predation) may drive season-specific energy allocation patterns of young-of-year fish. However, when quantifying such phenomena, the effect of ration is rarely considered. We conducted two experiments to investigate the effect of ration on seasonal energy allocation patterns of age-0 largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) during summer and fall. In a laboratory experiment designed to evaluate short-term effects of ration on energy allocation, recent ration history strongly affected body dimensions and length-adjusted energy content. In outdoor raceways, young largemouth bass grew at different rates under different ration levels. In response, length-adjusted energy content, a size-independent index of condition, differed among raceway ration treatments during late summer. However, during fall, high- and low-growth treatment fish expressed similar length-adjusted energy content. Thus, while low-growth fish appeared to allocate a disproportionately low amount of energy to growth of energy-rich storage tissue during late summer, as winter approached, low-growth fish switched and instead allocated a disproportionately high amount of energy to storage tissue. We conclude that energy availability (via ration level) affects short-term energy allocation patterns and may interactively influence seasonal shifts in energy allocation patterns.

J	TIPPING, E; HILTON, J; JAMES, B				TIPPING, E; HILTON, J; JAMES, B			DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER IN CUMBRIAN LAKES AND STREAMS	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. A survey of dissolved organic carbon concentration [DOC] and optical absorbance at 340 nm (A340) was carried out for thirteen lakes and twenty-three streams in Cumbria over the period May 1986 to April 1987. 2. Values of [DOC] were in the range 0-6.2 mg l-1, no water having a mean [DOC] greater than 3.6 mg l-1. Streamwaters showed no gross seasonal dependence in [DOC], but there was a peak in [DOC] associated with the first major rain event of autumn 1986. Summer values of [DOC] in lakes were greater than winter values, probably because of the production of DOC by phytoplankton. 3. In streams [DOC] was weakly positively correlated (r2 < 0.3) with discharge (as estimated from rainfall); A340 was more strongly correlated (0.4 < r2 < 0.6). Linear regression of mean A340 against mean [DOC] for streams gave a slope consistent with the absorptivities of aquatic humic substances, and a positive intercept on the abscissa that suggests the presence of, on average 0.6 mg l-1 of DOC that does not absorb at 340 nm. Lake samples taken in winter gave a similar A340/[DOC] relationship to that for streams, but in summer A340/[DOC] ratios were lower, suggesting that phytoplankton-derived [DOC] absorbs weakly or not at all at 340 nm.

Samples of water were collected every two months (springs. rivers, ponds) and every three months (lakes) in the years 1996-1999 for hydrochemical analysis and in order to determine the Pythium species content. From springs rivers and ponds collected were also ice blocks for determinations of presence of Pythium species. Buckwheat and hemp-seeds. cellophane and snake exuviae were used as bait. Forty-five species of Pythium were found in various types of water bodies. Pythium acanthicum, P. complectens, P, complens, P. diameson. P. dissimile. P. elongatum, P. lucens. P. megalacanthum, P. nagae, P. oedochilum, P. oryzae. P. palingenes, P. periilum and P. polysporum were recorded for the first time in Poland. The largest mean number of species was observed in spring Cypisek, a bit fewer in spring Jaroszowka and lake Biale (oligotrophic-like waters). The lowest mean number of Pythium species was noted in pond Akcent and Palacowy (polytrophic waters). In all types of water bodies the higest mean number of species was found in winter,and the lowest in summer.																			0001-6977	2083-9480					2001	70	1					61	69																WOS:000167898100009
J	Audet, D; Couture, P				Audet, D; Couture, P			Seasonal variations in tissue metabolic capacities of yellow perch (Perca flavescens) from clean and metal-contaminated environments	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												This study examined seasonal variations in tissue metal contamination and physiological condition of yellow perch (Perca flavescens) from a clean lake (Halfway Lake) and a metal-contaminated environment (Whitson Lake) in spring, summer, and fall of 1999. Dietary metal content influenced liver metal concentrations, especially for cadmium. Fulton's condition factor (FCF), an indicator of recent feeding activity, was lower in Whitson fish except in summer, when higher FCF values corresponded with higher liver copper concentrations, presumably because of higher feeding rate. Tissue protein concentrations and indicators of biosynthetic capacities (nucleoside diphosphate kinase and RNA/DNA ratios) suggested lower biosynthesis in Whitson fish. Muscle aerobic and anaerobic capacities (using citrate synthase and lactate dehydrogenase as indicators, respectively) were consistently lower in Whitson fish, with maximal differences in summer. In contrast, although liver aerobic capacities were generally comparable among populations, anaerobic capacities were much higher in Whitson fish. Finally, gill sodium/potassium adenosinetriphosphatase (Na+/K+ ATPase) activity peaked in the spring in fish from both lakes, and higher activities were correlated with elevated gill copper concentrations. This study highlights the importance of seasonal variations in tissue metal concentrations and fish condition. This information is essential to evaluate the extent of impairment in condition faced by metal-contaminated wild fish.

J	Jehl, JR; McKernan, RL				Jehl, JR; McKernan, RL			Biology and migration of Eared Grebes at the Salton Sea	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The Eared Grebe (Podiceps nigricollis Brehm) is the North American bird species most closely associated with highly saline habitats, and in winter and early spring it is the most abundant waterbird at the Salton Sea. During the fall, the great majority of the North American population stages at hypersaline lakes in the Great Basin, departing in early winter for wintering areas in southern California and Mexico, principally in the central Gulf of California. On the northward return flight, nearly all the population passes through the Salton Sea, where concentrations of >1 million have been reported in February-March. After staging for several weeks, grebes leave in March-April and migrate toward breeding grounds in the northern United States and southern Canada. The Sea's development as the species' major spring staging area may be as recent as the 1960s, and presumably awaited the establishment of appropriate prey populations of marine worms. In the past decades, two major dieoffs at the Sea each resulted in the undiagnosed death of tens of thousands of birds. Whether the cause(s) are endemic to the Sea or involve the grebes' migration routes and stopover locations is unknown. Because of problems in estimating numbers, the significance of these mortality events is hard to evaluate. Population trends are better studied at fall staging areas, especially Mono Lake, where population turnover is inconsequential, grebes are virtually the only species present, and numbers can be ascertained by aerial photography.																			0018-8158					APR	2002	473	1-3					245	253		10.1023/A:1016514725025	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1016514725025													WOS:000177008500018

Groundwater attenuation of summer stream temperatures favors deeper intrusion depths into Lake George, NY	HYDROLOGY RESEARCH												Groundwater inputs to two major streams along the southern end of Lake George attenuate summer temperatures resulting in deeper lake intrusion depths relative to other major streams. Between late April and early October, East and West Brook baseflow water temperatures generally were cooler than other major streams by similar to 4 degrees C in mid-summer. Historical data for West Brook confirmed that the trend occurred as far back as 1970. As a consequence of cooler spring and summer temperatures coupled with higher salinity, deeper lake intrusion from these streams was hypothesized based on density calculations. Warmer streams entered the lake as overflow through late spring while East and West Brook intruded into the lake at depth. Upon stratification, East and West Brook intrude at or below the metalimnion while other monitored streams generally intrude at or above the metalimnion; by mid-August/early September all streams intruded below the metalimnion. Highresolution profiler data identified the presence of underflow during a fall storm event in 2014. Deeper intrusion depths of East and West Brook would supply organics and oxygen to the Caldwell Sub-basin hypolimnion which can potentially have both negative and positive effects on hypolimnetic oxygen depletion.

Tourism brought Bonaire economic growth but also puts pressure on the island's natural ecosystem. Previous studies on tourist interest based on surveys are labour-intensive, time-consuming, and expensive. This paper explores whether the use of freely available social media data combined with automatic machine learning methods can function as a cheap and fast alternative to surveys. From 2003 to 2019, 13,706 geotagged Flickr data points assigned keywords, then weighted using TF-IDF (Term FrequencyInverse Document Frequency), and finally clustered with DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Noise Applications). Two factors determine whether a cluster has an associated unique activity/interest: the most relevant and least relevant keywords. Eight identified clusters are useful for interpreting Bonaire tourists' interest: urban tourism; nature tourism around the lake; in-land natural tourism; conch shell and food; unique fishes; windsurf activity; cruise and ship; carnival, parade and singing. Tourism demand was forecasted using both Flickr and CBS (Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek) data. Flickr data could show which continent the tourist came from in which seasons (Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn) from 2015 to the end of 2021.

J	Elias, SA				Elias, Scott A.			Environmental interpretation of fossil insect assemblages from MIS 5 at Ziegler Reservoir, Snowmass Village, Colorado	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Organic-rich lake sediments from a trench exposed at the Ziegler Reservoir fossil site near Snowmass Village, Colorado yielded a sequence of 27 insect fossil assemblages, spanning the time interval from about 125 to 77 ka. The assemblages appear to represent MIS 5e, Sc, 5b, and 5a. A total of 99 taxa were identified, mostly beetles. The fossils represent the oldest known Pleistocene insect faunas from high elevation in the Rocky Mountains, and document a series of climatic oscillations from full interglacial to stadial and interstadial environments, accompanied by changes in regional biological communities. The MIS 5e fauna indicates summer temperatures similar to modern values, with winter temperatures 5-7 degrees C cooler than today. Regional climates cooled somewhat by MIS 5c, and during MIS 5b summer temperatures were 5-6 degrees C colder than modem values. Summer temperatures recovered to near-modern levels during early MIS 5a, and cooled by 1-2 degrees C at its end, although winter temperatures were apparently above modem levels. The indication of milder but wetter winters, strengthened by the inclusion of species found today only in the Pacific Northwest region, suggests conditions that may have led to increased snowpack at high elevations in this part of the Rocky Mountains, linked with the onset of MIS 4 glaciation.

J	Holman, KD; Lorenz, DJ; Notaro, M				Holman, Kathleen D.; Lorenz, David J.; Notaro, Michael			Influence of the Background State on Rossby Wave Propagation into the Great Lakes Region Based on Observations and Model Simulations	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												The authors investigate the relationship between hydrology in the Great Lakes basin-namely, overlake precipitation and transient Rossby waves-using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) reanalysis data and historical output from phase 3 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3). The preferred path of observed Rossby wave trains associated with overlake precipitation on Lake Superior depends strongly on season and appears to be related to the time-mean, upper-level flow. During summer and fall, the Northern Hemisphere extratropical jet is relatively narrow and acts as a waveguide, such that Rossby wave trains traversing the Great Lakes region travel along the extratropical Pacific and Atlantic jets. During other months, the Pacific jet is relatively broad, which allows more wave activity originating in the tropics to penetrate into the midlatitudes and influence Lake Superior precipitation. Analysis is extended to CMIP3 models and is intended to 1) further understanding of how variations in the mean state influence transient Rossby waves and 2) assess models' ability to capture observed features, such as wave origin and track. Results indicate that Rossby wave train propagation in twentieth-century simulations can significantly differ by model. Unlike observations, some models do not produce a well-defined jet across the Pacific Ocean during summer and autumn. In these models, some Rossby waves affecting the Great Lakes region originate in the tropics. Collectively, observations and model results show the importance of the time-mean upper-level flow on Rossby wave propagation and therefore on the relative influence of the tropics versus the extratropics on the hydroclimate of the Great Lakes region.					; Lorenz, David/H-9564-2013	Lorenz, David/0000-0002-4859-6267; 													0894-8755	1520-0442				DEC	2014	27	24					9302	9322		10.1175/JCLI-D-13-00758.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-13-00758.1													WOS:000346055900018
J	Sovik, AK; Syversen, N				Sovik, Anne Kristine; Syversen, Nina			Retention of particles and nutrients in the root zone of a vegetative buffer zone - effect of vegetation and season	BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												Vegetative buffer zones (BZs) along streams retain particles and nutrients like phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N), from agricultural runoff. An experiment with drained soil columns was established to study the retention of particles and nutrients from artificial agricultural runoff. The effect of vegetation (grass versus trees, alder versus aspen) and season was examined. The retention of particles and P was significantly higher in columns with trees as compared with that in column with grass. In general this was also the case for organic carbon (C-org) and N. Columns with aspen and alder had equal retention efficiency for particles, C-org and P, and in most cases also for N. Thus alder and aspen seem to be equally suitable in forest covered BZs. The retention efficiency of nutrients was generally better during spring, summer and early autumn as compared with that during late autumn. Uptake of nutrients in vegetation seemed to be an important retention mechanism.																			1239-6095	1797-2469				JUN 25	2008	13	3					223	230																WOS:000257554300005

L-1 .cntdot. d-1, summer = 0.020 mg O2 .cntdot. L-1 .cntdot. d-1; WOD: winter = 0.032 mg O2 .cntdot. L-1 .cntdot. d-1, summer = 0.027 mg O2 .cntdot. L-1 .cntdot. d-1). In summer, the sum of SOD and WOD (0.047 mg O2 .cntdot. L-1 .cntdot. d-1) closely approximated the hypolimnetic deficit (0.040 mg O2 .cntdot.

Measurement of primary production and an estimate of rainwater influx revealed that both could be significant sources of oxygen input during winter.

J	ANTONSSON, U				ANTONSSON, U			THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF ZOOPLANKTON IN THINGVALLAVATN, ICELAND	OIKOS												The zooplankton of Thingvallavatn is dominated by three species of rotifers and another three species of crustaceans. The rotifer Polyarthra dolichoptera (Idelson) constitutes up to 90% of the rotifer biomass in summer, while in autumn Keratella cochlearis (Gosse) and Conochilus unicornis (Rousselet) together contribute 55-80% of the rotifer biomass. Cyclops abyssorum G. 0. Sars s.l. varies from a minimum of 30% in September to 100% of crustacean numbers, during winter. Leptodiaptomus minutus (Lillj.) reaches maximum or 50% by numbers in August and Daphnia longispina (0. F. Mull.) s.str. 60% by numbers in September. L. minutus and C. abyssorum have univoltine life cycles. The populations of L. minutus and D. longispina overwinter as diapause eggs/ephippia, but C. abyssorum as nauplii 1 to 3. L. minutus tends to stay in the intermediate layers of the lake, with an overall downward trend of movement in depth from May to October. The nauplii and copepodite 1 larvae of C. abyssorum have their maxima in the deeper water layers, while older copepodite stages, especially 4 and 5, stay in the uppermost regions. The total population tended to ascend from June to December, coinciding with the decrease in insolation. D. longispina tends to stay in the surface layers during spring peak production, after which the population descended. The diel pattern varies seasonally between species and stages. The migration pattern of the older stages was clearly to avoid predation. The fecundity of crustacean species is low compared to more eutrophic lakes. The recruitment of L. minutus, C. abyssorum and D. longispina was estimated at 1.3-1.4, 1.2-1.8 and 0.45 to 0.47 million ind m-2 yr-1, respectively. The birth rates of D. longispina peaked in the early summer (max. 0.2), after the spring peak in primary production. The birth rate for C. abyssorum peaked in late September (max. 0.7). The daily mortality rate of L. minutus was 0.16% for the nauplius stages, but increased to 0.3% for the copepodite stages. The survivorship curves for C. abyssorumn were similar in successive years. The average mortality rate was approximately 0.5% in nauplius and the first copepodite stages, increasing to 3% for copepodite 4, as a result of increased predation by arctic charr on later copepodite stages. The total annual production of crustaceans was stable during the research period. approximately 9 g DW m-2. The production of rotifers was estimated at 1.5 g DW m-2. The total secondary production in the pelagic zone was therefore ca. 10 g D\\ m-2. The turnover ratio (P/B) for the crustaceans during 1975 to 1977 was 3.97, 4.27, and 4.32, respectively. The crustacean zooplankton contributed 50 to 100% of the observed food of pelagic planktivorous arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus (L.) in the pelagic zone. C. abyssorium and D. longispina were the dominant food species, Cyclops being dominant in summer and Daphnia in autumn. On all occasions the composition of the stomach contents differed significantly from that of the plankton. the fish selecting always the biggest stages. In the autumn. when Daphnia became the dominant food , the size selection mechanisms for Cyclops were weakened.																			0030-1299					MAY-JUN	1992	64	1-2					188	221		10.2307/3545052	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3545052													WOS:A1992JG50900015

Several previous studies, mainly conducted on passerines, indicate that inexperienced, juvenile birds may not generally correct for displacement during fall migration. Waterbirds such as the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos, Linnaeus 1758) are more flexible in their migration behavior than most migratory songbirds, but previous experiments with waterbirds have not yet allowed clear conclusions about their navigation abilities. Here we tested whether immature mallard ducks correct for latitudinal displacement during fall migration within Europe. During two consecutive fall migration periods, we caught immature females on a stopover site in southeast Sweden, and translocated a group of them ca. 1,000 km to southern Germany. We followed the movements of the ducks via satellite GPS-tracking and observed their migration decisions during the fall and consecutive spring migration. The control animals released in Ottenby behaved as expected from banding recoveries: they continued migration during the winter and in spring returned to the population's breeding grounds in the Baltics and Northwest Russia. Contrary to the control animals, the translocated mallards did not continue migration and stayed at Lake Constance. In spring, three types of movement tactics could be observed: 61.5% of the ducks (16 of 26) stayed around Lake Constance, 27% (7 of 26) migrated in a northerly direction towards Sweden and 11.5% of the individuals (3 of 26) headed east for ca. 1,000 km and then north. We suggest that young female mallards flexibly adjust their migration tactics and develop a navigational map that allows them to return to their natal breeding area.

Passive air samplers with polyurethane foam (PUF) disks were deployed every three months during the sampling period of September 2009-August 2010. The total DP (syn- and anti-DP) concentrations in air ranged from not detected to 277 pg/m(3), with a mean concentration of 53.9 pg/m(3). A generally declining trend of DP levels was found from the E-waste dismantling region to the peripheral areas. The median values of total DP concentrations in autumn, winter, spring and summer were 52.2, 28.8, 39.7 and 30.1 pg/m(3), respectively. The seasonal variations of DP concentrations were mainly associated with the intensity of E-waste dismantling activities and meteorological conditions. The mean value of anti-DP fractional abundance (f (anti)) was 0.74 +/- 0.08, which was consistent with those in the commercial DP products. This study confirmed a significant emission source related to the distribution of atmospheric DP in the E-waste dismantling area and supplied information for the seasonal variation of DP in the atmosphere.					zhang, qinghua/HMP-3611-2023; MATSIKO, JULIUS/AAD-7317-2019; Zhang, Wei-Wei/AAJ-6840-2020	MATSIKO, JULIUS/0000-0002-8713-513X; 													1674-7291	1869-1870				FEB	2017	60	2					305	310		10.1007/s11426-016-0261-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11426-016-0261-6													WOS:000394038300019

Based on a seasonal field investigation of the plankton community, we established a planktonic index of biotic integrity (P-IBI) evaluation system to assess the lake's ecosystem health. The biological integrity of Lake Fuxian was relatively good during winter and spring, but gradually deteriorated from summer to autumn. Areas with poor biological integrity were mainly distributed near tourist attractions along the lake's west coast. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was performed to explore the relationships between the P-IBI, its selected indicators, and the environmental variables. Water temperature (WT), pH, ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), and dissolved oxygen (DO) significantly influenced the P-IBI and its selected indicators. NH3-N and DO were significantly positively correlated with the P-IBI, indicating that it could be used as a water quality indicator to indirectly reflect lake biological integrity. We demonstrated that the P-IBI can effectively reflect temporal and spatial variations of biological integrity and could be used as a potential tool to evaluate Lake Fuxian ecosystem health.

J	Delling, B; Palm, S				Delling, Bo; Palm, Stefan			Evolution and disappearance of sympatric Coregonus albula in a changing environment-A case study of the only remaining population pair in Sweden	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												During the past 50 years, Fennoscandian populations of spring-spawning Baltic cisco (Coregonus albula), sympatric to common autumn-spawners, have declined or disappeared; for example, three out of four known spring-spawning populations in Sweden are regarded as extinct. Over the same period, the climate has changed and populations have been subject to other anthropogenic stressors. We compared historic (1960s) and recent (1990-2000s) morphological data from the still-existent sympatric cisco populations in Lake Fegen, Sweden. Phenotypic changes were found for spring-spawners making them more similar to the sympatric autumn-spawners that had remained virtually unchanged. Based on results for other salmoniform fishes, a phenotypically plastic response to increased temperature during early development appears unlikely. The recent material was also analyzed with microsatellite markers; long-term effective population size in spring-spawners was estimated to be about 20 times lower than autumn-spawners, with signs of long-term gene flow in both directions and a recent genetic bottleneck in spring-spawners. We suggest the change toward a less distinct phenotype in spring-spawners to reflect a recent increase in gene flow from autumn-spawners. Time since divergence was estimated to only c. 1,900 years (95% CI: 400-5,900), but still the Fegen populations represent the most morphologically and genetically distinct sympatric populations studied. Consequently, we hypothesize that less distinct population pairs can be even younger and that spring-spawning may have repeatedly evolved and disappeared in several lakes since the end of the last glaciation, concurrent with changed environmental conditions.					; Palm, Stefan/MVX-7141-2025	Delling, Bo/0000-0001-9148-9574; Palm, Stefan/0000-0002-9890-8265													2045-7758					NOV	2019	9	22					12727	12753		10.1002/ece3.5745	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.5745		OCT 2019						31788210					WOS:000492978200001

The resulting increase of internal pressure is manifested by the sustained streams of bubbles (up to 37% methane and 6% CO2) that escape when emerging leaves are torn in the spring. Methane continues to enter the roots and rhizome during summer, rapidly moves up the petioles and passes out through the emergent leaves into the atmosphere.																			0036-8075	1095-9203					1979	203	4386					1253	1255		10.1126/science.203.4386.1253	http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.203.4386.1253								17841139					WOS:A1979GM81700024

Spatial and seasonal dynamics of water physical-chemical parameters in rivers and lakes of an Argentinian Patagonia basin	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The Senguer River basin, located in central Argentinian Patagonia, has its headwater in the Andean Range and ends in extra-Andean Patagonian plains. Within this region, the water bodies may be affected by their localization and the climatic and hydrological seasonality. At the lower basin, there are higher temperatures, evaporation and human impact, and lower precipitation and land cover. In addition, rainfall and runoff are higher during the winter and spring, while temperatures, wind intensity, and evaporation are higher during the summer and autumn. However, the characteristics and dynamics of the water bodies of this basin are not well known. This work aims to study the physical-chemical characteristics of the rivers and lakes of the Senguer River basin to establish their spatial and seasonal variations. During 1 year, seasonally, it was measured the concentration of total, organic and inorganic suspended sediments (TSS, OSS, ISS, respectively), total dissolved solids (TDS), pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), water temperature, chlorophyll a (Chl a), total phosphorus and Secchi disk depth. At the lower basin, water bodies present higher TSS, TDS, Chl a, and turbidity. The seasonal variability has a high impact on TSS (higher on the spring) and water temperature (higher on summer); however, the effect on the other variables is lower relative to the importance of the localization. The two extremes of the basin, Fontana Lake (Fo; located in the Andean zone) and Musters Lake (Mu; located extra-Andean plains), differed in TSS (Fo=0.4 +/- 0.3 mg L-1; Mu=4.3 +/- 2.8 mg L-1), TDS (Fo=14 +/- 1 mg L-1; Mu=278 +/- 9 mg L-1), water transparency (Fo=11.8 +/- 1.2 m; Mu=3.1 +/- 2.4 mg L-1), and Chl a (Fo=0.42 +/- 0.17 mu g L-1; Mu=3.93 +/- 2.23 mu g L-1). Our results allow a better understanding of the differences between the Andean and extra-Andean water bodies in Patagonia.					; Scordo, Facundo/LSL-2910-2024; Seitz, Carina/HAX-3738-2022; Perillo, GME/AAV-3784-2021	Perillo, Gerardo/0000-0002-1200-5138; Scordo, Facundo/0000-0001-6182-7368; Seitz, Carina/0000-0001-7985-3724; Piccolo, Maria Cintia/0000-0002-5184-9149													1866-6280	1866-6299				JUN 26	2020	79	13								10.1007/s12665-020-09063-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-020-09063-7													WOS:000545959500002

The river-lake ecotone is the ecological buffer zone between rivers and lakes, which can transfer energy and material between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Vegetation restoration of degraded river-lake ecotone can improve the interception capacity of P pollution. However, the effects of different vegetation restoration types on sediment P cycling and its mechanism remain unclear. Therefore, we seasonally measured the P fractions and physicochemical properties of sediments from different restored vegetation (three native species and one invasive species). The results found that vegetation restoration significantly increased the sediment total P and bioavailable P content, which increased the sediment tolerance to P pollution in river-lake ecotone. In addition, the total P content in sediments was highest in summer and autumn, but lower in spring and winter. The total P and bioavailable P contents in surface sediments were the highest. They decreased with increasing depth, suggesting that sediment P assimilation by vegetation restoration and the resulting litter leads to redistribution of P in different seasons and sediment depths. Microbial biomass-P (MBP), total nitrogen (TN), and sediment organic matter (SOM) are the main factors affecting the change of sediment phosphorus fractions. All four plants' maximum biomass and P storage appeared in the autumn. Although the biomass and P storage of the invasive species Alternanthera philoxeroides were lower, the higher bioavailable P content and MBP values of the surface sediments indicated the utilization efficiency of sediment resources. These results suggest that vegetation restoration affects the distribution and circulation of P in river and lake ecosystems, which further enhances the ecological function of the river-lake ecotone and prevents the eutrophication and erosion of water and sediment in the river-lake ecotone.

J	Nogueira, MG				Nogueira, MG			Zooplankton composition, dominance and abundance as indicators of environmental compartmentalization in Jurumirim Reservoir (Paranapanema River), Sao Paulo, Brazil	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Spatial and temporal patterns in the distribution of the zooplankton in a large tropical reservoir were investigated for a year. The zooplankton was sampled at 10 limnetic stations. Rotifera were richest in number of species and individuals, especially in transitional river-lake zones. They were dominant during the summer in nine sampling stations, and decreased in spring. The main species were Polyarthra vulgaris, Keratella americana, K. cochlearis and Conochilus unicornis. Polyarthra vulgaris was widely distributed. Keratella was more abundant at upstream stations, and a dense population of C. unicornis was observed in a lateral, sheltered compartment. Among copepods, Calanoida were more abundant in spring and Cyclopoida in autumn. Longitudinal gradients in the Calanoida/Cyclopoida relation were observed, with the predominance of Cyclopoida at upstream sampling stations and Calanoida in more lacustrine zones towards the dam. Notodiaptomus iheringi, Thermocyclops minutus and T. decipiens were the main species. Diaphanosoma birgei, the most abundant cladoceran, mainly occurred in lacustrine zones, while Moina minuta was more abundant at riverine sampling stations, generally in association with Bosminopsis deitersi. Peaks of tintinnid protozoans were observed in upstream zones during summer and spring.																			0018-8158					JUL 1	2001	455						1	18		10.1023/A:1011946708757	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1011946708757													WOS:000173247400001

While previous studies have explored the structure and function of microbial communities in APLs stratification, natural attenuation, and remediation processes, little is known about the succession patterns of microbial association networks and the underlying assembly mechanisms during seasonal succession. In this study, the distribution characteristics and succession patterns of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms in APLs across different seasons were investigated using 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA high-throughput sequencing technologies, combined with ecological and multivariate statistical methods. The diversity, composition and structure of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial communities showed obvious seasonal differences, and the surface waters were more susceptible to seasonal disturbances. Temperature is the most critical factor influencing the seasonal succession of microbial communities. During the year-round succession, variable selection (40.86 %) dominated in the prokaryotic community and homogeneous selection (69.64 %) dominated in the eukaryotic community. Moreover, the proportion of deterministic processes increased with increasing water temperature differences. Co-occurrence networks were more complex and inter-kingdom exchanges were more frequent during the warm seasons (summer and autumn), and microbial communities were more stable during the cool seasons (spring and winter). Meanwhile, the inter-kingdom interactions between eukaryotes and prokaryotes are predominantly positive in all seasons except autumn, which may serve as a strategy to resist environmental stress. These findings indicate that there is a significant seasonal heterogeneity between eukaryotes and prokaryotes in APLs, providing valuable insights into the ecological processes of microbial community succession in extreme environments.					; Jin, Wang/KIB-4590-2024; Yue, Zheng/E-7042-2015; Deng, Rui/NOF-0313-2025	Wang, Jin/0000-0002-0995-3890; 													0301-4797	1095-8630				MAY	2025	381								125177	10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.125177	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.125177		APR 2025						40199217					WOS:001468518500001

Field multiannual data were analyzed in order to understand the phytoplankton cell geometric shape distribution along the seasonal environmental variability in two Mediterranean lakes, a shallow natural lake and a deeper artificial lake. We characterized seasonally each lake on the basis of dominant phytoplankton cell geometric shapes, detecting the following common highlights comparing the two ecosystems: a complex and globular geometric shape (Cone + Half Sphere) with high mean volume and low mean surface-to-volume ratio in winter (at the deepest mixing layer); a variety of geometric shapes in spring (at the lowest nutrient concentrations), with a relevant contribution of simple and compact geometric shapes (Sphere and Cube) with low mean volume and high mean surface-to-volume ratio; a simple and elongated geometric shape (Cylinder) in summer (at thermal stratification conditions); a variety of geometric shapes in autumn (at intermediate environmental conditions), when the geometric shapes detected were at similar size. We provide new insights on how phytoplankton cell geometric shapes with similar and different sizes relate to the seasonal environmental variations in lake ecosystems, a topic relatively neglected in literature.					; Pulina, Silvia/Q-2684-2017; Satta, Cecilia Teodora/AAF-6417-2020; PULINA, Silvia/Q-2684-2017; Lugliè, Antonella/M-4321-2015	SATTA, Cecilia Teodora/0000-0003-0130-9432; PULINA, Silvia/0000-0002-4861-4170; 													0142-7873	1464-3774				MAR 24	2022	44	2					208	223		10.1093/plankt/fbac005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbac005		FEB 2022											WOS:000758369000001
J	Auer, B; Arndt, H				Auer, B; Arndt, H			Taxonomic composition and biomass of heterotrophic flagellates in relation to lake trophy and season	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Taxonomic composition and abundance of heterotrophic flagellates (HF) were studied in 55 lakes with different trophy in northern Germany using a live-counting technique. 2. Mean abundances and biomasses of HF ranged from 169 cells L-1 and 22 mug L-1 in mesotrophic lakes to 2439 cells mL(-1) and 475 mug L-1 in hypertrophic lakes, respectively. Highest values were generally observed in spring, but mesotrophic lakes showed maximum values in early summer. 3. The taxonomic composition of HF was not significantly influenced by lake trophy and season. The major fraction of HF consisted of chrysomonads and Protista. incertae sedis; other important groups were choanoflagellates and bicosoecids. The size distribution of HF changed with lake trophy and season, with a higher proportion of large HF (> 10 mum) in hypertrophic lakes and in spring, respectively. 4. Correlation analyses revealed a strong negative impact of cladocerans on total HF biomass and especially on large HF. Ciliates and large bacteria (> 10 Lm) were strongly positively correlated with HF biomass; small bacteria (< 2 <mu>m) showed a weak positive correlation. 5. Analyses at the level of species and genera revealed distinct distribution patterns of some taxa. Paraphysomonas, Aulacomonas and Quadricilia as large-bodied HF showed highest abundance in hypertrophic lakes and in spring. Attached taxa (e.g. Monosiga, Salpingoeca amphoridium) were highly abundant in late summer and autumn, whereas Spumella and Kathablepharis occurred frequently in most samples.

Denitrification rates were measured in slurries of field samples and enrichment experiments using the acetylene inhibition technique. Sediment denitrification rates in inner bay and outer bay ranged from 2.8 to 51.5 nmol N-2/(g dw (dry weight).hr) and from 1.5 to 81.1 nmol N-2/(g dw.hr), respectively. Sediment denitrification rates were greatest in the spring and lowest in the summer and early autumn, due primarily to seasonal differences in nitrate concentration and water temperature. For each site, positive and linear relationships were regularly observed between denitrification rate and water column nitrate concentration. Of various environmental factors on denitrification that we assessed, nitrate was determined to be the key factor limiting denitrification rates in the sediments of Meiliang Bay. In addition, at the two sites denitrification rates were also regulated by temperature. The addition of organic substrates had no significant effect on denitrification rate, indicating that sediment denitrification was not limited by organic carbon availability in the sediments. Nitrate in the water column was depleted during summer and early autumn, and this suppressed effective removal of nitrogen from Taihu Lake by denitrification.

We wished to demonstrate that the East Asian Continental Population (which winters on natural wetlands in the Chinese Yangtze River floodplain and is currently declining) avoids using farmland at multiple wintering sites. We also gathered tracking evidence to support general observations from two increasing population of GWFG, the North Sea-Baltic (which winters in Europe) and the West Pacific (which winter in Korea and Japan) winter mostly within farmland landscapes, using wetlands only for safe night roosts. Methods We tracked 156 GWFG throughout their annual cycle using GPS/GSM transmitters from these three populations to determine migration routes and stopover staging patterns. We used Brownian Bridge Movement Models to generate summer, winter and migration stopover home ranges which we then overlaid in GIS with land cover and protected area boundary at national level to determine habitat use and degree of protection from nature conservation designated areas. Results Data confirmed that 73% of European wintering GWFG homes ranges were from within farmland, compared to 59% in Japan and Korea, but just 5% in China, confirming the heavy winter use of agricultural landscapes by GWFG away from China, and avoidance of farmland at multiple sites within the Yangtze River floodplain. The same GWFG used farmland in northeast China in spring and autumn, confirming their experience of exploiting such habitats at other stages of their annual cycle. Chinese wintering birds showed the greatest overlap with protected areas of all three populations, showing current levels of site safeguard are failing to protect this population. Conclusions Results confirm the need for strategic planning to protect the East Asian Continental GWFG population. While the site protection network in place to protect the species seems adequate, it has failed to stop the declines. Buffalo grazing could serve as one simple strategy to improve the condition of feeding habitats at Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake in the Yangtze, where vast Carex meadows exist. In addition, while we warn against pushing GWFG to winter farmland feeding in China because of the long-term potential to conflict with agricultural interests, we recommend experimental sacrificial, disturbance-free farmland within designated refuge areas adjacent to the Yangtze River floodplain wetland reserves as a manipulative experiment to improve the conservation status of this population in years when natural food sources are limited.

Invasive Silver Carp movement patterns in the predominantly free-flowing Wabash River (Indiana, USA)	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Many organisms must move among habitats to fulfill life history requirements. Fish movements have been widely studied and tend to be either fine-scale (i.e., routine) and governed by factors such as food availability and cover, or broad-scale and associated with spawning migrations. However, movements of invasive fishes in non-native ecosystems are comparatively poorly understood despite the often critical importance of fish movement and dispersal for invasion success. We examined invasive Silver Carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) movements using acoustic telemetry to monitor the timing, distance, and direction of fish movements and assessed movements in relation to seasonal, annual, environmental, and individual factors in the Wabash River (Indiana, USA), a largely unregulated Midwestern river. Silver Carp exhibited highly variable movements that could be rapid and large in magnitude; however, tagged individuals remained stationary most of the time. Despite high variability, several trends emerged, indicating the importance of backwater habitats, avoidance of small tributaries, and tendencies of tagged fish to exhibit directed spring and fall broad-scale movements. Summer movements were smaller in magnitude, characterized by lower movement rates, and evenly split between upstream and downstream directions, although tagged Silver Carp moved more frequently during summer months. Our results indicate that specific seasons (i.e., spring and early fall) and locations (i.e., backwaters) are likely targets for Silver Carp control in the Wabash River and should also be useful targets for early detection and control in other largely unconstrained rivers over a broad geographic range (e.g., Great Lakes tributaries and upper Mississippi River mainstem and tributaries).

J	Sikder, MNA; Xu, GJ; Xu, HL				Sikder, Mohammad Nurul Azim; Xu, Guangjian; Xu, Henglong			Seasonal variability in taxonomic breadth of biofilm-dwelling ciliates in colonization surveys for marine bioassessment	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												To determine an optimal sampling strategy for collecting samples with an expected taxonomic breadth, a 1-year baseline colonization survey was conducted in Chinese coastal waters using glass slides as an artificial substratum for biofilm-dwelling ciliates. A total of 240 slide samples were collected at a depth of 1 m in a four-season cycle. The taxonomic composition and structure of the ciliate communities differed from spring to winter. The colonization dynamics in taxonomic distinctness showed a significant variability among the four seasons. Expectation tests on the pairs of average taxonomic distinctness indices demonstrated a seasonal variability in taxonomic breadth of the ciliates, with high expectation levels in spring and autumn and low levels in the other two seasons. These findings suggest that there was a significant seasonal variability in taxonomic breadth for colonization surveys of biofilm-dwelling ciliates, and that an optimal sampling strategy should be determined for bioassessment in marine ecosystems.																			0025-326X	1879-3363				FEB	2020	151								110828	10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.110828	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.110828								32056620					WOS:000514758400075
J	Stottlemyer, R; Toczydlowski, D				Stottlemyer, R; Toczydlowski, D			Seasonal relationships between precipitation, forest floor, and streamwater nitrogen, Isle Royale, Michigan	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												The Upper Great Lakes receive large amounts of precipitation-NH4+ and moderate NO3- inputs, Increased atmospheric inorganic N input has led to concern about ecosystem capacity to utilize excess N, This paper summarizes a 5-yr study of seasonal N content and nux in precipitation, snowpack, forest floor, and streamwater in order to assess the source of inorganic N outputs in streamflow from a small boreal watershed. Average precipitation N input was 3 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) The peak snowpack N content averaged 0.55 kg ha(-1). The forest floor inorganic N pool was approximate to 2 kg ha(-1), eight times larger than monthly precipitation N input. The inorganic N pool size peaked in spring and early summer, Ninety percent of the forest Boor inorganic N pool was made up of NH4+-N. Forest floor inorganic N pools generally increased with temperature. Net N mineralization was 15 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), and monthly rates peaked in early summer. During winter, the mean monthly net N mineralization rate was twice the peak snowpack N content. Streamwater NO3- concentration peaked in winter, and inorganic N output peaked in late fall. Beneath the dominant boreal forest species, net N mineralization rates were positively correlated (P < 0.05) with streamwater NO3- concentrations. Forest floor NO3- pools beneath alder [Alnus rugosa (Du Roi) Spreng] were positively correlated (P < 0.01) to streamwater NO3- output, At the watershed mouth, streamwater NO3- concentrations were positively correlated (P < 0.05) with precipitation NO3- input and precipitation amount. The relatively small snowpack N content and seasonal precipitation N input compared to forest floor inorganic N pools and net N mineralization rates, the strong ecosystem retention of precipitation N inputs, and the seasonal streamwater NO3- concentration and output pattern all indicated that little streamwater NO3- came directly from precipitation or snowmelt.																			0361-5995					MAR-APR	1999	63	2					389	398		10.2136/sssaj1999.03615995006300020018x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1999.03615995006300020018x													WOS:000080200500018

During the study, the body lengths of a total of 7590 zooplankton specimens (1110 rotifers, 3270 cladocerans, and 3210 copepods) were measured. The length of the majority of the species was significantly smaller in summer than in winter, fall, and spring, including that of the most dominant species, Asplanchna priodonta, Daphnia galeata, Daphnia longispina, Diaphanosoma brachyurum, Bosmina longirostris, Leptodora kindtii, Ceriodaphnia pulchella, Cyclops vicious, Metacyclops gracilis, and Acanthocyclops robustus (F > 5, p < 0.05). Correspondence analysis (CA) showed that the body length of the zooplankton studied was inversely related to water temperature, whereas it was positively related to ORP and pH. The results of our study suggest that, although nutrients (NO3 and SRP) apparently have an effect on zooplankton body length only in the mesotrophic reservoir, temperature influences the body length in both the mesotrophic and the eutrophic reservoir.

J	Helbling, EW; Barbieri, ES; Marcoval, MA; Gonçalves, RJ; Villafañe, VE				Helbling, EW; Barbieri, ES; Marcoval, MA; Gonçalves, RJ; Villafañe, VE			Impact of solar ultraviolet radiation on marine phytoplankton of Patagonia, Argentina	PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY												Patagonia area is located in close proximity to the Antarctic ozone "hole" and thus receives enhanced ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation (280-315 nm) in addition to the normal levels of ultraviolet A (UV-A; 315-400 nm) and photosynthetically available radiation (PAR; 400-700 nm). In marine ecosystems of Patagonia, normal ultraviolet radiation (UVR) levels affect phytoplankton assemblages during the three phases of the annual succession: (1) prebloom season (late summer-fall), (2) bloom season (winter-early spring) and (3) postbloom season (late spring-summer). Small-size cells characterize the pre-and postbloom communities, which have a relatively high photosynthetic inhibition because of high UVR levels during those seasons. During the bloom, characterized by micro-plankton diatoms, photosynthetic inhibition is low because of the low UVR levels reaching the earth's surface during winter; this community, however, is more sensitive to UV-B when inhibition is normalized by irradiance (i.e. biological weighting functions). In situ studies have shown that UVR significantly affects not only photosynthesis but also the DNA molecule, but these negative effects are rapidly reduced in the water column because of the differential attenuation of solar radiation. UVR also affects photosynthesis versus irradiance (P vs E) parameters of some natural phytoplankton assemblages (i.e. during the pre- but not during the postbloom season). However, there is a significant temporal variability of P vs E parameters, which are influenced by the nutrient status of cells and taxonomic composition; taxonomic composition is in turn associated with the stratification conditions (e.g. wind speed and duration). In Patagonia, wind speed is one of the most important variables that conditions the development of the winter bloom by regulating the depth of the upper mixed layer (UML) and hence the mean irradiance received by cells. Studies on the interactive effects of UVR and mixing show that responses of phytoplankton vary according to the taxonomic composition and cell structure of assemblages; therefore cells use UVR if > 90% of the euphotic zone is being mixed. In fact, cell size plays a very important role when estimating the impact of UVR on phytoplankton, with large cells being more sensitive when determining photosynthesis inhibition, whereas small cells are more sensitive to DNA damage. Finally, in long-term experiments, it was determined that UVR can shape the diatom community structure in some assemblages of coastal waters, but it is virtually unknown how these changes affect the trophodynamics of marine systems. Future studies should consider the combined effects of UVR on both phytoplankton and grazers to establish potential changes in biodiversity of the area.					; Gonçalves, Rodrigo/AAV-2782-2021; Goncalves, Rodrigo Javier/AAV-2782-2021	Marcoval, Maria Alejandra/0000-0002-8926-9246; Villafane, Virginia/0000-0002-9552-6069; Goncalves, Rodrigo Javier/0000-0002-4332-2312													0031-8655	1751-1097				JUL-AUG	2005	81	4					807	818		10.1562/2005-03-02-RA-452R.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1562/2005-03-02-RA-452R.1								15839753					WOS:000231367600011
J	Deutschlander, ME; Muheim, R				Deutschlander, Mark E.; Muheim, Rachel			Fuel reserves affect migratory orientation of thrushes and sparrows both before and after crossing an ecological barrier near their breeding grounds	JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY												Fat reserves influence the orientation of migrating songbirds at ecological barriers, such as expansive water crossings. Upon encountering a body of water, fat migrants usually cross the barrier exhibiting 'forward' migration in a seasonally appropriate direction. In contrast, lean birds often exhibit temporary 'reverse' orientation away from the water, possibly to lead them to suitable habitats for refueling. Most examples of reverse orientation are restricted to autumn migration and, in North America, are largely limited to transcontinental migrants prior to crossing the Gulf of Mexico. Little is known about the orientation of lean birds after crossing an ecological barrier or on the way to their breeding grounds. We examined the effect of fat stores on migratory orientation of both long- and short-distance migrants before and after a water crossing near their breeding grounds; Catharus thrushes (Swainson's and gray-cheeked thrushes, C. ustulatus and C. minimus) and white-throated sparrows Zonotrichia albicollis were tested for orientation at the south shore of Lake Ontario during spring and autumn. During both spring and autumn, fat birds oriented in a seasonally appropriate, forward direction. Lean thrushes showed a tendency for reverse orientation upon encountering water in the spring and axial, shoreline orientation after crossing water in the autumn. Lean sparrows were not consistently oriented in any direction during either season. The responses of lean birds may be attributable to their stopover ecology and seasonally-dependent habitat quality.
