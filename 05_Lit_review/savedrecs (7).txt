Previous evaluation-oriented studies have either focused on the uncertainty of time series or on the monitoring capability of extreme events. There is limited research that comprehensively considers both aspects to provide a systematic knowledge. Moreover, there is still insufficient understanding of the accuracy of hourly precipitation estimates. This study conducts a comprehensive evaluation between five NSPPs (IMERG Early, IMERG Late, GSMaP NRT, GSMaP NRT Gauge and PERSIANN CCS) from two main perspectives at hourly scale: an assessment of time series spanning from 2018 to 2022 over the Lower Yangtze River Basin and the Lixiahe region and an examination of the four extreme events over the Tai Lake Basin and the Chao Lake Basin. HP-metrics are proposed to evaluate bias in the location of extreme rainfall, rainy area, and precipitation amount over time, comprehensively analyzing performance in terms of extreme events. The results show that, for general and seasonal assessment, IMERG Late generally performed best with good statistical metrics, with the highest CSI (0.343), CC (0.445), KGE '(0.295) in annual results, and the best agreement in capturing convective rain diurnal curves (summer CC = 0.820). GSMaP showed a better detection capability especially in spring and summer, and also performed better in capturing frequency curves, but always showed large estimation errors. IMERG and GSMaP detected worse CC region close to the water body. And the effect of high terrain on GSMaP NRT is more obvious in winter. For the evaluation in detecting the extreme events, IMERG and GSMaP overestimated the area and intensity and had a certain ability to discriminate the location of extreme precipitation, based on the temporal variation of HP-metrics. The rapid expansion or contraction of the extent of the extreme precipitation region could degrade the detection capability of HP-pi. The comprehensive understanding of NSPPs provides valuable insights for upgrading satellite retrieval algorithms and making informed selection for precipitation products in meteorological hydrological applications.																			0169-8095	1873-2895				OCT 1	2024	308								107520	10.1016/j.atmosres.2024.107520	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2024.107520		JUN 2024											WOS:001258699700001

Herbicides induce change in metabolic and genetic diversity of bacterial community from a cold oligotrophic lake	WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY												Pristine cold oligotrophic lakes show unique physical and chemical characteristics with permanent fluctuation in temperature and carbon source availability. Incorporation of organic toxic matters to these ecosystems could alter the bacterial community composition. Our goal was to assess the effects of simazine (Sz) and 2,4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) upon the metabolic and genetic diversity of the bacterial community in sediment samples from a pristine cold oligotrophic lake. Sediment samples were collected in winter and summer season, and microcosms were prepared using a ration 1:10 (sediments:water). The microcosms were supplemented with 0.1 mM 2,4-D or 0.5 mM Sz and incubated for 20 days at 10 A degrees C. Metabolic diversity was evaluated by using the Biolog Ecoplate (TM) system and genetic diversity by 16S rDNA amplification followed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis. Total bacterial counts and live/dead ratio were determined by epifluorescence microscopy. The control microcosms showed no significant differences (P > 0.05) in both metabolic and genetic diversity between summer and winter samples. On the other hand, the addition of 2,4-D or Sz to microcosms induces statistical significant differences (P < 0.05) in metabolic and genetic diversity showing the prevalence of Actinobacteria group which are usually not detected in the sediments of these non-contaminated lacustrine systems. The obtained results suggest that contaminations of cold pristine lakes with organic toxic compounds of anthropic origin alter their homeostasis by inhibiting specific susceptible bacterial groups. The concomitant increase of usually low representative bacterial groups modifies the bacterial composition commonly found in this pristine lake.

In all three lakes, at least one slow- and one fast-growing form can be identified. The different growth patterns might be the result of different trophic and temperature conditions between and within the lakes: In eutrophic L. Biel, both forms reproduce in winter, in mesotrophic L. Thun and in oligotrophic L. Brienz, only the fast-growing forms reproduce in winter, the others in autumn. Therefore, the environmental conditions for newly hatched larvae differ strongly and the observed growth differences might be explained with temperature conditions and food availability for the offspring. In order to test the hypothesis that growth differences are the result of environmental conditions, larvae of all six populations were reared under equal conditions (temperature, larvae density, and food availability) during 100-120 day, in the laboratory. Our results reveal three growth stanzas: one during larval development stage L1 (approx. 20 days), a second until the fish reach development stage L6-L7 (approx. 55 days), and a third thereafter. The slow-growing autumn-spawners of L. Brienz and L. Thun showed a faster increase in length than the winter-spawning forms during the first growth period, but during the third growth period after 54 days, the slow-growing form of L. Brienz grew significantly slower than the fast-growing form from the same lake. In the other two lakes, no significant differences were detected between the forms for the third growth period. Further experiments with different rearing temperatures showed that after larval stage L7 all three tested forms grew faster in warmer water with considerable differences between slow- and fast-growing forms. L7 is characterised by the forming of the pyloric caeca, which means that stomach structures are fully developed after this stage. These results indicate that the different growth patterns are not only the result of environmental conditions, but of endogenous factors with differences in metabolism, food uptake, and utilization.																			0071-1128		3-510-47052-4				1998	50						49	59																WOS:000078180200006

No clear pH depression was seen during the study year with exceptionally thin snow cover, in contrast to the year 1997, when a clear episodic decline in surface water pH was measured. In contrast to many Arctic lakes, no phytoplankton spring bloom was observed, probably because of the combination of low nutrient concentrations, dilution effect, flushing and rapid change in light climate. Low temperatures and limited food resources, resulting in long life cycles of zooplankton and with a clear winter maximum, may be the main factor controlling the atypical succession of zooplankton in Lake Saanajarvi.

Spring-dependent animals are particularly sensitive to groundwater conditions, and land-use changes associated with urbanization can affect factors such as the temperature and stability of groundwater supply. This study aimed to examine how catchment-scale land use influences the distribution patterns of a spring-dependent animal. To explore this, we constructed a generalized linear model (GLM) incorporating both indirect influences from catchment land use and direct effects from local wetland environmental factors. Furthermore, to provide an example of conservation planning that considers land use, we assessed habitat suitability at the wetland level using a GLM and at the grid level using maximum entropy modeling (MaxEnt) with only landscape variables. Distribution data of Lefua echigonia, an indicator species of spring-dependent animals, were collected through field surveys and environmental DNA analyses in 102 first-order valleys of the Lake Inba watershed. The GLM results indicated that an index of spring water stability, the percentage of permeable surfaces in the catchment, precipitation, the period of rice paddy abandonment in the valley bottom, and valley length (representing habitat size) positively influenced the fish's presence, while summer temperature had a negative effect. The MaxEnt analysis also showed a positive effect of the percentage of permeable surfaces. Our results highlight that both land use within a catchment and catchment size, which can affect the volume and stability of spring water, are important factors for conserving suitable habitats for spring-dependent animals.																			0912-3814	1440-1703				SEP 9	2025	40	5							e70003	10.1111/1440-1703.70003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1440-1703.70003													WOS:001567584900001
J	PHILLIPS, GL				PHILLIPS, GL			MINERAL NUTRIENT LEVELS IN 3 NORFOLK BROADS DIFFERING IN TROPHIC STATUS, AND AN ANNUAL MINERAL-CONTENT BUDGET FOR ONE OF THEM	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The seasonal range and variation of P; N, silica and Mn were studied in 3 Norfolk Broads: Alderfen Broad, Barton Broad and Upton Broad [England]. At all of the sites NO3-N was maximal during the winter and usually undetectable in the summer. At Alderfen and Barton Broads a large increase of soluble reactive P occurred during the summer. At Alderfen Broad this was accompanied by an increase of NH4-N, Mn and soluble reactive silica. A nutrient budget was calculated for Alderfen Broad, and this showed that the increase of these nutrients could not be accounted for by the input stream. The sediment was probably an important source of these nutrients during the summer. The algal crop, the range of nutrients in these broads, and the N and P loading of Alderfen Broad are compared with those in other lakes in Britain. It is suggested that these 3 broads are typical of the range of conditions present in the Norfolk Broads as a whole. Barton Broad is highly enriched and often contains blue-green algal blooms; Alderfen Broad is less enriched; and Upton Broad is typical of a broad as yet unaffected by increased enrichment. The implications of internal loading for the possible recovery of Alderfen Broad are discussed.																			0022-0477	1365-2745					1977	65	2					447	474		10.2307/2259494	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2259494													WOS:A1977DN67500008

Vast wax ester reserves of Limnocalanus were accumulated in a period of only two months, and comprised mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and saturated fatty alcohols. In winter, the mobilization of wax esters was selective, and the proportion of long-chain polyunsaturated wax esters declined first. PUFA accounted for > 50 % of all fatty acids throughout the year reaching up to ca. 65 % during late summer and fall. Long-chain PUFA 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 together comprised 17-40 % of all fatty acids. The rarely reported C24 and C26 very-long-chain PUFA (VLC-PUFA) comprised 6.2 +/- A 3.4 % of all fatty acids in August and 2.1 +/- A 1.7 % in September. The VLC-PUFA are presumably synthesized by Limnocalanus from shorter chain-length precursors because they were not found in the potential food sources. We hypothesize that these VLC-PUFA help Limnocalanus to maximize lipid reserves when food is abundant. Sterol content of Limnocalanus, consisting ca. 90 % of cholesterol, did not show great seasonal variation. As a lipid-rich copepod with high abundance of PUFA, Limnocalanus is excellent quality food for fish. The VLC-PUFA were also detected in planktivorous fish, suggesting that these compounds can be used as a trophic marker indicating feeding on Limnocalanus.

This was followed by a corresponding series during a period of lower freshwater flows and spring tides in autumn 1996. The surveys indicated substantial numbers of fish living upstream and downstream of a depleted oxygen zone which exists in the tidal Hull. Conditions in this zone of poor water quality deteriorated further during low flow periods due to reduced dilution of effluents. Fish populations moved with the tide apparently in response to gradients of dissolved oxygen and salinity. Under conditions of low freshwater flow and high tides, gradients of salinity and oxygen were steeper and fish responses appeared more marked: at higher salinities, the response to increasing salinity overrode the response to decreasing oxygen availability.																			0969-997X					FEB	2003	10	1					1	12		10.1046/j.1365-2400.2003.00316.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2400.2003.00316.x													WOS:000180744800001

Results compare favorably with previously obtained data for temperature distributions around the lake during midsummer 2007. During the spring months, when experimental data is not available, the model predicts strong and rapid variations in the water temperature, which correlate well with significant storms on the lake. A heat balance shows that the largest components of heat fluxes into and out of the lake are due to short wave solar and evaporative cooling, respectively. Both numerical and experimental results also indicate that, due to the shallow nature of the lake and occurrence of significant wind events, thermal stratification is never achieved.																					978-0-7918-4358-1				2009							833	841																WOS:000283010000097

The data revealed that the sand smelt fed mainly on larger zooplankton, such as adult copepods and cladocerans. Fish eggs and juvenile fish were also found in the stomach content. There was a considerable dietary overlap among size groups larger than 30 mm total length. Larger individuals have also cannibalistic behaviour as they consumed juveniles of sand smelt. The proportion of empty stomachs was maximum in winter and minimum in summer. The trophic niche breadth was the highest in summer. The results suggested that the sand smelt may have a remarkable impact on zooplankton communities in the Hirfanli Reservoir.

Influence of episodic wind events on thermal stratification and bottom water hypoxia in a Great Lakes estuary	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Hypoxia formation and breakdown were tracked during 2015 in Muskegon Lake estuary at multiple locations, and five years (2011-2015) of time-series buoy observatory data were evaluated for the effect of episodic wind-events on lake mixing. Bi-weekly water temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) profiles at four locations revealed that hypoxia occurred at all sites and persisted for 2-3 months during summer 2015. On one date in late-summer, up to 24% of the lake's volume was estimated to be mildly hypoxic (DO < 4 mg L-1) as defined by lake sturgeon requirements. Patterns of wind speed and water column stability in late spring indicated that high winds and low stability delayed the onset of hypoxia while in late summer low winds and high stability delayed degradation of hypoxia. Wind speeds appear to play a great role in the interannual variability of stratification and subsequent hypoxia. Water temperature and DO profiles taken before and after one mid-summer mixing event (wind speed >7.7 m s(-1) for 10 h), indicated that while the wind was unable to completely mix the entire water column, it deepened the epilimnion by similar to 1.5 m and sheared a thin layer from the upper hypolimnion. By entraining internally loaded nutrients, such episodic wind-events may initiate and sustain algal blooms in nutrient limited surface waters. Quantifying the variable role of wind and mixing events will be key to integrating limnological processes into climate models of the future.

CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Sampling on Akwesasne Mohawk Nation lands during 1993 yielded elevated polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations comparable with those of other areas impacted by the discharge of PCBs. The summer air PCB congener-specific pattern in proximity to three Superfund sites along the St. Lawrence River suggests that the volatilization of Aroclor 1248, used extensively at all three downwind sites, is the dominant source. A dechlorinated source, presumably From river sediment and waters, is a minor contributor (similar to 12%) to the pattern. These two sources can account for similar to 80% of the observed pattern. At a small cove adjacent to an industrial landfill, summer concentrations exceeded those measured in the winter by a factor of 27. At all sample sites during the summer months (June-August), concentrations and chlorine to biphenyl ratios increased, and similar congener-specific PCB patterns were observed.

Spatiotemporal Variations in Abundance and Biomass of Planktonic Ciliates Related to Environmental Variables in a Temporal Pond, Argentina	ZOOLOGICAL STUDIES												Gabriela C. Kuppers and Maria C. Claps (2012) Spatiotemporal variations in abundance and biomass of planktonic ciliates related to environmental variables in a temporal pond, Argentina. Zoological Studies 51(3): 298-313. This report describes the structure and seasonal dynamics of ciliated protozoa associated with variations in physicochemical characteristics of the environment in a temporary pond in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. Plankton samples were obtained, and physicochemical variables were measured monthly for 2 yr. In total, 50 planktonic ciliates were recorded. The highest species richness occurred during the pond's filling and stable-hydric phases. Upon the pond's desiccation, the number of ciliate species decreased, with the lowest values being recorded in spring; while the highest abundance and biomass values were observed before drought periods. Ciliate diversity tended to be higher after a drought but decreased with pond desiccation. Most ciliate species were rare and found during filling periods. Vorticella convallaria, Pelagostrobilidium wilberti, and Coleps hirtus were dominant; Cyclidium glaucoma, Strobilidium caudatum, Pseudochilodonopsis piscatoris, Limnostrombidium viride, L. pelagicum, and Chilodonella sp. were common; and Pelagostrombidium mirabile and Rhabdostyla sp., an epibiont on cladocerans, were occasional. The 1st axis and the sum of all axes in the canonical correspondence analysis explained a significant portion of the variance in the ciliate data. Autumn and winter samples were grouped together corresponding to the highest conductivities, high precipitation, and low temperatures, properties which characterized the filling and stable-hydric periods. Species were mainly distributed according to conductivity and temperature gradients along the 1st canonical axis. The structure and temporal dynamics of planktonic ciliates from this temporary pond varied with changes in the physicochemical characteristics of the environment which were determined by flooding and desiccation. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/51.3/298.pdf						Claps, Maria/0000-0002-7459-3238													1021-5506	1810-522X				MAY	2012	51	3					298	313																WOS:000304891000003
J	Kirillin, G				Kirillin, Georgiy			Modeling the impact of global warming on water temperature and seasonal mixing regimes in small temperate lakes	BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												Global warming increases the vertical stability in small lakes and makes a future transition between different mixing regimes possible. In order to estimate this effect, the one-dimensional lake temperature model, FLake, is applied to two lakes located in Berlin, Germany, that have similar morphometrical characteristics but that differ in the mixing regime. The model is driven by long-term meteorological data and by regional climate scenarios. The current rate of increase in the year-round lake temperature of 0.3 degrees C per decade is found to coincide with the trend in the air temperature. The warming rates are unevenly redistributed over the seasons and across the water column; the strongest warming occurs in winter and slight cooling of the near-bottom waters occurs in summer. In future scenarios, both lakes change their mixing regime to warm monomictic over the course of the century. Successive transitions between poly-, di- and monomictic states reveal themselves through a series of abrupt changes in the near-bottom temperature during summer, which can significantly affect the water sediment nutrient exchange and the benthic biological communities.

J	Schiefer, E				Schiefer, E			Depositional regimes and areal continuity of sedimentation in a Montane Lake Basin, British Columbia, Canada	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Spatially variable sedimentation patterns are described for a small montane lake in southwestern British Columbia through the analysis of contemporary (20th century) wave sequences recovered from a high-density sediment coring program. Average, moderate, extreme, and localized depositional regimes, resolved at decadal to intra-annual scales, are differentiated for the Green Lake system from the stratigraphic record based on the volume and areal extent of the associated deposits. Average-regime sedimentation is mediated by the reliable annual freshet for the catchment. Moderate-regime events of the contemporary period (1930-2000) include periods of rapid glacial recession, extreme late-summer and autumn rainstorm-generated floods, and unusual snowmelt conditions. Only exceptional rainstorm events have led to extreme-regime sedimentation in the lake basin. Spatial sedimentation patterns are quantified by empirically derived surface models. Systematic differences are observed between both moderate and extreme sediment delivery events and the defined average-regime model. Substantial differences are observed between average and extreme regimes because of associated changes in sediment bypassing effects, intermediate sub-basin trapping, and sediment focusing mechanisms. Localized deposits coincide with isolated winter rainstorms in the region and anthropogenic disturbances along lake shorelines. Results indicate that the assumption of areal continuity in lacustrine sedimentation is not always appropriate for making comparisons between the identified depositional regimes. Sediment sampling programs that do not capture these spatially fluctuating sedimentation patterns may lead to biased accumulation chronologies and erroneous paleoenvironmental assessments of important hydroclimatic events.

Temporal variation in the relative abundance, suitable habitat selection, and distribution of Ataeniobius toweri (Meek, 1904) (Goodeidae), by life stages, in the Media Luna spring, Mexico	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												The Media Luna spring, Mexico, is the main reservoir of the endemic and endangered fish Ataeniobius toweri. In the last decades, the ecosystem has been modified by tourism, and the habitat has changed for this species. Therefore, for better conservation management of the natural fish population, it is necessary to understand its abundance status and suitable habitat conditions, in ecological and spatial scenarios, on a temporal scale. In the present study, we modeled A. toweri's ecological responses and spatial distribution for adult and juvenile life stages, in three summer periods (years 1999, 2009, and 2019). As habitat variables, we used water depth and underwater coverage. Ecological response curves were obtained from a Generalized Linear Model; distribution models were obtained with DOMAIN. In the modeling evaluation, for the Linear Regression Model, we obtained true statistical skills metric > 0.30 and, for DOMAIN, an area under the curve (AUC) > 0.70 with an AUC ratio > 1.00. In general, as the summer periods progressed, we found the highest probability of occurrence (P > 0.20) and distribution (P > 0.60) in areas with conditions of large coverage of underwater vegetation, in the first 1.5 m of depth, and near the shores of the spring. Also, the variations of relative abundance were always observed at sites with these habitat conditions. Thus, we concluded that our models had the performance to discern between suitable and unsuitable habitat conditions for A. toweri, and that areas with little or no anthropogenic pressure are more important for this species.					; Espinosa, Santiago/GLQ-5727-2022	Palacio-Nunez, Jorge/0000-0002-8374-8801; Espinosa, Santiago/0000-0002-7416-7167; Martinez-Montoya, Juan Felipe/0000-0003-2616-7469; Rossel-Ramirez, David Walter/0000-0002-1056-9992													0378-1909	1573-5133				FEB	2024	107	2					173	188		10.1007/s10641-024-01520-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-024-01520-7		FEB 2024											WOS:001160446200001

We conducted surveys of A. patagonicus in 15 lakes in and around the park from December 2000 through April 2001 (late austral spring through early fall) and January-February 2002. We found the species in all the lakes except the largest, Laguna Blanca, and conclude that A. patagonicus is gone from that lake, probably related to the introduction of an invasive fish species there. We used transects and quadrats to sample animals near the shoreline of the lakes and found impressive densities of A. patagonicus, up to 1.15 individuals/m(2) in one transect at one lake and an overall average highest density per lake of 0.58 individuals/m(2). Densities were highest in late summer (March). Captures were higher in aquatic than terrestrial habitat, although postmetamorphs on land were not uncommon. Littoral and aquatic postmetamorphic forms have been described for this species; most animals we found were the aquatic form (96.8%). Tadpoles were found in January-March. In most populations, we found many dead and moribund tadpoles and frogs, all of which showed clinical signs of an unknown disease. Frequency of affected animals was greater than 40% in eight of the I I lakes sampled systematically and reached 91.3% in one lake in February 2002. Percent animals encountered dead was usually less than 12%, except for 33% registered in one lake in January 2001. Clinical signs occurred mostly in metamorphosing tadpoles and recent metamorphs, with a peak in February (47%). Populations were mostly asymptomatic: (prevalence of 1.4%) by early fall (April) and showed roughly equivalent high densities of animals the next year, as well as high levels of sick animals once again.

We studied the relationships between a recent population recovery and an improvement of lake water quality. We used correlation analysis to evaluate lagged seasonal effects of lake water quality on population dynamics during the past decade, and factor analysis to determine the independent factors responsible for population recovery. We also provided a water-quality-based reconstruction of population growth from the beginning of the lake recovery two decades ago, using a partial least squares regression (PLSR) model of population growth. We identified three independent controlling factors: nutrients (nitrate, phosphorus, calcium, potassium, magnesium), stressors (pH, ionic aluminium) and temperature. Of these, nutrient availability did not limit the quillwort growth, but annual mean pH and winter mean concentrations of toxic ionic aluminium influenced population growth through negative effects on sporeling establishment until the age of one year, while cumulative temperature in spring and summer controlled the later plant growth. Thus, water quality in the acidified Plegne Lake mainly controls recruitment success rather than adult survival of Isoetes echinospora. This study provides the first in situ evidence that the recruitment success, namely the annual increment in the adult quillwort population, indicates the degree of recovery from acidification, however further extensive investigation is required to more accurately quantify, and therefore understand, the relationships between recruitment, water quality and other factors.

In this study, 24 sampling sites were set up in Shengjin Lake in the summer of 2022, and water quality indicators were measured, zooplankton samples were collected, and quantitative identification counts were conducted to investigate the effects of high summer temperatures on the zooplankton community structure of Shengjin Lake in the summer of 2020 and 2021, combined with the results of 2 summers. The findings showed that the water temperature (WT) increased significantly in 2021 and 2022 compared with 2020,the highest value was 34.35 degrees C in July 2022, the lowest value was 26.68 degrees C in July 2020. This study analyzed the dynamic changes of zooplankton and water temperature and other environmental factors in three summers. A total of 83 species of zooplankton in 21 families and 50 genera were identified, among them, 53 species of rotifers in 12 families and 27 genera, 22 species of cladoceras in 5 families and 15 genera in 5 families, 8 species of copepods in 4 families and 8 genera. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index(H ') decreased from 3.63 in the summer of 2020 to 2.85 in the summer of 2022; Margalef richness index(D) fell from 4.9 in 2020 to 2.19 in the summer of 2022; the highest value of Pielou evenness index(J) was 1.03 in 2021 and the lowest was 0.99 in 2020. The temperature (P < 0.01) had a significant negative correlation to the density and biomass of cladoceras and copepods whereas a rise in the temperature (P < 0.05) had a notable positive correlation on the density and biomass of rotifers. This indicates to a trend of zooplankton succession toward miniaturization in high summer temperatures.

Variations in phytoplankton carbon biomass, community assemblages and species succession along Lake Burullus, Northern Egypt	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												Phytoplankton assemblages and species succession along Lake Burullus (Southern Mediterranean) is expressed as carbon biomass (mg cm(-3)) using a standard spreadsheet based on the species cell volume cell(-1) carbon relationship. High Chl a levels were measured (maximum 85-126 mg m(-3)) reflecting a dense phytoplankton population (up to 8.3 x 10(3) cell ml(-1) and 5.5 x 10(3) mg cm(-3)) throughout the lake body with maximum concentrations at the western sector of the lake (Si). A diverse phytoplankton community was determined. Cell count data revealed the dominance of a mixed phytoplankton taxa, however biomass data indicates over-dominance of Bacillariophyceae (up to 98%). Good correlation (r=0.73, p<0.05) was found between Chl a and carbon biomass with various cell carbon/Chl a ratio according to variations in community structure. Bacillariophyceae were the most dominant, particularly at the middle (S2) and the western parts (Si) during periods of high nutrient (silicate) and good weather conditions (during spring/summer months). Chlorophyceae were abundant with Scenedesmus sp. mostly dominant, particularly at P-rich sites. Dinoflagellates peaked only during calm and high light summer months (May -July) being at a maximum level at Si. Euglenophyceae were less contributed to total phytoplankton abundance and peaked only; as a transition stage; at S1 during Jannuary and March (winter months). Cyanophyceae were numerous along with maximum peak at S2 affected by the southern drains. Excessive nutrient enrichment into the lake alters the existent structure of phytoplankton community. The water quality index indicated a poor water quality status of the lake. This may led to increase the possibility of toxic algal blooms to invade the lake ecosystem and, in turn, affect the lake fish yield.

These parameters were then related to the chemical, biological and physical/hydromechanical conditions in the lake. Medium sized cells (2-3 mu m) dominated the bacterial population in the spring, then in mid-slimmer the smaller cell fraction (1 mu m) took over. Relatively low numbers of large cells (10 mu m) were counted, but the biovolume of this fraction was significant, especially in mid-summer. Both the abundance and biovolume of medium sized cells were positively correlated with NH4+ and O-2 concentrations, but not with NO3-, inorganic orthophosphate (P-i) and Total-P. At water temperatures above 28 degrees C, the biovolume of medium sized cells decreased, probably due to faster grazing of zooplankton. When water circulation in the vertical plane was dominant, large cells disappeared from the water column, due to sinking to the bottom. We conclude that chemical parameters, such as NH4+ and O-2 concentrations, had a long-term effect on bacterial succession and size distribution, whereas hydromechanical mechanisms, such as turbulent mixing in the horizontal or vertical planes, had a short-term effect.																			0273-1223						2000	42	1-2					49	54																WOS:000089465000009
J	Kocik, JF; Taylor, WW				Kocik, JF; Taylor, WW			Effect of juvenile steelhead on juvenile brown trout habitat use in a low-gradient great lakes tributary	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We investigated habitat use of wild brown trout Salmo trutta in Gilchrist Creek, Michigan, with and without a parallel cohort of introduced steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss. This stream is typical of the region, having a low-gradient, stable discharge and a high sand bedload. By snorkeling, we evaluated seasonal habitat use in two stream reaches before and after steelhead introduction to one of the reaches. Age-0 brown trout occupied stream margins soon after emergence, using cover provided by aquatic vegetation growing on sand and silt substrates. By summer and fall, brown trout moved into deeper water and used more diverse cover types. From summer to fall, the smaller age-0 steelhead used lower current velocities than did age-0 brown trout. Similar water depth, substrate, and cover were used by the two species. At the densities studied, age-0 brown trout habitat use did not change in response to the presence of age-0 steelhead. We believe that three factors minimized the effect of steelhead: (1) the larger size of the brown trout, which gave them a competitive advantage; (2) vertical habitat segregation with steelhead suspended in the water column and brown trout near or at the bottom; and (3) temporal differences in habitat ontogeny with shifts of older, larger fish to deeper, faster water. These factors may permit these two species to coexist in low-gradient rivers.

In this study we explored if and how timing (with regard to temperature seasonality) influences the responses of planktonic and free-floating plants communities to floods in a warm temperate floodplain lake and assessed its relevance for determining state shifts. We took samples of zooplankton, phytoplankton, picoplankton, heterotrophic nanoflagellates and free-floating macrophytes at four sites of the lake characterized by the presence-absence of emergent or free-floating macrophytes along a 2-year period with marked hydrological fluctuations associated to river flood dynamics. We performed ANOVA tests to compare the responses of these communities to floods in cold and warm seasons and among sites. Planktonic communities developed high abundances in response to floods that occurred in the cold season, while the growth of free-floating macrophytes was impaired by low winter temperatures. Spring and summer floods favored profuse colonization by free-floating plants and limited the development of planktonic communities. The prolonged absence of floods during warm periods caused environmental conditions that favored Cyanobacteria growth, leading to a "low turbid waters" regime. The occurrence of floods early in the warm season caused phytoplankton dilution and promoted free-floating plant colonization and a shift towards a "high clear waters" state. Zooplankton:phytoplankton biomass ratio was very low during floods in warm seasons, thus zooplankton grazing on phytoplankton seemed to play a minor role in the maintenance of the clear regime.

Both programs were initiated in the early 1990s to track the efficacy of emission reduction policies and to assess the full impacts of acid deposition on surface water chemistry. They now serve to inform on the emerging chemical recovery of these waters. The Adirondack TIME program utilizes a probability-based approach to assess chronic acidification in a population of lakes using one summer sample per year. The ALTM attempts to track changes in both chronic and episodic acidification across a gradient of lake types using monthly samples. The ALTM project has two important attributes that contrast with the TIME program in the Adirondacks: higher temporal resolution (monthly versus once during the summer or fall) and speciation of aluminum. In particular, the ALTM program provides inorganic monomeric aluminum (Al-IM), the fraction of Al that is most toxic. The monthly sampling of the ALTM program includes the spring snowmelt period when acid-neutralizing capacity and pH are near their lowest and Al levels are near their highest. We compare chemistry trends (1992-2008) for sulfate, nitrate, base cations, dissolved organic carbon, hydrogen ion, acid neutralizing capacity, and Al for the six lakes common to both programs. We also compare relatively high springtime Al-IM concentrations from the ALTM with relatively low summertime total Al concentrations from the TIME, showing that the ALTM program provides a more biologically relevant indicator of the effects of acid deposition, illustrating the value of the complementary monitoring efforts in the Adirondack region.

Water-surface photovoltaic avoids negative impacts on terrestrial ecosystems, while the impacts on aquatic physical and chemical properties and biodiversity are unclear. To understand the ecological and environmental impacts of water-surface photovoltaic systems, here we conducted a field survey on water physical and chemical properties, plankton and bird communities of 26 water-surface photovoltaic systems in the Yangtze River basin in China during the winter and summer of 2022. We found that water-surface photovoltaic systems decreased water temperature, dissolved oxygen saturation and uncovered area of the water surface, which caused a reduction in plankton species and individual density, altering the community composition. Water-surface photovoltaic systems also caused an overall decrease in bird diversity and changed bird community compositions. These findings suggested that water-surface photovoltaic systems have impacts on the water environment and ecology. Since water-surface photovoltaic systems will continue to expand in the future, our results emphasize that rational planning is critical for the sustainable development of water-surface photovoltaic systems and the protection of the aquatic environment and biodiversity. Plankton species richness and individual density, and bird diversity decreased where water-surface photovoltaic systems were installed, according to a field survey in the Yangtze River basin, China during the winter and summer of 2022.

The surface area of the lake is 37.1 km(2), and the maximum depth is 57 m. Data were collected of ice, snow and weather conditions with an automatic ice station in the lake. The heat budget together with ice structure, growth and melting was analysed. It was dominated by the radiation balance, down to 50 W m(-2) in fall and up to 100 W m(-2) in summer. Turbulent heat fluxes were significant before freeze-up in fall (absolute values up to 30 W m(-2)), but in the ice season they were small except for an occasional sensible heat flux which was large due to warm air advection. The evolution of ice thickness served as a very good condition for the total surface heat flux, and was found to be consistent with the ice station time series of air-ice heat fluxes.																			1998-9563	2224-7955				AUG	2017	48	4					969	980		10.2166/nh.2016.171	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/nh.2016.171													WOS:000409334100008

During spring and late summer, an optical plankton counter was towed along a total of 11 transects, ranging from 26 to 67 km in length, distributed among the three major basins of the lake. A general model of spatial variation was used to identify large-scale trends, cyclic components at intermediate scales, and small-scale autocorrelation. Significant trends in biomass were found along all transects, while significant spatial autocorrelation underlying these trends was present in all but one case. The observed spatial autocorrelation was then removed, and standard statistical methods were used to estimate mean biomass and confidence limits. In most cases, the larger-scale spatial trends remained after removing autocorrelation. Regression methods were therefore used to estimate mean biomass in the presence of these trends. Relatively little overlap in confidence bands of the regression estimates were found from different regions of the lake. Mean biomass estimates for the entire take from two seasons, when spatial trends and autocorrelation were ignored, fell outside the 95% confidence limits of estimates that did account for these spatial structures more than 50% of time. The relatively large change in biomass within and among many transects show that spatial variability of zooplankton biomass should be incorporated in future zooplankton studies in Lake Erie and the other Great Lakes.

Sampling was conducted during winter stratification, the critical period for oxygen (O-2) deficiency in seasonally ice-covered, thermally stratified lakes. Oxygen concentrations were maintained at least at a moderate level throughout the oxygenated water columns, whereas the nonoxygenated columns suffered anoxic hypolimnia. The mean concentrations of dissolved CH4 exceeding the atmospheric equilibrium were greater in the non-oxygenated water columns (20.6-154 muM) than in the oxygenated ones (0.01-1.41 muM) In contrast, the mean excess CO2 concentrations varied less between the non-oxygenated and oxygenated sites (0.28-0.47 and 0.25-0.31 mM, respectively). Oxygenated water columns had greater mean excess concentrations of N2O (0.018-0.032 muM) than the non-oxygenated ones (0.005-0.024 muM). If the accumulated greenhouse gas stores in the water columns during winter are assumed to be released to the atmosphere during the spring overturn, the global warming potentials (GWP, time horizon 100 yr) of these potential emissions at the non-oxygenated, eutrophic study sites ranged from 177 to 654 g CO2 equivalent (CO2-e) m(-2) compared with 144 to 173 g CO2-e m(-2) at the oxygenated sites. The increase in the accumulation of CHI was the main reason for the higher GWP of the non-oxygenated sites.

However, little attention has been paid to the linkage between the lakes ' nitrogen removal efficiency and improved water quality in lakes, especially the variation of denitrification rate (DNR) under decreasing N concentrations. To understand the efficiency of N removal under improving water quality and its influence on the N control targets in Lake Taihu, a denitrification model based on in situ experimental results was developed and long-term (from 2007 to 2022) water quality and meteorological observations were used to estimate DNR and relate it to the amount of N removal (ANR) from the lake. The concentration of total nitrogen (TN) in Lake Taihu decreased from 3.28 mg L -1 to 1.41 mg L -1 from 2007 to 2022 but the reduction showed spatial heterogeneity. The annual mean DNR decreased from 45.6 mu mol m -2 h -1 to 4.2 mu mol m -2 h -1 , and ANR decreased from 11.85x10 3 t yr - 1 to 1.17x10 3 t yr - 1 during the study years. N budget analysis suggested that the amount of N removed by denitrification accounted for 23.3 % of the external load in 2007, but decreased to only 4.0 % in 2022. Thus, the contribution of N removal by internal N cycling decreased significantly as water quality improved. Notably, the proportion of ANR in winter to total ANR increased from 14 % in 2007 to 23 % in 2022 due to warming. This could potentially lead to N deficiencies in spring and summer, thus limiting the availability of N to phytoplankton. A TN concentration of less than 1.0 mg L -1 in the lake and 1.5 mg L -1 in the inflowing lake zones in spring contribute to local N-limitation in Lake Taihu for cyanobacteria control. Our study revealed a general pattern that N removal efficiency decreases with improved water quality, which is instructive for eutrophic lakes in nitrogen management.					xu, hai/JEP-5422-2023; Zhang, Yunlin/N-5464-2014	Guangwei, Zhu/0000-0002-6718-8576; Zhang, Yunlin/0000-0002-3382-4570													0043-1354	1879-2448				JUN 1	2024	256								121565	10.1016/j.watres.2024.121565	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2024.121565		APR 2024						38581985					WOS:001224902900001
J	Baker, PD				Baker, PD			Role of akinetes in the development of cyanobacterial populations in the lower Murray River, Australia	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Planktonic populations and benthic resting stages (akinetes) of the common bloom-forming cyanobacteria Anabaena circinalis Rabenhorst and Anabaena flos-aquae f. flos-aquae (Lyngb.) Komarek were monitored in the Murray River near Nildottie and in adjacent floodplain wetlands (lagoons) from 1995 to 1997, to determine the extent of sporulation and the contribution of recruitment from the sediments to seasonal development of blooms. Physical and chemical characteristics of the water in the river and the lagoons were examined in relation to the succession of key life-cycle stages and growth. The warm, shallow lagoons supported considerably higher populations of Anabaena in the summer than did the river, with correspondingly higher incidence of sporulation. Viable akinetes were abundant in the sediments of both the river channel and the lagoons, providing a potentially significant inoculum for cyanobacterial growth. The apparent germination of akinetes early in summer and immediately following sporulation in mid summer indicated a strategy for both initiation and maintenance of populations. A. circinalis also persisted as a planktonic population throughout winter. Germination is considered more likely to occur in the shallow lagoons than in the main channel, principally because of frequent resuspension of sediments containing resting stages to the euphotic zone or because of direct penetration of light to the sediments.																			1323-1650						1999	50	3					265	279		10.1071/MF98090	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF98090													WOS:000079447200011
J	Çelik, K				Celik, Kemal			The Relationships between Chlorophyll-a Dynamics, Certain Physical and Chemical Variables in the Temperate Eutrophic Caygoren Reservoir, Turkey	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCES												The Caygoren Reservoir was sampled monthly from February 2007 to January 2009 at three stations to determine the relationships between the chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) dynamics and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N), ammonium-nitrogen (NH4-N), water discharge, water transparency, water temperature (T), specific conductance (SC) and pH. Thermal stratification occurred in the reservoir from May to September. The maximum chlorophyll-a concentrations were measured (using a YSI multi probe) in the fall and the minimu, SRP and NO3-N were significant among seasons (P<0.01), but not among sampling stations (p>0.01). The differences in the Secchi disk transparency were significant both among sampling stations and seasons (P<0.05). The results of this study suggest that high chl-a concentrations resulted from the increase in available light in the spring and deep mixing in the fall which provided nutrients needed for phytoplankton growth.

The purpose of this research is to determine spatiotemporal distributions of some physicochemical variables in water column (temperature, salinity, pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, NH4-N, NO2-N, NO3-N, oPO(4)-P, TPO4-P, chlorophyll-a, total suspended solids) and sediment (TN, TC, TOC, TP) and their relationships at coastal stations. In the water column, nitrate and phosphate concentrations showed seasonal variations with high values recorded in winter period. Ammonium was determined as a main source of TIN component. During summer period, a large amount of total phosphorus was found as dissolved organic form. However, in the winter period, inorganic phosphate levels increased at sampling stations. N limitation was a common feature throughout the lake where P-limitation was only observed in summer period. The total phosphorus levels which showed hypereutrophic condition at the western part of the lake changed between 1.55 and 4.99 mu M and did not remain in the range for uncontaminated condition. In the lake sediment, a strong relationship was found between TOC and TC levels. Generally, the mean TOC concentrations constitute small amount of TC values in the sampling stations. The results also indicated that a strong correlation exists between TOC and TN values, and TN was greatly regulated by organic sources. In the lake, TOC: TN ratios changed between 5 and 13; the ratio greater than 10 could be an indicator of algal and land plant sources mixing as an organic matter.

J	Dokulil, MT				Dokulil, Martin T.			Predicting summer surface water temperatures for large Austrian lakes in 2050 under climate change scenarios	HYDROBIOLOGIA					3rd European Large Lakes Symposium	SEP, 2012	Lake Constance, GERMANY					Long-term data on surface water temperature (SWT) from 9 lakes larger than 10 km(2) located in different climatic regions in Austria were analysed for June-September 1965-2009. The lakes are situated north and south of the Alps, in the east bordering Hungary and in the west bordering Germany. Time series of air temperature (AT) and SWT were smoothed by the lowess function and linear trends. Water temperature for the year 2050 was estimated from (1) linear extrapolation of the time trend, (2) projection of the AT-SWT relation and (3) increase of average present day SWT (2000-2009) by 3A degrees C in summer in the Alps as expected from models by climatologists. Results indicate a rise in SWT parallel to AT since the mid-1960s. On an annual basis, changes in water temperature were the greatest in spring and summer. A conservative estimate of the average increase of summer SWT until 2050 is 2A degrees C (1.2-2.9A degrees C), differentiated by region. As a consequence of warming water temperatures, the duration of thermal stratification will increase and mixing and retention time will be affected. Changes in the food web are difficult to forecast, but will strongly depend on local environmental conditions and will therefore be different for individual lakes.

Seasonal and long-term changes in fishing depth of Lake Constance whitefish	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												P>The ecosystem of Lake Constance in central Europe has undergone profound modifications over the last six decades. Seasonal and inter-annual changes in the vertical distribution patterns of whitefish were examined and related to changes in biotic and abiotic gradients. Between 1958 and 2007, the average fishing depth in late summer and autumn was related to two factors influencing food supply of whitefish - lake productivity and standing stock biomass. In years with low food supply, whitefish were harvested from greater depths, where temperatures were up to 4 degrees C lower. The whitefish's distribution towards colder water might be a bioenergetic optimisation behaviour whereby fish reduce metabolic losses at lower temperatures, or it may result from a reassessment of habitat preference under conditions of limited food supply, according to the ideal free distribution theory.

J	Morley, DW; Leng, MJ; Mackay, AW; Sloane, HJ				Morley, DW; Leng, MJ; Mackay, AW; Sloane, HJ			Late glacial and Holocene environmental change in the Lake Baikal region documented by oxygen isotopes from diatom silica	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE					Joint Assembly of the EGS/AGU/EUG	APR 06-11, 2003	Nice, FRANCE	EGS, AGU, EUG				We investigate late glacial and Holocene climate change recorded in Lake Baikal using the oxygen isotope composition of diatom silica (delta O-18(DIAT)). Evaporation from the lake is minor, and the temperature fractionations of delta O-18 are unable to explain variations in the delta O-18(DIAT) record alone. Isotopically, low meltwater input from glaciers may have some influence on delta O-18(DIAT), but the assumed periods of climatic warming and wastage do not coincide with large shifts in delta O-18(DIAT). There is a gradual oxygen isotope lowering from 27.0 parts per thousand to 20.6 parts per thousand over the late glacial, while, during the Holocene, delta O-18(DIAT) values return to relatively high values. Previous studies of the modem oxygen and hydrogen isotope composition of Lake Baikal's inputs reveal that fluvial input to the lake's North Basin are isotopically lower than fluvial input from South Basin rivers. This north-south gradient of river delta O-18 and delta D is mainly due to the greater input from isotopically low winter precipitation in the north and isotopically higher summer precipitation in the south. As a result, the delta O-18(DIAT) record from Lake Baikal can at least in part be explained by varying input from these sources related to seasonal changes in precipitation. Changes in atmospheric conditions may have a role in altering seasonality and the distribution of precipitation over Lake Baikal's catchment. A feedback mechanism is well known linking higher Eurasian spring snow cover extent (ESSC) to the development of anticyclonic conditions and low precipitation the following summer in the areas south of Lake Baikal. A simultaneous increase in the importance of depleted water (snowmelt) input from the north and decreased enriched summer precipitation in the south is needed to explain depletions in delta O-18 of lake water and subsequently delta O-18(DIAT) during colder periods. The opposite of this situation is required to enrich lake water during warmer periods. The analysis of delta O-18 from diatom silica is a useful proxy for environmental change, especially in lakes, like Lake Baikal, where carbonates are absent or diluted. However, analysis must be based on near pure diatom samples as even trace amounts of silt can have a dominating effect on delta O-18(DIAT) values. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Diet niche relationships among predator and prey fish species in their early life stages in Lake Vortsjarv (Estonia)	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												In Lake Vortsjarv pikeperch was observed not to shift to piscivory in their first autumn of life, although juvenile stages of a variety of fish species were abundant in the lake. It was hypothesized that the diets of predator and prey fish fry overlap and that coarse fish species are important food competitors for juvenile piscivores and thus, pikeperch and perch fry do not shift to piscivory during their first growing season. To discover the possible linkages in this pattern, in 2009 the feeding relationships of pikeperch, perch, ruffe and roach fry were analysed. The stomach content analyses showed that in the summer period, Mesocyclops leuckarti was the most frequent prey for perch and ruffe, pikeperch consumed Leptodora kindti in large quantities, and roach ate mostly plant material. Towards autumn, M. leuckarti was the most abundant prey for all percids. However, average stomach content weight and the number of prey items eaten by ruffe were considerably higher than for other fish fry. Since the feeding opportunities of fish fry are considered poor in the examined lake, the prey has the potential to restrict the recruitment to piscivory of their predators, as prey fish seem to have better abilities to persist in this ecosystem. Furthermore, supposed competition in the juvenile stage may result in a reduced top-down effect on coarse fish.

HYDROBIOLOGIA					1st international conference on Challenges in Aquatic Sciences	MAR 15-21, 2013	Keelung, TAIWAN					This study aimed to evaluate whether hatchery-reared Siniperca chuatsi (HSC) competes significantly with wild Siniperca populations in a shallow lake. Two wild Siniperca fishes, S. chuatsi and Siniperca kneri, along with HSC, were collected in the shallow Biandantang Lake, and their diets were determined using both stomach contents and stable isotope analyses. The stomach contents showed that shrimps and fish were the major food items of HSC and wild Siniperca fishes, but their dietary composition and percentage contribution revealed significant differences. Isotopic mixing model analysis suggested similar conclusions that contribution proportions of end members were significantly different. The niche overlap index on the basis of prey importance from stomach content analysis indicated that there was not significant diet overlap between hatchery-reared and wild Siniperca populations in winter and summer. Similar results were found in winter based on the prey contributions from isotopic mixing model outputs, but meaningful diet overlap was observed in summer. Our findings demonstrated that HSC did not have apparent feeding competition with wild Siniperca fishes during the critical periods of the early stocking stages, suggesting that moderate stocking of HSC may not have a negative effect on the variability of wild Siniperca populations.

Periphytic diatom communities in tributaries around Lake Ichkeul, northern Tunisia: a preliminary assessment	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												An initial inventory of diatom biodiversity at 12 sites draining into Lake Ichkeul, northern Tunisia, was performed in summer 2014, together with the characterisation of metal pollution status by analysing trace metal concentrations to determine Water Quality Indices. The maximum values of Fe, Mn, Sb, Zn, Cu and Pb were all below the national and international standard, except for Fe in Hammam Ben Abbes thermal spring and Sb in Wadi Tinja, indicating that the surface water of the Ichkeul basin was largely acceptable. Diatom community composition and specific descriptors, including quantification of morphological alterations and mortality, were used to diagnose environmental stress. High abundances of Achnanthidium minutissimum (Kutzing) Czarnecki were observed at the Fe-rich site, which could reflect a response to metal contamination. Diatoms were stressed mostly by the influence of temperature and salinity, which drove species composition and increased mortality. Further research is required on the ecology of diatoms in Ichkeul thermal springs. The use of diatoms as indicators of ecosystem health in the Ichkeul area requires additional knowledge of diatom diversity in the ecoregion.

J	Patterson, WP				Patterson, WP			North American continental seasonality during the last millennium: high-resolution analysis of sagittal otoliths	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												delta(18)O((CaCO3)) values of late Holocene sagittal fish otoliths from Lake Erie provide a record of seasonal temperature variation for mid-western North America. Freshwater drum (Aplodinotus grunniens) sagittal otoliths obtained from Paleo-Indian middens, ranging in age from approximate to A.D. 985 to A.D. 1530 as well as a recent specimen, were sampled at a resolution representing lime-averaging of as little as 3-5 days to estimate seasonal climatic variation over the last thousand years. Regional differences in climate, as well as asynchronous variation inferred by comparison with historical records of Europe, Greenland and Iceland, suggest that the climate trends of eastern North America may not always correspond to those of Europe or even the North Atlantic. Results suggest that summer temperatures of the Laurentian Great Lakes region at the beginning of the millennium were 2-6 degrees C warmer, while winter temperatures may have been nearly 2 degrees C cooler than the 20th century average. By the late 1200s, summer temperatures decreased to nearly modern values. In the 1400s and through the 1500s, summer maxima exhibited enhanced intra-annual variation as well as temperatures which were as much as 8 degrees C cooler, while winter temperatures were 0.4-2.7 degrees C warmer than 20th century values. An additional outcome of this research is the estimation of lake water delta(18)O values for several time periods throughout the Holocene. Mean annual temperatures inferred from delta(18)O((H2O)) values display a decrease from A.D. 985 through at least A.D. 1530, concomitant with summer temperature trends. The long residence time of these large lakes suggests that secular trends in delta(18)O values must represent lone-term variation in climate which can be used in concert with the short-term, high-resolution temperature record for a comprehensive estimation of climatic trends. Temperature variation and paleohydrology of the Great Lakes region is discussed in terms of variation in storm tracks and source region with time. delta(18)O values of lake water coupled with paleotemperature data suggest that changing climate is the result of secular variation in the position. shape. and strength of the circumpolar vortex.

Thermokarst Lakes on the Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska: Spatial and Temporal Variability in Summer Water Temperature	PERMAFROST AND PERIGLACIAL PROCESSES												In summer 2010, water temperature profile measurements were made in 12 thermokarst lakes along a 150-km long northsouth transect across the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska. In shallow lakes, gradual warming of the water column to 14 degrees C begins at the lake bed during decay of the ice cover in spring. Rapid warming follows ice-off, with water temperature responding synchronously to synoptic weather variations across the area. Regionally, ice-off occurs 24 weeks later on lakes near the coast. Inland lakes are warmer (13 degrees C) in mid-summer than those near the coast (7 degrees C), reflecting the regional climate gradient and the maritime effect. All lakes are well mixed and largely isothermal, with some thermal stratification (< 2 degrees C) occurring during calm, sunny periods in deeper lakes. In deep (69 m) lake-bed depressions that are likely ice-wedge troughs, water cools by conduction to the colder sediments below, while concurrent warming occurs in the upper water column. A spatially dense sample of near-surface temperature measurements was collected from one lake over a short period and shows warmer (23 degrees C) temperatures on the upwind, sheltered end of the lake.

J	Spooner, DR; Maher, W				Spooner, D. R.; Maher, W.			Benthic sediment composition and nutrient cycling in an Intermittently Closed and Open Lake Lagoon	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Surfical sediments within Corunna Lake, a moderate size Intermittently Closed and Open Lake Lagoon (ICOLL), were examined for solid phase nutrient concentrations (TN, TP, TOC,) and solute exchange rates between the sediment and water column (O-2, NO3-N, NH4-N, FRP, and N-2). The surfical sediments in Corunna Lake contained high concentrations of TN (5 mg/g dry mass), total phosphorus (0.6 mg/g dry mass), and TOC (-5% dry mass). The carbon stable isotope ratio (delta C-13) and TOC:TN ratios (delta C-13 similar to -24, TOC:TN similar to 11-14) demonstrated that the composition of the organic matter in the sediment was a mixture derived primarily of degraded planktonic matter. The close association between TP and Fe concentrations highlighted the potential role Fe plays in mediating Filterable Reactive Phosphorus (FRP) concentrations in the water column of Corunna Lake. In situ benthic chamber incubations were used to measure benthic fluxes. Solute exchange rates between the sediment and water column in Corunna Lake were similar to other reported studies (O-2=-469 to -1765 mu mol m(-2) h(-1), NH4-N=0.1-63 mu mol m(-2) h(-1), NO2/NO3-N=0 mu mol m(-2) h(-1), FRP=-4-1.6 mu mol m(-2) h(-1) land N-2 = 12-356 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)). As more carbon was deposited and mineralized the efficiency of the bacterial population to denitrify nitrogen in the sediment decreases. The linkage between land use and benthic biogeochemistry was also explored. A dairy farm exists in the middle catchment of Corunna Lake, and the receiving bay sediment consistently demonstrated the highest oxygen consumption rates in winter and spring (-1408 mu mol m(-2) h(-1) in winter, -1691 mu mol m(-2) h(-1) in spring) and lowest denitrification efficiencies during summer (similar to 3%). Nitrate/nitrite fluxes were not observed during any of the chamber incubations, with the concentrations of nitrate/nitrite being below detection limits (< 10 mu g/L). Seasonal changes influenced the rates of solute exchange between the sediment and water column. Critical measures of solute exchange for NH4-N and biogenic N-2 indicated that seasonal temperature changes play a significant role in mediating the reaction rates of sedimentary based biogeochemical processes. Measurable FRP fluxes were small but greater in the benthic sediments which received higher carbon inputs. Sediments have a high capacity to adsorb P which is released as sediment oxygen demand increases as a result of increases in labile carbon loads. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS) allows rapid assessment of OM-rich samples and has proven a useful tool for peat, lacustrine and marine deposits, but is rarely applied specifically to lake environments prone to the formation of varves (annually laminated sediments), which are used frequently for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. We applied Py-GC-MS to a 3.5 yr record of sediment trap samples collected from Nylandssjon in northern Sweden to determine the usefulness of the method for improving knowledge of OM dynamics in varved lakes. It appeared that seasonal variation controlled the pyrolysis fingerprints: intact polysaccharides and lignin from vascular plants, chitin from arthropods and chlorophyll from algae were concentrated in spring and summer traps, whereas winter trap samples were enriched mainly in degraded components, as OM slowly trickled down under a thick layer of ice. A secondary diagenetic process involving sulfurisation of phytadienes was recognised via isoprenoid thiophenes, with no clear seasonal trend, probably because it occurred under anoxic conditions at the lake bottom. The N-containing compounds from proteins in algae and chitin in arthropods were abundant in all samples, indicating that the dominant flux of varve OM was autochthonous in origin. We conclude that Py-GC-MS has significant potential for identifying the variability in parent material (source organisms and degradation state) and could become a valuable tool for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction from varved lake sediments.

Pintail and mallard survival in California relative to habitat, abundance, and hunting	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												The influence of habitat, waterfowl abundance, and hunting on winter survival of waterfowl is not well understood. We studied late August-March survival of 163 after-hatch-year (AHY) and 128 hatch-year (HY) female mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) radiotagged in Sacramento Valley (SACV) and 885 AHY female northern pintails (A. acuta) radiotagged throughout the Central Valley of California, USA, relative to flooded habitat (HAB), January abundance of each species (JMAL or JPIN), hunter-days (HDY), and a hunting pressure index (HPI) that combined these variables. From EARLY (1987-1994) to LATE (1998-2000), HAB increased 39%, JPIN increased 45%, JMAL increased 53%, HDY increased 21%, duck-hunting season increased from 59 days to 100 days, and the female daily bag limit doubled to 2 for mallards but remained 1 for pintails. Survival (+/- SE) was greater during LATE versus EARLY for pintails radiotagged in each region (SACV: 93.2 +/- 2.1% vs. 87.6 +/- 3.0%; Suisun Marsh: 86.6 +/- 3.2% vs. 77.0 +/- 3.7%; San Joaquin Valley: 86.6 +/- 3.1% vs. 76.9 1 +/- 4.1%) but not for SACV mallards (AHY: 70.6 +/- 7.2% to 74.4 +/- 7.7% vs. 80.1 +/- 7.2% to 82.8 +/- 5.6%; HY: 48.7 +/- 9.1% [1999-2000 only] vs. 63.5 +/- 8.8% to 67.6 +/- 8.0%). Most pintail (72%) and mallard (91%) deaths were from hunting, and lower HPI and higher JPIN or JMAL were associated with reduced mortality. Increased HAB was associated with reduced winter mortality for pintails but not for SACV mallards. Pintail survival rates that we measured were within the range reported for other North American wintering areas, and during LATE were higher than most, even though our study duration was 68-110 days longer. Winter survival rates of SACV mallards were also within the reported range. However, with higher bag limits and longer seasons, mallard survival during LATE was lower than in most other wintering areas, especially during 1999-2000, when high winds on opening weekend resulted in high hunting mortality. Habitat conservation and favorable agriculture practices helped create a Central Valley wintering environment where natural mortality of mallards and pintails was low and survival varied with hunting mortality. We recommend regulations and habitat management that continue to minimize natural mortality while allowing sustainable harvest at a level that helps maintain strong incentive for management of Central Valley waterfowl habitats, including the large portion that is privately owned.						casazza, Mike/0000-0002-5636-735X													0022-541X					SEP	2007	71	7					2238	2248		10.2193/2005-634	http://dx.doi.org/10.2193/2005-634													WOS:000249351100017

This article used correlation analysis and redundancy analysis (RDA) combined with the community turnover index (BC) to analyze the phytoplankton functional groups. The results showed that 7 phyla and 68 genera of phytoplankton were identified in the water body, of which Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta, Cyanobacteria, Chrysophyta, Euglenophyta, Cryptophyta, and Pyrrophyta accounted for 34%, 32%, 16%, 6%, 4%, 4%, and 3%, respectively. The phytoplankton in the water body was classified into 23 functional groups, of which MP and D functional groups were the long-term dominant functional groups, indicating that the habitat is a turbid water body. The ecological state index (Q) value ranged from 1.94 to 3.13, with an average value of 2.74. The comprehensive nutritional index (TSIM( n-ary sumation )) was between 49.32 and 52.11, with an average value of 51.72, indicating that Nanhai Lake was in a mesotrophic state. Correlation analysis and redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that multiple nutrients, transparency (SD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), water temperature (WT), and Chlorophyll a (Chl-a) were the main environmental factors affecting the biomass of dominant functional groups in the water body. The study showed the characteristics of the functional groups of algae in a precious urban lake in arid and semi-arid areas of China and their relationship with environmental factors (physical and chemical indicators, anions and cation ions, and heavy metal ions), and provided a scientific basis for its water quality evaluation.					; Guo, Ziqing/NYT-2955-2025	gong, donghui/0000-0003-1487-3331; 														1424-2818				NOV	2022	14	11							927	10.3390/d14110927	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d14110927													WOS:000882641900001

On the basis of instrumental records, previous studies have shown that the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) and summer monsoon (EASM) interact with each other. However, owing to the lack of long-term high-resolution EAWM records, it remains unclear how and whether human activity has affected the phase relationship between the EASM and EAWM since the Industrial Revolution. In this study, we present a precisely dated high-resolution EAWM record for the last 300 years from a crater lake in northeastern China. Our results indicate that the EAWM intensity was relatively weak and fluctuated significantly between 1700 and 1850 CE. After 1850 CE, the EAWM strengthened rapidly and exceeded its intensity observed at the end of the Little Ice Age. In addition, a comparison of our reconstructed EAWM record with the published EASM record clearly shows in-phase variations during the Current Warm Period. We concluded that the climatic effects of industrially induced warming enhance the EAWM by slowing the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and increasing the meridional temperature gradient, while also strengthening the EASM by increasing hemispheric meridional gradients and affecting other large-scale processes. Under the sustained intensification of human activity, the EASM and EAWM are likely to continue exhibiting synchronous variations in the future.

Meta-transcriptomic analyses revealed that expressions of genes involved in N-2-fixation (nifDKH) and P-scavenging were significantly upregulated during the bloom compared to pre-bloom in Harsha Lake. The activities of N-2-fixation occurred during early summer after a late spring phytoplankton bloom, and were associated with high phosphorus and low nitrogen. The highly active cyanobacterial N-2-fixers were dominated by Nostoc and Anabaena. Following the activities of N-2-fixation and production of new nitrogen, an early summer Microcystis-dominated bloom, a shift of dominance from Nostoc and Anabaena to Microcystis and an increase of microcystin and saxitoxin occurred. By contrast, P-scavenging activities dominated also by Nostoc and Anabaena were associated with low P and the Microcystis bloom. This information can be used to aid in the understanding the impact that nitrogen and phosphorus have on the early summer CyanoHAB and the functional activities of Nostoc- and Anabaena-dominated or Microcystis-dominated communities, and aid in making management decisions related to harmful algal blooms.

J	Hu, P; Cheng, JB; Fen, GL; Dogar, MMA; Gong, ZQ				Hu, Po; Cheng, Jianbo; Fen, Guolin; Dogar, Muhammad Mubashar Ahmad; Gong, Zhiqiang			The mechanism of EAP-EU combined impact on summer rainfall over North Asia	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												This article uses wave activity flux and sea surface temperature (SST) to explore the mechanism of EAP-EU combined impact on summer rainfall in North Asia (NA). EAP and EU teleconnections can be divided into four categories of configuration according to their anomaly phase features. The category I (II) configurations cause rainfall in the Urals and the Okhotsk Sea and the region from Northeast China to Japan being less (more), the Lake Baikal to the Okhotsk Sea being more (less), which leads to the summer rainfall in NA mainly presenting the "- + -" ("+ - +") a tripole wavelike structure. Category I (II) configurations also show the West-East reverse anomalies of summer rainfall in northern NA and the North-South opposite anomalies in eastern NA. The EAP and EU teleconnections have an obvious correlation with the ENSO-like pattern of SST anomalies over the tropical Pacific. When warm ENSO is in the development phase, it is conducive to stimulate Rossby waves propagating eastward from the North Atlantic Ocean via the PNA teleconnection, forming the EU teleconnection across the Eurasia continent. Meanwhile, the warm summer SSTA anomalies over tropical east Pacific and IMC are conducive to the local thermal convective over Indo-Pacific warm pool and motivate the EAP teleconnection, propagating northward to mid-high latitude region. EAP and the EU teleconnections overlapped with each other, form the tripole atmospheric structure in NA, and produce relevant rainfall anomaly patterns. For the category IV of EAP-EU configuration, the warm SST anomalies in the equatorial region gradually weaken from previous winter to summer. Weak tropical east Pacific SST anomalies are conducive to excite the EU teleconnection with different wave train features against the category II, presenting a strong positive anomaly center over the Ural mountain and Baikal lake. This positive center connected with the EAP caused positive anomalies over FER resulting in the dipole pattern of atmospheric and rainfall anomalies in the summer season. The condition is opposite for the category III (I) configuration against that of category IV (II). It is also found that the influence on EAP-EU configuration caused by ENSO-like pattern of SST anomalies over the tropical Pacific has an obvious asymmetric feature that category II (I) configuration relevant SST forcing is much significant than that of category IV(III) configuration.

The cluster analysis of DGGE profiles revealed that the buoyant Microcystis colony associates collected in summer and winter were clustered together and were distinct from settling particle-associated and free-living bacteria. In contrast, the bacterial communities of the latter two populations collected in summer were clustered together and varied from those collected in winter. The diversity indices of the Microcystis-associated bacterial population were significantly lower than those of the other two bulk bacterial communities (P < 0.05). Clone library analysis revealed that no shared operational taxonomic units were found in the three populations. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that buoyant Microcystis-associated bacteria were distinct from the other communities and that they were dominated by Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria. Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria were prevalent in all three habitats. Other bacterial taxa such as Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia, Gemmatimonadetes and Acidobacteria were associated with settling particles and with the water column. Buoyant Microcystis colonies, settling particles and the water column in the eutrophic lake are thus inhabited by different bacterial flora. In addition, specific bacterial communities are associated with buoyant Microcystis colonies.					yu, yang/HIZ-9682-2022														1758-2229					DEC	2012	4	6					669	678		10.1111/1758-2229.12001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1758-2229.12001								23760939					WOS:000311057000012

Features of Thermohaline Structure and Circulation in Lake Issyk-Kul	OCEANOLOGY												Field measurements carried out over 4 years made it possible to establish previously unknown features of the thermohaline fields and circulation of Lake Issyk-Kul. The most detailed salinity distribution maps for the entire history of observations were constructed. An area of slightly increased salinity was found in the central part of the lake, the specific "dipole" shape of which indicates the existence of not only a general cyclonic circulation, but also two separate gyres of a smaller, subbasin scale (which is partially confirmed by direct current velocity measurements). It has been established that, generally speaking, the salinity fields in Lake Issyk-Kul are extraordinarily conservative: its interannual and seasonal changes, as well as spatial variability throughout the lake (with the exception of estuarine regions), are usually measured only in hundredths of g kg(-1). An important result of the project is the discovery of a subsurface salinity maximum persisting from year to year at depths from 70 to 130 m. As shown on the basis of balance estimates and then confirmed by analysis of direct current velocity measurements, autumn-winter differential cooling leads to the fact that in canyons (i.e., paleoriver channels) in the eastern littoral region, a significant amount (up to 1 km(3)) of cold coastal waters freshened by river runoff enters the bottom layers of the central part of the lake. These waters are then mixed with the overlying more saline waters, which, in a situation where the upper layer of the lake is also desalinated by river runoff, leads to a salinity maximum at intermediate depths. Our measurements do not confirm manifestations of global warming in the form of an interdecadal temperature increase in the deeper layers of Lake Issyk-Kul, which was previously reported: the current (in 2018) temperature at a depth of 500 m exactly coincided with that noted in the 2003 measurements, namely, about 4.44 degrees C. However, one can point to a very weak (about 0.03 g kg(-1)) increase in the salinity of the bottom layer over the past 40 years.

Although object-based (OB) methods within Google Earth Engine (GEE) improve accuracy and output quality in contrast to pixel-based approaches, their application to crop classification remains relatively rare. Therefore, this study aimed to develop an OB classification methodology for crops located in central Italy's Lake Trasimeno area. This methodology employed spectral bands, spectral indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Modified Radar Vegetation Index), and textural information (Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix) derived from Sentinel-2 L2A (S2) and Sentinel-1 GRD (S1) data within the GEE platform. Moreover, European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) data associated with cadastral parcels were employed and served as ground information during the training and validation stages. The CAP crop classes were aggregated into three levels (Level 1-3 crop types, Level 2-5 crop types, and Level 3-7 crop types). Subsequently, optimized Random Forest (RF) classifiers were applied to map crops effectively. Feature selection analysis highlighted the importance of certain textural features. Additionally, findings demonstrated high overall accuracy results (89% for Level 1, 86% for Level 2, and 82% for Level 3). It was found that winter crops achieved the highest F-score at Level 1, while specific subclasses, such as winter cereals and warm-season cereals, excelled at Level 2. Overall, this study provides a promising approach for improved crop mapping and precision agriculture in the GEE environment.					; Acharki, Siham/HJH-0977-2022	Vizzari, Marco/0000-0002-4238-8897; Acharki, Siham/0000-0001-9421-0807													1009-5020	1993-5153				MAY 4	2025	28	3					815	830		10.1080/10095020.2024.2341748	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10095020.2024.2341748		APR 2024											WOS:001208243000001

HYDROBIOLOGIA												The mysid Limnomysis benedeni, one of the most important ponto-caspian invaders, was found in Lake Constance (southern Germany) in 2006. As part of larger studies to evaluate the effects of L. benedeni on the ecosystem, we studied its life-cycle strategies over an entire seasonal cycle in intervals of 3-5 weeks, addressing factors (predation, temperature) which we expected to be most important triggers of the observed changes. The size class distribution and the reproductive pattern indicated that the life cycle of L. benedeni changes seasonally. During winter (November to March), the mysid invested energy in growth and delayed reproduction until April, when the population was dominated by adults. In summer (June to September), the adults reproduced at a smaller body size and the population was disproportionately dominated by juveniles. In a mesocosm experiment that excluded fish predators, the mysids followed the same seasonal patterns of growth and energy investment as in the field population, but the size class distribution differed. Even in summer, the population in the mesocosm was dominated by adults. Stomach analyses of fish showed that L. benedeni is preyed upon by juvenile Perca fluviatilis, which fed size selectively on larger mysids. In conclusion, our results suggest predation was the reason for the dominance of juveniles and the observed size class distribution in summer. In contrast, the smaller adults in summer were most likely a physiological adaptation, perhaps evolved to avoid predation or as a reaction on metabolic losses at higher temperatures.					; Sahm (née Gergs), Rene/B-6962-2012	Sahm (nee Gergs), Rene/0000-0001-8806-265X; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2011	673	1					193	204		10.1007/s10750-011-0773-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-011-0773-6													WOS:000293162400015
J	Travnichek, VH; Maceina, MJ; Dunham, RA				Travnichek, VH; Maceina, MJ; Dunham, RA			Angling vulnerability of black crappies, white crappies, and their naturally produced hybrid in Weiss Reservoir, Alabama, USA	FISHERIES RESEARCH												We examined differences in angling vulnerability among black crappies Pomoxis nigromaculatus, white crappies Pomoxis annularis, and their naturally produced hybrid offspring in Weiss Reservoir, Alabama, USA, during spring and fall of 1992 and 1993. Proportions of crappie phenotypes (determined by starch-gel electrophoresis) in the reservoir were estimated from trapnet and electrofishing collections. We collected angled crappies from local resort owners and crappie tournaments during spring and fall 1992 and 1993 to determine relative proportions of crappie phenotypes in angler catch. The proportion of black crappies caught by anglers was higher (P < 0.05) and the proportion of white crappies caught by anglers was lower (P < 0.05) compared to their proportions in trapnet and electrofishing catches from the reservoir. Although first-generation (F-1) hybrids recruited to the minimum harvestable size (254 mm total length) earlier than either parental, these fish were not overly abundant in angler catches compared to their abundances in the reservoir. In fact, we found that in the fall of 1992 F-1 hybrid crappies were less abundant in angler catches compared with their abundances in the reservoir. Black crappies were more vulnerable to angling than the other phenotypes, yet the proportion of this species did not decrease over time, likely because of moderate rates of crappie exploitation in Weiss Reservoir. Results of this study suggest that stocking of hybrid crappies for sport fishing purposes may not be as beneficial as once thought because they do not always contribute to the sport fishery relative to their abundance.																			0165-7836					FEB	1997	29	2					185	191		10.1016/S0165-7836(96)00522-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0165-7836(96)00522-X													WOS:A1997WP90100007

Zooplankton diversity and distribution in a deep and anoxic Mediterranean coastal lake	MEDITERRANEAN MARINE SCIENCE												The variation of the smaller size fraction of zooplankton was investigated during a two-year period in a brackish deep and anoxic coastal lake of western Greece (Aitoliko), along with the specific environmental characteristics of this ecosystem. The zooplanktonic community comprised a relatively small number of taxa and it was dominated by brackish-water calanoid copepods (Paracartia latisetosa, Calanipeda aquaedulcis) and in certain periods by rotifers and tintinnids. The zooplankton abundance showed an increase in the warmer period starting from late spring and reached maximum values in July. In the well oxygenated surface layer, temperature was the most important parameter influencing the seasonal cycles of all groups. In contrast, the oxygen depletion a few meters under the surface affected the vertical distribution of most of the zooplankton groups, which were found restricted in the surface layer, especially from spring until autumn. Only the meroplanktonic larvae of polychaetes presented increased proportions in the deeper layers. Salinity has not significantly influenced the zooplanktonic assemblages. The results reveal the degraded status of the Aitoliko basin, where the hypoxic/anoxic layers resulted in a high portion of dead organic material identified as copepod carcasses; they also underline the necessity of monitoring this ecosystem.					; Ramfos, Alexis/AAK-8680-2021; Zacharias, Ierotheos/R-9672-2017	Ramfos, Alexis/0000-0001-5916-0509; Zacharias, Ierotheos/0000-0001-8410-6862													1108-393X					JUN	2013	14	1					179	192		10.12681/mms.332	http://dx.doi.org/10.12681/mms.332													WOS:000320294500022

Although Lake Superior populations have been less affected than those in other Great Lakes, these pop-ulations still face multiple threats. We characterized lake whitefish diets collected off the Keweenaw Peninsula between 2015 and 2017 and compared results to previous Lake Superior studies. We addition-ally estimated length-weight relationships to determine whether lake whitefish body condition (i.e., expected weight-at-length) had changed since the 1980s. Diet diversity was low, although individual specialization was moderate to high. Fish transitioned from consuming Diporeia in the spring to Mysis and fish eggs during fall and winter; sphaeriids composed 20-30% of diets across all seasons. Compared to findings for other Lake Superior regions, lake whitefish diets comprised lower percentages of high energy items (e.g., Diporeia, Mysis) and higher percentages of low energy items (e.g., sphaeriids). Expected weights in the 2000s and 2010s were lower in the 400-and 500-mm length groups but similar in larger lengths groups compared to the 1980s; condition was highest across all lengths in the 1990s. The observed decline in condition since the 1990s in the 400-and 500-mm length groups, in combination with possibly greater consumption of less energetically profitable items, suggests that lake whitefish <600 mm or preferred prey resources in this lake region may be experiencing stressors leading to condi-tion declines, although what these stressors are remain unknown.

Groundwater discharge rates and uncertainties in a coastal lagoon using a radon mass balance	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Coastal lagoons face anthropogenic pressures worldwide, and understanding groundwater discharge to these sensitive environments can enable better management of water budgets and nutrient inputs. The main objective of the study was to quantify groundwater seepage into a large and shallow coastal lagoon using a detailed radon (Rn-222, a natural groundwater tracer) mass balance. To assess and reduce uncertainty, three wind-speed scenarios were modelled in two seasons using two Rn-222-in-groundwater endmembers. Groundwater discharge to the lagoon ranged between 5.2 +/- 5.8 m(3)/s to 18.7 +/- 19.6 m(3)/s during summer and 0.9 +/- 2.2 m(3)/s to 8.1 +/- 10.5 m3/s during winter. Wind-driven radon evasion was the most influential component of the radon mass balance. Higher summer wind speeds resulted in groundwater discharge estimates 3.5 times greater than those during winter. We carried out an in-depth uncertainty analysis of the radon mass balance results, which confirmed the importance of accounting for individual uncertainties, particularly the most sensitive parameters of the model. Overall, results from the radon mass balance revealed groundwater discharge to the lagoon was 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than previous localised seepage meter estimates. This is likely because radon tracer approaches quantify both one-directional discharge and bi-directional porewater exchange at a larger spatial scale than traditional seepage meter methods. In spite of large uncertainties, the possible range of reasonable estimates revealed groundwater seepage as an important component of the water budget at this site. This study highlights the benefits of broad-scale tracer-based mass balances for quantifying groundwater discharge to coastal lagoons and the value of in-depth uncertainty analysis to increase confidence in seepage flux estimates.

Ruby; Gustafson, William I., Jr.			Evaluation of regional climate simulations over the Great Lakes region driven by three global data sets	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The performance of regional climate simulations is evaluated for the Great Lakes region. Three 10-year (1990-1999) current-climate simulations are performed using the MM5 regional climate model (RCM) with 36-km horizontal resolution. The simulations employed identical configuration and physical parameterizations, but different lateral boundary conditions and sea-surface temperatures derived from the NCEP Global Reanalysis and output from the CCSM3 and GISS general circulation models (GCMs). The simulation results are compared to the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR). The three RCM simulations appeared to be more accurate in winter and least accurate in summer, and more accurate aloft than near the surface. The reanalysis-constrained simulation adequately captured the spatial distribution and seasonal cycle of the observed surface-air temperature and precipitation, but it produced consistently across all seasons a cold bias that is generally larger over the lakes than over land and a wet bias due to an overestimation of non-convective precipitation. The simulated seasonal cycle of moisture-flux convergence over the region was in very good agreement with NARR. The two GCM-driven runs adequately simulated the spatial and seasonal variation of temperature, but overestimated cold-season precipitation and underestimated summer precipitation, reversing the observed annual precipitation cycle. The GISS-driven run failed to simulate the prevailing low-level flow and moisture convergence patterns. All three RCM simulations successfully captured the impact of the Great Lakes on the region's climate, especially on winter precipitation, a significant improvement over coarse-resolution GCM simulations over the region.

J	Wong, JB; Brinke, T; Briedis, M; Hahn, S				Wong, Joanna B.; Brinke, Tomas; Briedis, Martins; Hahn, Steffen			Unexpected variation in migration routes and nonbreeding residency of Tree Pipits (Anthus trivialis) from a central European breeding population	JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												The natural history of migration comprises a set of population-specific ecological and flexible traits, that will undergo fundamental changes under current climate alterations, but basic features remain undiscovered for many species and populations. Here, we provide the first spatiotemporal annual cycle information of individual Tree Pipits (Anthus trivialis), one of the most common long-distance African-Palearctic migrants. Male pipits from Czechia showed a large variation in migration routes and African nonbreeding residence sites. In autumn, birds crossed the Mediterranean basin over a wide range from its western to eastern part to reach nonbreeding sites in West Africa, Nigeria, and the Lake Chad area. Nonbreeding residence period lasted on average 160 days, wherein 28% of males showed site itinerancy of 100 km and 400 km between overwintering sites. Northbound spring migration routes differed entirely or in the North-African European portion from autumn (post-breeding) routes, resulting in seasonally different passage regions. Departure periods from the breeding sites in autumn and the nonbreeding sites in spring spanned over a 1.5- and 1 month period, respectively. Migration duration per bird in spring lasted 20 days (median) which was 61% shorter than the duration of autumn migration (median: 52 days). Our study shows that Tree Pipits from a single breeding population pass through and reside across vast areas and thus, experience a wide array of environmental conditions outside their breeding season. To establish a causal link between environmental conditions and the population trajectory of Tree Pipits, further tracking information are required especially from northern and eastern European breeding populations.

Concentration of Ti, abundance of CaCO3, Zr/Ti ratio and TOC/Ti ratio were compared with their average values to infer variations in runoff, lake water salinity, transportation of clastic minerals by aeolian activity and total organic productivity. In general, conditions were wetter during similar to 9.6-5.7 ka (early-middle Holocene) and similar to 2.2-0.7 ka (late Holocene) compared to similar to 5.7-2.2 ka (middle-late Holocene). Transportation of above-average amounts of Zr-bearing clastic minerals from an arid watershed and deposition of the highest abundance of CaCO3 at similar to 3.5-2.8 ka occurred within the drier interval of middle-late Holocene. Except for the interval of similar to 2.2-0.7 ka, the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) controlled summer precipitation forced the hydrological variations. The Etzatlan-Magdalena Basin remained wet and some sites in central Mexico were dry over a large part of similar to 2.2-0.7 ka. The activity of tropical cyclones and frontal systems may have increased in the northeastern Pacific during this interval of enhanced ENSO. Either of them, or the combination of both, possibly contributed more autumn and winter precipitation to western-central Mexico.					; P, Dr.Gopinathan/O-2348-2018	Roy, Priyadarsi D./0000-0003-3284-8762; Lozano Santacruz, Rufino/0000-0002-6341-8039; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				DEC 1	2017	487						149	157		10.1016/j.palaeo.2017.08.029	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2017.08.029													WOS:000414881100012

FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Trophic interactions can influence the flux of energy and nutrients between donor and recipient ecosystems, thereby altering recipient food webs and communities. We investigated the potential for anadromous alewife to influence filter-feeding insects in lake outflow streams by altering seston and zooplankton export from lakes to streams through size-selective consumption of zooplankton in lakes. We compared spring and summer zooplankton biomass and body size and seston concentration in 6 lakes and their respective outflow streams (3 with alewife access, 3 without alewife access) in Maine, USA. The contribution of seston particles >= 500-mu m and mean pelagic zooplankton size decreased from spring to summer in alewife lakes, but not in lakes without alewife. However, we found no seasonal change in zooplankton body size and seston >= 500-mu m in the outflow streams of alewife lakes. Furthermore, zooplankton biomass and seston concentration differed between lakes and streams, a result indicating the influence of additional factors on seston movement from lakes to streams. Last, we found no relationship between filter-feeder biomass or community structure and seston quantity, a result indicating that stream communities probably were not strongly regulated by seston availability. Our results illustrate that strong trophic interactions may not be propagated from lakes to streams and suggest the importance of boundaries in modulating the extent to which trophic interactions in one ecosystem can influence the flow of energy to adjacent ecosystems.					; Simon, Kevin/CAH-1516-2022	Simon, Kevin/0000-0002-9537-2450; Demi, Lee/0000-0002-3085-8214													2161-9549	2161-9565				SEP	2012	31	3					973	985		10.1899/11-124.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1899/11-124.1													WOS:000309905100022

Data exist for 25 full years and for 7 additional partial years between 1919 and 1963. There has been a consistent increase in the average quantity of phytoplankton. The vernal and autumnal phytoplankton maxima have consistently become more intense and have lasted longer. The periods of minimum phytoplankton development in winter and summer have become shorter and less well marked, until the winter minimum failed to develop at all in some of the latest years. Certain marked qualitative changes also have occurred. These effects are thought to have been caused by an increasingly rapid eutrophication of the water in Lake Erie.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1964	9	3					275	283		10.4319/lo.1964.9.3.0275	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1964.9.3.0275													WOS:A1964WU66000001

Winter distributional overlap facilitates lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) piscivory on invasive round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus) in Green Bay, Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												The prevalence of round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) in the diet of lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) >350mm total length was investigated during winter, when round gobies occupy deeper water and have distributional overlap with lake whitefish. On average, round gobies were the most important diet item (46.6% by dry weight), followed by nonmollusk benthic invertebrates (21.3%) and unidentifiable fish parts (10.6%). Of whitefish that contained food, round gobies were the most frequently occurring diet item (49% occurrence); 44.3% of whitefish examined had empty stomachs. Although lake whitefish are not generally considered piscivores, altered lake whitefish diets have been observed during a recent period of high lake whitefish density and reduced abundance of historically important prey like Diporeia spp., which declined in the Great Lakes following the invasion of Dreissena polymorpha and D. bugensis. There is evidence that fish provide an important summer diet item for lake whitefish in some areas of the Great Lakes, and our study suggests round gobies are also an important component of lake whitefish diets during winter.

J	Hodell, DA; Schelske, CL				Hodell, DA; Schelske, CL			Production, sedimentation, and isotopic composition of organic matter in Lake Ontario	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Organic matter and its carbon and nitrogen isotopic composition were measured in sequential sediment trap and core samples from the Rochester Basin of Lake Ontario to evaluate their usefulness in reconstructing historic changes in lake productivity. The greatest flux of organic matter from the epilimnion occurred during late summer and coincided with whiting events, indicating that calcite precipitation is an effective mechanism for sedimenting organic matter. Carbon isotopes of organic matter were low prior to the onset of stratification, increased to maximum values in late summer, and then decreased following fall overturn. This pattern is controlled mainly by the timing of stratification and primary productivity, which preferentially removes (CO2)-C-12 from the epilimnion. The physiological effect of decreased carbon isotopic fractionation with decreasing supplies of [CO2](aq) may have also contributed to increased delta(13)C(orgC). Nitrogen isotopes showed a seasonal pattern opposite to that of carbon, whereby delta(15)N values were low during the summer stratified period and high for the remainder of the year. Seasonal variability in delta(15)N(orgN) probably reflects changes in the source of sedimented organic particles, which is dominated by isotopically depleted phytodetritus during the stratified period and isotopically enriched organic matter from heterotrophic or detrital sources during the mixed period. A comparison of organic carbon accumulation rates and delta(13)C(orgC) between sediment cores collected in 1987 and 1993-1994 confirms earlier predictions that diagenetic processes reduce the mass accumulation of organic carbon in the zone of oxic pore waters, but will not change the delta(13)C(orgC) values. All cores analyzed for delta(13)C(orgC) display the reproducible pattern of a progressive increase in the 1900s, peaking in the early to mid-1970s, and then decreasing to the present. This pattern matches the historical trends of phosphorus loading to the basin, suggesting that delta(13)C of organic carbon is a reliable proxy for paleoproductivity and responds to spring phosphorus supplies in the water column. The delta(15)N of sedimentary organic matter increased linearly from 1840 to 1960 at a rate of 0.3 parts per thousand per decade, and remained relatively constant thereafter except for an increase in the upper few centimeters of sediment. The increase in delta(15)N(orgN) reflects a combination of factors, including early forest clearance by Europeans, increased sewering by municipalities after 1940, and increased nitrate utilization as productivity increased in the lower Great Lakes. Increased rates of denitrification in the central basin of upstream Lake Erie from the 1930s to the early 1970s may have also contributed to the rise in delta(15)N(orgN) values.

Long-term studies on the population dynamics of vendace have been hampered by the difficulty of obtaining reliable estimates of year-class sizes. Data collected from Lake Pyhajarvi (Southwest Finland) during 1971-91 allowed relatively accurate analysis of vendace abundance changes. in the winters of 1979-91, daily catch statistics were collected from professional fishermen. Species, age, and size composition were analysed from regular catch samples. We estimated the size of the vendace population from the decrease in the CPUE during 10 winters. For the remaining 10 years, estimates were based on the relationship between the numbers of a year-class in autumn and mean individual growth rate. A 2-yr cycle was the most conspicuous feature of the data implying density-dependent regulation. We suggest that in Lake Pyhajarvi the basic model producing a persistent 2-yr cycle is the asymmetrical food competition between age groups.

The peak concentration of Pb in precipitation in June indicated increased dust content of air in late spring and early summer due to soil exposure and plowing. Increased concentration of Zn in the Kubenskoe Lake surface water in spring is likely to result from the peak discharge of anthropogenic pollutants on melting of snow and ice.					; Котова, Екатерина/AAF-8757-2019	Vinogradova, Anna/0000-0002-4056-472X; Kotova, Ekaterina/0000-0001-7442-3311; 													1070-3632	1608-3350				DEC	2016	86	13					2965	2973		10.1134/S1070363216130065	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1070363216130065													WOS:000397492400006

The downstream decrease in the studied section varied between 28% and 100% seasonally, and the average was 66(+/-25)% during 1987-1988. As to explain the decrease, we investigated biodegradation of LAS in water, diffusive exchange of dissolved phase LAS through the sediment/water interface, and settling of adsorbed phase LAS. Adsorption experiments were performed between 0.3-9 ppm of the initial concentrations of LAS. The experimental equation used to estimate the adsorption coefficient of LAS was verified by using adsorption data from field observations. The averaged value 2.4x10(-5) cm2 sec-1 for the diffusion coefficient in the sediment interstitial water was obtained from the experiments using the sediment core samples. The biodegradation rate constant (between 0.06 and 3.33 day-1) in water and the diffusive flux rate (between -0.157 and 0.022 mg m-2 hour-1) from water to sediment were obtained from field observations and experiments. Based on this information, a mathematical model was applied to simulate the downstream decrease of LAS in water. With this model, nearly 10% of the total LAS from the river was found to be transported to sediment both in summer and winter. The settling flux of LAS in the lake estuary was ten times greater than the diffusive flux. The settling flux was ten times smaller than the disappearing flux by biodegradation in summer but was the same level in winter.					; Fukushima, Takehiko/S-9801-2019	Fukushima, Takehiko/0000-0003-2494-309X; 													0273-1223						1991	23	1-3					497	506		10.2166/wst.1991.0449	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.1991.0449													WOS:A1991EN77200056

Effects of length of growing season on biomass accumulation and reproductive investment of Vallisneria natans (Lour.) H. Hara	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												The above-and below-ground biomass and fruit production of Vallisneria natans plants were measured in relation to length of the growing season, based on six treatments (April/May/June planting in relation to October/November harvest) in a microcosm experiment. Above- and below-ground biomass generally increased with length of growing season. There were no significant differences between early and late harvest measures for each start date, except for the earliest planting date, where above-ground biomass was significantly less in November compared to October. There were no significant differences in the dry weight production of fruits between any of the treatments, nor in the ratio of unripe to mature fruits produced in each treatment. The biomass of mature fruits and the ratio of mature to unripe fruits were significantly higher (approximately double) amongst November harvested plants compared to October harvested plants across all start dates, suggesting reduced seed production as a result of early harvesting. There was a significant increase in the dry weight of mature fruits with length of growing season. Based on these results, shortening of the inundation periods experienced by Vallisneria natans plants in Yangtze River ephemeral wetlands (more so in autumn than in spring) will reduce annual biomass production, and advances in autumn desiccation date will reduce investment in viable seed production in this submerged macrophyte.

A multiproxy study based on organic deposits from a palaeochannel fill (Lutomiersk-Koziowki) shows that after the channel was cut off during the late glacial termination, it became a shallow oxbow, fed by local springs. In the Boreal period, the oxbow lake was also fed by precipitation and became a telmatic environment overgrown by rush and swamp vegetation. Finally, it was covered by overbank deposits. The first flooding phase (9900-9600 cal. BP) was followed by the accumulation of overbank sediments (after 9500 cal. BP) and flooding increased after ca. 9300-9000 cal. BP. Pollen data provide information on the regional vegetation context for local and regional changes. In the Atlantic period, an increase in both summer and winter temperatures is inferred from the pollen data, corresponding to an expansion of thermophilous deciduous forests. While in general, flooding phases of the Early Holocene are poorly recognised in Eastern Europe, the Lutomiersk-Koziowki site may be considered as one of the reference points for this phenomenon in the region.

Particulate concentrations of the elements were also measured in early autumn and winter. Based on these results, the geochemical behaviors of trace elements are discussed. The redox-sensitive elements Mn and Fe showed characteristic vertical distribution profiles. Profiles of Mn changed drastically with the progression of the stagnation period. The dynamics of Ba were affected by the redox cycle of Mn. Dissolved V concentration showed a clear seasonal variation. In contrast, dissolved concentrations of Sr, Mo, Cu, Zn, and Ni were almost uniform, i.e., not dependent on the season or the depth. The distribution ratios of these elements between lake water and Mn nodules formed in the lake were calculated to assess their geochemical behaviors.																			1439-8621	1439-863X				AUG	2005	6	2					117	130		10.1007/s10201-005-0144-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-005-0144-y													WOS:000231200000006
J	Zhang, C				Zhang, Chi			Moisture source assessment and the varying characteristics for the Tibetan Plateau precipitation using TRMM	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Precipitation over the west Tibetan Plateau (TP) was always being accused of lacking observations that limits the precipitation moisture attribution and quantitation over the whole TP. By introducing precipitation from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and other observation-based data, moisture sources for the whole TP and their variations from 1998 to 2018 are explored using an Eulerian model. It is found that the Southwest subregion from TP to the western Indian Ocean, is the largest moisture contributor. It contributes around 147.6 +/- 13.0 mm yr(-1)in water-depth of the TP in climatology, accounting for 31.9 +/- 1.9% of the annual precipitation. The TP, the West (TP to Europe), and the Southeast (TP to Indochina Peninsula) follow by contributing 23.6 +/- 2.3, 21.8 +/- 1.5, and 2.6 +/- 0.6%, respectively. Circulations dominate the TP in different seasons. Take spring for example, the westerlies prevail over the TP and the West contributes the most moisture, which accounts for 38.6 +/- 2.9% of the spring precipitation. In summer, with the breakout of the Indian monsoon, contribution from the Southwest reaches the highest of 91.1 +/- 11.5 mm JJA(-1), accounting for 34.6 +/- 2.6% of the summer precipitation. The interannual variability (IAV) of the TP precipitation is mainly influenced by the moisture IAVs from the Southwest and the TP, contributing around 36.6% and 31.7%, respectively. Moisture contributed from the Southwest decreases significantly from 1998 to 2018 at a rate of -10.6 mm yr(-1)dec(-1), but moisture from the local increases significantly at 12.1 mm yr(-1)dec(-1). Further analyses reveal that the local increase in moisture contribution (and ratio) is primarily due to intensified evaporation of the TP, but the Southwest decrease is mainly caused by reduced moisture transport from the Indian monsoon.						, Chi/0000-0002-2547-7804													1748-9326					OCT	2020	15	10							104003	10.1088/1748-9326/abac78	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/abac78													WOS:000573571900001

In summer, total Hg in the water column ranged from 0.14 to 0.77 ng Hg/L, with the highest concentrations observed in the central basin of the lake in surface water samples. Labile inorganic Hg was found to be 7 to 20% of the total Hg content. Highest total Hg concentrations were found in river waters : up to 2 ng Hg/L. Labile methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations ranged from 2 to 38 pg Hg/L in the water column, with the higher concentrations in the central part of the lake, and showing a slight increase in near bottom waters. Labile MeHg makes up 1 to 15% of the total I-Ig content in the water column, with larger fractions in deep waters. The slight increase of the MeHg gradient with depth corresponds with the O-2 minimum region. Highest MeHg concentrations were observed in river waters (up to 145 pg Hg/L) and in some bays of the lake (up to 160 pg Hg/L). In these high temperature- and phytoplankton-rich water masses, the MeHg-fraction increased up to 35% of total Hg. Labile MeHg concentrations in water samples taken in winter in the southern basin (under the ice cover), showed slightly higher concentrations than in summer, possibly due to an early spring bloom. In rainwater, total Hg ranged from 3 to 20 ng Hg/L and MeHg from 0.1 to 0.25 ng Hg/L. In snow, a large fraction of total Hg is bound to particulate matter; concentrations of total Hg ranged from 8 to 60 ng Hg/L and labile MeHg from 0.1 to 0.25 ng Hg/L. Atmospheric Mg was found to be 0.73 to 2.31 ng/m(3) as gaseous Hg and 0.005 to 0.02 ng/m(3) in its particulate form. Spatial distribution patterns of atmospheric Hg show slightly higher to 0.02 ng/m concentrations over the central part of the lake and the Selenga river delta. In winter, atmospheric Hg values 3 (measured in the southern region), ranged from 1.2 to 6.1 ng/m(3) as total gaseous Hg and 0.02 to 0.09 ng/m(3) as total particulate Hg, and are higher than in summer, probably influenced by coal burning and traffic by the local population. MeHg contents in fish ranged from 20 ng Hg/g dry weight in small Cottocomephorus to 300 ng Hg/g dry weight in pike and trout species, which were caught in organic-rich waters.					; Baeyens, Willy/A-9366-2010	Baeyens, Willy/0000-0002-5281-903X; 													0049-6979					FEB	1995	80	1-4					539	551		10.1007/BF01189704	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01189704													WOS:A1995RM44200059

Biodiversity assessments of lakes depend on the ability to identify the complement of species present, although the degree of sampling required is often uncertain. We utilise long-term data to predict rotifer species richness in three habitats in three Polish lakes using rarefaction sampling methods. 2. Richness in littoral and psammon habitats did not saturate, even with up to 130 samples. Highest richness was observed in psammon habitat (119 species) in Lake Mikolajskie, followed by littoral habitat in Lakes Luknajno (114 species) and Kuc (110 species). Littoral habitats in Lakes Luknajno (56%) and Kuc (51%) had the most species not shared with other habitats in the same lake. 3. Species richness (Chao2) estimates ranged between 44 for pelagic and 135 for psammon habitat in Lake Mikolajskie, to 100 for psammon and 137 for littoral habitat in Lake Kuc, and 65 for pelagic and 162 for littoral habitat in Lake Luknajno. Whole lake estimates were 167, 205 and 171 species, respectively, for these lakes, higher than the 150 to 160 species predicted by Dumont and Segers (Hydrobiologia, 1996, 341, 125). 4. Using standardised sampling, richness was significantly higher in littoral than either pelagic or psammon habitats. Contrasts of standardised rarefaction curves revealed that richness in Lakes Kuc and Mikolajskie was described as well by littoral-only or psammon-only samples, respectively, as by those randomly drawn from across all habitats in the lake. 5. Species richness estimates for Lake Mikolajskie were highest in summer, followed by autumn and spring. Interannual estimates differed by up to 427%, nearly an order of magnitude greater than maximal seasonal variation of 70%. 6. Results indicate that much higher sampling intensity is required to establish species richness than is presently carried out in most lakes. Because many species can be detected only with very intensive sampling, conservation programmes must consider sampling intensity when designing studies.					macisaac, hugh/AAE-3742-2020	Muirhead, Jim/0000-0002-0264-3662													0046-5070	1365-2427				SEP	2006	51	9					1696	1709		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2006.01614.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2006.01614.x													WOS:000239797800009

H.; Labarre, Thibault			A new ∼ 900-year varved record in Lake Walker, Quebec North Shore, eastern Canada: insight on late Holocene climate mode of variability	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												This paper presents a new annually laminated record (varves) from Lake Walker, Quebec North Shore (eastern Canada) spanning the period from similar to 3230 to 2320 +/- 20 cal BP. A similar to 3.5-m-long composite sequence was established with the best regular and continuous laminated intervals using computed tomography and high-resolution photographs. The varve chronology was built based on two methods: manual multi-parameter counting using the PeakCounter software, and manual counting on thin-section images obtained by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The latter correlates more closely with the ages derived from AMS radiocarbon dating, suggesting that thin-section analysis is here a more reliable counting technique. Varves are clastic, composed of a silt layer deposited in spring and summer, and a clay layer deposited in winter. Annually resolved grain size obtained using image analysis technique on SEM images of thin sections and elemental composition from X-ray microfluorescence analyses performed on the floating varve chronology suggests that the record is sensitive to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), as revealed by the strong co-variability with another lower resolution record from Greenland. This suggests that periods of negative winter NAO promoted a thicker snow cover that resulted in higher river discharges and stronger clastic component in the varves. In modern times, cooling of the North Atlantic in the mid 1970s to the late 1980s was also characterized by concurrent negative phase of NAO, which condition translated into increase snow precipitation over the region. Overall, these results highlight that the new Lake Walker varve record presents remarkable prospects of developing a longer and high-resolution paleoclimatological reconstruction of the NAO in a region where similar records are scarce.					; St-Onge, Guillaume/E-4828-2014	Francus, Pierre/0000-0001-5465-1966; St-Onge, Guillaume/0000-0001-6958-4217; Lajeunesse, Patrick/0000-0002-2265-4529; Nzekwe, Obinna/0000-0001-9132-2619; Fortin, David/0000-0002-0761-0210; Jenny, Jean-Philippe/0000-0002-2740-174X; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				JAN	2022	67	1					35	57		10.1007/s10933-021-00220-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-021-00220-x		OCT 2021											WOS:000707543000001
J	Blanchfield, PJ; Flavelle, LS; Hodge, TF; Orihel, DM				Blanchfield, PJ; Flavelle, LS; Hodge, TF; Orihel, DM			The response of lake trout to manual tracking	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The use of telemetry is widespread in fisheries research, and manual tracking of fish is considered acceptable for data collection. However, it has never been shown whether the use of boats with powered engines, which is common in manual tracking, influences the distribution and behavior of fish. We examined whether general boat traffic or focused manual tracking activity altered movement patterns of adult lake trout Salvelinus namaycush in a small boreal lake at the Experimental Lakes Area of northwestern Ontario, Canada. In the summer and fall of 2002, we used automated fish positioning systems to compare the behavior of lake trout during 1-h disturbance periods (boat traffic or manual tracking) with behavior in the preceding 1-h baseline periods (no disturbance). In addition, we compared behavioral differences of lake trout during disturbance and baseline periods (experimental trials) with a similar period of time when no boats were on the lake (control trials). This comparison allowed us to determine whether the observed changes in behavior during normal boat traffic or manual tracking were within the natural range of variation. Overall, we observed no effect of boat traffic or manual tracking on the depth, speed, and path predictability of lake trout. Similarly, the changes in lake trout behavior between the disturbance and baseline periods of the experimental trials were all within the natural range determined by control trials. The response of lake trout to manual tracking was not related to their proximity to the motorboat, both when lake trout were in deep water (6 m; summer) and when they were in shallow water (2 m; fall spawning season). The lack of significance of the relationship between patterns of fish behavior and manual tracking activity provides support for the continued use of this method in fisheries research.

The one-year-long trap monitoring consisted of 5-month and 7-month periods representing growing season and winter season (including the spring flood event), respectively. Sediment accumulation rate (SAR), and organic content were determined, highest SAR - 14.5 g/m(2)/d - was measured during the winter period. Microplastics were extracted from the sediment applying heavy-liquid density separation method and collected under a microscope for further identification with FTIR spectroscopy. PE was identified as the most abundant synthetic polymer type, while PP and PET are also present. The annual microplastic flux rate is 32 400 pieces/m2/ year, and highest accumulation does not coincide with the highest SAR, but occurs during the growing season. Changes in the microplastic accumulation rates are related to seasonal conditions. Highest microplastic concentration with respect to dry sediment weight (10 200 pieces/kg) was observed in a growing season sample, while highest concentration with respect to sediment volume (1800 pieces/l) was observed during winter. This finding underlines the problems related to reporting microplastic concentrations in various units. The results highlight that sediment trap monitoring is an efficient tool for monitoring microplastic accumulation rate in aquatic environments and provides an opportunity to better understand and define processes controlling microplastic accumulation.

J	Chmura, J				Chmura, J			Thermal energy transfer towards the bottom of water reservoirs (lakes)	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES												In water reservoirs (lakes) in the summer period, three layers can be observed: the epilimnion, metalimnion and hypolimnion. In summer an increase in the thickness of the epilimnion layer is observed together with a movement of the metalimnion towards the bottom and a significant increase in the temperature of the two layers. An increase in hypolimnion temperature is observed in autumn during the cooling of the surface layers of the water. The increase in temperature of the epilimnion and metalimnion in summer and the downward movement of the metalimnion has not been clearly explained. The movement of the metalimnion is connected with thermal energy transfer, but previous theories do not take into account the phenomenon observed. In this paper, a new theory of thermal energy transfer in water reservoirs is elaborated and subsequently checked by laboratory experiments. A physical model of the water reservoir was designed and constructed. During the investigations it was noted that thermal energy can be transferred towards the bottom of the reservoir due to the existence of anti-convectional currents, which appear with the water temperature inversion in the upper part of the water column. The results obtained in the laboratory were confirmed by measurements in the Salina Reservoir in Poland.																			0262-6667					DEC	2005	50	6					1025	1036		10.1623/hysj.2005.50.6.1025	http://dx.doi.org/10.1623/hysj.2005.50.6.1025													WOS:000233886100008
J	Harris, SA; Prick, A				Harris, SA; Prick, A			Conditions of formation of stratified screes, slims river valley, Yukon Territory: A possible analogue with some deposits from Belgium	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Stratified scree is forming today on 34-45 degrees north-facing slopes in gullies in the Kluane Lake area of the St. Elias Range of the Yukon Territory. Low winter snowfall leaves the slopes snow-free in the dry spring weather, so that dry grain flows are extremely active. The coarsest material moves to the bottom of the slope, while the finer material is left behind. Summer rains mobilize the matrix-rich material upslope and cause it to flow down and cover the clast-supported deposits from the dry grain flows. The matrix-supported debris flow material dries and hardens, stabilizing the clast-supported material. This occurs in a region of discontinuous permafrost, but permafrost is not involved in the processes. A remarkably similar Pleistocene deposit occurs at Noiseux in Belgium. Detailed examination of the deposits from the Yukon and Noiseux shows that they have essentially similar characteristics, suggesting that the main deposit at Noiseux formed in the same way from frost-shattered Famenne siltstone with small quantities of loess. The deposit remaining today represents the sediments at the toe of this scree. Thus climatic conditions at Noiseux during part of the Late Pleistocene were similar to those found today at Kluane Lake. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Subsidence-induced methane clouds in Titan's winter polar stratosphere and upper troposphere	ICARUS												Titan's atmospheric methane most likely originates from lakes at the surface and subsurface reservoirs. Accordingly, it has been commonly assumed that Titan's tropopause region, where the vertical temperature profile is a minimum, acts as a cold trap for convecting methane, leading to the expectation that the formation of methane clouds in Titan's stratosphere would be rare. The additional assumption that Titan's tropopause temperatures are independent of latitude is also required. However, Cassini Composite InfraRed Spectrometer (CIRS) and Radio Science Subsystem (RSS) data sets reveal colder temperatures in Titan's tropopause region near the winter pole than those at low latitudes and in the summer hemisphere. This, combined with the presence of a cross-equatorial meridional circulation with winter polar subsidence, as suggested by current general circulation models, implies the inevitable formation of Subsidence-Induced Methane Clouds (SIMCs) over Titan's winter pole. We verified this by retrieving the stratospheric methane mole fraction at 70 degrees N from the strength of the far infrared methane pure rotation lines observed by CIRS and by assuming the RSS-derived thermal profile at 74.1 degrees N. Our retrieved methane mole fraction of 1.50 +/- 0.15% allows for methane to condense and form SIMCs at altitudes between similar to 48 and similar to 20 km.

J	Ekstrand, S; Wallenberg, P				Ekstrand, Sam; Wallenberg, Peter			Climate change impact on nutrient loss in regions with pronounced winter seasons	JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE												Eutrophication manifested by massive algal blooms is the most acute problem in many coastal waters and lakes around the world. The main source of phosphorus and nitrogen transport in the region studied, the Baltic Sea basin, is agriculture. Several studies have predicted adverse climate change impact on eutrophication problems. Here we show that in regions with a climate characterized by pronounced winter seasons and snow-melt flow peaks, this may not be the case. Regional Climate Model results were used to drive hydrological and nutrient modelling. Substantial reductions of phosphorus losses and small reductions for nitrogen were predicted. The main factors behind these results were fewer and less pronounced snow-melt occasions, elevated plant uptake of nutrients and increased growth and crop yield. Based on IPCC scenarios, one 'market driven' (A2) and one 'Local Sustainability' (B2), the impact on nutrient loss of societal development and future policy lines were assessed. Agricultural adaptation to a future climate, market demand and remedial action policies, e. g. more autumn crops and bio-fuel production, gave further reductions in nutrient loss. The results should not be taken as a motive to reduce efforts to minimize eutrophication in these areas, since severe eutrophication may cause irreversible effects in the decades to come.																			2040-2244	2408-9354					2010	1	3					181	192		10.2166/wcc.2010.019	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wcc.2010.019													WOS:000208392700002

Seasonal variation of arsenic and antimony in surface waters of small subarctic lakes impacted by legacy mining pollution near Yellowknife, NT, Canada	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The seasonal variation in lake water arsenic (As) and antimony (Sb) concentrations was assessed in four small (<1.5 km(2)) subarctic lakes impacted by As and Sb emissions from legacy mining activities near Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada. Substantial variation in As concentrations were measured over the two-year period of study in all but the deepest lake (maximum depth 6.9 m), induding a four-fold difference in As in the shallowest lake ([As]: 172-846 mu g L-1; maximum depth 0.8 m). Arsenic concentrations were enriched following ice cover development in the three shallowest lakes (50-110%) through a combination of physical and biogeochemical processes. Early winter increases in As were associated with the exclusion of solutes from the developing ice-cover; and large increases in As were measured once oxygen conditions were depleted to the point of anoxia by mid-winter. The onset of anoxic conditions within the water column was associated with large increases in the concentration of redox sensitive elements in lake waters (As, iron [Fe], and manganese [Mn]), suggesting coupling of As mobility with Fe and Mn cyding. In contrast, there was little difference in Sb concentrations under ice suggesting that Sb mobility was controlled by factors other than Fe and Mn associated redox processes. A survey of 30 lakes in the region during fall (open-water) and late-winter (under-ice) revealed large seasonal differences in surface water As were more common in lakes with a maximum depth <4 m. This threshold highlights the importance of winter conditions and links between physical lake properties and biogeochemical processes in the chemical recovery of As-impacted subarctic landscapes. The findings indicate annual remobilization of As from contaminated lake sediments may be inhibiting recovery in small shallow lakes that undergo seasonal transitions in redox state.

J	ABRAHAMSON, WG				ABRAHAMSON, WG			SPECIES RESPONSES TO FIRE ON THE FLORIDA LAKE WALES RIDGE	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The responses of native plant species to prescribed and lightning-caused burns were recorded using permanent line transects and quadrats, sampled over a 5-yr period, 1977-1982. The dominant species of more frequently burned associations (southern ridge sandhills, scrubby flatwoods, flatwoods, swales and seasonal ponds) either recover from fire by sprouting or survive by resisting fire, rather than by seeding. The dominants of less frequently burned associations (sand pine and rosemary scrub) are killed by fire and recovery by seeding. Quercus myrtifolia, Q. inopina, Q. chapmanii, Q. geminata, Serenoa repens and Sabal etonia exhibited resiliency, rapidly returning to their preburn levels of dominance. Of the palmettos, Serenoa responded more vigorously than Sabal. Vegetation measures for Gaylussacia dumosa and Vaccinium myrsinites increased and then decreased dramatically after fire with 2-, and 3- to 4-yr cycles, respectively. Myrica cerifera var. pusilla, Q. minima, and Hypericum reductum were more gradual in their responses. A strong inverse relationship, mediated by both abiotic and biotic factors, was found between density and accumulated aboveground biomass in H. edisonianum. Pinus elliottii var. densa showed a high degree of resistance to fire with several abiotic and biotic variables affecting mortality. A number of species exhibited an increased incidence of flowering after fire. Late spring/summer fires stimulated a vigorous flowering response in Aristida stricta. Panicum abscissum and Andropogon spp., whereas winter fires encouraged only a vegetative response. The ridge species do not require fire in the sense of maintaining a fire subclimax. Rather, fire revitalizes species'' populations, but does not initiate succession in the Clementsian sense.																			0002-9122	1537-2197					1984	71	1					35	43		10.2307/2443621	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2443621													WOS:A1984SD99100005
J	SIEGFRIED, CA				SIEGFRIED, CA			LIFE-HISTORY, POPULATION-DYNAMICS AND PRODUCTION OF PONTOPOREIA-HOYI (CRUSTACEA, AMPHIPODA) IN RELATION TO THE TROPHIC GRADIENT OF LAKE GEORGE, NEW-YORK	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The life history characteristics, population dynamics and production of P. hoyi in Lake George, New York, were studied from May 1981 through Oct. 1982. P. hoyi, in terms of both density and standing crop, is the most prevalent member of the deep water macrobenthos of Lake George. It reproduces in the winter, with young being released in the late winter-early spring. At the southernmost study site, young released in the spring grew to 6-7 mm in length and bred during ther 1st winter. At the remaining sites, P. hoyi required 2 yr to complete its life cycle. This difference in life history characteristics can be related to food availability and temperature differences. The open waters of the south end of Lake George are not only more productive but are also more closely associated with the littoral zone, providing a wealth of bacteria-rich detritus for benthic deposit feeders. The greater food availability in the south basin of Lake George is reflected in significantly larger brood sizes and smaller size at maturity for P. hoyi populations from the south end of the lake. The southermost study site has significantly greater P. hoyi density and standing crop than all other sites. The cohort of the year dominated density and standing crop at the southern site while the cohort of the previous year dominated standing crop at the other sites. Peak abundance ranged from 600 .cntdot. m2 at the north site to 2900 .cntdot. m2 at the south site. Cohort production ranged from .apprx. 2 g .cntdot. m2 at the north site to .apprx. 15 g .cntdot. m2 at the south site.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1985	122	2					175	180		10.1007/BF00032105	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00032105													WOS:A1985AFF8100011

Temporal coherence of variables across lake pairs was highest for conductivity, Ca, water temperature and alkalinity. The lake pairs with a direct surface water channel connection had a higher coherence than the lake pairs not connected by a stream. The size of the lake or catchment area had little effect on the coherence between the lakes. Temporal coherence was not strongly related to the difference in water colour (dystrophy) between the lakes. However, between polyhumic lakes (colour > 100 g Pt m(-3)) the coherence was generally higher than between less coloured lakes. Year-to-year variation in limnological characteristics could be partly explained by the variation in local weather. In March, water temperature and chemistry were infrequently related to winter weather, rather they correlated with the weather conditions of the previous autumn, while the ambient late winter weather seemed to have a stronger influence on lake conditions in April. Temporal variation in some variables was related to the atmospheric pressure changes over the North Atlantic (the North Atlantic Oscillation, NAO). Our results suggest that the potential effects of climatic change on lakes can be generalised regionally for brown-coloured dystrophic lakes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	SVEINBJORNSDOTTIR, AE; JOHNSEN, SJ				SVEINBJORNSDOTTIR, AE; JOHNSEN, SJ			STABLE ISOTOPE STUDY OF THE THINGVALLAVATN AREA - GROUNDWATER ORIGIN, AGE AND EVAPORATION MODELS	OIKOS												The paper describes the stable isotopic composition of water within the catchment area of Thingvallavatn. The lake is about 90% fed by groundwater springs, mainly entering the lake by the northern shore. These springs have stable isotopic composition considerably lower than the local precipitation, but similar to the present precipitation falling on the southernmost part of the Langjokull ice cap. It is therefore suggested that the spring water originates from Langjokull ice cap but is slightly enriched in the heavier isotopes due to mixing with local precipitation on the 50 km way from the recharge area to the lake. At the southwestern shoreline of the lake several springs have been observed that are luke warm (7-11-degrees-C) due to the geothermal activity at the Nesjavellir field. The oxygen isotopic composition of this water is slightly heavier than observed elsewhere within the catchment area due to contamination by the Nesjavellir thermal fluid, which has become considerably enriched in the heavy isotope O-18 due to oxygen isotopic exchange with the bedrock. In the paper it is shown that the thermal water at Nesjavellir also originates from the Langjokull ice cap. The delta-O-18 - delta-D relation for the waters in open fissures. springs and wells within the Thingvellir National Park follows a line with a similar slope to that of the meteoric line (i.e. 8), but most of the data points lie above the meteoric line. The deuterium excess which is 10 parts per thousand for the meteoric line is 10 to 13 parts per thousand for the Thingvellir water. Seasonal variation in the delta-O-18 value was studied for three fissure springs within thc National Park. For the fissures with the least rainwater component (the Vellankatla springs) the variation is usually very small, whereas the spring Silfra, that has higher local rainwater component, shows more variation. Stable isotope data suggests that 75% of the water in the Vellankatla springs originates in the Langjokull ice cap. Furthermore, it is shown that precipitation within the 5 previous years amounts to about 9% of the Vellankatla flow and that the 25% of the Vellankatla water, which consists of recent precipitation, is younger than 10 vr. Radiocarbon analyses of the water give, on the other hand, an anomalously high age due to influx of CO2 from the mantle. It is shown how evaporation from lakes and ponds can be modelled and studied quantitatively by measuring the deuterium excess. The results demonstrate the importance of studying simultaneously the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes and suggest that if the deuterium excess is < 10 parts per thousand the water is isotopically different from its original isotopic composition due to evaporation. This is particularly important to bear in mind when the geographical distribution of delta values in precipitation is being studied and the delta-D values are used to trace the origin of a spring water.																			0030-1299					MAY-JUN	1992	64	1-2					136	150		10.2307/3545049	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3545049													WOS:A1992JG50900012

By combining isotopic data with chemical and hydrologic measurements, we determined the relative importance of N sources and biogeochemical N processes in the Taige River in the East Plain Region of China. The river was polluted more seriously by anthropogenic inputs in winter than in summer. Manure and urban sewage effluent were the main nitrate (NO3-) sources, with the nitrification of N-containing organic materials serving as another important source of NO3- In the downstream, with minor variations in hydrological conditions, nitrification played a more important role than assimilation for the decreasing ammonium (NH4+-N) concentrations. The N isotopic enrichment factors (epsilon) during NH4+ utilization ranged from -13.88%. in March to -29.00.parts per thousand in July. The ratio of the increase in delta O-18 and delta N-15 of river NO3- in the downstream was 1.04 in January and 0.92 in March. This ratio indicated that NO3- assimilation by phytoplankton was responsible for the increasing delta N-15 and delta O-18 values of NO3- in winter. The relationships between delta N-15 of particulate organic nitrogen and isotopic compositions of dissolved inorganic nitrogen indicated that the phytoplankton in the Taige River probably utilized NH4+ a preferentially and mainly in summer, while in winter, NO3- assimilation by phytoplankton was dominant.

The phosphorus and nitrogen release fluxes in the vessels with GCA (up to 2.9 mg m(-2) d(-1) for total phosphorus and 23.9 mg m(-2) d(-1) for total nitrogen) were considerably smaller than those in the vessels without GCA (up to 8.9 mg m(-2) d(-1) and 56 mg m(-2) d(-1), respectively), except in the case of phosphorus in the fall experiment, and thus the phosphorus concentration released from the vessel without GCA under anoxic conditions in the summer experiment was extraordinarily higher (over 1.5 mg l(-1)) than those in the other vessels (less than 0.31 mg l(-1)). Supplementary experiments with smaller columns indicated that the chemical effect of GCA was on a similar level with its physical effect and that the threshold phosphorus concentration for removing it was lower in freshwater than seawater. The chromium level slightly exceeded the standard for drinking water and the development of technology to suppress its release is a future challenge.

The results indicate a significant difference in macrophyte species number and abundance between the nursery and main fishponds, with up to 24.5% of the variation in macrophyte species distribution patterns explained by fishpond management type (nursery or main) and up to 6.7% by water transparency. Fish biomass used as a fish stock proxy explained up to 13.9% of variability. Although not significant, differences in species number and abundance were found (i) between spring and summer survey periods during the growing season with both species number and abundance usually decreasing in summer, and (ii) between years of the farming production cycle with a higher species number and abundance typically found in the first year of the farming cycle in the nursery fishponds.

J	Havens, K; Ji, GH				Havens, Karl; Ji, Gaohua			Inferences about seston composition and phytoplankton limiting factors during recovery of a large shallow lake from hurricane impacts	INLAND WATERS												We evaluated the effects of 3 successive major hurricanes that impacted Lake Okeechobee, Florida, in 2004 and 2005. Impacts and recovery were compared to a pre-hurricane period, focusing on inferred seston composition and potential phytoplankton limiting factors based on deviations between Carlson's trophic state index values. Before the hurricanes, the lake was seasonally and spatially variable. At 4 sites examined, summers had larger seston and nitrogen limitation, whereas winters had smaller seston and light limitation. This seasonality was strongest at south and west sites closer to the lake shore in shallower water and weakest at deeper central and north sites overlying flocculent mud sediments. Hurricanes homogenized the lake spatially and seasonally, and for 2 years there was lake-wide light limitation and small seston in summer and winter. Four years after the last hurricane, the composition of seston and nature of limiting factors had recovered to conditions nearly identical to those in a pre-hurricane period, with some localized seasonal exceptions, possibly explained by migration of sediments or differences in submerged plant density. Lakes such as Okeechobee, with a large surface to depth ratio, high nutrient concentrations, and fine flocculent sediments, can recover from hurricanes over time, but a long duration of recovery could make them vulnerable to repeated hurricane impacts, which could keep nutrient concentrations high, transparency low, and work against efforts aimed at lake rehabilitation.

J	Johnson, TB; Kitchell, JF				Johnson, TB; Kitchell, JF			Long-term changes in zooplanktivorous fish community composition: Implications for food webs	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The zooplanktivorous fish community of Lake Mendota has been dominated by cisco (Coregonus artedi), yellow perch (Perca flavescens), and white bass (Morone chrysops) for over 100 years. Shifts in their abundances have led to changes in zooplankton community composition. When total zooplanktivory was less than 0.5 g Daphnia . m(-2). day(-1), large-bodied Daphnia pulicaria dominated. At predation rates above 0.9 g Daphnia . m(-2). day(-1), D. pulicaria were rare. Large differences exist in the ability of each planktivore to regulate zooplankton community structure. In its lifetime, one cisco will consume as much Daphnia spp. as 14 yellow perch or 8 white bass. For equal biomass, cisco consume twice as much Daphnia spp. as do yellow perch or white bass. Almost 80% of the zooplanktivory by cisco is attributable to adults, while juvenile yellow perch and white bass account for over 50% of their species' predation. Cisco predation is highest during spring and fall and controls D. pulicaria population dynamics. Yellow perch and white bass predation is most intense during summer. When cisco biomass was less than 80 kg . ha(-1), D. pulicaria was the dominant zooplankter, regardless of yellow perch or white bass biomass. Continued improvements in water quality of Lake Mendota through biomanipulation require sustained low cisco biomass, enabling D, pulicaria populations to flourish.																			0706-652X					DEC	1996	53	12					2792	2803		10.1139/cjfas-53-12-2792	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-53-12-2792													WOS:A1996WL12500012
J	Gibson, JAE				Gibson, JAE			The role of ice in determining mixing intensity in Ellis Fjord, Vestfold Hills, East Antarctica	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Mixing in Ellis Fjord, Vestfold Hills, East Antarctica, is controlled by processes which are influenced by the extent of ice formation. A study of water temperature and salinity at a site near the middle of the fjord was undertaken from Map 1994 to February 1995 after a summer (1993-94) in which the ice cover of the fjord was largely retained. Vertical mixing resulting from the exclusion of salt during the limited winter formation of ice was insufficient to mix completely the non-meromictic basins of the fjord. In contrast, a previous study during a winter with far more ice production recorded much stronger vertical mixing throughout the fiord. Warming and freshening of the fjord during the 1994-95 summer, when the ice again did not melt significantly: was attributable to the flow of warmer, less saline water along the fjord. This process was probably related to the formation of tidal jets at the narrow and shallow entrance to the fjord, and was thus influenced by the ice conditions around the entrance. These jets would also have introduced significant amounts of extra-fjord water (along with any resident biota) into the fjord.																			0954-1020					DEC	1999	11	4					419	426		10.1017/S095410209900053X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S095410209900053X													WOS:000084648200006

Growth and survival of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) from Karluk Lake and River, Alaska, in relation to climatic and oceanic regimes and indices, 1922-2000	FISHERY BULLETIN												We examined whether the relationship between climate and salmon production was linked through the effect of climate on the growth of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) at sea. Smolt length and juvenile, immature, and maturing growth rates were estimated from increments on scales of adult sockeye salmon that returned to the Karluk River and Lake system on Kodiak Island, Alaska, over 77 years, 1924-2000. Survival was higher during the warm climate regimes and lower during the cool regime. Growth was not correlated with survival, as estimated from the residuals of the Ricker stock-recruitment model. Juvenile growth was correlated with an atmospheric forcing index and immature growth was correlated with the amount of coastal precipitation, but the magnitude of winter and spring coastal downwelling in the Gulf of Alaska and the Pacific Northwest atmospheric patterns that influence the directional bifurcation of the Pacific Current were not related to the growth of Karluk sockeye salmon. However, indices of sea surface temperature, coastal precipitation, and atmospheric circulation in the eastern North Pacific were correlated with the survival of Karluk sockeye salmon. Winter and spring precipitation and atmospheric circulation are possible processes linking survival to climate variation in Karluk sockeye salmon.																			0090-0656	1937-4518				OCT	2009	107	4					488	500																WOS:000271312500007

Sympatric Diversification of Dolly Varden Salvelinus malma (Salmonidae) in an Extremely Small Ecosystem	JOURNAL OF ICHTHYOLOGY												A planktivorous form of Salvelinus malma characterized by lacustrine winter spawning was discovered for the first time in north-east Asia in an isolated water system with an area of 0.23 km(2). This form dwells in sympatry with the benthivorous form of the same species, which reproduces in autumn in the lake tributary. Given the size of the ecosystem, a single isolation event, and the absence of other fish species, this example of ecological diversification can be recognized as the simplest known in the world. The data on the growth rate, morphology, and feeding of two sympatric forms are presented.					; Melnik, Nikolai/AAC-3543-2022; Shkil, Fedor/AAJ-4030-2020; Zlenko, Dmitry/S-1658-2016	Shkil, Fedor/0000-0002-5637-8278; Zlenko, Dmitry/0000-0002-4126-3080													0032-9452	1555-6425				NOV	2019	59	6					958	961		10.1134/S003294521906002X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S003294521906002X													WOS:000519250800014

This study evaluated the applicability of a modified distributed surface energy balance model (DSEBM) with 3-h temporal and 100-m spatial resolution to the alpine Dongkemadi Glacier (DKMD) in the central Tibetan Plateau region, analyzed the causes of glacier MB variations with respect to energy balance, and evaluated MB changes under various climate scenarios. Results showed that: (i) the modified model can describe surface energy and MB of XDKMD well; (ii) net shortwave and longwave radiation, accounting for more than 80% of total heat flux, dominated the glacier energy balance during both summer and winter months; (iii) summer MB spatial patterns dominated annual MB, consistent with the fact that DKMD is a summer accumulation type glacier; and (iv) effect of increase in air temperature on glacier MB is higher than that of decrease in air temperature. The sensitivity of MB revealed by the modified DSEBM can help to understand MB changes influenced by the climate changes and to regulate water management strategies to adapt to climate changes at the catchment scale.					; Cuo, Lan/AEW-9519-2022; Liu, Qiang/IWU-3947-2023	liang, li qiao/0000-0001-5282-9855; Liu, Qiang/0000-0003-3403-923X; 													2045-2322					AUG 24	2018	8								12788	10.1038/s41598-018-31228-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-31228-5								30143725					WOS:000442607800017
J	Hann, BJ; Zrum, L				Hann, BJ; Zrum, L			Littoral microcrustaceans (Cladocera, Copepoda) in a prairie coastal wetland: seasonal abundance and community structure	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Seasonal species abundance and community structure of the littoral microcrustacean community (Cladocera, Copepoda) in two areas of Delta Marsh were investigated over the open-water season. Cladoceran abundance in Crescent Pond, with no fish, only invertebrate predators was considerably higher than in Blind Channel, with both fish and invertebrate predators, and where cyclopoid copepods were the dominant microcrustaceans. In both areas, a small number of species of planktonic cladocerans characterized the community in spring and early summer, whereas a diverse array of species of phytophilous cladocerans comprised the community throughout the summer. Daphnia rosea was the most abundant species in the planktonic community in Crescent Pond for the first half of the summer, and Ceriodaphnia dubia was most abundant in the last half. In contrast, no single planktonic cladoceran species was consistently most abundant in Blind Channel. The sequence of dominant phytophilous cladoceran species observed in Crescent Pond through the season was Chydorus sp. 2, Simocephalus vetulus, Pleuroxus denticulatus, and Ceriodaphnia dubia, and in Blind Channel, Alona circumfimbriata, Simocephalus vetulus, and Ceriodaphnia dubia. Dominant planktonic and phytophilous copepods in both areas were Diacyclops thomasi, Acanthocyclops vernalis, Eucyclops agilis, and Macrocyclops albidus. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed differences in community structure between areas of the marsh related to turbidity, phytoplankton biomass, and soluble reactive phosphorus concentration.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				DEC 19	1997	357						37	52		10.1023/A:1003170416487	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003170416487													WOS:000072604600004

Earlier, higher contents of Al, Zn and Cd were found in plants collected over the whole catchment area of the acidified lake (where barren forest types predominate). This suggests that the proportions of different vegetation types in the catchment area determine the degree of lake acidification. This conclusion was supported by the observation that the contents of Cd were significantly higher in plants growing in the more barren forest sites types. No significant differences were found for Al. The plant nutrients Fe and Zn showed the highest levels in the most fertile forest type. The contents of Al and Fe in V. myrtillus leaves increased with decreasing distance from the shoreline of the lakes, but no such increase was noted for Zn, Cd or Hg. Clearly higher contents of Al, Fe and Hg were observed in V. myrtillus leaves in autumn than in spring, whereas Zn showed higher levels in the spring. In future work, attention should be paid to seasonal changes in the contents of metals in plants.																			0003-3847	1797-2442					1988	25	4					365	370																WOS:A1988R605500003
J	Pitlo, J Jr				Pitlo, J Jr			Effects of environmental factors on walleye and sauger recruitment in Pool 13, upper Mississippi River	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												I measured the abundance of walleyes Stizostedion vitreum and saugers S. canadense in the spring as larvae and in the Call as age 0 to determine which factors limited reproductive success in Pool 13 of the upper Mississippi River. Catches of larval walleyes and saugers in conical and rectangular drift nets during 1993-2000 were significantly higher in night samples than day samples but were similar at the surface and at the bottom. The fall abundance of age-0 walleyes and saugers in four to eight nights of sampling at fixed sites in lock and dam tailwaters during 1992-1999 was not correlated with the spring abundance of larval walleyes and Saugers. However, the fall abundance of age-0 walleyes and saugers was highly correlated with the rate of water warming (degreesF/d) between April 15 and May 5. Age-0 walleye and sauger abundance was not correlated with river discharge during the April spawning period. Strong walleye and sauger year-classes were produced in 1992, 1994, and 1997 in Pool 13, The age-0 abundance of walleyes and saugers from Pools 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, and 15 shows that strong year-classes were also produced in 1992, 1994, and 1997 in those pools. I conclude that environmental effects on recruitment were systemic on the upper Mississippi River.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				AUG	2002	22	3					1021	1031		10.1577/1548-8675(2002)022<1021:EOEFOW>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8675(2002)022<1021:EOEFOW>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000177486800036

Climatic and phenological controls on coherent regional interannual variability of carbon dioxide flux in a heterogeneous landscape	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The climate sensitivity of plant seasonal life cycles, or phenology, may impart significant carbon cycle feedbacks on climatic change. Analysis of interannual ecosystem carbon exchange provides one way to assess this climate sensitivity. Multiyear eddy covariance carbon dioxide flux observations from five different ecosystems (deciduous forest, northern hardwood mixed forest, old-growth forest, shrub wetland, and mixed wetland-forest) in the Upper Great Lakes, United States, located within 400 km of each other and exhibiting coherent interannual variability, were used to parameterize a simple ecosystem model. The model, when properly constrained with an interannual sensitive cost function, was able to explain a significant proportion of the interannual variation of carbon fluxes in all ecosystems except the old-growth forest. The results reveal that spring or autumn climate thresholds impact annual carbon uptake, though the magnitude and strength varied by site. When the model was forced to maintain the same climate-phenology relationship across the five sites, most of the interannual variability could still be explained except at the old-growth forest and the forest farthest in distance from the others. These results suggest that at least for this region, coarse spatial resolution carbon-climate models could likely specify general climate-phenological relationships at grid scales on order of 100 km without appreciably sacrificing ability to model interannual carbon cycling.

J	Camarero, L; Catalan, J				Camarero, L; Catalan, J			Variability in the chemistry of precipitation in the Pyrenees (northeastern Spain): Dominance of storm origin and lack of altitude influence	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The assessment of the effects of atmospheric inputs on the chemistry of mountain lakes requires realistic data on the chemical composition of these inputs. However, precipitation sampling stations are usually at lower altitudes than lakes. The location of the stations may lead to a mistaken appraisal of precipitation chemistry, since orography strongly influences the formation of storms caused by air masses coming from different directions, and altitude affects the mechanisms of transport and deposition of solutes in several ways. The effect of altitude on the chemistry of precipitation in the Pyrenees was studied at three sampling points located at different heights (1600, 1900, and 2200 m above sea level) within the same valley, orientated in a NE-SW direction, Sampling was carried out over a period (summer-autumn 1990) long enough to ensure a statistically representative collection of events with a different origin, Three main results were derived from this study. (1) The main source of variability was the cation-anion balance, which was determined by the origin of the wet air masses: rains from the Atlantic were more acidic than those coming from the Mediterranean. (2) There was no significant difference in the chemistry of bulk precipitation with altitude within the range 1600-2200 m asl, in which most of the lakes in the Pyrenees are found. (3) Below-cloud mechanisms of deposition had a significant influence on NO3- concentration. The concentration of most of the solutes was independent of precipitation volume, except for NO3-.

The purpose of this study was to sample aquatic environments in the Tulsa, Oklahoma, area year-round for the presence of these disease-causing amebae. A total of 34 pathogenic isolates were obtained from 2,016 processed water and swab samples. Pathogenicity was determined by the ability of amebae to cause death in mice after intranasal inoculation. Pathogenic amebae were isolated during every month of the year and were identified as Naegleria australiensis (38%), Acanthamoeba species (35%), N. fowleri (18%), and leptomyxid amebae (9%). Pathogenic leptomyxids have not previously been reported from the environment. The greatest percentage of recovery of pathogens occurred during the spring and autumn. The prevalence of pathogenic free-living amebae in the sampled waters was 1 pathogen/3.4 l water.																			0932-0113	1432-1955				FEB	1995	81	3					193	201											7770424					WOS:A1995QL08000003

Under the current climate change conditions, ice-cover duration has been reduced by an advance in ice-off, and a delay in ice-on, and future projections foresee this trend as continuing. Here, we describe the current ice phenology of Pyrenean high mountain lakes and ponds, including ice-cover duration and ice-on and ice-off dates. We used mixed models to identify the variables that explained the observed patterns, extrapolated them across all water bodies in the mountain range, and related the seasonality of air and water temperatures with ice phenology using structural equation models. Ice phenology was obtained from the temperature series of 85 lakes and ponds for fourteen years, including 2001 to 2004 and 2009 to 2019. We discovered that high autumn precipitation was related to earlier ice-on dates, and that earlier ice-off dates were associated with higher following-summer water temperatures. We found a greater predictability of ice-off dates and ice-cover duration than ice-on dates. Altitude was the most important variable explaining the variation in ice phenology, followed by latitude, which was related to climatic differences among the northern and southern slopes of the mountain range. The lake area was significant for ice -on dates and ice -cover duration. The interannual variability in air temperature and radiation was remarkable for the ice -off date and ice -cover duration but not for the ice -on date. In contrast, wind speed was related to an earlier ice -off date and shorter ice -cover duration. All the measured lakes and ponds froze in winter during the studied period, a feature maintained in the extrapolation to the whole set of water bodies.					; Buchaca, Teresa/L-1679-2014; Miro, Alexandre/K-5758-2017; Camarero, Lluis/J-9239-2012; Miró, Alexandre/K-5758-2017; Piera, Jaume/I-1152-2015; Ventura, Marc/A-5660-2008; Catalan, Jordi/A-5420-2008; Camarero, Lluís/J-9239-2012	Ventura, Marc/0000-0003-1401-414X; Buchaca, Teresa/0000-0001-7933-8992; Miro, Alexandre/0000-0002-7348-1736; Camarero, Lluis/0000-0003-4271-8988; Sabas, Ibor/0000-0002-4173-5332; Piera, Jaume/0000-0001-5818-9836; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				SEP 1	2024	941								173571	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.173571	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.173571		JUN 2024						38830415					WOS:001251145900001

Dissolved organic matter (DOM) collected from lake water induced by hydrophyte decomposition may play a key role in understanding the change in the water quality. Spectroscopic techniques can reveal the spectral properties of DOM and their impact on the water quality under oligotrophic and eutrophic growth conditions, such as the application of ultraviolet visible (UVvis) spectra and fluorescence spectroscopy in combination with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) method. The results indicated that dissolved organic carbon (DOC), a(350), and UV absorption in a unit of TOC at 254 nm (SUVA254) values under eutrophic growth conditions in summer are generally higher than those under oligotrophic conditions in winter. Five fluorescent components, including one humic-like substance (C4), one fulvic-like material (C3) and three protein-like materials (C1, C2 and C5) were obtained by PARAFAC analysis from hydrophyte-derived DOM samples under different growth conditions and in different seasons. The Fmax of the different fluorescent components were greatly influenced by hydrophyte decomposition, and varied under these different conditions. The results of water quality parameters also showed that dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total phosphorus (TP), and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations for oligotrophic and eutrophic conditions in the summer (OS and ES) samples were generally higher than those in the winter samples. The characterization of hydrophyte decomposition DOM is of great importance in eutrophic lake management. Thus, much effort should be put into the study of hydrophyte-derived DOM characteristics and their potential risks as a carrier of hazardous pollutants. The study provides scientific guidance for lake clean water management.

J	Hong, JM; Liu, S; Shi, GP; Zhang, YQ				Hong, Jianming; Liu, Shu; Shi, Guopeng; Zhang, Yuqu			Soil seed bank techniques for restoring wetland vegetation diversity in Yeyahu Wetland, Beijing	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												In recent years, wetland restoration measures have created extensive concerns globally. The theory and practice of restoring wetland vegetation diversity in wetlands through soil seed banks is discussed in this paper. A comparative study on soil seed bank and species composition in Yeyahu Wetland, Beijing, was conducted in 2007. Species and quantities of seeds from 12 sample sites were counted and measured by the seed-germinating method. After germination, 27 species belonging to 16 families and 23 genera were recorded, with an average of 11.75 species per sample site, and total average density of 24831.0 individuals/m(2). There were significant differences between the soil seed bank and vegetation in spring, summer and autumn, with similarity coefficients of 0.2620 +/- 0.0868, 0.2580 +/- 0.0778 and 0.1953 +/- 0.0452, respectively. Also in 2008, by using the seed bank technique, vegetation diversity was restored in a degraded wetland near Maying River of Yeyahu Wetland through the processes of spot selection, topographic surveying, water level monitoring, and vegetation management. The results showed that in the restored regions, both species and diversity coefficients of vegetation observably increased: 73.68% of the hydrophytic species we discovered were transplanted from provenance regions; germination of seeds in the soil lasted until late September; and many species completed their life history and produced new seeds to renew the seed bank. In addition, the results suggested that seed bank technique not only increased richness and multiplicity of vegetation, but also provided food chains with animal diversity in wetlands.

J	Judson, A; Doesken, N				Judson, A; Doesken, N			Density of freshly fallen snow in the Central Rocky Mountains	BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												New snow density distributions are presented for six measurement sites in the mountains of Colorado and Wyoming. Densities were computed from daily measurements of new snow depth and water equivalent from snow board cores. All data were measured once daily in wind-protected forest sites. Observed densities of freshly fallen snow ranged from 10 to 257 kg m(-3). Average densities at each site based on four year's of daily observations ranged from 72 to 103 kg m(-3). Seventy-two percent of all daily densities fell between 50 and 100 kg m(-3). Approximately 5% of all daily snows had densities below 40 kg m(-3). The highest frequency of low densities occurred at Steamboat Springs and Dry Lake. The relationship between air temperature and new snow density exhibited a decline of density with temperature with a correlation coefficient of 0.52. No obvious reversal toward higher densities occurred at cold temperatures, as some previous studies have reported. No clear relationship was found between snow density and the depth of new snowfalls. Correlations of daily densities between measurement sites decreased rapidly with increasing distance between sites. New snow densities are strongly influenced by orography, which contributes to density differences over short distances.																			0003-0007					JUL	2000	81	7					1577	1587		10.1175/1520-0477(2000)081<1577:DOFFSI>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0477(2000)081<1577:DOFFSI>2.3.CO;2													WOS:000087887300005

Dispersal and coexistence of two non-native crayfish species (Pacifastacus leniusculus and Procambarus clarkii) in NE Portugal over a 10-year period	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												NE Portugal is one of the most isolated and low populated regions of Western Europe. Recently, two American crayfish species reached this area: signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus coming from Spain and red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii in its northward expansion. The dispersion of both species was followed throughout the last decade in river Macas (Douro catchment). Our results support the hypothesis of faster downstream colonisation. The mean spread rate of signal crayfish was faster for the downstream expansion, 2.8 km.yr(-1), while the upstream rate was 1.7 km.yr(-1). Exceptionally, in one period, the rate of spread reached 6.7 km.yr(-1), which was apparently caused by downstream washing in extreme conditions of flow. The mean rate of spread is higher than the observed in other studies which may also be related to the low current velocity of late spring and summer that provides favourable conditions for a fast upstream colonisation. Coexistence of signal and red swamp crayfish was detected in a large river sector. Signal crayfish strongly dominates in the upper and intermediate sectors which are the colder part of the river and in the lower sectors, species abundances are not significantly different. Winter temperature in the higher altitude reaches seems to moderate the competitive abilities of P. clarkii.

(Centrarchidae) from the Lake Atanasovsko Wetlands, Bulgaria: Survey of Species and Structure of Helminth Communities	ACTA ZOOLOGICA BULGARICA												A helminthological survey of the alien Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Lepomis gibbosus (L.), from the Lake Atanasovsko Wetlands, Bulgarian Black Sea coast, is based on the examination of 107 host individuals studied in spring, summer and autumn of 2012 and 2013. Six helminth species are recorded: metacercariae of Posthodiplostomum centrarchi Hoffman, 1958 with prevalence (P) 8.41%, mean intensity (MI) 1.88 and mean abundance (MA) 0.16; monogeneans Onchocleidus similis Mueller, 1936 (P 31.78%, MI 4.41, MA 1.40) and O. dispar Mueller, 1936 (P 3.74%, MI 1.00, MA 0.04), both specific parasites of centrarchids; adult liver nematode Schulmanela petruschewskii (Shulman, 1948) (P 3.74%, MI 17.74, MA 0.66); larvae of nematodes Spiroxys contortus (Rudolphi, 1819) (P 10.28%, MI 2.90, MA 0.30) parasitic as adults in pond turtles and Contracaecum sp. (P 1.87%, MI 1.00, MA 0.02) parasitic as adults in fish-eating birds. Though L. gibbosus harbours three alien parasites (P centrarchi, O. similis and O. dispar), there is no evidence for spillover infections in fishes in the Lake Atanasovsko Wetlands. However, its negative impact on native populations might be by parasite spillback (participation in life cycles of native parasites in fishes, reptiles and birds).

In the eastern side it is fed by springs that discharge groundwater of the nearby volcanic aquifers. The area is arid: rainfall does not exceed 200 mm/year in the rainiest parts. The stable isotopic content of spring water shows that the recharge is originated mainly from winter rain, snow melt, and to a lesser extent from some short and intense sporadic rainfall events. Most of the spring water outflowing in the northern side of Laguna Tuyajto is recharged in the Tuyajto volcano. Most of the spring water in the eastern side and groundwater are recharged at higher elevations, in the rims of the nearby endorheic basins of Pampa Colorada and Pampa Las Tecas to the East. The presence of tritium in some deep wells in Pampa Colorada and Pampa Las Tecas indicates recent recharge. Gas emission in recent volcanoes increase the sulfate content of atmospheric deposition and this is reflected in local groundwater. The chemical composition and concentration of spring waters are the result of meteoric water evapoconcentration, water-rock interaction, and mainly the dissolution of old and buried evaporitic deposits. Groundwater flow is mostly shallow due to a low permeability ignimbrite layer of regional extent, which also hinders brine spreading below and around the lake. High deep temperatures near the recent Tuyajto volcano explain the high dissolved silica contents and the delta O-18 shift to heavier values found in some of the spring waters. Laguna Tuyajto is a terminal lake where salts cumulate, mostly halite, but some brine transfer to the Salar de Aguas Calientes-3 cannot be excluded. The hydrogeological behavior of Laguna Tuyajto constitutes a model to understand the functioning of many other similar basins in other areas in the Andean Altiplano. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Jiang, HC; Ding, ZL				Jiang, Hanchao; Ding, Zhongli			Eolian grain-size signature of the Sikouzi lacustrine sediments (Chinese Loess Plateau): Implications for Neogene evolution of the East Asian winter monsoon	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												In order to explore the Neogene evolution of East Asian winter monsoon circulation, grain-size analysis was conducted on the Neogene Sikouzi section, Guyuan, Ningxia, China, a relatively monsoon-sensitive region. The results show that most of the particles are fine, the sand-bearing samples (median grain size [Md] >63 mu m) are less than 6.4%, and that all the grain-size distribution curves of representative samples have a similar pattern to those of eolian dust sediments on the Chinese Loess Plateau. Rare earth element (REE) patterns of eight samples from the Sikouzi section are all characterized by light (L) REE enrichments, relatively flat heavy (H) REE patterns, and slight negative Eu anomalies, similar to those of loess and the average upper continental crust. These lines of evidence point to a windblown origin of the Sikouzi fine sediments. Based on previous studies, the 10-70 mu m fraction of the Sikouzi sediments is mainly transported by the East Asian winter monsoon, and an increase in content of the 10-70 mu m fraction reflects strengthening of the winter monsoon. In contrast, sand grains in samples of Md >63 mu m are probably brought into the study area by rivers and streams linked with precipitation enhancement. According to stratigraphic variations in content of various fractions of the Sikouzi grain-size record, the Neogene evolution of the East Asian monsoon circulation can be divided into three stages. During the period 20.1-12.0 Ma, the 10-70 mu m fraction holds the lowest values, whereas sand content usually shows high percent-ages, denoting a weak winter monsoon and a strong summer monsoon. After 12.0 Ma, the 10-70 mu m fraction increased substantially and remained at high values, while sand content showed a marked decline, indicating that the winter monsoon strengthened dramatically and the summer monsoon declined significantly. From 4.3 to 0.07 Ma, the winter monsoon strengthened further, as evidenced by the gradual increase in content of the 10-70 mu m fraction. This inference agrees well with the timing of glaciation development in the Northern Hemisphere. During the early to middle Miocene, the high values of both Md and sand content are mainly distribute in five intervals, 19.8-18.8 Ma, 18.0-17.5 Ma, 16.7-15.6 Ma, 14.3-13.7 Ma, and 13.0-12.0 Ma, corresponding to five periods of intense precipitation. The interval from 16.7 to 15.6 Ma is well correlated with the middle Miocene climatic optimum determined by the well-known Miocene Shanwang biota from eastern China. As for the other four periods, it is speculated that episodic growth of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet possibly shifted atmospheric fronts such as the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and thus carried water vapor further northward, leading to increases in regional precipitation on the northern midlatitude continent, including North China.					; Jiang, Hanchao/ABG-2653-2020	Jiang, Hanchao/0000-0003-3391-4477; 													0016-7606					MAY-JUN	2010	122	5-6					843	854		10.1130/B26583.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/B26583.1													WOS:000278350800014

Fish from Rouyn-Noranda began rapid growth at a young age, whereas fish from Sudbury lakes showed slow growth rates between ages 0-3, after which growth rates improved. Fish from contaminated lakes grew faster and died younger than fish from reference lakes in both contamination gradients. Fish from Sudbury had lower condition than in Rouyn-Noranda, higher condition occurred in summer than spring, and fish from contaminated lakes had lower condition than those from cleaner lakes. Tissue Zn concentrations were correlated with fish condition and showed strong temporal stability. However, it is more likely that Zn covariates, such as Cd or Cu (which were more temporally variable) influenced condition, suggesting that long-term, broad-scale processes are more important than short-term, lake-specific processes for establishing growth patterns, longevity, and fish condition in metal-contaminated systems. Results from this study reveal that fish condition must be interpreted in the light of regional, seasonal, and other factors that can potentially influence fish growth patterns. Ecological risk assessments that fail to take these factors into account may draw erroneous conclusions about risk to indigenous populations.

J	Silow, EA				Silow, EA			The use of two lumped models for the analysis of consequences of external influences an the Lake Baikal ecosystem	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												The application of two lumped models to the prediction of the anthropogenic changes in the ecosystem of Lake Baikal is described. The first model is the static size conversion model, describing the changes in the ecosystem caused by a conservative pollutant present in sub-lethal concentrations. The second one is the model of the ecosystem disturbances. It is based on the data of field experiments and describes the interaction of the ecosystem components with the nutrients and phenolic compounds in the under-ice and summer-autumn seasons. The static model has demonstrated the higher sensitivity of top trophic levels to external influences and necessity to take these levels into account during monitoring works. The model of the anthropogenic disturbances of the Lake Baikal ecosystem has shown higher sensitivity of under-ice community than summer one. The possible reasons are discussed. Exergy content is shown to decrease under the action of conservative pollutant and increase after addition of nutrients and phenolic compounds, reflecting the general shifts in ecosystem. The calculations of buffer capacities demonstrated that exergy buffer capacity seems to be more realistic one than biomass buffer capacity. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Salmonella shedding in cows	PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE												The objective of this study was to evaluate associations between herd characteristics and the isolation of Salmonella from dairy cows in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and New York. Study farms were 129 conventional and organic farms enrolled without regard to previous history of Salmonella infection. Herds were sampled at 2-month intervals over a 1-year period. This is the largest study to date on Salmonella shedding in dairy cows and the only study evaluating herd-level risk factors using longitudinal sampling to characterize Salmonella shedding on dairy farms. Salmonella was isolated in fecal samples from 1026 (4.9%) of 20,089 cows. Over the course of the study, 113 (87.6%) of 129 farms had at least one positive cow sample. Multi-variable logistic regression using the generalized estimating equations approach was used to test the association between herd-level risk factors and the dependent variable of within-herd prevalence by visit (number of Salmonella-positive cows/number of cows sampled) after adjustment for effects of herd size, season, state of origin, and the multiple sampling occasions per herd. Factors retained in the final model included lack of use of tiestall or stanchion facilities to house lactating cows (OR = 1.9; 95% CI: 1.1-3.3), not storing all purchased concentrate or protein feeds in an enclosed building (OR = 2.5; 95% CI: 1.3-4.9), not using monensin in weaned calf or bred heifer diets (OR = 3.2; 95% CI: 2.0-5.4), access of lactating or dry cows to surface water (e.g., lake, pond, river, or stream) (OR = 2.3; 95% CI: 1.3-3.9), disposal of manure in liquid form (slurry or irrigation, as opposed to disposal of manure by broadcast/solid spreader only) on owned or rented land (OR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.3-3.9), and cows eating or grazing of roughage from fields where manure was applied in solid or liquid form and not plowed under during the same growing season (OR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.0-3.0). A seasonal association was also present as cows were more likely to be Salmonella-positive in summer, spring, and fall compared to winter. Herd size was not associated with Salmonella shedding in the final multi-variable model. The herd-level risk factors identified in this study could potentially be implemented in Salmonella control programs on dairy farms. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Diatom response to the whole lake manipulation of a eutrophic urban impoundment	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Diatoms typically dominate during April and May in Ford Lake, a eutrophic urban impoundment in southeastern Michigan, USA, whereas cyanobacteria dominate during summer. To alter this, whole lake experiments were conducted during 2006 and 2008 in alternation with control years 2005 and 2007. In experimental years, water was withdrawn from the hypolimnion during summer to destabilize the stratified water column, promote deeper mixing, and reduce anoxia. In 2006, withdrawals occurred over a 6-week period with three discrete intervals, releasing 3 x 10(5) m(3) d(-1) for the first and third intervals, and 1.5 x 10(5) m(3) d(-1) for the second. In 2008, withdrawal occurred continuously for 6 weeks at a rate of 3 x 10(5) m(3) d(-1). In control years, water was released only from the epilimnion. Nuisance cyanobacteria replaced diatoms in control years when the lake became thermally stratified. Diatom response to experimentally induced mixing was examined with focus on 2008 as a model for future management. Selective withdrawal of hypolimnetic water destabilized the water column and promoted diatom summer blooms. Diatom success was greatest in 2008, with abundance reaching 10 mm(3) L-1 and persisting through spring and summer. Dominance peaks of diatoms were punctuated when Daphnia populations approached or exceeded 3 x 10(5) individuals m(-2).

In the summer and autumn, these parasitic copepods have high prevalence and intensity on pikeperch of more than 20 cm body length. Typically, Ergasilus establish themselves in the folds on the external surface of the operculum and on the base of the pectoral fins, and only a small proportion cling to the gill filaments. Infestation is rare and of low intensity in pikeperch of less than 20 cm body length. The Volga pikeperch (Stizostedion volgense) has low-intensity infestation irrespective of age. The lesions caused by copepods present on the operculum are restricted to the epithelium even if infestation is intensive.					; Szekely, Csaba/F-5246-2012; Székely, Csaba/V-2655-2019	Molnar, Kalman/0000-0002-6138-7929; Szekely, Csaba/0000-0001-8831-9099; 													0236-6290						1997	45	2					165	175											9270139					WOS:000168702800007

Resource partitioning across a trophic gradient between a freshwater fish and an intraguild exotic	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												The introduction of exotic species has the potential to cause resource competition with native species and may lead to competitive exclusion when resources are limiting. On the other hand, information is lacking to predict under what alternate trophic conditions coexistence may occur. Comparing diets of native yellow perch Perca flavescens and nonindigenous white perch Morone americana, we examined variation in resource partitioning and body condition across a prominent longitudinal nutrient gradient in Lake Erie (north-eastern United States, Canada). As measured with Analysis of Similarity and Schoener's index, diet similarity declined monotonically from west to east tracking declines in nutrients, productivity and relative abundance of both species. Additionally, diet similarity increased from spring through fall, following seasonal development of stratification and hypolimnetic hypoxia-phenomena which tend to increase spatial overlap between these species. Finally, relative weights of both species peaked in the Central Basin (relative weights > 0.85), which, on average, had intermediate values of prey diversity, ecosystem trophic status and water clarity. Our results highlight that native yellow perch coexist with invasive white perch under a wide range of trophic conditions. Of importance to fishery managers, mesotrophy in the Central Basin correlated with the highest body conditions and intermediate prey resource partitioning, although the effect size was small and variable. While competitive exclusion appears unlikely, the goal of reducing nutrient inputs in Lake Erie could affect not only the distributions of both species but also stakeholder decisions about where to fish.					; Keretz, Kevin/ABC-1086-2021; Schmitt, Joseph/AAC-3110-2021	Keretz, Kevin/0000-0002-4808-8350; Kraus, Richard/0000-0003-4494-1841; 													0906-6691	1600-0633				JUL	2021	30	3					320	333		10.1111/eff.12586	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12586		DEC 2020											WOS:000597973400001

The model was based on comprehensive indoor mesocosm experiments run at four temperature and three light regimes. It was driven by time-series of water temperature and irradiance, considered edible and less edible phytoplankton separately, and accounted for density-dependent grazing losses. It successfully reproduced the observed dynamics of well edible phytoplankton in the different temperature and light treatments. Four major factors influenced spring phytoplankton dynamics: temperature, light (cloudiness), grazing, and the success of overwintering phyto- and zooplankton providing the starting biomasses for spring growth. Our study predicts that increasing cloudiness as anticipated for warmer winters for the Baltic Sea region will retard phytoplankton net growth and reduce peak heights. Light had a strong direct effect in contrast to temperature. However, edible phytoplankton was indirectly strongly temperature-sensitive via grazing which was already important in early spring at moderately high algal biomasses and counter-intuitively provoked lower and later algal peaks at higher temperatures. Initial phyto- and zooplankton composition and biomass also had a strong effect on spring algal dynamics indicating a memory effect via the broadly under-sampled overwintering plankton community. Unexpectedly, increased initial phytoplankton biomass did not necessarily lead to earlier or higher spring blooms since the effect was counteracted by subsequently enhanced grazing. Increasing temperature will likely exhibit complex indirect effects via changes in overwintering phytoplankton and grazer biomasses and current grazing pressure. Additionally, effects on the phytoplankton composition due to the species-specific susceptibility to grazing are expected. Hence, we need to consider not only direct but also indirect effects, e.g. biotic interactions, when addressing climate change impacts.

Diet of mute swans in lower great lakes coastal marshes	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												During the past 30 years, normative mute swan (Cygnus olor) populations have greatly increased, and continue to increase, in the eastern United States and within the lower Great Lakes (LGL) region. As a result, there is much concern regarding impacts of mute swan on native waterfowl, aquatic plants, and marsh habitats. There are presently only limited dietary data for mute swans in North America and none exist for birds in the LGL region. Thus, in 2001, 2002, and 2004 we collected 132 mute swans from LGL coastal marshes in Ontario, Canada, to determine dietary composition and to evaluate 1) seasonal and sex-related variation in adult diets and 2) age-related dietary differences. Adult diets did not differ among years, collection sites, or seasons, but female diets contained more pondweed spp. (Potamogeton spp.) and less slender naiad (Najas flexilis) and common waterweed (Elodea canadensis) than did diets of males. Adult males, adult females, and cygnets had similar diets during summer and autumn. Overall, mute swan diets mainly consisted of above-ground biomass of pondweed spp., muskgrass (Chara vulgaris), coontail (Ceratophyllum demersum), slender naiad, common waterweed, wild celery (Vallisneria americana), and wild rice (Zizania palustris); below-ground parts of wild celery, sago pondweed (Stuckenia pectinatus), and arrowhead spp. (Sagittaria spp.) were eaten infrequently. Comparison of our findings with those of other diet studies suggested considerable dietary overlap between mute swans and several other species of native waterfowl. Thus, we suggest that mute swans have potential to compete with native waterfowl and impact aquatic plants that are important waterfowl foods within LGL coastal marshes. Further, our results can be used to assess which aquatic plant species may be most impacted by foraging activities of mute swans at other important waterfowl stopover and wintering sites in North America.

The collected data were compared with the data collected 21 years ago. Chlamydomonas microsphaerella, Cyclotella krammeri, C. glomerata, and Ceratium hirundinella were identified to be dominant several times during the study period. Species diversity and biomass of the phytoplankton were very low in spite of sufficient and high levels of nutrient concentrations. Maximum phytoplankton density levels were observed during summer and late autumn. Phytoplankton density was positively correlated with nutrients, temperature and pH, and it was negatively correlated with Secchi depth and dissolved oxygen. Phytoplankton growths were negatively affected from water transparency and high levels of water mass transport (circulation) and velocity in the lake.																			0006-3088	1336-9563				JUL	2006	61	4					339	345		10.2478/s11756-006-0062-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-006-0062-4													WOS:000241709700001

Autotrophic picoplankton of Lake Baikal: composition, abundance and structure	HYDROBIOLOGIA					3rd Symposium on Species in Ancient Lakes	SEP 02-07, 2002	Quincy, WA					Investigations of Baikalian phytoplankton in 1960s showed that some very small blue-green algae with a cell diameter of 1.5 mu m develop in great abundance in Lake Baikal in summer. They were described as a new endemic species - Synechocystis limnetica Popovsk. S. limnetica was found as mass dominant species of the autotrophic picoplankton. Knowledge on species composition of Baikalian picoplankton is limited to this species. Autotrophic picoplankton (APP) communities were studied monthly from 1997 to 2001 at the monitoring station in southern Lake Baikal. Microscopic examinations of picoplanktonic samples based on the fluorescence of pigments, cell morphology and ultrastructure revealed that Lake Baikal is dominated by chroococcoid phycoerythrin-rich cyanobacteria of genus Synechococcus. Cyanobacteria of this genus were represented by various morphotypes throughout the study: coccoid and ellipsoid Synechococcus spp. 0.85 x 1.1 mu m by size, constituting the main mass of autotrophic picoplankton, their proportion varying during the year from 74 to 97%; Synechococcus-species with short and long rod-shaped form of cells, reach maximum (8-18%) in the autumnal period. Endemic species of Lake Baikal - S. limnetica contribute 1-4% in APP communities. Baikalian APP was found to include free aggregated cells of Synechocystis- and Synechococcus-type, to 5% in autumn, as well as the colonial species Aphanothece clathrata f. brevis, the contribution of which to total autotrophic picoplankton fraction changes significantly in seasonal and annual aspects. Picoplanktonic green algae are not especially abundant in Lake Baikal, and, on average did not exceed 8% of the total APP. The sizes of picoalgae are 1.25 x 1.75 mu m, both single cells of green algae; aggregated forms are noted in the picoplankton. Maximal abundance of autotrophic picoplankton was registered in a near-surface layer in late July (7.36 x 105 cells ml(-1)), and the minimum number (2.03 x 10(4) cells ml(-1)) in May, during the period of spring isothermal mixing.					/J-3464-2018; Sorokovikova, Ekaterina/D-8694-2012; Belykh, Olga/J-3406-2018; Belykh, Olga/L-6880-2019	Sorokovikova, Ekaterina/0000-0002-1431-6546; Belykh, Olga/0000-0002-1188-7351; 													0018-8158					SEP 15	2006	568			1			9	17		10.1007/s10750-006-0340-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0340-8													WOS:000240688900003
J	Patterson, BR; Messier, F				Patterson, BR; Messier, F			Age and condition of deer killed by coyotes in Nova Scotia	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Coyote (Canis latrans) predation is a major source of mortality for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in many areas of northeastern North America. However, if coyotes primarily remove deer that would have died of other causes in the absence of predation (compensatory mortality), the impact of predation would be minimal regardless of the number of deer removed. We examined the carcasses of 102 white-tailed deer consumed by coyotes during winter in southwestern Nova Scotia (Queens County) and on Cape Breton Island from 1992 to 1997. Sixty-nine deer were victims of predation, five died of other natural causes, two were killed in coyote snares, two were killed on the road, two were shot and not recovered during the autumn hunting season, and one was shot and abandoned in early winter. The causes of death of the remaining 21 deer could not be determined. Fawns were overrepresented in the sample of coyote-killed deer on Cape Breton Island, but the age distribution of deer killed by coyotes in Queens County did not differ significantly from that of local road-killed deer. Femur marrow fat reserves of deer killed by coyotes appeared to be as good as or better than those of road-killed deer in the vicinity of each study area. During winter, coyotes often killed deer in situations where deer were disadvantaged either by deep snow or by poor footing on frozen lakes. This may help explain the general lack of selection of weaker animals. Our data are consistent with the idea that mortality due to coyote predation was largely additive to mortality due to other factors. However, manipulative experiments are needed to verify this conclusion.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				NOV	2003	81	11					1894	1898		10.1139/Z03-189	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/Z03-189													WOS:000188730300014
J	Gbah, MB; Murthy, RC				Gbah, MB; Murthy, RC			Characteristics of turbulent cross and alongshore momentum exchanges during a thermal bar episode in Lake Ontario	NORDIC HYDROLOGY												Time series flow data obtained during the thermal bar episode of 17 April to 24 May 1990 in Lake Ontario are analyzed to provide a kinematic description of the coastal flow and cross-margin exchange characteristics. A thermal bar is a shore-parallel front which separates descending waters at or near the fresh water temperature of maximum density (4 degrees C) during Spring and Fall seasons. Thermal bars are important because of their influence mixing, cross-shore exchanges, and the variability of biotic factors in coastal zones. The analysis shows that cross-frontal exchange coefficients, K-y, are nearly constant and consistently smaller than along-frontal counterparts, K-x, Moreover, these exchange coefficients are several orders of magnitude smaller than typical coastal and oceanic values in the absence of the bar. The turbulent kinetic energy represents less than 6% of the total kinetic energy in the flow. These results suggest that small-scale horizontal fluctuations and cross-frontal turbulent momentum exchanges are severely inhibited in the spring during the thermal bar.																			0029-1277						1998	29	1					57	72																WOS:000072324700004

To improve our understanding of physical and biogeochemical factors affecting CH4 dynamics in subtropical lakes, we examined vertical and seasonal profiles of dissolved CH4 and its carbon isotope ratio (C-13) and conducted incubation experiments to assess CH4 production and oxidation in the deep subtropical Fei-Tsui Reservoir (FTR; Taiwan). The mixing pattern of the FTR is essentially monomixis, but the intensity of winter vertical mixing changes with climatic conditions. In years with incomplete vertical mixing (does not reach the bottom) and subsequent strong thermal stratification resulting in profundal hypoxia, we observed increases in sedimentary CH4 production and thus profundal CH4 storage with the development of reducing conditions. In contrast, in years with strong winter vertical mixing to the bottom of the reservoir, CH4 production was suppressed under NO3--rich conditions, during which denitrifiers have the competitive advantage over methanogens. Diffusive emission from profundal CH4 storage appeared to be negligible due to the efficiency of CH4 oxidation during ascent through methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) activity. Most of the profundal CH4 was rapidly oxidized by MOB in both oxic and anoxic layers, as characterized by its carbon isotope signature. In contrast, aerobic CH4 production in the subsurface layer, which may be enhanced under high temperatures in summer, may account for a large portion of atmospheric CH4 emissions from this reservoir. Our CH4 profiling results provide valuable information for future studies predicting CH4 emissions from subtropical lakes with the progress of global warming.

BIOINDICATION POTENTIAL OF PHYTOPLANKTON FOR SEASONAL DYNAMICS EVALUATION IN THE SASYK RESERVOIR, UKRAINE	4TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE WATER RESOURCES AND WETLANDS	Water Resources and Wetlands				4th International Conference on Water Resources and Wetlands	SEP 05-09, 2018	Tulcea, ROMANIA	Romanian Limnogeog Assoc				Sasyk is an anthropogenically altered brackish-water reservoir that may serve as an example of desalination treatment of estuary and presents itself as an interesting research object for scientific investigations. Thus, the main aim of the present research composed in tracking ecological condition of Sasyk reservoir with the help of phytoplankton composition and bioindication methods. The sampling was carried out on 17 observation stations, most adequately representing the territory of the reservoir Seasons for it were chosen as summer (August) and autumn (November) 2013, in spring (May) and summer (July, August) 2014. For the investigation, 136 samples of plankton algae were analysed. The total list of all plankton algae found in the Sasyk reservoir through all seasons equalled 207 species and 215 infraspecific taxa. Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta divisions were prevailing groups over all seasons of the investigated years, which is common for season dynamics in that region. Quantitative characteristics of phytoplankton varied from 12.28 x 10(6) cells L-1 up to 360.645 x 10(6) cells L-1 (average amount varied from minimum value 27.476 x 10(6) cells L-1 to maximum 171.468 x 106 cells L-1) as for abundance over all seasons of investigated years and from 1.82 mg L-1 to 8.2 mg L-1 (minimum average - 3.23 mg L-1 and maximum - 4.59 mg L-1). The dominant complex species was formed by Dolichospermum flosaquae (Brebisson ex Bornet et Flahault) P.Wacklin, L.Hoffmann et J.Komarek, Aphanocapsa planctonica (G.M. Sm.) Komarek et Anagn., Limnothrix planctonica (Wolosz.) Meffert, Merismopedia punctata Meyen, Merismopedia tenuissima Lemmerm., and Oscillatoria amphibia J. Agardh ex Gomont. With the help of bioindicational analysis, it were revealed major variables based on algal species distributions over the seasons. The indicators reflected the response of aquatic ecosystem to temperature, salinity, acidity, water mass dynamics and oxygenation, organic pollution along with other habitat conditions. According to observations of the dynamics of bioindicators in 2013-2014, it can be concluded that Sasyk reservoir acquires features of a lake freshwater reservoir.

The Daphnia magna population in an intermittent, large shallow lake in Northern Germany has two major periods of sexual reproduction during the year, usually in May and late summer before the pond is drained. Assuming random mating during sexual reproduction, one might expect numerous clones to emerge from the ephippial hatchling pool. However, the multi-locus genotype composition was not significantly different among the ephippial hatchlings in both spring 1995 and 1996, and the adult populations in summer 1994, 1995 or 1996.																			0071-1128		3-510-47054-0				1998	52						185	194																WOS:000089402600013
J	Scott, RW; Sharma, S; Wang, XW; Quinlan, R				Scott, Ryan W.; Sharma, Sapna; Wang, Xiaowa; Quinlan, Roberto			The limnological response of Arctic deltaic lakes to alterations in flood regime	INLAND WATERS												Arctic freshwaters are being rapidly altered by global climate change with consequences to hydrology, biogeochemistry, and ecology, but in many cases the trajectory of these changes is poorly understood. We collected a unique 5-year time series of major ion, nutrient, and trace metal data from lakes in the Mackenzie Delta (NT, Canada) to examine limnological changes during a period of variable flood conditions, including years of recent historic high and low peak river levels. Previous work in the Mackenzie Delta has established that lake water chemistry is strongly related to connection time with the river during the period of spring ice-jam flooding or via channel connections through the growing season. We show that differences in peak spring water levels explain differences in lake chemistry in lakes isolated from the channel during the summer. Isolated, macrophyte-rich lakes in the Mackenzie Delta have been shown to be CO2 absorbers during summer. We demonstrate a response to alterations in flood regime by variables related to macrophyte productivity in isolated lakes with the greatest connectivity to the river that suggests productivity declines with increasing connection time. The connectivity of low-elevation lakes, which represent a majority of lake number and area in the Mackenzie Delta, has been projected to increase with climate change. Our work suggests that an increase in connection time may decrease the macrophyte productivity of these lakes, with potential consequences to the CO2 balance of individual lakes and the Mackenzie Delta as a whole.

In this paper we explore the linkages among past climate, vegetation, and fire regimes using a high-resolution pollen and charcoal reconstruction from Morris Pond located on the Markagunt Plateau in southwestern Utah, USA. A regime shift detection algorithm was applied to background charcoal accumulation to define where statistically significant shifts in fire regimes occurred. The early Holocene was characterized by greater amounts of summer precipitation and less winter precipitation than modern. Ample forest fuel and warm summer temperatures allowed for large fires to occur. The middle Holocene was a transitional period between vegetation conditions and fire disturbance. The late Holocene climate is characterized as cool and wet reflecting an increase in snow cover, which reduced opportunities for fire despite increased availability of fuels. Similarities between modern forest fuel availability and those of the early Holocene suggest that warmer summers projected for the 21st century may yield substantial increases in the recurrence and ecological impacts of fire when compared to the fire regime of the last millennium.

J	KRABBENHOFT, DP; WEBSTER, KE				KRABBENHOFT, DP; WEBSTER, KE			TRANSIENT HYDROGEOLOGICAL CONTROLS ON THE CHEMISTRY OF A SEEPAGE LAKE	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												A solute mass balance method was used to estimate groundwater inflow and outflow rates for Nevins Lake, Michigan, a seepage lake in the upper peninsula that historically has shown extremely variable water chemistry compared with most other seepage lakes. A 4-year Study (1989-1992) of the hydrology and geochemistry of Nevins Lake and its contiguous groundwater system revealed that changes in the mass of dissolved solutes are the result of annual hydraulic gradient reversals. A pronounced acidification of Nevins Lake from 1986 to 1988 was likely caused by drought-induced diminished groundwater inflow rates. In this study, dissolved calcium (the major cation in water of Nevins Lake, groundwater, and precipitation) was used for estimating mass flow rates. During the 1989-1992 period, Nevins Lake showed a reproducible annual cycle in calcium mass. Immediately following spring snowmelt and the resulting hydraulic gradient reversal, the mass of dissolved calcium in the lake increases rapidly, and then it decreases steadily throughout the summer and early fall, at which time the lake becomes hydraulically mounded and receives no groundwater inflow. Groundwater flow rates estimated by the solute mass balance method are sensitive to assumed solute concentrations in discharging groundwater. Pore water samples from the lake bed are shown to be more representative of water discharging to the lake than are samples from piezometers near the lake shore, but spatial and temporal variability in pore water chemistry must be considered. Stable isotope analyses (O-18 and H-2) of lake water, groundwater, and pore water samples show that water discharging to Nevins Lake in the spring is entirely recycled lake water, and no groundwater derived from terrestrial recharge reaches the lake. The conceptual model formulated during this study linking lake chemistry and the contiguous groundwater system and general groundwater flow patterns surrounding highly transient lake systems are likely transferable to other similar systems.

Comparative biology and population mixing among local, coastal and offshore Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) in the North Sea, Skagerrak, Kattegat and western Baltic	PLOS ONE												The population structure of Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) from 13 local, coastal and offshore areas of the North Sea, Skagerrak, Kattegat and western Baltic (northeast Atlantic) was studied using biological and environmental data from 1970-2015. The objective was to identify distinct populations by comparing variability in the temporal and spatial phenotypic characteristics and evaluate the potential for mixing of populations in time and space. The populations varied in biological characteristics such as mean vertebral counts (VS), growth and maturity ogives. Generalized additive models indicated temporally stable VS in the North Sea and western Baltic, whereas intra-annual temporal variation of VS occurred in other areas. High variability of VS within a population was not affected by environmental factors such as temperature and salinity. Consequently, seasonal VS variability can be explained by the presence or absence of herring populations as they migrate between areas. The three main populations identified in this paper correspond to the three managed stocks in this area: Norwegian spring spawners (NSS), western Baltic spring spawners (WBSS) and North Sea autumn spawners (NSAS). In addition, several local populations were identified in fjords or lakes along the coast, but our analyses could not detect direct mixing of local populations with the three main populations. Our results highlight the importance of recognizing herring dynamics and understanding the mixing of populations as a challenge for management of herring.

J	MOULTON, DW; WELLER, MW				MOULTON, DW; WELLER, MW			BIOLOGY AND CONSERVATION OF THE LAYSAN DUCK (ANAS-LAYSANENSIS)	CONDOR												A 2-summer, mark-recapture study of laysan ducks (A. laysanensis) resulted in a population estimate of 510 birds with > 90% of the birds marked. Individuals seemed long-lived with the low reproductive rate common to K-selected species. Nesting occurred in spring and early summer in spite of the subtropical climatic regime. Nests were mainly in clumps of grass (Eragrostis) and hatching success was low. Duckling mortality due to exposure was common during rainstorms, but no direct predation was noted. Pair bond behavior resembled that of continental populations of mallards (A. platyrhynchos) but males tended to return to mates after brood-rearing or loss of brood or nest. Year-to-year mate switching occurred more than half the time, even when previous mates were alive. Males did not assist in care of the brood. During spring and summer, ducks of all ages fed heavily on invertebrates. Adult brine flies (Neoscatella sexnotata) on mud flats around the lake were the major food of ducks of all ages. Radio-marked pairs consistently used the same upland areas during the day. At night, most ducks moved to a lake on the island to feed and to drink in communal areas at freshwater seeps. Feeding and drinking was dominantly crepuscular and nocturnal at the lake, but laying hens or hens with broods sometimes fed throughout the day as well. Conservation of the species requires monitoring of duck populations and habitat conditions, and surveillance for accidentally introduced predators such as rats. The lake is vital to the success of the species and it is unlikely that a significant population could survive on terrestrial resources alone. Intensive management will be necessary only if blowing sands fill the lake, predators become established or the vegetation is seriously damaged in some way.																				1938-5129					1984	86	2					105	117		10.2307/1367021	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1367021													WOS:A1984SU83000001

APA is almost never investigated in PO4-rich estuaries, since very low activities are expected to occur. As a consequence, microbial mineralization of organic phosphorus into PO4 has often been ignored in estuaries. In this study, we examined the importance of potential APA and the associated microbial dynamics in two estuaries, the Aulne and the Elorn (Northwestern France), presenting two different levels of PO4 concentrations. Unexpected high potential APA was observed in both estuaries. Values ranged from 50 to 506 nmol L-1 h(-1), which range is usually found in very phosphorus-limited environments. High potential APA values were observed in the oligohaline zone (salinity 5-15) in spring and summer, corresponding to a PO4 peak and a maximum bacterial production of particle-attached bacteria. In all cases, high potential APA was associated with high suspended particulate matter and total particulate phosphorus. The low contribution of the 0.2-1 mu m fraction to total APA, the strong correlation between particulate APA and bacterial biomass, and the close relationship between the production of particle-attached bacteria and APA, suggested that high potential APA is mainly due to particle-attached bacteria. These results suggest that the microbial mineralization of organic phosphorus may contribute to an estuarine PO4 production in spring and summer besides physicochemical processes.					; Ragueneau, Olivier/H-6021-2017; leynaert, aude/A-4211-2010; Leynaert, Aude/A-4211-2010	Raimonet, Melanie/0000-0001-5953-3950; Ragueneau, Olivier/0000-0001-8598-1730; Leynaert, Aude/0000-0001-8226-3733; Labry, Claire/0000-0002-3271-9533													0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	2016	61	4					1513	1529		10.1002/lno.10315	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10315													WOS:000383622900026
J	Dupuis, AP; Hann, BJ				Dupuis, Alain P.; Hann, Brenda J.			Climate change, diapause termination and zooplankton population dynamics: an experimental and modelling approach	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Earlier spring warming as predicted for climate change will alter combinations of water temperature and photoperiod that act as emergence cues for zooplankton resting stages. As a result, water temperature cue thresholds will be experienced at shorter photoperiods, a variable independent of weather variations. Also, light intensity, another potentially important cue for zooplankton emergence, could decrease in many lakes if symptoms of climate change resemble those of eutrophication. 2. We designed a laboratory experiment to test the effects of three factors, temperature (6, 9 and 12 degrees C), photoperiod (13L : 11D and 16L : 8D) and light intensity (20 and 35 mu E m(-2) s(-1)) on hatchling abundance and timing of hatching of daphniids (Daphnia ambigua) and rotifers (Keratella spp. and Synchaeta pectinata) from resting eggs. Further, we investigated the implications of potential changes in hatching dynamics, following variations in hatching cues, on zooplankton spring population development using predator-prey simulation models. 3. For hatchling abundance and timing of hatching, photoperiod had a significant effect for D. ambigua but not rotifers. Daphnia ambigua hatchling abundance decreased by 50% when incubated at conditions mimicking early spring (12 degrees C + 13-h photoperiod) compared to a later spring (12 degrees C + 16-h photoperiod). Light intensity has a significant effect only for S. pectinata, producing greater hatchling abundance at lower light intensity. 4. Simulation models suggest that in contrast to a later spring, an early warming produces a shift in spring zooplankton community composition, from daphniid to rotifer dominance. These patterns are primarily driven by differential zooplankton emergence response with variations in temperature-photoperiod cues. 5. Overall, our laboratory experiments and simulation models suggest that lakes with strong dependence on the 'resting egg-bank', characteristic of many shallow north-temperate lakes or in years with low winter survivorship of adult zooplankton, may be most susceptible to climate change. Further, fewer large grazers such as daphniids with an earlier spring may result in less control of cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic lakes.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				FEB	2009	54	2					221	235		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.02103.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.02103.x													WOS:000262470300001

The "Parchi Verbano Ticino" project (2019-2021, ID: 481668) was the driving force to fine-tune the monitoring and management system of multidisciplinary information (chemistry, hydro-morphology, macro- and meio-fauna monitoring). The study reveals that water level fluctuations in Lake Maggiore, sometimes characterized by measurable changes in water levels, have remarkable effects on littoral habitats and on the structure and function of macro- and meiofaunal assemblages living there. Overall, this study provides insights into the potential impacts of Lake Maggiore water management strategy on freshwater littoral ecosystems during late spring-early summer, and emphasizes the need for a comprehensive understanding of the lake ecosystem dynamics. Thanks to the results achieved, publicly endorsed water management rules will be stated, for the late spring-early summer period, considering frequency and amplitude of water level fluctuations as crucial factors in management plans to mitigate their impacts. The endorsed rules turn out to be a negotiated compromise between the maintenance of ecosystem services and the protection of littoral life below water.

In the present study, the composition of benthic diatoms and their diversity metrics were determined and compared along the shoreline of the lake in spring 2013 and autumn 2014. Overall, 118 taxa classified in 52 genera were found, of which 15 species belonged to threat categories of the Red List for Central Europe. Species richness (33 +/- 4), Shannon diversity (2.47 +/- 0.23), and species composition did not show any differences between different basins. Besides the spatial homogeneity, considerable temporal differences were observed. In spring 2013, species number was significantly lower, while the proportion of Mediophyceae species was higher due to the high abundance of Stephanodiscus rugosus and S. neoastraea. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) showed significant differences between samples from the two years for the total and the Bacillariophyceae species composition. TP concentration of water samples suggested a mesotrophic status and most of the diatom taxa were considered eutraphentic and meso-eutraphentic.

J	JEWSON, DH				JEWSON, DH			SIZE-REDUCTION, REPRODUCTIVE STRATEGY AND THE LIFE-CYCLE OF A CENTRIC DIATOM	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON SERIES B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												The life cycle of Aulacoseira subarctica (O. Muller) Haworth in Lough Neagh, Northern Ireland, is described. Cell numbers can reach up to 17 000 per millilitre in spring. Most cells sediment to the bottom after silica limitation and go into a resting state during summer. The inoculum in autumn partly comes from resuspension, with the surviving cells (0.5-5%) continuing to grow through the winter, doubling every one to two weeks. The population goes through a size reduction and regeneration cycle linked to sexual reproduction. Gametes are only produced in narrower cells (3.8-7.4-mu-m diameter), usually after interruptions in growth caused by low light conditions (surface irradiance 100-150-mu-E m-2 s-1), but availability of nutrients, especially silica and nitrogen, is also important. Even the highest densities of auxospores (20 ml-1) represent only a small proportion of the total cells present (0.16%). Size regeneration results in initial cells with diameters (14.8 +/- 2-mu-m) about three times those of the parent. Larger parent cells usually give rise to larger initial cells. Subsequently, cell division leads to a decrease in population diameter, because of the way new valves are laid down below the girdle bands. Reductions are largest in broader cells (0.32-mu-m per division) and gradually decrease as cells get narrower. Occasionally large reductions, up to 1-mu-m, follow periods of environmental stress. By combining these results with studies of changes in cell size (width, length and volume) in related individuals along filaments, it was possible to explain there have been difficulties in applying the MacDonald-Pfitzer hypothesis to natural populations. Theoretically, the life cycle in L. Neagh might extend over 100 divisions or 15 years but, in practice, cells reach a sexually inducible size in 4-6 years. The discrepancy is because environmental factors (e.g. sedimentation, resuspension, parasitism, etc.) are also important in size selectivity. The interaction of these factors, combined with intermittent sexual reproduction at low frequencies, results in a relatively stable population size distribution, where there are always Some cells in the size range in which sexual differentiation can be induced. Overall. the results demonstrate, that for a full understanding of diatom population dynamics, it is important to quantify events over complete life cycles.																			0962-8436					MAY 29	1992	336	1277					191	213		10.1098/rstb.1992.0056	http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.1992.0056													WOS:A1992HY52100006
J	Paillisson, JM; Reeber, S; Marion, L				Paillisson, JM; Reeber, S; Marion, L			Bird assemblages as bio-indicators of water regime management and hunting disturbance in natural wet grasslands	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Responses of the waterbird community to the management regime of a wet grassland system (primarily small changes in the water regime but also hunting disturbance) in a large floodplain lake, Grand-Lieu, were studied during three consecutive years (winter and spring in 1998-2000). These temporarily flooding grasslands (1100 ha) constituted a very important feeding area by supporting large flocks of waterbird species (52 regular spp., totalling up to 14250-22850 birds). A global similar seasonal pattern in the presence of waterbird species was recorded whatever the year. The March-May period was a key phase with the maximum species richness (42-48 spp.) and the maximum abundance (30-40% of the total according to year, essentially Anseriformes). Late in spring Ciconiiformes and to a lesser extent some waders exploit this feeding area. Nevertheless some changes in bird assemblages were exhibited according to the management regime (a decreasing spring water level from 1998 to 2000, and an exceptional hunting ban in January 2000, instead of an usual stop in late February). The hunting disturbance clearly limited diurnal accessibility of ducks to wet grasslands in January and February 1998 and 1999. Also, the duck population in flooding grasslands increased by 55-65% in January 2000 when hunting was prohibited and in the same time the richness species grew from 14-19 spp. up to 23 spp. in 2000. The overall impact of a high spring water level on waterbirds as in 1998 and to a lesser extent in 1999 (with respectively 54 and 35 cm of mean water level against 25 cm in 2000) was an increase in diving fish-eating birds and larger flocks of resting gulls. Conversely these conditions, notably a reduced period with a spring water level under 25 cm in spring (20 days in 1998-1999 instead of 40 days in 2000) were adverse to numerous ground-feeding waterbirds (Ciconiiformes and waders) that require shallow waters. This study showed that limitation of human disturbance and moderate flooding of wet grasslands can increase their attractiveness for numerous species of high conservation status.

It is reported from 17 species of principal, accessory, and occasional definitive hosts (new record in Moxostoma carinatum) and from 13 species of paratenic hosts (new records in Amia calva, Ictalurus punctatus, Lepomis cyanellus, Pomoxis nigromaculatus). Infection patterns were influenced by fish species, feeding behavior, temperature, and availability of intermediate host, type of water body, fish movement, and changes in fish host community. Host roles are not fixed but are often interchangeable. A seasonal cycle in prevalence, intensity, and maturation was evident, with greatest abundance and maturation during summer and recruitment during summer and autumn. Recruitment of new infections, development, and release of eggs, however, occurred all year. Sex ratio changed from near equal in new infections to one more highly in favor of females in older adults. Female fish were considerably more frequently and heavily infected than males. No relationship with fish age (size) was evident. Worms were mostly attached in posterior intestinal locations but initial establishment sites correlated with temperature. Translocation of P. bulbocolli due to competitive exclusion in concurrent infections was not observed. The significance of extraintestinal larval forms in the cycle of transmission was noted.																			0022-3395	1937-2345				APR	1987	73	2					278	289		10.2307/3282079	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3282079								3585622					WOS:A1987H834100004

Nine prey species were found in the stomachs, the most important being small schooling fish species: perch Perca fluviatilis, roach Rutilus rutilus, vendace Coregonus albula, smelt Osmerus eperlanus and ruff Acerina cernua. The importance of crustaceans in the diet of the ringed seal in Lake Saimaa is insignificant. Length of the intestinal tract of the Saimaa ringed seal is relatively shorter than those of marine ringed seals. In cafeteria tests on one captive seal the preferred fish species were vendace and smelt. The captive seal displayed clear seasonal variation in feeding activity. The consumption of fish was lowest in springtime and highest in autumn and winter.																			0001-7051					DEC	1999	44	4					443	450		10.4098/AT.arch.99-42	http://dx.doi.org/10.4098/AT.arch.99-42													WOS:000084604300010

In the 1960's mist netting at bird-banding stations revealed Saw-whets to be a regular, uncommon migrant. Passive mist netting was initiated at the Little Suamico Ornithological Station in 1971. Our Saw-whet Owl experiences were similar to other banding stations until 1986, when we developed an "audiolure". This technique, utilizing an amplified Saw-whet "solicitation" courtship call increased our annual catch more than tenfold. Now in use at major banding stations in the western Great Lakes area, this technique has resulted in over 2,000 Saw-whets being netted each autumn. Currently at Little Suamico 5 percent of adult owls netted have been previously banded. Approximately 40 percent of owls netted are northbound. Direct interstation recoveries reveal that Saw-whets migrate slowly at our latitude and often not in the expected southbound direction. Adults move greater distances per night than immatures. More than 200 recoveries and recaptures in subsequent years have been generated at Little Suamico since 1986. Migration dates and nightly travel distances suggest that many of the Saw-whet Owls that we encounter spend the winter in Wisconsin.																			0363-616X						1997	190						167	172																WOS:000077557600025

To evaluate their post-pandemic environmental impacts, five categories of drugs were detected in lakes and WWTP-river-estuary system near hospitals of Jinyintan, Huoshenshan and Leishenshan in the three regions (J, H and L) (Regions J, H and L) in Wuhan, China. The total amount of PPCPs (ranging from 2.61 to 1122 ng/L in water and 0.11 to 164 ng/g dry weight in sediments) were comparable to historical reports in Yangtze River basin, whereas the detection frequency and concentrations of ribavirin and azithromycin were higher than those of historical studies. The distribution of concerned drugs varied with space, season, media and water types: sampling sites located at WWTPs-river-estuary system around two hospitals (Regions L and J) usually had relatively high waterborne contamination levels, most of which declined in autumn; lakes had relatively low waterborne contamination levels in summer but increased in autumn. The potential risks of detected PPCPs were further evaluated using the multiple-level ecological risk assessment (MLERA): sulfamethoxazole and azithromycin were found to pose potential risks to aquatic organisms according to a semi-probabilistic approach and classified as priority pollutants based on an optimized risk assessment. In general, the COVID-19 pandemic did not cause serious pollution in lakes and WWTPs-river estuary system in Wuhan City. However, the increased occurrence of certain drugs and their potential ecological risks need further attention. A strict source control policy and an advanced monitoring and risk warning system for emergency response and long-term risk control of PPCPs is urgent. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The determining factor for an AIV to transmit through diffusion in water is the term of viability of the virus in the water body. To better understand the perpetuation of AIV in natural water bodies, and thus the risks of AIV spread and transmission via such bodies, we systematically studied the inactivation dynamics of two AIV strains (H5N1 and H9N2) at different temperatures in water bodies of important migratory bird habitats within China (Dongting Lake, Poyang Lake, the Hubei segment of the Yangtze River and Qinghai Lake). We also studied the impact of water-borne micro-organisms on the perpetuation of AIV. Our findings indicated that water is very likely an important route for the epidemic spread of AIV, especially during the autumn and winter seasons. In addition, water-borne micro-organisms might antagonize the persistence of AIV.					; ZHANG, Hongbo/S-7439-2016	Zhang, Hongbo/0000-0003-3316-9403; 													0022-1317	1465-2099				JUL	2014	95		7				1430	1435		10.1099/vir.0.063438-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.063438-0								24671753					WOS:000341171300002

Several episodes of density current intrusions are documented. Water temperatures and salinities measured near the bottom of a 10 m deep Minneapolis lake during the late winter warming periods in 1989, 1990, 1991, and 1995 show significant rapid changes which are correlated with observed higher air temperatures and snowmelt runoff. The snowmelt runoff entering this particular lake (Ryan Lake) has increased electrical conductivity, salinity, and density. The source of the salinity is the sal, spread on urban streets in the winter. Heating of littoral waters in spring may also contribute to the occurrence of the sinking flows, but is clearly not the only cause.																			0043-1370					DEC	1997	33	6					1363	1374		10.1111/j.1752-1688.1997.tb03559.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.1997.tb03559.x													WOS:000071498000018

Comparison of routine metabolic rates of the stygobite, Gammarus acherondytes (Amphipoda: Gammaridae) and the stygophile, Gammarus troglophilus	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Reduced metabolic rate among cave organisms compared with surface species has long been suggested as an adaptation to food shortage in cave environments. However, comparisons of metabolic rates between species have not often included closely related surface and cave species. By measuring metabolic rate across three seasons and over a range of body sizes, we examined the hypothesis that the routine metabolic rate of Gammarus acherondytes, a federally listed stygobitic amphipod, is lower than that of the closely related stygophilic Gammarus troglophilus. To determine if human activities increased the supply of organic matter to caves, we also examined the relationship between residential development and bacterial contamination in water wells. 2. For G. acherondytes, the slope of the overall relationship between oxygen consumption and body dry mass did not differ from zero and did not vary seasonally, whereas for G. troglophilus it was positive and higher in summer than in winter and spring. These results provide insights into a potential novel metabolic adaptation among stygobites. Higher metabolic rate in young G. acherondytes would allow efficient use of typically transient energy sources and a low metabolic rate at larger body sizes would increase survival through periods of food scarcity. 3. The number of wells with faecal coliform contamination was weakly but positively correlated with the number of residential building permits, indicating that surface land-use changes probably increase the availability of energy in groundwater systems inhabited by G. acherondytes. This may give stygophilic animals, with higher metabolic rates, a competitive advantage in the caves, thus reducing the abundance of stygobites such as G. acherondytes.

It has been shown that bacteria, viruses and protozoan grazers are dominant in terms of abundance and biomass. The frequent interactions between these microbiological compartments are responsible for strong trophic links from dissolved organic matter to higher trophic levels, via heterotrophic bacteria, which form the basis for the important biogeochemical roles of microbial food webs in aquatic ecosystems. To gain a better understanding of the interactions between bacteria, viruses and flagellates in lacustrine ecosystems, we investigated the effect of protistan bacterivory on bacterial abundance, production and structure [determined by 16S rRNA PCR-DGGE], and viral abundance and activity of two lakes of contrasting trophic status. Four experiments were conducted in the oligotrophic Lake Annecy and the mesotrophic Lake Bourget over two seasons (early spring vs. summer) using a fractionation approach. In situ dark vs. light incubations were performed to consider the effects of the different treatments in the presence and absence of phototrophic activity. Results: The presence of grazers (i.e. < 5-mu m small eukaryotes) affected viral production positively in all experiments, and the stimulation of viral production (compared to the treatment with no eukaryotic predators) was more variable between lakes than between seasons, with the highest value having been recorded in the mesotrophic lake (+30%). Viral lysis and grazing activities acted additively to sustain high bacterial production in all experiments. Nevertheless, the stimulation of bacterial production was more variable between seasons than between lakes, with the highest values obtained in summer (+33.5% and +37.5% in Lakes Bourget and Annecy, respectively). The presence of both predators (nanoflagellates and viruses) did not seem to have a clear influence upon bacterial community structure according to the four experiments. Conclusions: Our results highlight the importance of a synergistic effect, i.e. the positive influence of grazers on viral activities in sustaining (directly and indirectly) bacterial production and affecting composition, in both oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes.

Warming advances top-down control and reduces producer biomass in a freshwater plankton community	ECOSPHERE												Global warming has been shown to affect ecosystems worldwide. Warming may, for instance, disrupt plant herbivore synchrony and bird phenology in terrestrial systems, reduce primary production in oceans, and promote toxic cyanobacterial blooms in freshwater lakes. Responses of communities will not only depend on direct species-specific temperature effects, but also on indirect effects related to bottom-up and top-down processes. Here, we investigated the impact of warming on freshwater phytoplankton community dynamics, and assessed the relative contribution of nutrient availability, fungal parasitism, and grazing therein. For this purpose, we performed an indoor mesocosm experiment following seasonal temperature dynamics of temperate lakes and a warmed (+ 4 degrees C) scenario from early spring to late summer. We assessed phytoplankton biomass, C:N:P stoichiometry and community composition, dissolved nutrient availabilities, fungal parasite (i.e., chytrid) prevalence, and zooplankton abundance. Warming led to an overall reduction in phytoplankton biomass as well as lower C: P and N: P ratios, while phytoplankton community composition remained largely unaltered. Warming resulted in an earlier termination of the diatom spring bloom, and an epidemic of its fungal parasite ended earlier as well. Furthermore, warming advanced zooplankton phenology, leading to an earlier top-down control on phytoplankton in the period after the spring bloom. Linear model analysis showed that most of the observed variance in phytoplankton biomass was related to seasonal temperature dynamics in combination with zooplankton abundance. Our findings showed that warming advanced grazer phenology and reduced phytoplankton biomass, thereby demonstrating how bottom-up and top-down related processes may shape future phytoplankton dynamics.

It is often difficult to capture fine-scale climate and glacial changes in high-altitude mountainous areas due to the harsh natural environment and the extreme lack of observational sites. Based on high-altitude meteorological stations erected on the eastern shore of Aqikkule Lake (AQK) and at the terminus of Shenshechuan Glacier (SSG), as well as on mass balance data from SSG, the characteristics and correlation of temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, precipitation, wind speed and direction of the two regions, and the mass balance in the ablation area of SSG from 30 May 2022 to 18 May 2023 were analyzed, and the average melting depth of SSG was simulated. The results indicate the following: (1) The average annual temperature of AQK and the terminus of SSG is -3.7 degrees C and -7.7 degrees C, respectively, and the vertical lapse rate of temperature in the summer half of the year is greater than that in the winter half of the year. Precipitation timing has a great influence on daily temperature differences. (2) Precipitation in both places is concentrated in summer; the glaciers in this area are of the summer recharge type, and precipitation has a significant reducing effect on the solar incident radiation and increases the relative humidity in this region. (3) AQK and SSG both have local circulation development, in the area of AQK all year round due to the lake effect, while the terminus of SSG only has the development of valley winds in the summer, being controlled in the winter by the westerly wind belt. (4) The average mass balance value of the ablation area of SSG was -1786 mm as measured by the range poles method. The average annual ablation depth of SSG simulated by using the empirical formula was 587-597 mm, which is not large compared with other glacier areas in the Tibetan Plateau, and it has the characteristics of typical continental-type glaciers.

Ttirloughs - Ireland's unique wetland habitat	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Turloughs are karst wetland ecosystems that are virtually unique to Ireland. Flooding annually in autumn through springs and fissures in the underlying limestone and draining in the springtime, often through the same fissures or swallow-holes, they have been described as 'temporal ecotones'. Over 300 have been documented. They are priority habitats in the EU Habitats Directive and support a variety of wet grassland and fen type vegetation. Though the vegetation has been recorded and mapped for over 80 turloughs, records for invertebrates are more sporadic. Characteristic species include some aquatic species-often benefiting from the absence of fish-, and many wetland terrestrial species, including carabid beetles that are rare on a European scale. Due to their shallow nature and the full vegetation cover of the basin, turloughs can host internationally significant numbers of visiting winter wildfowl, particularly whooper swans. The variety of plant and invertebrate communities between turloughs is primarily due to different hydrogeomorphological characteristics, but also depends on the range of grazing practices on turloughs. Since these often vary within a turlough basin, this helps maintain within-turlough biodiversity. The main threat to turloughs in the past was drainage, but pollution by nutrients is also now potentially detrimental. However, a more recent and important threat may be the cessation of farming within turloughs. As potentially threatened wetlands of European importance, turloughs require a full inventory of their biodiversity and the factors affecting it. The collation here of all literature concerning turloughs will provide a basis for an integrated approach to future research on turloughs that is essential for a full understanding of these complex ecosystems.

With Cuona Lake as the demarcation point, the delta O-1(8) values of the river water increased initially and then decreased from upstream to downstream along the river's mainstream. In the Naqu River system, a general decrease of delta O-1(8) values in the trunk stream of the lower reaches (from the head of Cuona Lake) was revealed owing to the gradual dilution of increased isotopically-depleted tributary inflow Lakes play an important role in regulating runoff and changes in the levels of stable isotopes in rivers or streams. Additionally, the decrease of delta O-1(8) is controlled by processes involved in the 'isotopic altitude effect'. Larger contributions of winter precipitation in surface runoff at higher elevations would produce higher deuterium excess in stream water. On the regional scale, with Cuona Lake as the demarcation point, one of the clearest findings was that the river/stream's deuterium excess values decreased first and then increased from the south to the north in the summer; but there was a positive linear increase in the winter. From geographical and climatological perspectives, the changes of deuterium excess could result from increasing effects of summertime, and the generation of continental/local recycled and monsoonal water vapor in the surface runoff northward. The study area is at the critical transition between the Indian monsoon system in the South and the Northern belt of the westerlies, as revealed by the intermediate deuterium excess values.

Annually laminated oil shales from the maar lake of Messel (Germany) provide high-resolution sedimentological and paleoenvironmental data of a time interval of similar to 600 k.y. during the Eocene greenhouse phase. Individual laminae consist of a light spring and summer algal layer (Tetraedron minimum layer) and a dark winter layer composed of terrigenous background sediment. Four sections were selected from the core of the Messel 2001 well in order to count varves and to measure total varve thickness and the thickness of light and dark laminae. Spectral analyses were done in order to detect possible cyclic fluctuations in varve thickness. Fluctuations are significant in the quasi- biennial (2.1-2.5 yr) and low-frequency band (2.8-3.5 yr, 4.9-5.6 yr), thus showing that algal growth as well as the background sedimentation were controlled by ENSO effects at least over a time interval of 600 k.y. This confirms the existence of a previously postulated robust Eocene ENSO. Significant peaks within a quasi- decadal (10-11 yr), interdecadal (17-26 yr), and multidecadal band (similar to 52 yr, similar to 82 yr) show either the enduring influence of more or less cyclic instabilities or the influence of solar cycles.																			0091-7613	1943-2682				JUL	2010	38	7					627	630		10.1130/G30889.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/G30889.1													WOS:000279089700013

Lake Huron climatology, inter-lake exchange and mean circulation	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT					8th Conference on the State of Lake Huron: Ecosystem Change, Habitat and Management	2007	Honey Harbour, CANADA	Aquat Ecosyst Hlth & Management Soc, Lake Huron Binatl Partnership				Selected key features of the physical limnology, hydrology and climate influencing Lake Huron is presented. The lake is deep (229 m), consists of four interconnected bodies of water and currently there are no diversions into or out of the lake. Long-term annual summaries of meteorological and hydrological variables show that the lake affects spatial distributions across the basin. An estimate of the long-term hydrologic budget shows the relative importance of the major inflows, outflows and net basin supply. Long-term monthly average water level is 176.6 m. Monthly mean total heat flux ranges from -155 W m(-2) in December to 154 W m(-2) in June. Light attenuation is higher in Saginaw Bay and the nearshore compared to the mid-lake. Ice extent can be an important factor in the Lake Huron system with values ranging from 10% to 90% depending on winter severity. Surface and mean lake temperature for shallow North Channel are similar, however, large volumes of main Lake Huron and Georgian Bay results in mean temperatures nearly 10 degrees C less than surface temperatures in summer. Inter-lake exchange at the Straits of Mackinac is about 2 cm s(-1) but fluctuating flows can be up to 30 times larger. The averaged summer and winter circulation shows cyclonic patterns for Lake Huron.					; Schwab, David/B-7498-2012	Lofgren, Brent/0000-0003-2189-0914; Beletsky, Dmitry/0000-0003-4532-0588; 													1463-4988						2008	11	2					144	152		10.1080/14634980802098705	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634980802098705													WOS:000257032200004

Marine lakes of karst islands in Ha Long Bay (Vietnam)	CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY												Ha Long Bay in North Vietnam is characterized by karst towers and bigger islands totalling more than 3000 isles. Karst processes carved hundreds of caves out of the limestone and contributed to the formation of many enclosed and semi-enclosed saltwater lakes. Here, we report the results of a general survey of several lakes and the first data on the Hang Du I lake, a small basin devoid of any apparent communication with the surrounding sea. Hang Du I is characterized by the presence of Rhizostomeae, genus Mastigias, suggesting strong similarities with the famous lakes described from the archipelago of Palau. Among the benthic organisms sponges are the most important group. Temperature and abundance of the monsoon rains are the main factors influencing remarkable seasonal variations in physical-chemical parameters and the community structure of the lake. A thermal crisis with water temperatures up to 36 degrees C was recorded in September 2003. In this period, usually abundant medusae and sea anemones totally disappeared. Sponge populations showed fast growth rates in winter and spring and a partial degeneration to face the harsh conditions of the summer season. When isolated from the surrounding marine environment, the saltwater lakes share the condition of oceanic islands, representing spots of habitats surrounded by a completely different environment. The Ha Long Bay marine lakes are not easy to access, being surrounded by tropical forest, but local people usually exploit them for both fishery and oyster harvesting. There is an urgent need to develop measures of protection for these endangered and unique environments, natural laboratories that facilitate the study of evolution of marine organisms, where biodiversity has been until now totally unexplored.

Long-term field evaluation of the Plantower PMS low-cost particulate matter sensors	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												The low-cost and compact size of light-scattering-based particulate matter (PM) sensors provide an opportunity for improved spatiotemporally resolved PM measurements. However, these inexpensive sensors have limitations and need to be characterized under realistic conditions. This study evaluated two Plantower PMS (particulate matter sensor) 1003s and two PMS 5003s outdoors in Salt Lake City, Utah over 320 days (1/2016-2/2016 and 12/2015-10/2017) through multiple seasons and a variety of elevated PM2.5 events including wintertime cold-air pools (CAPs), fireworks, and wildfires. The PMS 1003/5003 sensors generally tracked PM2.5 concentrations compared to co-located reference air monitors (one tapered element oscillating microbalance, TEOM, and one gravimetric federal reference method, FRM). The different PMS sensor models and sets of the same sensor model exhibited some intrasensor variability. During winter 2017, the two PMS 1003s consistently overestimated PM2.5 by a factor of 1.89 (TEOM PM2.5<40 mu g/m(3)). However, compared to the TEOM, one PMS 5003 overestimated PM2.5 concentrations by a factor of 1.47 while the other roughly agreed with the TEOM. The PMS sensor response also differed by season. In two consecutive winters, the PMS PM2.5 measurements correlated with the hourly TEOM measurements (R-2 > 0.87) and 24-h ERM measurements (R-2 > 0.88) while in spring (March-June) and wildfire season (June-October) 2017, the correlations were poorer (R-2 of 0.18-0.32 and 0.48-0.72, respectively). The PMS 1003s maintained high intra-sensor agreement after one year of deployment during the winter seasons, however, one PMS 1003 sensor exhibited a significant drift beginning in March 2017 and continued to deteriorate through the end of the study. Overall, this study demonstrated good correlations between the PMS sensors and reference monitors in the winter season, seasonal differences in sensor performance, some intra-sensor variability, and drift in one sensor. These types of factors should be considered when using measurements from a network of low-cost PM sensors. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Hembre, LK; Megard, RO				Hembre, LK; Megard, RO			Seasonal and diel patchiness of a Daphnia population:: An acoustic analysis	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Detailed information about the location and extent of zooplankton patches is fundamental to understand how abiotic and biotic forces interact to structure the spatial distribution of zooplankton. We mapped zooplankton patchiness in a Minnesota lake during spring, summer, and autumn with high-frequency (192-kHz) single-beam sonar. Conventional plankton samples of aggregations detected acoustically revealed that Daphnia pulicaria (mean body length 1.6 mm, mean target strength - 120 dB) scattered most (similar to63%) of the sound. Other taxa were smaller (<(1)/(2) the length of D. pulicaria) and were usually less abundant and therefore scattered much less sound than D. pulicaria. Our acoustic estimates of Daphnia concentrations illustrate extreme patchiness, with concentrations varying by as much as four orders of magnitude over vertical distances of less than I in. Seasonal patterns of patchiness were related to predation by rainbow trout and to abiotic factors associated with stratification. Daphnia concentrations were highest from June to October in a deep-water "refuge zone" where oxygen concentrations were between 3 and 5 mg L-1. These oxygen levels are suitable for Daphnia but are lower than those required by rainbow trout. Heterogeneity in Daphnia concentration along the lake's long axis was highest in May and June, when the population resided primarily in the oxic hypolimnion during the daytime. From July to October, as oxygen concentrations declined in the hypolimnion, the population became more metalimnetic and more uniformly distributed in the horizontal dimension. A diel study of the population in October indicated that the patchiness of population also changed dramatically between day and night. During the day the population aggregated densely in a thin layer (similar to2 in thick) in the thermocline. After sunset the population dispersed into the epilimnion, where concentrations were similar to100,000 m(-3) less than they were during the day in the thermocline.																			0024-3590					NOV	2003	48	6					2221	2233		10.4319/lo.2003.48.6.2221	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2003.48.6.2221													WOS:000186772800016

Although habitat use by yellow eels was examined in summer and winter, no distinct difference was found between the two seasons. Yellow eels preferred lower current velocity in all the three sites in both seasons. Cover use by yellow eels differed among the three sites having different cover-type availability. In a coarse-substrate mountain stream, the majority of yellow eels used cobble/boulders as cover, whereas in the other two fine-substrate streams, where coarse substrates were rare, large parts of yellow eels burrowed into fine sediments. In addition, undercut bank and bank vegetation were substantially used and preferred by yellow eels depending on the study site, suggesting the importance of natural bank habitat. The majority of glass/elver eels used sand substrates with current velocity < 10 cm center dot s(-1) in all the three sites, suggesting their clear preference for such habitat. However, the preference for sand shown in this study contrasts with a general trend established by previous experimental studies that glass/elver eels prefer stony substrates over sand. Our results contrary to the general trend could be attributed to glass/elver eels displaying a stronger preference for slow currents over stony substrates, implying that current velocity has a dominant effect in habitat use by glass/elver eels under natural conditions.					; Uemura, Yohsuke/F-8412-2019	Inoue, Mikio/0000-0002-9319-1269; Uemura, Yohsuke/0000-0002-7703-9857													0378-1909	1573-5133				DEC	2023	106	12					2113	2125		10.1007/s10641-023-01493-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-023-01493-z		NOV 2023											WOS:001109877700001

Rajesh			Water quality assessment on Ooty lake in Nadir's district	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												Water quality index is used to express the quality of water on both surface as well as subsurface by integrating various water quality parameters. The present work aimed to evaluate seasonal water quality index for Ooty Lake in the Nilgiris district, TamilNadu India. The physico?chemical parameter of water samples taken during two seasons (winter and summer) were analyzed to categorize the level of pollution in the study area. The results were compared with the water quality standards recommended by Environment Protection Act (2009). Based on the Water Quality Index, Multivariate statistical analyses were applied to identify the group of parameter that influence water quality and to evaluate the type of pollution in the lake. In addition to multivariate statistical analyses, the factor and principal component analysis were applied and the outcome showed that there were three types of pollution influencing the water quality namely, agricultural pollution, organic pollution and domestic waste water pollution. During the winter season, domestic waste water pollution was high, as rainwater flushed out in all the areas of watershed. During this season the lake receives a meager amount of water, and hence, the biological activities taking during the summer season has resulted in higher biological pollution. From the analyses, it was observed that there is no major impact by the agricultural pollution. The cluster analysis showed that there were three cluster values, and from the similarity groups among the sampling sites, it was noticed that direct discharge and improper drainage system of watershed caused more pollution in lakes.																			0254-8704					NOV	2016	37	6			SI		1463	1472																WOS:000390341100010

Measurements of the local energy balance over a coral reef flat, Heron Island, southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Coral reefs are thought to face significant threat from global warming due to increased water temperatures and ocean acidity. However, research into the surface energy balance of coral reefs and their associated micrometeorology is rare. Here we present, through a case study approach, the first direct in situ measurements of the surface energy balance of Heron Reef, a small platform coral reef in the southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Surface energy exchanges were measured using the eddy covariance method and show that during winter and spring an estimated 80-98% of net radiation goes into heating of the water overlaying the reef and reef substrate. As a result, cloud cover is considered the dominant control on heating of the reef flat environment. Change in cloud cover may therefore significantly affect the thermal environment of coral reefs and their ecology. Sensible and latent heat fluxes reached their highest values during wintertime advection of dry and cool continental air blowing from mainland Australia. This resulted in a net loss of energy from the reef flat and a decreasing trend in water temperature. Turbulent fluxes otherwise remained small, with sensible heat flux often close to zero. Results indicate that coral reefs may act as heat sinks during winter and as heat sources during spring, thereby affecting local water and atmosphere heat budgets and associated thermodynamics.					; McGowan, Hamish/AAD-9607-2021	Neil, David T/0000-0003-1786-8992; Sturman, Andrew/0000-0002-2103-3616													2169-897X	2169-8996				OCT 13	2010	115								D19124	10.1029/2010JD014218	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2010JD014218													WOS:000283084500008

FLUXNET-CH4: a global, multi-ecosystem dataset and analysis of methane seasonality from freshwater wetlands	EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA												Methane (CH4) emissions from natural landscapes constitute roughly half of global CH4 contributions to the atmosphere, yet large uncertainties remain in the absolute magnitude and the seasonality of emission quantities and drivers. Eddy covariance (EC) measurements of CH4 flux are ideal for constraining ecosystem-scale CH4 emissions due to quasi-continuous and high-temporal-resolution CH4 flux measurements, coincident carbon dioxide, water, and energy flux measurements, lack of ecosystem disturbance, and increased availability of datasets over the last decade. Here, we (1) describe the newly published dataset, FLUXNET-CH4 Version 1.0, the first open-source global dataset of CH4 EC measurements (available at https://fluxnet.org/data/fluxnet-ch4-community-product/, last access: 7 April 2021). FLUXNET-CH4 includes half-hourly and daily gap-filled and non-gap-filled aggregated CH4 fluxes and meteorological data from 79 sites globally: 42 freshwater wetlands, 6 brackish and saline wetlands, 7 formerly drained ecosystems, 7 rice paddy sites, 2 lakes, and 15 uplands. Then, we (2) evaluate FLUXNET-CH4 representativeness for freshwater wetland coverage globally because the majority of sites in FLUXNET-CH4 Version 1.0 are freshwater wetlands which are a substantial source of total atmospheric CH4 emissions; and (3) we provide the first global estimates of the seasonal variability and seasonality predictors of freshwater wetland CH4 fluxes. Our representativeness analysis suggests that the freshwater wetland sites in the dataset cover global wetland bioclimatic attributes (encompassing energy, moisture, and vegetation-related parameters) in arctic, boreal, and temperate regions but only sparsely cover humid tropical regions. Seasonality metrics of wetland CH4 emissions vary considerably across latitudinal bands. In freshwater wetlands (except those between 20 degrees S to 20 degrees N) the spring onset of elevated CH4 emissions starts 3 d earlier, and the CH4 emission season lasts 4 d longer, for each degree Celsius increase in mean annual air temperature. On average, the spring onset of increasing CH4 emissions lags behind soil warming by 1 month, with very few sites experiencing increased CH4 emissions prior to the onset of soil warming. In contrast, roughly half of these sites experience the spring onset of rising CH4 emissions prior to the spring increase in gross primary productivity (GPP). The timing of peak summer CH4 emissions does not correlate with the timing for either peak summer temperature or peak GPP. Our results provide seasonality parameters for CH4 modeling and highlight seasonality metrics that cannot be predicted by temperature or GPP (i.e., seasonality of CH4 peak). FLUXNET-CH4 is a powerful new resource for diagnosing and understanding the role of terrestrial ecosystems and climate drivers in the global CH4 cycle, and future additions of sites in tropical ecosystems and site years of data collection will provide added value to this database. All seasonality parameters are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4672601 (Delwiche et al., 2021). Additionally, raw FLUXNET-CH4 data used to extract seasonality parameters can be downloaded from https://fluxnet. org/data/fluxnet-ch4-community-product/ (last access: 7 April 2021), and a complete list of the 79 individual site data DOIs is provided in Table 2 of this paper.

In this study, we used the simulations of the regional climate model REMO with 25 km spatial resolution, driven by three different global climate models (MPI-ESM-MR, NorESM1-M, and HadGEM2-ES), to evaluate how annual and seasonal mean surface air temperature and precipitation in the QM are likely to change for three future periods (2011-2040, 2041-2070, and 2071-2100) under two representative concentration pathways (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). The REMO model, shows noticeable cold and wet biases compared to observations for the reference period (1971-2000) and air temperature simulation outperforms precipitation simulation. The REMO simulations exhibit a warm and wet centre around lake, indicating that the simulation are likely influenced by lake. Projections under RCP2.6 show regional warming reaching 1.74 ??C during 2011-2100, characterized by an initial increase and a decrease afterwards. Under RCP8.5, air temperatures increase monotonously from 2011 to 2100, with a warming magnitude of 5.36 ??C for 2071-2100 relative to 1971-2000. The overall change in regionalaverage annual precipitation is not evident during 2011-2100, with some increases or decreases in certain time periods. In the 2071-2100 both the strongest warming and precipitation increase are projected to occur in winter under both scenarios, while precipitation in summer and autumn is projected to decrease in the east of the QM for the three future periods. The results suggest that the QM is likely to experience drought conditions in warm seasons in the future, which could impact agricultural and livestock production.					zhang, zihan/JHU-2592-2023; Wang, Xuejia/H-2780-2015	Wang, Xuejia/0000-0002-4761-9156													1674-9278					JUN	2022	13	3					344	358		10.1016/j.accre.2022.03.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.accre.2022.03.003													WOS:000802050300005

Remarkably, picophytoplankton was composed solely of eukaryotic cells, surpassing the dominance expectations for these acidic water bodies, whereas testaceans were virtually absent, even as tychoplankters. Abundances of the different planktonic communities were slightly higher than those reported for Northern Hemisphere peat bogs and humic lakes. Mixotrophic nutrition prevailed among nano- and microphytoplankters, a strategy also common in humic lakes. The structures in spring of the planktonic communities were similar. In contrast, in late summer there were differences in the abundance and biomass of the different trophic compartments among small, shallow water bodies and large ones. These seem to be dictated by distinct pool size-driven patterns of water temperature variation. A general shift in the control of heterotrophic flagellates abundance in the pools occurred, changing from bottom-up regulation in spring to top-down control in late summer related to temperature-dependant variations in zooplankton abundance and composition. We hypothesize that changes in the trophic interactions affecting the entire food web occur over the open water period in these aquatic ecosystems, and that these are dictated by pool morphometry and related abiotic features.

J	Fang, X; Stefan, HG				Fang, X; Stefan, HG			Dynamics of heat exchange between sediment and water in a lake	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Traditionally, it has been stated that heat is transferred from water to lake sediments during the summer and released from lake sediments into the water during the winter (ice cover) period. While this is true for seasonal averages, the direction of the heat flux reverses frequently on shorter, for example, daily timescales. Therefore the lake sediments not only provide seasonal heat storage but also add significant thermal inertia to the water column. Sediment heat fluxes are most important in shallow lakes. In this study the sediment heat exchange is calculated separately for every layer of a one-dimensional, deterministic, unsteady year-round lake water temperature model and then included as a source/sink term in the lake water temperature simulation. The importance of sediment heat transfer has thus been identified, and the dynamics of sediment heat exchange have been discovered. Heat can transfer into or out of the lake sediment during both the open water season and the winter ice cover period. The influence of the sediment heat exchange on water temperature Simulations is quantified.																			0043-1397					JUN	1996	32	6					1719	1727		10.1029/96WR00274	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/96WR00274													WOS:A1996UN70400022

These ecosystems are often ignored by scientists under the erroneous assumption that they play an insignificant socio-economical role or they are of low ecological importance. This study aimed to explore the seasonal surface variations using GPS readings (March 2013 to March 2014), in a complex of nine small freshwater ecosystems in NW Greece. Precipitation and temperature data were also obtained from two local meteorological stations. Additionally, electrofishing was conducted in all lakes on two occasions (March and July 2013), in order to provide a preliminary fish species list based on field surveys. Overall, water surface variations in all lentic ecosystems exhibited extreme recessions during the summer period, with two lakes drying completely, and expansions during winter-spring periods. Lakes shallower in depth, with an initial smaller surface and depending solely on precipitation inputs were the first to dry out. The endemic fish diversity was extremely low in the entire study area, since only one native fish was caught (Pelasgus thesproticus). On the contrary, alien species (Carassius gibelio, Gambusia holbrooki and Silurus aristotelis) have intruded into new localities and expanded their distributional range. This study conforms, that habitat loss and the introduction of non-native species are the two major threats for biodiversity in these small-sized Mediterranean lentic ecosystems.

A combination of daily meteorological readings, monthly measurements of inflows and water column composition, and a 7-month period of thermistor chain readings over a 2.5-year study period were used to assess physical and biogeochemical characteristics of Lake Rinihue and potential for change in trophic status. A coupled hydrodynamic-water quality model, DYRESM-WQ, was used to reproduce the observed changes in water temperature in the lake over this period. The model output yielded insights into the timing of stratification and mixis. Lake Rinihue did not mix completely over the 2.5-year period of the study (1995-1997). From late spring to autumn, a well developed thermocline was observed at depths of 20-40 m. Thermistor chain readings indicated that the thermocline position was quite variable on a day-to-day basis. Ln late winter the thermocline deepened rapidly in response to a sustained net negative heat flux, due largely to reduced solar radiation. Biological and chemical variables in DYRESM-WQ were calibrated over a period of 7 months and a further period of 2 years was used for validation. The simulation output reinforced the oligotrophic nature of Lake Rinihue ([chl-a] <6 mg/m(-3)), the general timing of changes in chlorophyll-a and the depletion of dissolved inorganic nutrients from the surface layer during summer. The DYRESM-WQ model and a bulk loading model were used to assess the potential for eutrophication of Lake Rinihue in response to increases in nutrient loads from inflows. The response to doubling of phosphorus (PO4-P and TP) concentrations in the inflows was to increase mean levels of depth-integrated chlorophyll-a near the water surface (0-58 m), from 1.36 mg/m(3) to 1.95 mg/m(3). The simulated 1.4-fold increase in chi-a concentrations in response to the increased phosphorus load was considerably less than that predicted from a combination of a bulk loading model for TP and a regression against chl-a (2.8-fold increase). The DYRESM-WQ model indicated that the trophic response to increased nutrient loading would be complicated by growth limitation by light and nitrogen.

J	SORRELL, BK; BOON, PI				SORRELL, BK; BOON, PI			BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF BILLABONG SEDIMENTS .2. SEASONAL-VARIATIONS IN METHANE PRODUCTION	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. We examined the temporal (seasonal and diel) and spatial variation in methane flux from sediments of a billabong in south-eastern Australia, and related it to variations in the rate of organic matter decay, concentration of interstitial metabolites, and sediment redox. 2. Total gas ebullition ranged from <2 to >59 ml m-2 h-1, and was highest in the summer months when water temperatures were >25-degrees-C. These rates are equivalent to carbon fluxes of about 16-30 g C-CH4 m-2 yr-1. Ebullition was greater from unvegetated sediments than from sediments colonized by the emergent macrophyte Eleocharis sphacelata. R. Br. or the submerged macrophyte Vallisneria gigantea Graeb. There were no consistent differences in the rate of ebullition over the day and the night. 3. Methane accounted for about 42-45% of total sediment gas in the vegetated sediments, but about 60% in the unvegetated sediments. These ratios did not vary greatly throughout the year. Carbon dioxide was a minor component of sediment gas, usually comprising < 5% of the total. Carbon dioxide contents were highest in summer, especially in unvegetated and E. sphacelata beds. 4. In vitro methanogenesis ranged from 3 +/- 0.9 to 106 +/- 30 nmol g(dry weight)-1 h-1, being highest in summer and lowest in winter. Added acetate (5 mm) increased the rate of methanogenesis by up to 10-fold, with the effect being greater in summer than winter. Generally, added acetate had least effect in E. sphacelata sediments. The maximum rate of in vitro methanogenesis with added acetate was 243 +/- 57 nmol g(dry weight)-1 h-1 . 5. Ebullition was highly correlated with the rate of in vitro methanogenesis, with a time lag of about 4 weeks. About 35-60% of benthic in vitro methanogenesis could be accounted for by ebullitive loss: the remainder was presumably lost via diffusion, flux through emergent plants or by oxidation. The rate of organic-matter degradation, assessed with amylopectin azure, varied throughout the year, but there was no clear relationship between ebullition and organic-matter decay. 6. Concentrations of interstitial ammonium, which also varied seasonally, ranged from 1 +/- 0.2 to 13 +/- 1 mgN l-1. There was no clear relationship between ebullition rates and ammonium concentrations. Redox potential was most positive in the E. sphacelata sediments, but there was little consistent difference in the redox potential of V. gigantea and unvegetated sediments. Redox potential appeared not to be a controlling factor in methane release.

A total of seven species of fish were recorded, however only three species were regularly collected. These were the larval common bully (Gobiomorphus cotidianus McDowall), larval inanga (Galaxias maculatus Jenyns), and postlarval cockabully (Tripterygion nigripenne Valenciennes). Common bully densities were highest in mid January, with the highest densities being recorded drifting out of Lake Waihola. Inanga densities were highest in March and April, with the highest densities being recorded in the channels draining wetland areas where extensive tidal inundation of riparian vegetation occurred. Cockabully were recorded from February to April, mostly at more downstream sites. Inland penetration by marine species was considerable, with two marine species, clingfish (Trachelochismus pinnulatus Forster) and smooth leatherjacket (Parika scaber Forster), being recorded c. 12 km upstream in late summer.

Mean conductivity (25.degree. C) and sodium measurements indicate that in summer and winter the north basin epilimnion and the south basin comprises about 50%, and the north basin hypolimnion about 80%, sea water. About 56% of high tides enter the loch. Vertical diffuse attenuation coefficients for blue, green and red light are the same in epilimnion and south basin, the blue coefficient being slightly higher than the red in July and much higher in Jan. In July the blue coefficient in the hypolimnion is lower than the red, as in clear coastal water. Six of 24 macrophytes and 8 epiphytes are confined within 200 m of the sea inlet. Distribution and depth limits of those and other species are discussed in relation to substrate, water chemistry and light. The presence of a halocline in the north basin and its absence from the south basin allow a comparison to be drawn between depth limits set by water chemistry (north basin), and those predicted on the basis of light (south basin) for Potamogeton pectinatus and Nitella opaca.																			0308-2113						1979	78		1-2				123	138		10.1017/S0269727000012963	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0269727000012963													WOS:A1979JR01300003

Some nauplius larvae were recorded in each month, but they were abundant only from April to October. Cyprid larvae were most abundant from July to August, and settlement from June to October. At different stations in the lake, frequency of settlement was related to biotic rather than abiotic factors. Growth rate was faster in summer than winter, and was related to water quality. The seasonal pattern of reproduction in Lake Timsah reflected the marked seasonality in environmental conditions.

Spatial variability and trends in observed snow depth over North America	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												[1] This study uses a gridded dataset of daily U. S. and Canadian surface observations from 1960-2000 to study regional spatial and temporal variability and trends in snow depth across North America. Analysis shows minimal change in North American snow depth through January, with regions of decreasing snow depths beginning in late January. These regional decreases grow in intensity and extent through March and into April, implying an earlier onset of spring melt. The region showing the greatest decreases in snow depth occurs in central Canada, along a line from the Yukon Territory in northwestern Canada to the Great Lakes region. The regional decreases in spring snow depth across central Canada are likely a result of more rapid melt of shallower winter snowpacks, evident through shallower snow cover (2-10 cm) during May and October and a decrease in extent of deeper snowpacks (> 40 cm) through March and April.

J	Sato, D; Shibuya, K				Sato, Daisuke; Shibuya, Kazuki			Development and Usage Patterns of Second-home Areas at the Foot of Mt. Fuji	JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY-CHIGAKU ZASSHI												The development process and usage patterns of second-home areas at the foot of Mt. Fuji are clarified by analyzing their expansion process, capital, and owner behavior. After World War I, in 1929, Fuji Kyuko Company, profiting from a business boom, started to develop a second-home area south of Lake Yamanaka [Yamanaka Kohan Bessochi]. This approach, by which a private company borrowed a section of Imperial Gift Land from Yamanashi Prefecture and established a second-home area, served as a model for developments at the northern foot of Mt. Fuji. In the early 1960s, second-home areas were developed north of Lake Yamanaka and at Fujizakura Highland south of Lake Kawaguchi. With the opening of the Chuo and Tomei Expressways in 1969, there were large capital flows into the creation of up-scale second-home areas at Juriki Highland, Fujigamine Highland, and Asagiri Highland, as well as around Lake Kawaguchi from the late 1960s until the mid-1970s. Large railway, trading, and paper manufacturing companies, as well as local developers, started to create second-home areas throughout the high-growth period. These investors, therefore, competed for land at the foot of Mt. Fuji. As a result, speculative capital flowed into development projects in second-home areas. This speculation created the potential for massive environmental destruction. Consequently, local governments concluded agreements with second-home owners' associations to clarify management responsibilities. Owners are most frequently at their second homes on weekends and during summer vacations in the hot months from mid-July to mid-September when temperatures at the foot of Mt. Fuji are below 30 degrees C. Owners also visit frequently at weekends and holidays in the spring and autumn. The second-home areas around Mt. Fuji, therefore, are both summer and weekend resorts, because they are located within a two-hour commute from Tokyo by car. The second-home areas, moreover, receive many migrants from urban areas, including aged persons, who seek an attractive natural environment at a relatively low price.																			0022-135X	1884-0884					2015	124	6			SI		965	977		10.5026/jgeography.124.965	http://dx.doi.org/10.5026/jgeography.124.965													WOS:000446310800007

The spatial-seasonal dynamics of CDOM absorption and three CDOM composition variables, including spectral slope (S), spectral slope ratio (S(R)) and the M value, defined as the ratio of absorption at 250 nm/365 nm, were analyzed and discussed. Furthermore, river input processes and degradation of phytoplankton were studied to assess their impact on CDOM composition and the factors involved in the spatial-seasonal variability of CDOM. The CDOM absorption coefficient at a wavelength of 350 nm, a(350), ranged from 1.37-9.55 m(-1) with a mean of 3.33 +/- 1.32 m(-1). Spatially, higher a(350) values, but lower spectral slope, spectral slope ratio and M values, were recorded in the northern algae dominated bays while lower values were recorded in southeastern macrophyte dominated bays. The a(350) was significantly higher in inshore waters than in offshore waters. Values of S, S(R) and M decreased during the flood and algal bloom season in spring and summer whereas a(350) increased. In the three river profiles, the gradual decrease of a(350) along the trajectory from the river mouth into the lake during the flood season showed the contribution of allochthonous CDOM. A laboratory phytoplankton degradation experiment was conducted to determine the contribution of CDOM production from phytoplankton. The significant increase of a(350) with time in the CDOM production experiment underlines the importance of autochthonous CDOM production during the algal bloom season. In summary, the significant increase of a(350) in spring and summer (algal bloom season) may be due to both the allochthonous CDOM input from the surrounding rivers and the autochthonous production of CDOM from degrading phytoplankton.

In this study, the freshness change during chilled (5 degrees C) and super-chilled (-1 and -2 degrees C) of S. microdon samples collected from Kasumigaura lake in October and December was assessed by observing their surface structure and determining their drip loss, K values, and free amino acid content.ResultsThe results revealed that more wrinkles formed on the surface of S. microdon samples with increasing storage time. More drip loss occurred in fall than in winter. Higher K values and increased degradation of muscle proteins were observed in winter. Moreover, their free amino acid content increased with storage time at all temperatures.ConclusionThis study suggested that seasonal differences and storage temperature should be considered in selecting the appropriate fishing, handling, and storage methods to maintain the freshness and quality of S. microdon.					; Mok, Wen/AAF-9229-2019	, MOK WEN JYE/0000-0002-7629-8312; 													2573-5098					DEC	2024	4	12					406	421		10.1002/jsf2.223	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsf2.223		NOV 2024											WOS:001365819800001
J	Franz, TP; Eisenreich, SJ				Franz, TP; Eisenreich, SJ			Accumulation of polychlorinated biphenyls and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the snowpack of Minnesota and Lake Superior	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The winter snowpack is a significant reservoir of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and may be utilized as a surrogate receptor for assessing net atmospheric deposition. Seasonal snow cores were collected in late winter before snowmelt in northern and central Minnesota and at Eagle harbor, Michigan on Lake Superior between 1982 and 1992. Snowpack concentrations of Sigma-PCBs ranged from 1 to 14 ng/L with no significant decrease in concentrations from 1986 through 1992. Sigma(21)-PAH concentrations in 1989 and 1992 ranged from 35 to 3280 ng/L with significantly higher concentrations nearer urban areas. Similarities between chemical accumulations in the snowpack and collection of integrated snowfall at Eagle Harbor support the hypothesis that dry deposition to accumulated snow is negligible at these remote locations. Tributary discharges from spring snowmelt to Lake Superior in 1992 contributed 7 to 11 kg of Sigma-PCBs and 220 to 350 kg of Sigma(21)-PAHs.																			0380-1330						2000	26	2					220	234		10.1016/S0380-1330(00)70688-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(00)70688-5													WOS:000087817600009

Spawning densities ranged from < 5 coho salmon/ha to up to 90 fish/ha. Subyearling coho salmon densities ranged from 10-60 fish/100 m2 in June and dropped to 5-20 fish by early fall. Coho salmon fry increased in length from 40 mm in early May to > 120 mm by smolt out-migration in the following April. Coho salmon instantaneous daily change in density coefficients ranged from 0.004-0.019 and were dependent on initial coho density. Daily coho salmon growth rates ranged from 0.38-0.60 mm/day and were not dependent on initial coho salmon density. Downstream movement of rainbow trout fry began in May and continued into July. In the spring 10-20 yearlings and one to five 2 yr olds/100 m2 were present. Most fry emerged in June at a size of 25 mm and grew to 85 mm by fall. Daily growth rates varied from 0.23-0.45 mm/day for yearling rainbow trout and were not correlated with rainbow trout density.																			0008-4301	1480-3283					1983	61	5					1120	1127		10.1139/z83-147	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z83-147													WOS:A1983QT83100021

Helminth fauna of Simav barbel, Barbus niluferensis Turan, Kottelat & Ekmekci, 2009 An endemic fish from Nilufer river in Bursa (Turkey): New host and locality records	BULLETIN OF THE EUROPEAN ASSOCIATION OF FISH PATHOLOGISTS												This study was carried out from autumn 2015 to summer 2016 to determine the seasonal occurrence of helminth species in Barbus niluferensis Turan, Kottelat & Ekmekci, 2009 endemic to Turkey. Samples were taken at random sites from the river once in every three months. A total of 58 individuals of B. niluferensis specimens were collected by electrofishing from the Nilufer River, Marmara Sea drainage in Bursa province, Turkey. Forty one fish specimens were infected by one or more parasite specimens, belonging to one of four identified parasitic helminth species; Dactylogyrus carpathicus (prevalence 58.6%), D. petenyi (25.8%) and D. lenkorani (24.1%) from the gills, and Allocreadium isoporum (39.6%) from the intestine. D. carpathicus was the commonest species found on the hosts. A total of 211 specimens of D. carpathicus infected 34 of 58 fish examined, having a prevalence and mean intensity of 58.6% and 6.2, respectively. Infection data of the parasite species were determined for seasons, host size and sex. D. carpathicus was present through all seasons. The prevalence values varied from 25% to 92.3%, the highest in winter. Fish were divided into two groups according to size; prevalence was higher in hosts of size class I for the three monogenean species, while for A. isoporum prevalence was higher in size class II. Higher prevalence and intensity levels were recorded in female, compared to male fish. The present study is the first record of helminth parasites of B. niluferensis. In addition, Turkey is a new locality record for D. petenyi, while B. niluferensis represents a new host record for all isolated helminths, adding to the geographical and host distribution of these studied parasite species.

T.; Brandt-Williams, Sherry			Addressing pollutant load reduction goals for impaired waterbodies through biomass harvest of Gulf Coast type Phragmites australis (common reed)	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												A population of "Gulf Coast haplotype" Phragmites australis occurring at the periphery of a hypereutrophic lake in Central Florida was sampled to determine biomass and nutrient stand attributes. This data was also used to investigate harvest potential and timing with respect to sustainable stand management and nutrient removal. This Phragmites type produces biomass and stores nutrients in similar quantities to moderately loaded stands elsewhere however patterns of production, storage, and nutrient translocation differ greatly. The growing season for these stands extended from February to early December. Stands present peak biomass (800-1,200 g m(-2)) and Phosphorus storage (1.7-1.8 g m(-2)) both at the very end and beginning of the growing season with a smaller peak in summer; this multi-modal pattern differs from unimodal patterns previously reported. Pulses of available nutrients as the marsh floods may be driving nutrient cycling in concert with seasonality. These morphological and functional patterns provide a flexible harvest strategy. Harvest in either late fall or early spring would address 28 and 23 % of the Lake's Pollutant Load Reduction Goal, respectively. The dual objectives of maximum nutrient removal and stand sustainability can be met through careful examination of nutrient storage and translocation results gleaned from this study, as well as, ongoing in situ harvest experiments to test emergent hypothesis. This investigation has yielded important baseline data for the little studied Gulf Coast haplotype of P. australis occurring in the southeastern United States as well as a wetland management technique for nutrient reduction in impaired aquatic ecosystems.																			0923-4861	1572-9834				JUN	2015	23	3					519	533		10.1007/s11273-015-9406-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11273-015-9406-6													WOS:000356540000016

High DOC concentrations occurred during spring snowmelt and late summer monsoon rains. The majority (similar to90%) of DOC loading (kilograms per month) from the Verde River watershed occurred in the spring. Bacterial consumption and algal production of DOC changed the chemical characteristics of DOC in the reservoir. DOC loading was reduced by 21 to 38%, and haloacetic acid precursor loading was reduced by 30 to 45% as water passed through the Horseshoe-Bartlett reservoir system in 1998-99. Depending on annual hydrologic patterns and reservoir operation, the Horseshoe-Bartlett reservoir system can either produce or consume DOC.

Using Satellite Imagery to Examine the Relationship between Surface-Water Dynamics of the Salt Lakes of Western Texas and Ogallala Aquifer Depletion	WETLANDS												We used Landsat imagery to examine surface-water dynamics over the past 27 years in 39 salt lakes (salinas) of the Southern High Plains of the U.S. These groundwater- and precipitation-fed wetlands are regionally unique habitats with high salt concentrations and halophytic biota that may be vulnerable to hydrological changes from groundwater extraction for agriculture coupled with drought. We documented amounts and occurrences of water within the 39 salinas, comparing summer and winter (representing periods of high and low groundwater demand, respectively) in 1986-2013. During this span in our study area, total and irrigated cropland acreage increased, and the saturated thickness of the Ogallala Aquifer decreased by similar to 18.3%. There was variation in inundation frequency by salina, with two never holding water during our study. A third of the salinas went dry at least once, slightly more in summer than winter. Occurrence of water was not simply a function of basin size or to depth to the aquifer. These wetlands are being impacted by human changes to the landscape that are diminishing groundwater inputs, effectively creating novel wetlands that are now primarily supplied by precipitation rather than groundwater, with altered hydrological and ecological traits that may exacerbate regional vulnerability to climate change.

It is a small (10.6 ha), not deep (up to 7.3 m) but thermally stratified, natural, kettle-shaped lake fed with waters from the Cybina River. Water of the tributary rich in nutrients was responsible for the hypertrophic state of the lake. To improve the condition of the lake, some restoration measures were applied. They included the iron treatment method used for phosphorus inactivation. The second method used for the lake restoration was transport of the water rich in nitrates flowing from the springs at the bottom of the slope near the lake by special pipes to the deepest part of the lake, to increase the redox potential at the sediments-water interface. The most abundant group of phytoplanlcton were cyanobacteria, (especially in summer and autumn months), diatoms, cryptophytes, and chrysophytes. Chlorophytes were the most numerous in respect to the number of taxa. The most important taxa were Planktothrix Aphanizomenon gracile, Pseudanabaena limnetica, Limnothrix redekei, Cyclotella, Stephanodiscus, Rhodomonas lacustris, Cryptomonas marssonii, and C. reflexa. Comparing with mean abundance and biomass of phytoplankton in 2010, a small statistically significant decrease was noted in 2011, but an increase in 2012. Some improvement in water quality judged by Shannon-Weaver diversity index and species composition, abundance, and biomass in the lake plankton was observed. Zooplankton was dominated by rotifers. Among cladocerans the most abundant were Bosmina longirostris and Eubosmina coregoni, which were not effective enough in phytoplankton control.					; Gołdyn, Ryszard/J-1093-2018	Goldyn, Ryszard/0000-0001-8325-5161; Kozak, Anna/0000-0001-7448-0498													1230-1485	2083-5906					2014	23	4					1201	1209																WOS:000341337900016

Biological indicators for environmental quality monitoring of marine sediment in Suez Gulf, Egypt	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC RESEARCH												A comparative field study was performed to assess the heavy metals contamination in surficial sediments of highly and less polluted zones at the northern part of the Suez Gulf. In addition, to highlight the relationship among metal contamination and enzyme activity. Seven heavy metals Mn, Fe, Pb, Cd, Zn, Ni, and Cu were analyzed using atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The activity of enzymes (alkaline phosphatase and urease) was estimated in the sediment samples. The statistical results showed that there were high significant differences at p < 0.01 among Cu, Pb, Cd, Ni, Mn and Zn between highly polluted and less polluted sediments. Urease activity had no significant relationship with the tested metals concentrations. Cd, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn may inhibit alkaline phosphatase activity. Alkaline phosphatase activity showed high significant difference at p < 0.01 between summer and winter seasons in highly polluted sediment. Moreover, there was significant seasonal difference in Pb concentration at p < 0.01 in the same category. Correlations of the enzymes with each metal showed that alkaline phosphatase activity had significant negative correlation coefficients (r =-0.55,-0.49,-0.27,-0.37,-0.37, and-0.60) with Cu, Cd, Fe, Ni, Zn and Pb respectively in winter, but only with Zn (r =-0.46) in summer season. As a result, ALP activity can possibly be used as a predictor and sensitive indicator of heavy metals bioavailability in marine sediments. (c) 2021 National Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries.

O2 depletion in bottom waters towards the end of the stratification period amounts to about 4 g .cntdot. m-3. Water transparency, as measured by Secchi disc, ranges from 11-21 m. The pH is typically 7-8; extreme values are 6.8 and 8.5. Major ion concentrations total about 2.3 eq .cntdot. m-3. Anion concentrations follow the pattern HCO3- > Cl- > SO42-, and cations Na+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+. The major ions varied little seasonally, spatially, or with depth, except bicarbonate, for which bottom concentrations were 1-2 g .cntdot. m-3 higher than at the surface. Reactive Si concentrations were 9.2-10.3 g .cntdot. m-3; there was no apparent relationship with diatom populations. Total dissolved iron concentrations ranged from 2-8 mg .cntdot. m-3, with no discernible pattern. The distributions of reactive P and nitrate-N developed pronounced seasonal chemoclines which were readily interpretable by reference to the state of lake stratification and phytoplankton populations. Ammonium-N concentrations in the epilimnion tended to increase in summer; this could not be explained. Chlorophyll concentrations in the top 30 m of the lake varied between 0.65-2.9 mg .cntdot. m-3, with a pronounced winter peak associated with a phytoplankton population dominated by Melosira granulata. Twenty-four genera of algae appeared in cell counts.																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1980	14	2					139	148		10.1080/00288330.1980.9515855	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1980.9515855													WOS:A1980KS41300005

The Ceyhan River basin is located in the south-eastern Anatolia region in Turkey. Lakes Golbagl and Azaph are located in a protected area. Some physico-chemical parameters of surface water were measured in situ. Sampling for oligochaetes was conducted by using both hand-nets and an Ekman Birge grab sampler, with samples obtained from different depths. Oligochaetes represented the dominant group of the total benthic macroinvertebrates in samples, with the exception of samples collected from Ayvali Dam lake. A total of 11,293 oligochaete specimens were sorted from samples collected from these lakes, from which 14 species belonging to 2 subfamilies (Naidinae and Tubificinae) were identified. Potamothrix hammoniensis (90.24%) and Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri (7%) were the most abundant oligochaetes in the samples.					; FINDIK, Özlem/AAY-2116-2021	aras, seval/0000-0002-6392-0117; FINDIK, Ozlem/0000-0001-8126-1250													0006-3088	1336-9563				JAN	2016	71	1					44	48		10.1515/biolog-2016-0007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/biolog-2016-0007													WOS:000372095600007

The analysis was done for two different seasons i.e. summer (June) and winter (December), 2022. The current investigation indicated that all the physiochemical parameters were in the permissible limit in both the seasons except few parameters (Ca, Mg, turbidity). In the analysis of heavy metals in both the seasons, it was found that there was no heavy metal contamination in all sampling sites except the Cr concentration which was found to be higher in all sites (except SXII) in summer season. The detailed analysis involved the calculation of various water quality indices which graded water quality under 'good' category as per WQI value whereas CPI and HPI value showed moderate to high pollution level in water during summer season. The study showed the seasonal variation in water quality parameters and thus encourage the need for regular monitoring of water quality to reduce pollution level.

The flora remained fairly stable in the summer months, changes in the relative percentage composition of the major and minor associations occurred from scouring flood-waters to stagnation in the semi-riverine areas from limited flow and extensive growth of Salvinia. The percentage frequency of occurrence remained high. The flora was less stable in the winter; some species were slow to recolonize tree areas exposed during down-draw of lake water in summer, especially at the lake face. A few species increased in relative percentage value in winter but the percentage frequency of occurrence in the minor association was poor. Achnanthes minutissima dominated particularly in the enclosed water where it was the cause of serious space competition especially to the larger species of diatom. Highest values throughout were obtained from the area of greatest change viz. the transitional water between riverine and lake conditions. Local environment was of greater significance in relative percentage abundance of diatoms than was the species of host plant. A few species showed that 50% of them occurred in the first 1.5 m, some increased with depth, notably Rhopalodia rhopala and a few appeared to be tolerant of light changes.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1985	121	1					65	76		10.1007/BF00035231	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00035231													WOS:A1985ADD2900009

A terrestrial record of climate variation during MIS 11 through multiproxy palaeotemperature reconstructions from Hoxne, UK	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												A terrestrial (lacustrine and fluvial) palaeoclimate record from Hoxne (Suffolk, UK) shows two temperate phases separated by a cold episode, correlated with MIS 11 subdivisions corresponding to isotopic events 11.3 (Hoxnian interglacial period), 11.24 (Stratum C cold interval), and 11.23 (warm interval with evidence of human presence). A robust, reproducible multiproxy consensus approach validates and combines quantitative palaeotemperature reconstructions from three invertebrate groups (beetles, chironomids, and ostracods) and plant indicator taxa with qualitative implications of molluscs and small vertebrates. Compared with the present, interglacial mean monthly air temperatures were similar or up to 4.0 degrees C higher in summer, but similar or as much as 3.0 degrees C lower in winter; the Stratum C cold interval, following prolonged nondeposition or erosion of the lake bed, experienced summers 2.5 degrees C cooler and winters between 5 degrees C and 10 degrees C cooler than at present. Possible reworking of fossils into Stratum C from underlying interglacial assemblages is taken into account. Oxygen and carbon isotopes from ostracod shells indicate evaporatively enriched lake water during Stratum C deposition. Comparative evaluation shows that proxy-based palaeoclimate reconstruction methods are best tested against each other and, if validated, can be used to generate more refined and robust results through multiproxy consensus.

We surveyed a number of freshwater systems in central Europe, by infra-red fluorometry, infra-red epifluorescence microscopy, fluorescence emission spectroscopy and pigment analyses. AAPs were found to be abundant in several oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes (50-400 ng of bacteriochlorophyll a I-1, 10-80% of bacterial biomass), while in more eutrophized water bodies they represented a negligible part of the total microbial community (< 1%). The observed freshwater AAPs were morphologically diverse and different from previously observed marine species. Under temperate European climatic conditions, AAP populations undergo strong seasonal changes in terms of both abundance and species composition, with the maximum biomass in summer and the minimum in winter. In the mountain lakes Certovo and Plesne, AAPs contributed more than one half of total bacterial biomass during their summer maximum. These results show that photoheterotrophic bacteria represent an important part of the microbial community in many freshwater systems.

WALLEYE FILLETS AND SKIN-ON VERSUS SKIN-OFF SAMPLING	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION					3rd International Conference on Mercury as a Global Pollutant	JUL 10-14, 1994	WHISTLER, CANADA	Elect Power Res Inst, Environm Canada, Atmospher Environm Serv, Frontier Geosci, Hlth Canada, Ontario Hydro, Dept Environm Protect, Florida, Wisconsin Dept Nat Resources, US FDA				During the past two years, walleye (Stizostedion vitreum) have been collected and prepared into skin-off fillets and submitted for total mercury analysis. The survey included 105 fish from 18 lakes in 10 counties in northern Wisconsin and the upper peninsula of Michigan. Fourteen lakes yielded walleye fillets with greater than 0.5 ppm mercury, and six lakes yielded samples in excess of 1.0 ppm mercury. Fourteen fish were collected in the spring and prepared as fillets ground up as either skin-on or skin-off samples. The difference in Hg was significant (T-14 = -3.26, p = 0.006) with skin-on fillets, resulting in an approximately 10% decrease in mercury concentrations. Results of this study suggest that by leaving the skin on the sample, mercury concentrations will be reported 10% lower than if the skin is removed Obviously, consumption advisories based on skin-off samples could provide more protection for Ojibwa people eating the spring harvest of walleye. In the fall, the difference in Hg samples between skin-on versus skin-off, was less and not statistically significant However, removal of the skin would be expected to underestimate lipophilic organochlorine burdens and may not be appropriate for fish species where PCBs, DDT, and chlordanes are the major concern. Fall data for 67 fish from 26 lakes in 9 counties are also reported.

J	Aebly, FA; Fritz, SC				Aebly, Frank A.; Fritz, Sherilyn C.			Palaeohydrology of Kangerlussuaq (Sondre Stromfjord), West Greenland during the last ∼8000 years	HOLOCENE												Major fluctuations of hydroclimate in West Greenland are recorded in palaeoshoreline terraces that encircle several lakes near Kangerlussuaq, Greenland (67 degrees 01'N, 50 degrees 40'W). Geomorphic and stratigraphic analyses were used to construct a lake-level curve for Hunde So, a large closed-basin lake in this region. Changes in lake volume associated with lake-level fluctuations were calculated, and a water-balance model was used to determine the primary factors influencing lake volume and the changes in those factors necessary to affect reconstructed lake-level change. Sensitivity tests suggest that mean annual precipitation and the relative proportion of summer versus winter precipitation are the primary climate drivers of lake-level change. Temperature effects are less important unless coupled with changes in one of the other variables. Two pluvial periods occurred centred around 4600 and 2000 cal. yr BP, with mean annual precipitation estimated at 130 mm and 70 mm higher than modem, respectively. In contrast, a low-stand prior to 6070 cal. yr BP with water levels as much as 18 m below modern was a result of summer temperatures similar to 2-3 degrees above modem, coupled with a 14 day increase in the length of the ice-off period and a reduction in mean annual precipitation of similar to 80 mm relative to modem.																			0959-6836	1477-0911				FEB	2009	19	1					91	104		10.1177/0959683608096601	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683608096601													WOS:000262812600005
J	Mao, M; Wu, XW; Zhang, YH				Mao, Mao; Wu, Xiaowei; Zhang, Yahui			Spatiotemporal Patterns and Regional Transport Contributions of Air Pollutants in Wuxi City	ATMOSPHERE												In recent years, with the rapid socioeconomic development of Wuxi City, the frequent occurrence of severe air pollution events has attracted widespread attention from both the local government and the public. Based on the real-time monitoring data of criteria pollutants and GDAS (Global Data Assimilation System) reanalysis data, the spatiotemporal variation patterns, meteorological influences, and potential sources of major air pollutants in Wuxi across different seasons during 2019 (pre-COVID-19) and 2023 (post-COVID-19 restrictions) are investigated using the Pearson correlation coefficient, potential source contribution function (PSCF), and concentration-weighted trajectory (CWT) models. The results demonstrate that the annual mean PM2.5 concentration in Wuxi decreased significantly from 39.6 mu g/m3 in 2019 to 29.3 mu g/m3 in 2023, whereas the annual mean 8h O3 concentration remained persistently elevated, with comparable levels of 104.6 mu g/m3 and 105.0 mu g/m3 in 2019 and 2023, respectively. The O3 and particulate matter (PM) remain the most prominent air pollutants in Wuxi's ambient air quality. The hourly mass concentrations of criteria pollutants, except O3, exhibited characteristic bimodal distributions, with peak concentrations occurring post-rush hour during morning and evening commute periods. In contrast, O3 displayed a distinct unimodal diurnal pattern, peaking between 15:00 and 16:00 local time. The spatial distribution patterns revealed significantly elevated concentrations of all monitored species, excluding O3, in the central urban zone, compared to the northern Taihu Lake region. The statistical analysis revealed significant correlations among PM concentrations and other air pollutants. Additionally, meteorological parameters exerted substantial influences on pollutant concentrations. The PSCF and CWT analyses revealed distinct seasonal variations in the potential source regions of atmospheric pollutants in Wuxi. In spring, the Suzhou-Wuxi-Changzhou metropolitan cluster and northern Zhejiang Province were identified as significant contributors to PM2.5 and O3 pollution in Wuxi. The potential source regions of O3 are predominantly distributed across the Taihu Lake-rim cities during summer, while the eastern urban agglomeration adjacent to Wuxi serves as major potential source areas for O3 in autumn. In winter, the prevailing northerly winds facilitate southward PM2.5 transport from central-northern Jiangsu, characterized by high emissions (e.g., industrial activities), identifying this region as a key potential source contribution area for Wuxi's aerosol pollution. The current air pollution status in Wuxi City underscores the imperative for implementing more stringent and efficacious intervention strategies to ameliorate air quality.																				2073-4433				MAY 1	2025	16	5							537	10.3390/atmos16050537	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos16050537													WOS:001495781500001

In order to assess the human health risks and to provide the local health authorities with a scientific basis for planning tailored monitoring activities, we studied P. rubescens ecology and toxicity for two years. P. rubescens generally dominated the phytoplankton community, alternating with Limnothrix redekei, potentially toxic. P. rubescens was distributed throughout the water column during winter; in summer it produced intense blooms where drinking water is collected (-20 m); here MC were detected all year round (0.5-5 mu g/L), with implications for drinking water quality. In surface waters, MC posed no risk for recreational activities in summer, while in winter surface blooms and foams (containing up to 56 mu g MC/L) can represent a risk for people and children practicing water sports and for animals consuming raw water. Total phosphorus, phosphate and inorganic nitrogen were not relevant to predict densities nor toxicity; however, a strong correlation between P. rubescens density and aminopeptidase ectoenzymatic activity, an enzyme involved in protein degradation, suggested a role of organic nitrogen for this species. The fraction of potentially toxic population, determined both as mcyB(+)/16SrDNA (10-100%) and as the MC/mcyB(+) cells (0.03-0.79 pg MC/cell), was much more variable than usually observed for P. rubescens. Differently from other Italian and European lakes, the correlation between cell density or the mcyB(+) cells and MC explained only -50 and 30% of MC variability, respectively: for Vico Lake, monitoring only cell or the mcyB+ cell density is not sufficient to predict MC concentrations, and consequently to protect population health. Finally, during a winter bloom one site has been sampled weekly, showing that monthly sampling during such a phase could greatly underestimate the 'hazard'. Our results highlight the need to adopt a stepwise monitoring activity, considering the lake and the cyanobacteria specific features. This activity should be complemented with communication to the public and involvement of stakeholders. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	BUNN, SE; BOON, PI				BUNN, SE; BOON, PI			WHAT SOURCES OF ORGANIC-CARBON DRIVE FOOD WEBS IN BILLABONGS - A STUDY BASED ON STABLE-ISOTOPE ANALYSIS	OECOLOGIA												We used the stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen to examine the food webs of three small floodplain lakes (billabongs) in south-eastern Australia. With few exceptions, stable carbon isotope analysis could not be used to discriminate among the conspicuous potential sources of fringing, emergent or floating vegetation or benthic detritus. These primary sources showed little spatial or temporal variation in delta(13)C values, with means ranging from -28.5 to -26.8% in spring and -29.1 to -25.4% in late summer. Submerged vegetation had similar delta(13)C values to the above sources in spring but showed greater spatial variation and were less C-13- depleted, considerably so in some species, in late summer. Epiphytes and algae were C-13-depleted in spring compared with the other primary sources but became more C-13-enriched in late summer. Mean delta(13)C values for primary and secondary consumers were not only far more variable (-37.4 to -22.7%) but in general were more negative than the potential food sources, particularly in spring. Using the combined information from stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis, we could narrow down the list of potential primary sources driving food webs in these billabongs. The freshwater crayfish (Cherax) was one of the few taxa that appeared to obtain its biomass carbon from detrital material. Gastropods and leptocerid caddis larvae on emergent or submerged vegetation obtained a mixture of carbon from epiphytes and macrophytes; in both taxa, epiphytes contributed more to biomass carbon than did the macrophytes. However, other common grazers and collector/ gatherers sampled from macrophytes, e.g. baetid mayflies, chironomid larvae and atyid shrimps, were often too C-13-depleted even to have derived their biomass carbon solely from epiphytes. Many other primary consumers, including zooplankton, and mussels (Velesunio), and most of the secondary consumers, including water mites (Hydracarina), phantom midge larvae (Chaoborus) and fish, were also C-13-depleted. The enormous biomass of littoral and fringing vegetation could contribute to metazoan food webs in these billabongs only if an additional highly C-13-depleted source was consumed simultaneously. Methane released from billabong sediments could provide such a C-13-depleted carbon source that is reintroduced into metazoan food webs via the consumption of methanotrophic bacteria. Alternatively, food webs in these water bodies are largely driven by an unknown and inconspicuous C-13-depleted primary producer, such as planktonic Chlorophyta.

Mackay, Alberta, during the 1977 open water season. Fluctuating discharge of the river effected changes in the nature of the sediments and the abundance and composition of invertebrate communities. During most of the summer, coarse sand was dominated by chironomids of the Harnischia complex and an undescribed Orthocladiinae. Stoneflies and mayflies invaded the coarse sand in autumn when decreasing discharge led to greater stability of the substrate. The invertebrate fauna of silt and mud resembled that of similar substrates in lakes. Bedrock supported communities similar to those of stony streams. The average abundances of invertebrates on sand and mud were similar but estimates from mud were somewhat more variable. Substrate stability and published records from other large rivers are discussed.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1980	74	2					151	160		10.1007/BF00014567	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00014567													WOS:A1980KL38800008

In this study, we analyzed long-term dynamics of the summer population of Velvet Scoters (Melanitta fusca) breeding in the Aland archipelago in the Baltic Sea; in particular, we examined the influence of winter weather and density dependence on population change. The studied population exhibited substantial fluctuations but only a weak negative trend during the total period of 58 years (1949-2007), and no significant trend at all during the latter three decades of the study (1977-2007). We tested for density dependence and incorporated the winter North Atlantic Oscillation index into the model to test for effects of winter conditions. Our final model explained 56.3 % of the variance of population growth of the studied population. Delayed density dependence explained 29.7 %, pre-breeding climate 8.3 %, and post-breeding climate 18.3 % of the variance. That breeding success is density dependent in a delayed manner is in accordance with the apprehension that Velvet Scoters breed at the age of 2 years. We conclude that density dependence and winter conditions must be taken into consideration when discussing population changes in seaducks in general and the Velvet Scoter in particular.

An isotope model that accounts for isotopic fractionations associated with photosynthesis in plants was applied to the stable isotope data to infer past meteoric water isotopic composition and seasonal air moisture variations, The model-inferred climate data was rationalized in terms of the trees' hydrologic environment and weather characteristics of the Great Lakes region, The result is an account of summer and winter conditions in southwestern Ontario for 275 years (1610 to 1885) prior to instrumental climate records, Conditions between 1610 and 1750 are inferred to have been cooler and drier than present, This was followed by a warm-moist climate interval between 1750 and 1885 during which there was an increase in winter precipitation, Cool-dry conditions were recorded instrumentally in this region at the end of the nineteenth century.

J	Tong, QY; Yao, SX				Tong, Qiaoyu; Yao, Suxiang			The Quasi-Biweekly Oscillation of Winter Precipitation Associated with ENSO over Southern China	ATMOSPHERE												Using ERA-interim Reanalysis data and observational data, the intraseasonal oscillation of the winter rainfall in southern China is studied. The mean square deviation of daily precipitation is used to express precipitation variability, and winter precipitation variability over southern China is determined to be highly correlated with sea surface temperature (SST) in central and eastern tropical Pacific; the dominant period of the precipitation is 10-30 days, which reflects quasi-biweekly oscillation. Examination of 1000 hPa geopotential height suggests that key low-pressure systems affecting the intraseasonal precipitation come from Lake Baikal, but with different travel paths. In El Nino years, key low-pressure systems converge with other low-pressure systems and move southeastward until reaching South China, while in La Nina years, only one low-pressure system can reach southern China. Meanwhile, the explosive development of the low-pressure system is mainly caused by the joint effects of thermal advection and vorticity advection in El Nino, and only vorticity advection accounted for the dominant status in La Nina. Multiscale analysis shows that the meridional distribution of intraseasonal circulation plays an important role on the thermal transmission and brings strong warm advection from low latitudes to high latitudes in El Nino.

J	Li, YL; Liao, MN; Chen, R; Shen, J				Li, Yanling; Liao, Mengna; Chen, Rong; Shen, Ji			Diatom-based inference of variations in the strength of East Asian spring wind speeds since mid-Holocene	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Lake Jingpo is located in Ning'an County, Southeast Heilongjiang Province, northeast China and is strongly influenced by the East Asian monsoon system. Diatom analysis of the last 5000 cal. yr BP according to the results of AMS C-14 dating provides a detailed history of paleoenvironment changes. The relative abundance of diatom species, Asterionella formosa, Aulacoseira, Cydostephanos, Stephanodiscus and Discostella species can be used as a proxy of spring wind speed, which is supported by the results of seasonal diatom and reviews of literature on the autoecologies of these species. In the sediment, high relative abundance of A formosa, Aulacoseira species indicates high wind-driven turbulence of the water column. The diatom record of the past 5000 years shows that the spring wind speed shifted from weak to strong to weak. In our result, the relative abundance of Aulacoseira species decreased sharply, while that of small-cell Cyclotella sensu lato (including Stephanodiscus, Cyclostephanos and Discostella) increased since 2000 cal. yr BP. The broad alternations between these species are probably keyed to mean temperature and wind variations that control lake circulation and stratification. Our results support the hypotheses that abiotic drivers affect the size structure of planktonic communities and that a warmer climate favors small-sized diatom cells. The change in the ratio of A. formosa and Aulacoseira species to Cyclostephanos. Stephanodiscus and Discostella species (AA/SC) basically correspond to change of the spring insolation (May) at 45 degrees N. Abundance of diatoms in Lake Jingpo roughly corresponds to changes in the Mid- to Low-latitude Circulation Index of the northern hemisphere as indicated by WIZ concentration from the GISP2 ice-core, the strength of the Asian summer monsoon as recorded from Hani Peat in Northeastern China, and from a stalagmite found in the Dongge cave in southern China. The results are important in demonstrating the sensitivity of diatoms to climate change, and providing proxy evidence for spring wind speed marked by shifts of diatom type. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Alexander, S; Smock, LA				Alexander, S; Smock, LA			Life histories and production of Cheumatopsyche analis and Hydropsyche betteni (Trichoptera: Hydropsychidae) in an urban Virginia stream	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST												The life histories, abundance, biomass, and production of two species of net-spinning caddisflies, Cheumatopsyche analis and Hydropsyche betteni Ross (Trichoptera: Hydropsychidae), were determined from a 3(rd)-order stream in Virginia. These are the only two species of hydropsychid caddisflies occurring in Upham Brook, which flows through a highly urbanized watershed and which is hydrologically altered by a small (4.85-ha) impoundment. Sampling was conducted at least monthly over one year at sites above, immediately below, and 1 km below the impoundment. Both species produced clear winter and spring-early summer generations as well as one or more additional, partial generations later in the summer. The annual mean density and biomass of C. analis were significantly greater (p < 0.05) immediately below the impoundment (2490 individuals/m(2); 972 mg/m(2)) than above (1315 individuals/m(2); 360 mg/m(2)) and 1 km downstream from the impoundment (1466 individuals/m(2); 467 mg/m(2)). Annual production of C. analis was 18.2 g m(-2) yr(-1) immediately below the impoundment and 7.2-9.5 g m(-2) yr(-1) at the other sites. Mean density and biomass of H. betteni were significantly greater 1 km downstream from the impoundment (156 individual s/m(2); 236 mg/m(2)) compared to above and immediately below the impoundment (28-44 individual s/m(2); 13-38 mg/m(2)). Annual production of H. betteni was highest at 2.5 g m(-2) yr(-1) 1 km downstream from the impoundment and 0.3-0.7 g m(-2) yr(-1) at the other two sites. The production of both species thus was greatest below the impoundment, but peak production of the two species varied depending on the distance below the dam.																			1092-6194	1938-5307					2005	12	4					433	446		10.1656/1092-6194(2005)012[0433:LHAPOC]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1656/1092-6194(2005)012[0433:LHAPOC]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000234612500006

Temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, total hardness, dissolved oxygen, organic matter, nitrite, nitrate, orthophosphate, total phosphorus, sulphate, silica and chlorophyll a concentrations were measured and analysed. During the study, a total of 67 diatom taxa belonging to 30 genera were identified. Navicula spp. (10 taxa) were the most noticeable diatoms in terms of species numbers and numbers of individuals in the epilithon, followed by Cymbella spp. (7 taxa), Epithemia spp. (7 taxa) and Gomphonema spp. (6 taxa) at the stations. The diatoms showed their best growth in late-spring and summer, and they reached their highest numbers in summer. The diatoms occurred in low numbers in the other two seasons. The chemical and physical properties of the lake water were discussed in relation to seasonal occurrence of the diatoms.

This study investigates the seasonal characteristics of eukaryotic microbial communities in the Jihongtan Reservoir, the main water-receiving body of YQWD, over a one-year period using 18S rDNA amplicon sequencing. The results showed that the eukaryotic microbial diversity did not exhibit significant seasonal variation (p > 0.05), but there was a notable variance in the community structure (p < 0.05). Arthropoda and Paracyclopina, representing the most dominant phylum and the most dominant genus, respectively, both exhibited the lowest abundance during the winter. The Chlorophyta, as the second-dominant phylum, demonstrates its higher abundance in the spring and winter. The Mantel test and PLS-PM (Partial Least Squares Path Modeling) revealed that water temperature (WT), dissolved oxygen (DO), and pH influenced the seasonal dynamic of eukaryotic microbial communities significantly, of which WT was the primary driving factor. In addition to environmental factors, water diversion is likely to be an important influencing factor. The results of the co-occurrence network and robustness suggested that the spring network is the most complex and exhibits the highest stability. Moreover, keystone taxa within networks have been identified, revealing that these key groups encompass both abundant and rare species, with specificity to different seasons. These insights are vital for understanding the seasonal variation of microbial communities in the Jihongtan Reservoir during ongoing water diversions.					; Ding, Ning/OGQ-7521-2025; lv, yuanyuan/JJC-4057-2023	Song, Zhiwen/0000-0003-2205-1055; 														2076-2607				SEP	2024	12	9							1873	10.3390/microorganisms12091873	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms12091873								39338548					WOS:001326052400001

Effects of shifting snowmelt regimes on the hydrology of non-alpine temperate landscapes	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Across the globe, increasing winter temperatures resulting from climate change are affecting how and when snow melts. Despite the significance of snowfall to the annual water budget in mid-latitude, non-alpine regions, there has been limited research into shifting snowmelt dynamics in these areas. This study examines snowmelt changes resulting from warmer winters in the Great Lakes region of North America. Using multiple metrics calculated from station temperature data, recent years (2003-2017) were categorized as "warm" or "cool", then snowmelt and regional hydrologic patterns within those year types were examined. Systematic differences were observed, including warmer years having less and earlier snowmelt than cooler years. Those changes have, in turn, led to both lower and earlier spring peak flows in streams and decreased net groundwater recharge in the northern regions. Additionally, we show that differences between warm and cool year types become more significant along a north-south gradient; differences between warm and cool years are more pronounced in northern regions with regard to streamflow, net recharge, melt amount and timing. These results provide a framework to examine linked changes between snowmelt and hydrology across high-latitude temperate regions of the world.

J	COOPER, SD; WINKLER, DW; LENZ, PH				COOPER, SD; WINKLER, DW; LENZ, PH			THE EFFECT OF GREBE PREDATION ON A BRINE SHRIMP POPULATION	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												Investigations were performed at Mono Lake, California, USA, to determine if the marked autumnal decline in the brine shrimp (A. monica Verrill) population was related to the annual arrival of hundreds of thousands of eared grebes (Podiceps nigricollis Brehm). Grebes and brine shrimp were censused through later summer and autumn of 1980 and 1981, and grebes were collected for stomach analyses. Passage times of Artemia through grebe stomachs were estimated by feeding dyed Artemia to marked grebes and collecting these grebes at intervals after they had been fed. The mean number of Artemia eaten per grebe per day ranged from c. [circa] 8000-70,000. The mean proportion of the Artemia population eaten per day tended to increase throughout the autumn, ranging from 0.5% in Aug. to 22% in late Oct. 1980 and from 0.02% in Aug. to 6.6% in late Nov. 1981. Grebe predation could account for 55-83% of the decline in Artemia density in 1980 and 8-27% of the decline in Artemia density in 1981. In both years, grebe predation could account for substantial amounts, but not all, of the observed declines in Artemia levels, and most Artemia mortality was due to other causes in 1981.

The model uses enthalpy rather than temperature as the predictive variable. It helps to set up governing equations more concisely, to deal with the phase change process more easily, and make the numerical scheme simpler. The model is verified by observed data from Lake Kinneret for a non-frozen lake in summer time, and Lake Lower Two Medicine for a frozen lake in winter time. Reasonably good agreements between the model simulations and observed data indicate that the model can serve as a component for a water body in a land surface model. In order to more efficiently apply the scheme in a climate system model, a sensitivity study of various division schemes with less layers in the vertical direction in the water body is conducted. The results of the study show that the division with around 10 vertical layers could produce a prediction accuracy that is comparable to the fine division with around 40 layers.

During the transition period between spring and summer, the inshore-offshore structure of biological and chemical distributions is controlled by the interaction of in situ processes and differences in vertical mixing on either side of the 4.degree. C isotherm. Due to reversals in flow patterns, the effect of advection is to reduce concentration gradients, but the effect on overall distributions is minimal. An analysis of sinking losses in 1- and 2-dimensional models indicates that the artificially low sinking rates used in 1-dimensional models of the Great Lakes result from the neglect of upwelling.

J	BLABER, SJM				BLABER, SJM			BIOLOGY OF FILTER FEEDING TELEOSTS IN LAKE ST-LUCIA, ZULULAND	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The biology of filter feeding teleosts in St. Lucia was studied for 2 yr from 1976-1978. The 3 common species, Gilchristella aestuarius, Hilsa kelee and Thryssa vitrirostris were studied with the composition and cyclical nature of the zooplankton which formed their food. Stolephorus commersonii and Hepsetia breviceps, which were rare, were only briefly examined. The zooplankton was dominated by the calanoid Pseudodiaptomus stuhlmanni which formed > 70% of the calorific value of the zooplankton for 70% of the study period. The mysid Mesopodopsis africana was second in importance in terms of calorific contribution, while the amphipod Grandidierella lignorum was relatively abundant. Larval forms, particularly post-veligers of Assiminea bifasciata, were also important. There was a close correlation between the zooplankton cycles, diel and annual, and the feeding, reproduction and recruitment of the 3 common filter feeding teleosts. G. aestuarius spent its whole life-cycle in the system and spawned in early summer when the resulting juveniles could feed on the summer zooplankton peaks. They grew at 0.5 cm mo.-1 and attained maximum size in 1 yr. They were non-selective taking mainly P. stuhlmanni and post-veligers. H. kelee spawned in the sea and juveniles were common in St. Lucia during 1978 when they fed non-selectively, chiefly on P. stuhlmanni but also on phytoplankton. Adult T. vitrirostris entered St. Lucia in late winter and spawned during the summer before disappearing over the winter. The resulting offspring went through a sequence of dietary changes which were closely related to zooplankton cycles. The importance of P. stuhlmanni in the pelagic food web of St. Lucia is illustrated. The species supports not only the filter feeding teleosts but indirectly supports the predatory fish Argyrosomus hololepidotus and Elops machnata, which feed on G. aestuarius and T. vitrirostris.																				1095-8649					1979	15	1					37	59		10.1111/j.1095-8649.1979.tb03571.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1979.tb03571.x													WOS:A1979HH36900005

J	Proctor, MCF				Proctor, Michael C. F.			ENVIRONMENTAL AND VEGETATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS OF LAKES, FENS AND TURLOUGHS IN THE BURREN	BIOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT-PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL IRISH ACADEMY												The limestone country of the eastern Burren includes permanent lakes, extensive fens, and turloughs-depressions characterised by large fluctuations in water levels that become dry in summer and have distinctive vegetation. Most of the larger lakes lie on an almost level surface, draining southwards via the River Fergus into the Shannon estuary; Lough Bunny drains through the limestone north towards Galway Bay. Field evidence indicates that the lakes and fens, whether they flood in winter or not, have a relatively constant summer water level, probably because the underlying limestone is sealed by glacial drift. Their vegetation follows a normal hydrosere succession from open-water deposits (mostly calcareous marl) to reed swamp and Schoenus fen, culminating locally in raised bog. Present-day exposed expanses of marl are products of erosion of a former peat cover. Turloughs are characterised by unconstrained fluctuations of the water level through most or all of its vertical range. They occur where there is no barrier at the surface to drainage into the limestone, but there is sufficient hydraulic resistance to underground flow to allow water levels to rise during winter and after heavy rain. The vegetation of typical turloughs has more in common with dune slack or flood meadow communities than with true fens.																			0791-7945					JUN	2010	110B	1					17	34		10.3318/BIOE.2010.110.1.17	http://dx.doi.org/10.3318/BIOE.2010.110.1.17													WOS:000278846000003
J	Menendez, M; Sanchez, A				Menendez, M; Sanchez, A			Seasonal variations in P-I responses of Chara hispida L. and Potamogeton pectinatus L. from stream mediterranean ponds	AQUATIC BOTANY												The relationship between primary production and irradiance was analyzed over an annual cycle in the submerged macrophytes, Chara hispida and Potamogeton pectinatus, of two mediterranean stream ponds. The effect of temperature on photosynthesis was also studied. The population of P. pectinatus reached maximum production values of 19.67 mgO(2) g(-1) AFDW h(-1) in December at 20 degrees C. In summer and owing to the development of floating filamentous algae, P. pectinatus growth decreased. This can be observed in a decrease in production and chlorophyll content. At the end of autumn a 'self-pruning' mechanism in P. pectinatus caused increase of light penetration and new shoots were observed. C. hispida showed maximum production values of 10.86 mg O-2 g(-1) AFDW h(-1) in May. In summer, in agreement with temperature increase C. hispida fructifies and decays, increasing P. pectinatus growth and cover in the same pond. Photoinhibition was observed in C. hispida in October, in agreement with a low radiation adaptation owing to an unusual decrease in light penetration in the pond, caused by inputs of suspended material from a fire suffered in the watershed at the end of summer. Variations in temperature had no effect on Pm/R ratio in P. pectinatus and decreased sharply from young to old tissue. The effect of temperature on the Pm/R ratio in C. hispida was significant. P. pectinatus showed great adaptation capacity to temperature fluctuations and light and this adaptation is higher than in C. hispida, which is affected by temperature increase and light penetration reduction.

Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus infection in yellow perch, Perca flavescens, in Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) infects wild and hatchery fish in Europe, Japan, and the Great Lakes and Pacific regions of North America. The virus was associated with a large die-off of yellow perch, Perca flavescens, in Lake Erie in 2006. To determine the infection pattern of VHSV, we sampled yellow perch during the spring, summer, and fall of 2007 and 2008 in the central basin of Lake Erie during routine sampling by the Ohio Division of Wildlife with bottom trawls in nearshore, mid-depth, and offshore locations near the Chagrin River. The Ohio Department of Agriculture's Diagnostic Laboratories and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's La Crosse Fish Health Center tested for VHSV from homogenized samples obtained from yellow perch kidney, spleen, and brain. At each lake sample location, we also measured temperature, dissolved oxygen, and conductivity. In both years, we found yellow perch infected with VHSV during a three-week period starting in the last week of spawning to early June. A high proportion of adult male and female yellow perch tested positive for VHSV during the infection period in our sample population. Infection appeared to be associated with temperatures between 12 and 18 degrees C and with significantly higher yellow perch densities during spawning. No large mortalities of yellow perch were observed during the VHSV infection period in 2007 and 2008. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The foundation for the study was proper classification of the habitat, which is wet meadows. The research confirmed the hypothesis that after mowing, the Phragmites australis does not develop inflorescences in the same growing season, regardless of the time of mowing. Therefore, the presence of old common reed in-florescences in a wet meadow proves that it was not mown last year, assuming mowing after June 15. The height and density of reed shoots and biomass yield depended on hydrothermal conditions, especially on the amount and distribution of precipitation and the groundwater table. Frequent mowing (twice or thrice) stimulated the density of common reed shoots. Such treatments also reduced reed growth, while a single autumn mowing had the least impact on this feature. The development of reed inflorescences was observed to be eliminated by frequent mowing, as well as by mowing performed in the late spring period. On the other hand, throughout the growing season, inflorescences occur only in plots without any treatments and those mown in autumn. The obtained results will help field inspectors to properly assess the controlled wet meadows. For managers and farmers, it will support rational management of common reed cultivation.					; Kulik, Mariusz/AAP-6552-2021; Ja, Ma/JYQ-1186-2024	Bochniak, Andrzej/0000-0001-6664-2741; Jazwa, Malgorzata/0000-0002-5556-6891; 													1617-1381	1618-1093				DEC	2023	76								126492	10.1016/j.jnc.2023.126492	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2023.126492		SEP 2023											WOS:001081317800001

Coilia mystus is the key commercial fish that spawns in the Yangtze Estuary and the yield has declined sharply in the past 30 years. In order to understand the spawning habitat selection mechanism of C. mystus, the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model was applied to explore the non-stationary effect of environmental variables [e.g., the sea surface temperature (SST) and the sea surface salinity (SSS)] and geographical variables [e.g., the distance to the coast (DTC) and the depth (DEP) of water] on the egg density distribution of C. mystus. The data were derived from the spring and summer ichthyoplankton surveys carried out from 2019 to 2020 in the Yangtze Estuary, China. The GWR model results showed that the key variables in different seasons had spatial non-stationary effects on the distribution of spawning habitat of C. mystus, which were mainly caused by regional rise in temperature and saltwater intrusion of the South Branch. In the spring, the SSS, the DTC, and the DEP were the main impact factors and saltwater intrusion in the South Branch might lead to the trend that the spawning habitat moved further upstream to the Changxing Island. The SST was most important in the summer and the relatively lower SST was more crucial in the spawning habitat selection than the DTC and the DEP. The GWR model performed well in the study of C. mystus potential spawning habitat in the Yangtze Estuary. We recommend that more attention should be paid in regional variation of environmental factors to explore fish potential spawning habitat in the estuarine areas.

J	Betts, AK; Reid, D; Crossett, C				Betts, Alan K.; Reid, Daniel; Crossett, Caitlin			Evaluation of the FLake Model in ERA5 for Lake Champlain	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Global model reanalyses of temperature and radiation are used for many purposes because of their spatial and temporal homogeneity. However, they use sub-models for lakes that are smaller than the model grid. This paper compares the simplified small-lake model, known as FLake, used in the European Centre global reanalysis known as ERA5, with observations made in and near Lake Champlain in northern Vermont. Lake Champlain is a challenging test for the ERA5 FLake model. The lake, which extends over several grid cells, is the lowest region at 30 m above sea level within complex mountain topography. The smoothing of the adjacent mountain topography means that the ERA5 grid cells containing the lake have higher mean elevations then 30 m, and this contributes to a small cool bias in FLake mid-summer temperatures. The seasonal cycle of FLake temperatures has a sharper peak than the observed lake temperatures. In winter, lake temperatures are close to 3 degrees C, while the 30 m deep FLake mixed layer (ML) is near freezing. In May and June, FLake maintains a deep ML, while lake profiles are generally strongly stratified with peak temperatures near the surface several degrees above the model ML. One possible contributing reason is that inflowing river temperatures that are not considered by FLake are as much as 5 degrees C above the lake surface temperature from April to June. The lake does develop a ML structure as it cools from the temperature peak in August, but the FLake ML cools faster and grows deeper in fall. We conclude that the vertical mixing in the FLake ML is stronger than the vertical mixing in Lake Champlain.

J	Lei, DA; Jiang, LJ; Wu, XF; Liu, WS; Huang, R				Lei, Dian; Jiang, Lijuan; Wu, Xiaofu; Liu, Wensheng; Huang, Rong			Soil Organic Carbon and Its Controlling Factors in the Lakeside of West Mauri Lake along the Wetland Vegetation Types	PROCESSES												There is a huge carbon pool in the lakeside, which is sensitive to environmental changes and can very easily be transformed into a carbon source as land from the lake is reclaimed. In this paper, West Mauri Lake was employed as a case study to examine soil organic carbon (SOC) and its controlling factors along the lakeside. Four transects of land use (i.e., vegetation) types along the landward lakeside were identified as the fluctuation zone, the beach zone, the mesozoic farmland rewetting zone and the xerophytic farmland rewetting zone. With the increase in soil depth, SOC in the lakeside decreased significantly (p < 0.05). SOC had an obvious seasonal variation (p < 0.001), ranking in order: winter (December) > spring (February) > summer (May). Among the aforementioned transects, SOC density differed significantly (p < 0.05), showing a significant increasing trend. Pearson correlation indicated that most soil physiochemical factors showed a significant correlation with SOC (p < 0.01), except total chromium, total copper, total zinc and total phosphorus. The relationship between SOC density and total nitrogen (N) has an obvious "S" curve, and total N accounts for 81% of the variation of SOC, suggesting that total N is the main controlling factor of SOC in the lakeside. The significant difference in SOC along the different vegetation (land use) types implied that land use affects the SOC in the lakeside. The long-term accumulation of N fertilizer after the man-made reclamation and aquaculture obviously controls SOC in the lakeside of West Mauri Lake.																				2227-9717				APR	2022	10	4							765	10.3390/pr10040765	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pr10040765													WOS:000786241500001

To some extent, the AOD reflects the extent of regional air pollution and is often characterized by significant spatiotemporal dynamics. However, detailed local AOD information is ambiguous at best due to limited monitoring techniques. Currently, the availability of abundant satellite data and constantly updated AOD extraction algorithms offer unprecedented perspectives for high-resolution AOD extraction and long-time series analysis. This study, based on the long-term sequence MOD09A1 data from 2010 to 2018 and lookup table generation, uses the improved deep blue algorithm (DB) to conduct fine-resolution (500 m) AOD (at 550 nm wavelength) remote sensing (RS) estimation on Landsat TM/OLI data from the Urumqi region, analyzes the spatiotemporal AOD variation characteristics in Urumqi and combines gray relational analysis (GRA) and the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model to analyze AOD influence factors and simulate pollutant propagation trajectories in representative periods. The results demonstrate that the improved DB algorithm has a high inversion accuracy for continuous AOD inversion at a high spatial resolution in urban areas. The spatial AOD distribution in Urumqi declines from urban to suburban areas, and higher AODs are concentrated in cities and along roads. Among these areas, Xinshi District has the highest AOD, and Urumqi County has the lowest AOD. The seasonal AOD variation characteristics are distinct, and the AOD order is spring (0.411) > summer (0.285) > autumn (0.203), with the largest variation in spring. The average AOD in Urumqi is 0.187, and the interannual variation generally shows an upward trend. However, from 2010 to 2018, AOD first declined gradually and then declined significantly. Thereafter, AOD reached its lowest value in 2015 (0.076), followed by a significant AOD increase, reaching a peak in 2016 (0.354). This shows that coal to natural gas (NG) project implementation in Urumqi promoted the improvement of Urumqi's atmospheric environment. According to GRA, the temperature has the largest impact on the AOD in Urumqi (0.699). Combined with the HYSPLIT model, it was found that the aerosols observed over Urumqi were associated with long-range transport from Central Asia, and these aerosols can affect the entire northern part of China through long-distance transport.

Gary			Comparison of metabolic rate between two genetically distinct populations of lake sturgeon	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Environmental temperatures differ across latitudes in the temperate zone, with relatively lower summer and fall temperatures in the north leading to a shorter growing season prior to winter. As an adaptive response, during early life stages, fish in north- ern latitudes may grow faster than their conspecifics in southern latitudes, which potentially manifests as different allometric relationships between body mass and metabolic rate. In the present study, we examined if population or year class had an effect on the variation of metabolic rate and metabolic scaling of age-0 lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) by examining these traits in both a northern (Nelson River) and a southern (Winnipeg River) population. We compiled 6 years of data that used inter- mittent flow respirometry to measure metabolic rate within the first year of life for developing sturgeon that were raised in the same environment at 16 degrees C. We then used a Bayesian modeling approach to examine the impacts of population and year class on metabolic rate and mass-scaling of metabolic rate. Despite previous reports of genetic differences between populations, our results showed that there were no significant differences in standard metabolic rate, routine metabolic rate, maximum metabolic rate, and metabolic scaling between the two geographically separated populations at a temperature of 16 degrees C. Our analysis implied that the lack of metabolic differences be- tween populations could be due to family effects/parental contribution, or the rearing temperature used in the study. The present research provided insights for conserva- tion and reintroduction strategies for these populations of lake sturgeon, which are endangered or threatened across most of their natural range.

J	Eastwood, S; Couture, P				Eastwood, S; Couture, P			Seasonal variations in condition and liver metal concentrations of yellow perch (Perca flavescens) from a metal-contaminated environment	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												The relationships between liver metal (Cu, Zn and Ni) concentration and physical condition of yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were compared in fish sampled in five northeastern Ontario Lakes in the spring and seven lakes in the fall of 1997. These lakes represented a wide range of metal contamination, pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and alkalinity. Lakes situated closest to emission point source had lower pH. alkalinity and DOC and higher aqueous metal concentrations than other lakes in this study. Fish from these lakes displayed higher liver metal concentrations. Seasonal variations in liver metal concentrations were observed in the most metal-contaminated lakes, with higher Cu levels in the spring and higher Zn and Ni concentrations in the fall. These fish had lower indicators of physical condition than fish from cleaner lakes. In particular, more metal-contaminated fish were smaller for a similar age, indicating slower growth rate, and had lower relative condition factor and scaling coefficients. The scaling coefficient is a descriptor of the growth pattern of fish, and higher values indicate increased weight gain per unit of growth in length. Negative (P < 0.05) relationships are reported between lake alkalinity and liver Cu concentration (in both seasons) and Zn concentration (in spring only). In both seasons mean liver Cu content was negatively associated (P < 0.05) with the scaling coefficient of the fish samples. With these data, we propose the use of the scaling coefficient as a simple biomonitoring tool to detect metal effects on the physical condition of yellow perch. Data presented here provide information on seasonal variations in liver metal concentration and condition of yellow perch that should be considered in the design of field studies investigating physiological effects of metals in wild fish. This work also describes a gradient of lake and fish metal contamination that is related to the physical condition of yellow perch. This system provides a unique research opportunity to further our limited knowledge of the effects of metals on the physiology of wild fish. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Rabette, C; Lair, N				Rabette, C; Lair, N			Spatial and temporal distribution of benthic stages of Cyclops vicinus and Chaoborus flavicans in relation to abiotic factors and benthic fauna	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The horizontal distributions of the benthic stages of Chaoborus flavicans and Cyclops vicinus were studied in a eutrophic stratified lake in the Massif-Central (France) over one year, at 5 stations from the shore to the centre of the lake. Their distribution was investigated in relation to temperature, dissolved oxygen, sediment grain-size and other benthic organisms. The dominant taxa of the benthic fauna of Lake Aydat were dipterans, crustaceans and oligochaetes and their distributions were independent of the grain size. In contrast to chironomids which preferentially inhabited the sublittoral zone, chaoborids and crustaceans were more numerous in the profundal zone. The sediment-dwelling oligochaetes remained numerous in both zones, according to the season. The fourth copepodite stages of Cyclops and Tubifex are tolerant to low oxygen concentrations in contrast to the fourth instar larvae of Chaoborus whose distribution was positively correlated with oxygen. The guts of these dipteran larvae were found to be empty and we assumed that, in contrast to the chironomids and oligochaetes, the resting stages of Cyclops vicinus and the benthic stages of Chaoborus flavicans did not use benthic resources. The former are activated at the autumn overturn, while the latter escape from the bottom at the start of the spring oxygen depletion. This suggests that physical factors are largely responsible for their reactivation. Both animals suffered of the effects of starvation and probably lost weight. The reactivation of the copepod at the autumn overturn would be facilitated by fluid mechanical disturbance. In addition, after the spring overturn, a small increase in temperature near 4 degrees C would be a reliable environmental signal for the dipteran. Food limitation does not occur, invertebrate predation pressure seems to be negligible and the predation by fish on the macrobenthic fauna and by chance on the meiofauna, clearly remains limited in both space and time.																			0018-8158						1998	390	1-3					61	72		10.1023/A:1003559832628	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003559832628													WOS:000080235900007

Occurrence, distribution and bioaccumulation of endocrine disrupting compounds in water, sediment and biota samples from a European river basin	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The occurrence, distribution and bioaccumulation of five endocrine disrupting compounds (4-tert-octylphenol, 4-n-octylphenol, 4-n-nonylphenol, nonylphenol and bisphenol A) in water, sediment and biota (Corbicula fluminea) collected along the Minho River estuary (NW Iberian Peninsula) were examined. Samples were collected in two campaigns (May and November, 2012) and analyzed by different extraction procedures followed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry determination. The presence of linear isomers (4-noctylphenol and 4-n-nonylphenol) was scarcely observed whereas branched isomers (4-tert-octylphenol and nonylphenol) were measured in almost all samples. Wastewater treatment plant effluents and nautical, fishing and agricultural activities are considered the primary source of pollution of the river by alkylphenols. The presence of bisphenol A in the river could be mainly associated to punctual sources of contamination from industrial discharges. A decrease in the total concentration of phenolic compounds in water was observed from spring to autumn (from 0.888 mu g L-1 in May to 0.05 mu g L-1 in November), while similar values were shown in C. fluminea samples from the two campaigns (1388 and 1228 ng g(-1) dw in spring and autumn, respectively). In sediments, the total concentration of the target compounds varied between 13 and 4536 ng g(-1) dw (average of 1041 ng g(-1) dw). Sediment-water partition coefficient (K-d), bioaccumulation factor (BAF) and biota-sediment accumulation factor (BSAF) were estimated and highest values were obtained for nonylphenol. Calculated risk quotients showed low and moderate risk for the aquatic environment from the presence of the target compounds at all sampling points. The estimation of the daily intake of the studied compounds via water and biota ingestion indicated no risk for human health. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The sedimentary succession shows evidence of three main episodes of Holocene glacier expansion. The first is recorded in the basal part of the core up to 370 cm. According to the age/depth relationship in the sediment core (based on 12 AMS radiocarbon dates), this glacier expansion episode terminated about 10200 cal. yr BP. The second major glacier phase lasted from 8400 to 8100 cal. yr BP, while the third was initiated around 4000 cal, yr BP and has continued up to the present. At 43 cm in the core, the medium silt content increases significantly, accompanied by a minor increase in the sand content. This textural change is interpreted as the first time that the terminus of Flatebreen extended into an upstream lake at 1083 m a.s.l. The age model suggests that this event took place around 800 cal. yr BP (similar to AD 1150), as a response to the initial 'Little Ice Age' glacier expansion after the 'Mediaeval Warm Period'. By using a Holocene-inferred summer-temperature curve from central southern Norway in the exponential relationship between annual winter precipitation (snow) and ablation-season temperature at the ELA, periods of higher winter precipitation than the 1961-90 normal in the Jostedalsbreen region are inferred for 9700-9400, 9200-8300, 8200-6500, 5700-5100, 4700-4600, 4500-4300, 3800-3000, 2100-1800, 1600-1300 and 1200-1000 cal. yr BP, and from 900 cal, yr BP to the present. The intervening periods of lower than normal winter precipitation correlate with periods of enhanced ice-rafting in the North Atlantic.

Earlier ice melt increases hypolimnetic oxygen despite regional warming in small Arctic lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS												Although trends toward earlier ice-out have been documented globally, the links between ice-out timing and lake thermal and biogeochemical structure vary spatially. In high-latitude lakes where ice-out occurs close to peak intensity of solar radiation, these links remain unclear. Using a long-term dataset from 13 lakes in West Greenland, we investigated how changing ice-out and weather conditions affect lake thermal structure and oxygen concentrations. In early ice-out years, lakes reach higher temperatures across the water column and have deeper epilimnia. Summer hypolimnia are the warmest (similar to 11 degrees C) in years when cooler air temperatures follow early ice-out, allowing full lake turnover. Due to the higher potential for substantive spring mixing in early ice-out years, a warmer hypolimnion is associated with higher dissolved oxygen concentrations. By affecting variability in spring mixing, the consequences of shifts in ice phenology for lakes at high latitudes differ from expectations based on temperate regions.

These changes are most noticeable during winter, when the potentially toxic Planktothrix rubescens forms its inoculum for annual blooms. Mostly, research has been conducted on alpine lakes, where blooms have persisted for decades, while a few have focused on temperate lakes. Our study aimed to determine the factors influencing the dynamics of the development of P. rubescens in temperate lakes where blooms occasionally occur, with a particular emphasis on the role of ice phenology. Methods We investigated the vertical distribution of P. rubescens in an annual cycle in three temperate lakes. Samples were collected monthly in the winter and biweekly during the vegetative seasons. Overall, 434 samples were collected and analyzed according to biological and chemical parameters. Physical parameters were measured in situ. Results The vegetation seasons in temperate lakes showed a similar development pattern in the P. rubescens population as that in alpine lakes. Our results also show the influence of physical and chemical factors on the vertical distribution of this cyanobacterium. These results revealed the significant impact of P. rubescens filaments on phytoplankton biodiversity and biomass. Our data show the role of ice phenology in the establishment of the winter inoculum of P. rubescens and its further mass development until its disappearance in autumn. Conclusion A climate-zone-independent pattern of P. rubescens blooms was observed during the vegetation periods. The population of P. rubescens was more influenced by physical factors than by the availability of dissolved nutrients in the water. Despite the same etiology, global warming has been shown to cause different responses in aquatic ecosystems, which affect the different nature of P. rubescens appearances. We associated blooms in temperate lakes, in contrast to alpine lakes, mainly with the presence of ice cover during severe winters, when the species establishes its inoculum. Hence, blooms in temperate lakes occur at different time intervals. Therefore, the dynamics of periodic blooms of P. rubescens in temperate lakes provide novel knowledge to the case study and a counterpoint to permanent blooms found in deep alpine lakes.

The Size Structure of Unicellular Plankton (Size-Taxonomic and Size-Trophic Spectra) in a Hypertrophic Urban Lake	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												The results of an analysis of the size spectra of unicellular plankton (bacteria, algae, ciliates) in a hypertrophic freshwater urban lake (Bol'shoe Vasilyevskoe Lake, Togliatti, Russia) are presented. Two types of size spectra have been identified in the seasonal cycle. A strong nanoplanktonic maximum formed mainly by phototrophic cyanobacteria and Chlorophyta was found during the period of open water (spring to autumn); the picoplankton maximum/maxima (mainly heterotrophic bacteria) and an increased proportion of microplankton (heterotrophic and mixotrophic ciliates) were noted in the ice period. A peculiarity of the lake studied, in contrast to less productive ones, is the stability of the plankton size structure over the past 25 years.

J	BAKKER, C; DEVRIES, I				BAKKER, C; DEVRIES, I			PHYTOPLANKTON DYNAMIC AND NUTRIENT DYNAMIC IN SALINE LAKE GREVELINGEN (SW NETHERLANDS) UNDER DIFFERENT HYDRODYNAMICAL CONDITIONS IN 1978-1980	NETHERLANDS JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH												Hydrographical and phytoplankton biomass parameters were studied in Lake Grevelingen, stressing 1978-1980. Clear salinity stratifications were observed during periods of flushing with North Sea water. This was accompanied by strong gradients of water temperature, O2 content, pH, Si and ammonium-concentration. High nutrient concentrations were not caused by import from the North Sea, but from release from the bottom sediments. Under stratified (water depth > 5 m) conditions, minimum Si fluxes of > 100 mg Si .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. d-1 were estimated. The phytoplankton assemblage of Lake Grevelingen represents an impoverished version of the neritic community of the Southern Bight of the North Sea and of the Eastern Scheldt estuary. In summer it consists mainly of diatoms (especially Ditylum brightwellii and Chaetoceros spp.); some flagellates dominate in spring (especially Cryptomonas spp.). In 1979, during flushing with North Sea water, the increasing salinity and import of phytoplankton species caused a shift of the species composition from a community with a lake character to one exhibiting an estuarine character. Phytoplankton biomass was significantly larger, especially in summer, than before and after the period of continuous flushing. Availability and decrease of Si in spring was not correlated with the increase of planktonic biomass, because cryptomonad flagellates dominated during that period, instead of diatoms. Several increases of biomass of diatoms during summer could be explained by sudden increases of Si and N concentrations caused by release from the bottom and turnover of the stratification. This suggests that the phytoplankton biomass was limited by Si and N during summer. Some diatom species changed their morphological appearance, showing a more delicate structure in Lake Grevelingen than in the tidal estuary of the Eastern Scheldt. The adaptive function of this phenomenon is discussed in relation to literature data. The hydrodynamic changes in Lake Grevelingen, consequence of the functioning of the sluice in the closing dam with the North Sea, markedly influenced the environmental factors controlling species composition, biomass and productivity of the phytoplankton. Under semi-stagnant conditions in 1980 biomass values declined strongly but primary productivity even rose to a higher level. The pelagic compartment of the lake was still far from stable. The highly productive phytoplankton assemblage, growing under limiting nutrient conditions in summer, was based on low biomass values and evidently underwent rapid processes of elimination of biomass.																			0077-7579						1984	18	3-4					191	220		10.1016/0077-7579(84)90002-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0077-7579(84)90002-4													WOS:A1984ASJ2800002
J	Asaeda, T; Van Bon, T				Asaeda, T; Van Bon, T			Modelling the effects of macrophytes on algal blooming in eutrophic shallow lakes	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												A dynamic model for eutrophication incorporating phytoplankton and nutrients in the overlying water, submerged macrophytes Potamogeton pectinatus L., and nutrient dynamics in sediments was developed as a functional tool to understand the effects of macrophytes on algal blooming in shallow lakes. The submodule for the overlying water treats three types of phytoplankton (diatoms, green and blue green algae), the macro-nutrients, as well as dissolved oxygen in the water, while the macrophyte submodule consists of equations for the time-dependence of the macrophyte components: shoots, secondary shoots, roots, tubers, and new tubers. The sediment submodule describes the concentrations of detritus, nitrates, ammonium, dissolved oxygen, and phosphates. These modules are processed simultaneously. The model was applied to the Lake Veluwe (Netherlands) experiment, successfully reproducing the seasonal changes in the lake, such as the transition of the dominant species of phytoplankton from diatoms during spring, green algae in summer, to blue green algae in late autumn depending on the nutrient and light condition, nutrient concentration in the water, and the yearly life-cycle of macrophytes. The model also describes the long term transition in the lake: after artificial flushing with water rich in nitrates and calcium, the return flux from the sediment decreased, and together with the reduction in the external load, the phosphate concentration in the overlying water decreased. This lessened the phytoplankton biomass in the water, which resulted in the remarkable development of macrophytes under the improved light condition. Sensitivity analyses of important coefficients indicated that the maximum photosynthesis and respiration rate are the most sensitive parameters for macrophyte and algal development. The parameters have sufficient accuracy to be successfully applied to other experiments. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Extreme cold events (ECEs) have signifi-cant impacts on agriculture and forestry and can cause serious economic damage. Therefore, considering the variability of ECEs is crucial for disaster prevention and mitigation. We aim to investigate the interannual variability of winter ECEs in Xinjiang and the underlying mechanisms. The results indicate that the anomalous atmospheric circulation responsible for ECEs is related to ice-air interactions over the Barents-Kara (B-K) Seas. In years with negative B-K sea ice anomalies in autumn, the tropospheric temperature over the B-K Seas increases due to enhanced surface heat fluxes. This warming subsequently affects the positive geopotential height anomaly in the troposphere, stimulating zonal wavenumber 1 and wave-number 2, which propagate upward into the stratosphere in November, resulting in the weakening of the stratospheric polar vortex. Subsequently, the tropospheric circulation adjusts simultaneously, further weakening the tropospheric polar vortex. This condition lasts until February. The weakened tropospheric polar vortex, combined with a southeastward meridional wave train pattern, strengthens the Lake Baikal trough and Ural high, leading to the cooling of the Siberian continent. Meanwhile, the weakening of the tropospheric polar vortex causes ascending anomalies over the Arctic and descending anomalies over Siberia, weakening the polar circulation cell and strengthening the Siberian high. The near-surface anticyclonic circulation anomaly results in enhanced northeasterly winds over the Siberian continent, contributing to the occurrence of ECEs in Xinjiang.																			0022-4928	1520-0469				JUL	2025	82	7					1467	1478		10.1175/JAS-D-24-0065.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAS-D-24-0065.1													WOS:001545521200001
J	Hamdi, N; Touihri, M; Charfi, F				Hamdi, Nabil; Touihri, Moez; Charfi, Faouzia			Ecological diagnosis of the Ichkeul National Park (Tunisia) after dams building: the case of waterbirds.	REVUE D ECOLOGIE-LA TERRE ET LA VIE												Ecological diagnosis of the Ichkeul National Park (Tunisia) after dams building : the case of waterbirds. The Ichkeul National Park (INP) has been ratified as a National Park (1980), a Biosphere Reserve under UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere Program (1977), and a Wetland of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention (1980), and subsequently has been inscribed on the World Heritage List (1980). However, this area is actually threatened by three dams which can retain up to 75 % of the inflow freshwater. According to this situation, fundamental modifications of different components of the INP were recognized. The modification of the hydrological parameters and the response of waterbird community to dam building have been specifically assessed in the present paper. Across 2001-2004, the salinity of the lake ranged from an average of 21 g l(-1) in winter to 37 g l(-1) in summer with an annual average of 27 g l(-1). This latest value was more than two times that recorded before the dams were built. Thus, the densities of Potamogeton and Scirpus populations were dramatically decreased, reducing the available food of herbivorous waterbirds, notably ducks and coots. They were restricted each year to within the mouths of rivers and covered a small area in September before disappearing by the end of October and November. Concerning waterbird communities, a total of 71 species were counted. The commonest species that accounted for more than 54 % of the total abundance of the waterbird communities were : Common Coot (21 %), Common Pochard (16 %), Eurasian Wigeon (12 %) and Greater Flamingo (5 %). The most abundant trophic groups were herbivores (11 species and 75 V. of the total abundance of waterbird communities), filterers (3 species and 5 %), vertebrate consumers (14 species and 3 %) and insectivores (26 species and 9 %). Subordinate ones were invertebrates-vertebrates consumers (8 species and 1 %), invertebrates-herbivores (6 species and 5 %) and omnivores (3 species and 2 %). The total species richness varied significantly among months. It ranged from 39 to 41 species, between November and December, and the minimum from 12 to 14 species, during June and July. Species abundance also varied significantly between months with a peak during November and December of about 50 000 individuals. The lowest species abundance values were recorded in July and August with an abundance of about 1500 to 3000 individuals. The INP constitutes a very important area during the autumn migration and wintering periods and provides a habitat for a large range of groups of wintering., waterbirds, notably herbivorous species. Thus, the competition for resources may be higher in winter than in summer. The total number of species is still decreasing from 93 species (1966-1985) and 90 species (1982-1994) to 71 species in 2001-2004. This variation is most likely dependent on the variation of the number of sporadic species visiting the site than due to the local conditions. The annual density of all waterbird communities decreased dramatically of about 40% after the building of dams. This condition was mainly caused by the decreasing number of herbivores. Indeed, they presented the lowest peak abundance estimations obtained since the beginning of waterbird counts in the park. There were about 120 000 birds in 1963-1983, 90 000 birds in 1984-1992, 121 000 birds in 1993-1994, but 60 000 in the present assessment. We support the hypothesis that freshwater diversion and increasing salinity caused severe depletion of Potamogeton and Scirpus, ad therefore, a worrying reality of the feeding condition for this trophic group. Furthermore, the intensive pressure of feeding exercised by the herbivorous species on wetland production has been identified as having a negative local effect on the Potamogeton population dynamics mainly when the productivity of the Ichkeul National Park was low. From those results, it is suggested that dams built upstream of the Ichkeul National Park caused significant changes to the abundance of waterbird community.

Instead, Planktothrix (Oscillatoria) agardhii has tended to occur abundantly in summer and autumn. The TN:TP ratios of the water during the growing season were mostly less than 10 before 1986, but exceeded 20 or 21 after 1987; coinciding with an increase in nitrogen loading. The light-saturated rate of photosynthesis in the growing season was influenced mainly by nitrogen limitation from 1981 to 1986, but changed to phosphorus limitation from 1987 to 1989. The possibility that the shift from Microcystis spp. to P. agardhii is related to the change in the N:P ratio of the lake water is discussed.

Vegetative vigor and reproductive vitality for B. spicant were estimated. Sterile frond length ranged from 47.9 cm at Twanoh to 19.0 cm at the Hoh Stand. Spore germination approached zero in the Hoh and Mason Mountain populations. The optimum habitat for B. spicant, represented by the Twanoh Stand, was wetter than mean sites in the Tsuga heterophylla zone, where Oplopanax horridum and Lysichitum americanum were abundant, Oxalis oregana was absent and Polystichum munitum was uncommon. Species composition, density and phenology were determined for mixed fern gametophyte populations at Lake Quinault. Gametophytes were first found in early fall, grew vigorously over the winter, and produced sporophytes through late spring. Female, bisexual and male gametophytes occurred in mixed-species populations at densities up to 4.5 cm-2. Sporophytes appeared shortly after development of archegonia on bisexual and female gametophytes. Polyembryony did not occur. As almost all archegoniate plants bore sporophytes in dense populations, competition among gametophytes was thought to be minimal. Dense populations of young sporophytes later occupied sites sufficient for single perennating sporophytes. Strong competition probably occurs between young sporophytes, and gametophyte reproductive mechanisms that increase heterozygosity may be selected in dense populations.																			0006-8071						1981	142	2					251	258		10.1086/337220	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/337220													WOS:A1981LZ96600012
J	HAYES, DB; TAYLOR, WW				HAYES, DB; TAYLOR, WW			CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION OF SOMATIC AND GONADAL TISSUES OF YELLOW PERCH FOLLOWING WHITE SUCKER REMOVAL	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We determined the response of the proximate composition of yellow perch Perca flavescens to removal of a food competitor, the white sucker Catostomus commersoni, in a whole-lake manipulation of Douglas Lake, Michigan. Following removal of 80% of the adult white sucker population, the composition of somatic tissue of adult yellow perch collected from mid-April to mid-July improved, with water content decreasing and fat and caloric contents increasing. In a nearby reference lake, yellow perch proximate composition showed either no change or became less favorable during the same time period. From mid-July to mid-October, somatic tissue composition showed no improvement in Douglas Lake; this is consistent with a previous study showing that feeding rate late in the summer was not significantly different after sucker removal. Gonadal development had a strong influence on the composition of somatic tissues. Immediately following spawning, fat and energy reserves were depleted and the water content of somatic tissues was high. During the summer (May through August), yellow perch stored fat and energy in somatic tissues, and their body water contents decreased in both lakes. Both sexes of yellow perch began gonad development during September and showed concurrent declines in fat and energy content in somatic tissues. Male yellow perch completed gonad development by mid-October, whereas gonadal development in females continued until spawning in late April. Male and female yellow perch showed similar rates of decline in fat and energy content during the winter, even though females were developing gonadal tissue during this time and males were not. Because female yellow perch required additional energy for gonadal development during the winter but showed a rate of somatic energy depiction similar to that of males, it appears that female yellow perch either rely on feeding or use energy-saving behaviors during the winter to supply the additional energy required for gonadal development. The improvement we observed in yellow perch body composition following white sucker removal indicates that fish respond to reductions in competition with qualitative changes in proximate composition as well as with quantitative changes in growth.																			0002-8487					MAR	1994	123	2					204	216		10.1577/1548-8659(1994)123<0204:CITCOS>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1994)123<0204:CITCOS>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1994NA85000008

Passive sampling devices (PSDs) were employed in the storm-water drainage of the city of Lahti, in an adjacent boreal lake (Vesijarvi) and along its shore. Samples were analysed for 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and 28 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) with a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer. Concentrations of contaminants were elevated in the stormwater drainage and in the vicinity of the stormwater outlets in Vesijarvi, but declined as a function of distance from the shore. Atmospheric PAH concentrations were significantly higher in the autumn than in the summer. Petrogenic PAHs contributed significantly to stormwater contamination, while pyrogenic pollutants mainly appeared to be carried to Vesijarvi by atmospheric transport.																			1239-6095	1797-2469				APR 8	2016	21	1-2					87	100																WOS:000374619900006

Influence of migrant tundra swans (Cygnus columbianus) and Canada geese (Branta canadensis) on aquatic vegetation at Long Point, Lake Erie, Ontario	HYDROBIOLOGIA					4th Conference on Limnology and Water Birds	AUG 03-07, 2003	Sackville, CANADA	WG Aquat Birds				Numerous studies have shown that large, herbivorous waterfowl can reduce quantity of aquatic plants during the breeding or wintering season, but relatively few document herbivory effects at staging areas. This study was done to determine if feeding activities of tundra swans (Cygnus columbianus columbianus) and Canada geese (Branta canadensis) had a measurable additive influence on the amount of aquatic plants, primarily muskgrass (Chara vulgaris), wild celery (Vallisneria americana), and sago pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus), removed during the fall migration period at Long Point, Lake Erie, Ontario. Exclosure experiments done in fall 1998 and 1999 showed that, as compared to ducks and abiotic factors, these two large herbivorous waterfowl did not have any additional impact on above or below ground biomass of those aquatic plants. As expected, however, there were substantial seasonal reductions in above-ground and below-ground biomass of aquatic plants in wetlands that were heavily used by all waterfowl. We suggest that differences in large- and small-scale habitat use, feeding activity, and food preferences between tundra swans and other smaller waterfowl as well as compensatory herbivory contributed to our main finding that large waterfowl did not increase fall reductions of Chara spp, V. Americana, and P. pectinatus biomass.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2006	567						195	211		10.1007/s10750-006-0045-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0045-z													WOS:000239147500016
J	Sudo, M; Kawachi, T; Hida, Y; Kunimatsu, T				Sudo, M; Kawachi, T; Hida, Y; Kunimatsu, T			Spatial distribution and seasonal changes of pesticides in Lake Biwa, Japan	LIMNOLOGY												The spatial distribution and seasonal variation in the concentrations in Lake Biwa of pesticides used in paddy fields were studied. Lake Biwa is the largest lake in Japan and is a recognized water resource for 14 million people in the Kinki district. Samples were collected nine times from April to December 2001 at ten sites within the lake and at the mouths of six influent rivers. Weekly sampling was also carried out at a single site on an effluent river. Among the 20 pesticides analyzed, the detection frequencies in surface water were almost 100% for simetryn, bromobutide, and isoprothiolane; around 75% for molinate and pyroquilon; around 30% for three herbicides and one fungicide; and almost zero for the remaining substances. The maximum concentrations of pesticides detected frequently in the lake were in the range 0.1-0.4 mug l(-1). The occurrence of a few pesticides below the thermocline may be explained by thermal stratification and vertical circulation. Although the thermocline suppressed vertical diffusion in spring and summer during pesticide application periods, a few pesticides remaining at the surface of the lake in winter were transported to the hypolimnion by vertical circulation and remained there even after the reestablishment of the thermocline. The half-lives of pesticides in the lake were estimated to be more than a year for simetryn, half a year for bromobutide, 1.5 months for molinate, and I month for dimepiperate. The main cause of elimination for molinate and dimepiperate was estimated to be degradation, that for simetryn was outflow, and for bromobutide both degradation and outflow were significant.																			1439-8621	1439-863X				AUG	2004	5	2					77	86		10.1007/s10201-003-0115-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-003-0115-0													WOS:000223274100003

HYDROBIOLOGIA					VIIIth International Rotifer Symposium	JUN 22, 1997	ST JOHNS UNIV, COLLEGEVILLE, MN		ST JOHNS UNIV			From the end of May to November 1995 the succession of rotifers and cladocerans was investigated in Muggelsee with samples taken twice a week. Keratella cochlearis was the only rotifer which was found on every sampling day and this species also showed the highest abundances. During summer, when frequencies of strong wind events were low and water was strongly stratified, three small cladocerans were dominant (Daphnia cucullata, Chydorus sphaericus, Eubosmina coregoni). Food supply was the main limiting factor for Keratella spp. and Synchaeta spp. In autumn, however, when the intervals between strong winds were shorter, rotifers with shorter periods for population development prospered. Zooplankton diversity first increased and subsequently decreased after disturbances. The results do not support the intermediate disturbance hypothesis in its present formulation.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1998	387						199	206		10.1023/A:1017045927016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017045927016													WOS:000080234300028
J	Lampert, W; Lampert, KP; Larsson, P				Lampert, Winfried; Lampert, Kathrin P.; Larsson, Petter			Coexisting overwintering strategies in Daphnia pulex: A test of genetic differences and growth responses	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We tested whether clones of Daphnia pulex in a mesotrophic lake differ with respect to overwintering strategies: either surviving the winter as parthenogenetic females with reduced metabolism in pelagic waters, or as sexually produced dormant embryos in ephippia. During winter 2007, we established two groups of clonal laboratory lines from females collected in the lake and neonates hatched from ephippia. Genetic relatedness and differentiation of the two clonal groups were studied with microsatellite markers, and compared to the genetic structure of a field reference population. Flow-through experiments designed to measure the specific juvenile growth rate (g(j)) of individual clones (a good proxy of fitness) at low and at high food concentrations show that differences in g(j) indicate physiological adaptation of the different starting populations to improving food conditions in spring. Although g(j) differed significantly among individual clones, both below and above the incipient limiting food concentration, we found no significant differences between the clonal groups. There was considerable clonal variation for reaction norms of g(j), but neither the group means of the slopes of reaction norms nor of the threshold food concentrations for growth differed significantly. The lack of differences in group means so far does not support the hypothesis that clones are specialized for either parthenogenetic or for dormant overwintering. It rather suggests a mixed strategy of individual females producing resting stages as insurance and then trying to survive the winter in an active state.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				SEP	2010	55	5					1893	1900		10.4319/lo.2010.55.5.1893	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2010.55.5.1893													WOS:000283667100008

Identically long individuals of all 3 spp. had almost the same filtering rates in spring; whereas in summer animals of identical weights had similar filtering rates regardless of species because of the length variability of the helmets. The grazing rate of adult filter-feeding crustaceans is suggested to be approximately 7% per day.																			0020-9309						1983	68	2					227	237		10.1002/iroh.19830680208	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19830680208													WOS:A1983QU48200005
J	Dai, GZ; Shang, JL; Qiu, BS				Dai, Guo-Zheng; Shang, Jin-Long; Qiu, Bao-Sheng			Ammonia may play an important role in the succession of cyanobacterial blooms and the distribution of common algal species in shallow freshwater lakes	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												With the human intensification of agricultural and industrial activities, large amount of reduced nitrogen enter into the biosphere, which consequently results in the development of global eutrophication and cyanobacterial blooms. However, no research had reported the effect of ammonia toxicity on the algal succession. In this study, we investigated the ammonia toxicity to 19 algal species or strains to test the hypothesis that ammonia may regulate the succession of cyanobacterial blooms and the distribution of common algal species in freshwater lakes. The bloom-forming cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa PCC 7806 suffered from ammonia toxicity at high pH value and light intensity conditions. Low NH4Cl concentration (0.06 mmol L-1) resulted in the decrease of operational PSII quantum yield by 50% compared with the control exposed to 1000 mu mol photons m-2 s-1 for 1 h at pH 9.0 +/- 0.2, which can be reached in freshwater lakes. Furthermore, the tolerant abilities to NH3 toxicity of 18 freshwater algal species or strains were as follows: hypertrophication species > eutrophication species > mesotrophication species > oligotrophication species. The different sensitivities of NH3 toxicity in this study could well explain the distributing rule of common algal species in the freshwater lakes of different trophic states. Meanwhile, the cyanobacterial bloom (e.g. M. aeruginosa) always happened at the low concentration of ammonia in summer, and disappeared with the decrease of ammonia. This may be attributed to the toxic effect of ammonia to M. aeruginosa in spring (the average and maximum ammonia concentration were 0.08 and 0.72 mmol L-1 in 33 Chinese lakes), and the low level of NH3-N in summer and fall in the lakes might be used as preferred nitrogen nutrition by M. aeruginosa, rather than with toxicity. Therefore, ammonia could be a key factor to determine the distribution of common algal species and cyanobacterial bloom in the freshwater systems.					; shang, jinlong/KHX-2738-2024	shang, jinlong/0000-0002-6922-7129; Qiu, Bao-Sheng/0000-0002-7848-1612; Dai, Guozheng/0000-0002-3617-6986; 													1354-1013	1365-2486				MAY	2012	18	5					1571	1581		10.1111/j.1365-2486.2012.02638.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2012.02638.x													WOS:000302543500010
J	Hudon, C; Paquet, S; Jarry, V				Hudon, C; Paquet, S; Jarry, V			Downstream variations of phytoplankton in the St Lawrence river (Quebec, Canada)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Longitudinal variations of phytoplankton biomass and composition were assessed in a 250 km-long section of the St.Lawrence River, which alternately runs through narrow (< 2 km) river cross sections and wide (up to 10 km) fluvial lakes. In the main river stem, concentrations of suspended matter and total phosphorus increased with distance downstream, whereas light penetration decreased. Seasonal changes in plankton composition and biomass were more important than those resulting from differences in water mass (tributary) of origin. Sampling at three cross river sections and in two fluvial lakes showed a progressive downstream decrease in phytoplankton biomass and changes in size structure and taxonomic composition. River plankton was primarily composed of small (< 10 mu m equivalent spherical diameter), truly planktonic cells belonging to Cryptophyceae and diatoms, with Chlorophyceae in summer. Plankton sampled in summer among rooted macrophytes in fluvial lakes exhibited a higher biomass of resuspended periphytic algae than in the main river stem, which contributed slightly to downstream phytoplankton biomass. Successive river cross sections always shared about 50% of their taxa, indicating a rapid downstream transport of algae within the main water mass. However, the proportion of species common to all cross sections was highest during the spring freshet, and lowest during summer low discharge, likely resulting from the development of a distinct flora in fluvial lakes during summer. Conversely, about 30% of the identified taxa were exclusive to a cross section and were replaced by others occurring downstream. Overall, phytoplankton composition along the St.Lawrence River is primarily controlled by advective forces, which result in a homogeneous flora in the main river stem, with a local contribution of resuspended periphyton from fluvial lakes.

Linking a regional climate model (RCM) configured for contemporary atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, with a phytoplankton community model (PROTECH) produced realistic simulations of 20 years of recent phytoplankton data from Bassenthwaite Lake, in the North-West of England. 2. Meteorological drivers were derived from the RCM to represent a future climate scenario involving a 1% per annum compound increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations until 2100. Using these drivers, PROTECH was run for another 20 year period representing the last two decades of the 21st century. 3. Comparison of these present and future simulations revealed likely impacts on the current seasonal phytoplankton development. Under future climate conditions, the simulated spring bloom showed an increase in cyanobacteria dominance caused by greater success of Planktothrix. Also, the summer cyanobacteria bloom declined earlier because of nutrient limitation caused by the increased spring growth. Overall productivity in the lake did not change. 4. Analysis showed that these predicted changes were driven by changes in water temperature, which were in turn triggered by the higher air temperatures predicted by the RCM.

In this study, an annual-scaled study on the space-time distribution of the microbial communities in water samples of Lake Faro was performed by both ARISA (Amplified Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis) and CARD-FISH (Catalyzed Reporter Deposition-Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization) approaches. A correlation between microbial parameters and both environmental variables (i.e., temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, redox potential, salinity, chlorophyll-a) and mixing conditions was highlighted, with an evident seasonal variability. The most significative differences were detected by ARISA between the mixolimnion and the monimolimnion, and between Spring and Autumn, by considering layer and season as a factor, respectively.

Based on remote sensing data andin-situGPS measurements we show that surface melt water is quickly routed to the ice-bed interface with a direct response on ice velocities measured at the surface. From the temporally highly resolved GPS time series we found summer peak velocities of up to 22% faster than their winter baseline. These average out to 9% above winter velocities when relying on temporally lower resolved velocity estimates from TerraSAR-X intensity offset tracking. From our GPS time series we also found short term ice acceleration after the melt season. By utilizing optical satellite imagery and interferometrically derived digital elevation models we were able to link the post melt season speed-up to a rapid lake drainage event (<24 h) with an estimated drainage volume of 28 x 10(6)m(3). We further highlight that GPS measurements are needed to resolve short term velocity fluctuations with low amplitudes, whereas remote sensing estimates are rather useful for the calculation of general trends in velocity behavior.

J	Salmabadi, H; Saeedi, M; Notaro, M; Roy, A				Salmabadi, Hesam; Saeedi, Mohsen; Notaro, Michael; Roy, Alexandre			Dust transport pathways from the Mesopotamian Marshes	AEOLIAN RESEARCH												The Mesopotamian Marshes, located in southern Iraq and southwestern Iran, represent one of the world's largest wetland ecosystems. These marshlands have undergone significant degradation primarily due to anthropogenic activities, including extensive dam construction, oil extraction, and political conflicts, transforming vast areas into potential dust sources. This study investigates the wind climatology over the marshes and analyzes the long-range transport pathways of dust originating from the region using forward air-parcel trajectories generated with the HYSPLIT model from 2000 to 2023, with each trajectory calculated over an 8day period. Through trajectory clustering, we identified four primary transport pathways with distinct seasonal patterns. The dominant pathway (35%) follows the Shamal winds southeastward across the Persian Gulf, particularly active in summer and spring. A second pathway (35%) curves southwestward toward Africa, while a third (19%) moves northeastward toward the Caspian Sea and Kazakhstan during non-summer seasons. The fourth pathway (11%) represents high-altitude transport via mid-tropospheric westerlies, potentially reaching East Asia. Meteorological analysis suggests that dust emission potential is active year-round and is highest during summer. Summer is characterized by high temperatures (seasonal mean of 38.8 degrees C), no precipitation, and the highest seasonal mean wind speeds (5.31 ms-1). These findings provide crucial insights into the spatial extent and seasonal variability of dust transport from the Mesopotamian Marshes, demonstrating their farreaching impact on air quality, ecosystems, and climate in regions as distant as East Asia and North Africa, highlighting the need for targeted conservation to mitigate environmental impacts posed by dust from these degraded wetlands.																			1875-9637	2212-1684				JUN	2025	73								100975	10.1016/j.aeolia.2025.100975	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aeolia.2025.100975		APR 2025											WOS:001480983300001

During summer and early autumn, G was the dominant taxon in the upper 20 m of the water column, while H and G x H were most abundant below 30 m. From November until April, all three taxa were homogeneously distributed in the water. Seventeen distinct G clones were detected during the study, while six G x H clones and five H clones were detected. Single clones of G x H and H accounted for 93% (400/431 and 400/434, respectively) of the total number sampled. Results reconfirm previous studies, which observed spatial (vertical) separation of G and H, and confirm previous suspicions as to the existence of G x H hybrids in the lake.

The composition of the soil seedbank and its role in ecosystem dynamics and rehabilitation potential in the arid Tankwa Karoo Region, South Africa</n>	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE & FORAGE SCIENCE												Very few soil seedbank studies have been conducted in South Africa, especially in arid rangelands. Insight into the soil seedbank could therefore improve assessment of rangeland dynamics and enhance rehabilitation efforts. This study aimed to characterise the soil seedbanks in various vegetation types of the Tankwa Karoo National Park, an arid environment in South Africa. At 43 sites soil was sampled twice at the end of spring and the end of autumn, and the composition and structure of aboveground vegetation were described at the peak growth period in spring. Seeds were isolated from the soil samples by means of flotation in a salt solution, seedbank species composition was obtained by seedling germination, and the vegetation was investigated using a line-point survey method. Overall seed density was 8 034 seeds m(-2) of which 55% was viable, and the common life-forms were therophytes and chamaephytes. Species richness and diversity were lower in the seedbank compared with those of the vegetation, and the two vegetation spheres were 25% similar. While seedbank composition suggested poor veld condition, there was enough seed density and viability for future regeneration and rehabilitation initiatives. However, this may be impeded by the absence of many perennial species in the soil seedbank.					; Saaed, Manam/H-3689-2018; Saaed, Manam Wafi Barrani/H-3689-2018; khomo, lesego/JNE-5659-2023; Masubelele, Mmoto/ABB-7215-2022	Samuels, Mogamat Igshaan/0000-0002-5594-2623; Masubelele, Mmoto/0000-0003-3656-1347; Jacobs, Shayne/0000-0003-1829-7650; MASUBELELE, MMOTO LEONARD/0000-0003-3876-712X; Saaed, Manam Wafi Barrani/0000-0002-3740-4274; khomo, lesego/0000-0002-8977-8008; 													1022-0119	1727-9380				DEC 10	2018	35	3-4					351	361		10.2989/10220119.2018.1526824	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/10220119.2018.1526824													WOS:000451149600019
J	Gu, BH				Gu, Binhe			Stable isotopes as indicators for seasonally dominant nitrogen cycling processes in a subarctic lake	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY												Nitrogen stable isotopes (d15N) of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN = NH4+ and NO3), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), and particulate organic nitrogen (PON) were measured in Smith Lake, Alaska to assess their usefulness as proxies for the biological nitrogen cycling processes, nutrient concentration, and lake productivity. Large seasonal variations in d15NH4+, d15NO3 and d15NPON occurred in response to different processes of nitrogen transformation that dominated a specific time period of the annual production cycle. In spring, 15N depletion in all three pools was closely related to the occurrences of a N2-fixing cyanobacterial bloom (Anabaena flos-aquae). In summer, d15NPON increased as phytoplankton community shifted to use NH4+ and decreased as a brief N2-fixing bloom (Aphanizomenon flos-aquae) occurred in August. In early and mid-winter, microbial nitrogen processes were dominated by nitrification that resulted in the largest isotope fractionation between NO3 and NH4+ in the annual cycle. This was followed by denitrification that led to the highest 15N enrichment in NO3. A peak of NH4+ assimilation by phytoplankton along with the elevated d15NPON and Chl a concentration occurred just before the ice break due to increased light penetration. The d15NDON displayed little temporal and spatial variations. This suggests that the DON pool was not altered by biological transformations of nitrogen as the results of its large size and possibly refractory nature. There was a positive correlation between Chl a concentration and d15NPON, and a negative correlation between NH4+ and d15NPON, suggesting that d15NPON is a useful proxy for nitrogen productivity and ammonium concentration.

J	KOSKENNIEMI, E				KOSKENNIEMI, E			COLONIZATION, SUCCESSION AND ENVIRONMENTAL-CONDITIONS OF THE MACROZOOBENTHOS IN A REGULATED, POLYHUMIC RESERVOIR, WESTERN FINLAND	INTERNATIONALE REVUE DER GESAMTEN HYDROBIOLOGIE												The colonization and succession of the macrozoobenthos in a polyhumic, winter-regulated reservoir, Lake Kyrkosjarvi in Western Finland (62-degrees 45'N, 22-degrees 48'E, A = 6.4 km2 at summer HW, Z(mean) = 2.5 m and Z(max) = 7 m) was studied from its filling in 1981 until 1989 (in 1981-83, 1986 and 1989). The zoobenthos was sampled over the whole reservoir bottom using qualitative and quantitative methods during three open-water seasons and winter samples were taken in the regulated and submerged areas during the maximum draw down (2 m) in March-April. Colonization during the first summer revealed two phases. The first phase featured dominance of actively swimming and adult-dispersing taxa. The second phase was characterized by a mass occurrence (high abundance and biomass) of chironomids (Chironomus, Glyptotendipes) and the isopod Asellus aquaticus. Asellus originated in a small bog pond in the northern outlet basin, and it was the dominant zoobenthic species during the study period. The species of Chironomus, most of them pool inhabitants of natural waters, succeeded each other. In the later study years, when the zoobenthos at the sites was determined more by habitat (spatially) than by the succession (temporally), the reservoir bottom could be divided into three areas: a) deep areas, less-than-or-equal-to 3 m, with an increasing occurrence of lacustrine species (eutrophic or dystrophic), b) shallower organic bottoms, greater-than-or-equal-to 2 m, with many pool-inhabiting and eurytopic species, and c) some eroded areas in the shallow littoral, greater-than-or-equal-to 0.5 m, where lacustrine species became common. Water-level regulation in winter killed only a small proportion of the fauna in the organic-rich peatland and forest bottom areas representing the majority of the regulated zone. Hence, the regulated areas had almost everywhere high abundance and biomass values throughout the year, deviating from the results found by other authors in strongly regulated lakes, which have maximum values just below the draw down limit.																			0020-9309						1994	79	4					521	555		10.1002/iroh.19940790405	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19940790405													WOS:A1994QA61500003

In Kings Beach, a community on the California side of Tahoe's north shore, storm runoff flowed towards Lake Tahoe in earth roadside ditches from streets, residential, and commercial areas that were originally subdivided in 1926. Placer County, the government entity responsible for maintaining local roads in Kings Beach, started design of an erosion-control project in 1992, using funds from state agencies and the Forest Service. Design was completed in 1996 after identification and acquisition of desirable parcels needed to construct detention basins. A local contractor was awarded the bid for the project, which was built during Tahoe's short construction season in summer and early fall 1996. The project reduced concentration of flows along long stretches of roadside ditches by routing runoff from block-long sections of asphalt and blanketed, seeded swales into sediment traps that discharged to underground storm drains. Three detention basins were built near the lower end of the storm drains. In early fall, the basins were excavated to a depth close to the seasonal water table and planted with wetland plugs, seeded with wetland species, and seeded and planted with upland species on the banks. To prevent scour and enhance plant establishment, temporary bypasses were constructed between each basin inlet and outlet riser. The bypass pipes were effective in protecting the newly vegetated basins from damage during erosive winter storms of 1997. Due to the successful establishment of appropriate vegetation and the effectiveness of other erosion control techniques, the basins were stable enough to allow removal of bypasses after one growing season. Continued monitoring was proposed, including measuring the depth of and period of inundation in the basins. Results of continued monitoring will help identify plants that survive seasonal inundation, and for differences between detention basins with solid or perforated risers. Data generated by monitoring will be used to refine future projects.																			1092-2806						1998	29						75	91																WOS:000073814100006

Tritium formed by natural cosmic radiation in the upper atmosphere and in the last century by tests of thermonuclear bombs, is an ideal age-marker during the last 60 years. To determine the origin and mean age of waters in many projects concerning water supply, engineering and scientific projects in the last 45 years on more than 1,350 sites more than 40,000 isotope measurements were performed in Austria. The median value of all sites of oxygen-18 is delta O-18 -10.7 parts per thousand and for hydrogen-2 delta H-2 -75 parts per thousand. As the fractionation is mainly temperature dependent the lowest negative values are observed in winter precipitation (oxygen-18 as low as delta O-18 -23 parts per thousand) and in springs in the mountain regions (delta O-18 -15.1 parts per thousand). In contrast the highest values were observed in summer precipitation (up to delta O-18 - 0.5 parts per thousand) and in shallow lakes in the Seewinkel close to the Hungarian border (up to delta O-18 + 5 parts per thousand). The precipitation in the region of South of the main Alpine crest (East-Tyrol, Carinthia and South-East Styria) is approximately 1 parts per thousand higher in delta O-18-values as sites at the same altitude in the northern part. This is most probably caused by the stronger influence of precipitation from the Mediterranean area. The median value of all 1,120 sampling sites of decay corrected ( 2015) tritium measurements is 6.2 tritium units (TU). This is somewhat smaller than the median value of all precipitation stations with 7.2 TU. The tritium concentration increases in the summer up to 10 - 11 TU and decreases in winter down to 3 - 4 TU. A mean tritium concentration in aquifers smaller than approximately 3.5 TU indicates large amounts of this water are older than 60 years. Waters containing approximately more than 12 TU containing still tritium from the 1960s and 1970s formed originally by thermonuclear bomb experiments. In Austria the highest Tritium values can be observed in the rivers Danube and March which show periodic or permanent tritium contamination up to 70 TU coming from nuclear power plants in the neighbouring countries.

Temporal trends of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the UK atmosphere: 1991-2005	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Internationally there are few long-term air monitoring programs, which are necessary to assess the effectiveness of source abatement measures as required under the UNECE POPs protocol. In the United Kingdom, the Toxic Organic Micropollutants (TOMPS) program, funded by the Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs (Defra), was started in 1991 and includes regular monitoring of a range of compounds including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In this study, the time series (1991-2005) of atmospheric concentrations of 15 PAHs at six U.K. monitoring sites were investigated. Most show a statistically significant decrease in PAH levels over time, broadly consistent with the reported decline in emissions. Higher levels of heavier PAHs were noted in winter than in summer at most sites. At one coastal site, higher levels of lighter PAHs were noted in summer, possibly due to temperature-driven outgassing of these compounds from seawater. Current annual averages of benzo[a]pyrene are below the recently introduced annual air quality standard of 0.25 ng m(-3) at all sites, although quarterly averages have exceeded 0.25 ng m(-3) in recent years but only at the urban sites in winter. The atmospheric signature of total PAHs closely mirrors the emission signature, which lends strength to the idea that levels of PAHs in air are still mostly influenced by direct/local sources.					; Halsall, Crispin/D-8135-2014; Jones, Kevin/F-4296-2014; Sweetman, Andrew/D-8456-2014	Sweetman, Andrew/0000-0001-9230-8536; Halsall, Crispin/0000-0001-8007-9756; Jones, Kevin Christopher/0000-0001-7108-9776; 													0013-936X					MAY 1	2008	42	9					3213	3218		10.1021/es702979d	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es702979d								18522096					WOS:000255444100021

Total dissolved-phase water concentrations of PBDEs (Sigma 7PBDEs) were 212 +/- 65 and 87 +/- 57 pg L-1 (average +/- SD) in summer and winter, respectively. BDE-209 was the most abundant congener in all samples, followed by BDE-99 and -47. Average ambient gas-phase Sigma 7PBDE concentrations were between 189 +/- 61 (summer) and 76 +/- 65 pg m(-3) (winter). Net air-water exchange fluxes ranged from -0.9 +/- 1.0 (BDE-28) (volatilization) to 11.1 +/- 5.4 (BDE-209) ng m(-2) day(-1) (deposition). The BDE-28 fluxes were mainly volatilization while the other congeners were deposited. Gas- and dissolved-phase concentrations were significantly correlated (r(2) = 0.33-0.55, p < 0.05, except for BDE-209, r(2) = 0.05, p > 0.05) indicating that the atmosphere controls the surface water PBDE levels in this coastal environment. Estimated particulate dry deposition fluxes ranged between 2.7 +/- 1.9 (BDE-154) and 116 +/- 84 ng m(-2) day(-1) (BDE-209) indicating that dry deposition is also a significant input to surface waters in the study area.

Modeling the impediment of methane ebullition bubbles by seasonal lake ice	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Microbial methane (CH4) ebullition (bubbling) from anoxic lake sediments comprises a globally significant flux to the atmosphere, but ebullition bubbles in temperate and polar lakes can be trapped by winter ice cover and later released during spring thaw. This "ice-bubble storage" (IBS) constitutes a novel mode of CH4 emission. Before bubbles are encapsulated by downward-growing ice, some of their CH4 dissolves into the lake water, where it may be subject to oxidation. We present field characterization and a model of the annual CH4 cycle in Goldstream Lake, a thermokarst (thaw) lake in interior Alaska. We find that summertime ebullition dominates annual CH4 emissions to the atmosphere. Eighty percent of CH4 in bubbles trapped by ice dissolves into the lake water column in winter, and about half of that is oxidized. The ice growth rate and the magnitude of the CH4 ebullition flux are important controlling factors of bubble dissolution. Seven percent of annual ebullition CH4 is trapped as IBS and later emitted as ice melts. In a future warmer climate, there will likely be less seasonal ice cover, less IBS, less CH4 dissolution from trapped bubbles, and greater CH4 emissions from northern lakes.					; Sepulveda-Jauregui, Armando/J-5049-2019; Martinez-Cruz, Karla/AAC-4902-2021	Greene, Samuel/0000-0001-5135-5926; Sepulveda-Jauregui, Armando/0000-0001-7777-4520; Martinez-Cruz, Karla/0000-0001-9365-0616													1726-4170	1726-4189					2014	11	23					6791	6811		10.5194/bg-11-6791-2014	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-11-6791-2014													WOS:000346357100019

This was correlated with the low ambient total CO2 concentration. The relationship was confirmed in laboratory experiments where maximum catalase activity occurred under an atmosphere composed of 30% O2 and 0.003% CO2. Conversely, high CO2 concentrations inhibited catalase activity. The rise in catalase activity was not directly due to increasing environmental pH, as in vitro and in vivo measurements showed a characteristic broad pH curve with a constant activity from pH 6-10 for catalase. Photoinhibition of catalase occurred above 250 mumol photons.m-2.s-1. However, at high photoinactivating irradiances, photoinhibition was ameliorated under high pO2/pCO2. Such conditions prevail in the Kinneret at the end of the spring. We propose that the enhancement of photorespiration (under high pO2/pCO2) induces a temporary burst in catalase activity despite the progressively photoinhibitory conditions of early summer.																			0022-3646					FEB	1994	30	1					17	22		10.1111/j.0022-3646.1994.00017.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0022-3646.1994.00017.x													WOS:A1994MY59400003

Seasonal phytoplankton dynamics was described on the basis of its species composition and abundance, biomass and chlorophyll-a concentrations. Phytoplankton assemblages comprised diatoms (mainly Cyclotella meneghiniana, Nitzschia palea and Fragilaria ulna), cyanobacteria (mainly Pseudanabaena limnetica, Aphanizomenon sp. and Limnothrix cf. redekei) and green algae (various species of Scenedesmus and Chlamydomonas, Coelastrum microporum and Monoraphidimm contortum). Many benthic diatoms were also present. An important growth of euglenophytes was observed during summer, mainly Lepocinclis steinii, L. ovum, Euglena intermedia, E. viridis and Phacus caudatus. The spring maximum of centric diatoms extended into the summer. The qualitative and quantitative composition of the phytoplankton is compared to communities of other European rivers. With regard to phytoplankton assemblages, Aliakmon resembles more the relatively fast-flowing, "individual-poor" European rivers. Its widely varying discharge volume, turbidity and shallowness, seem to be the main factors controlling phytoplankton communities in its lower reaches.					; Danielidis, Daniel/D-3907-2009	ECONOMOU-AMILLI, Athena/0000-0002-5615-1372; 													0003-9136					JAN	2000	147	2					171	191																WOS:000085557300004

A 27cal ka biomarker-based record of ecosystem changes from lacustrine sediments of the Chihuahua Desert of Mexico	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Hydroclimate variation of the northwest Mexico during the late Pleistocene and Holocene is an active area of debate, with uncertainty in the nature and sources of precipitation. Previous research has inferred the influences of winter storms, summer monsoonal rain and autumn tropical cyclones. The impacts on regional and local ecosystems, however, are not well constrained. Here, we investigate the response of lacustrine and terrestrial habitats of the Santiaguillo Basin in the Chihuahua Desert (Mexico) to hydrological changes occurring since the late last glacial. Biomarkers from the sediments reflect variable input of organic matter (OM) from algal and bacterial biomass, aquatic microfauna and surrounding vegetation, revealing distinct stages of ecosystem adaption over the last 27 cal ka. Based on previously published and new data, we show that a perennial productive lake was present during the late glacial and it persisted until 17.5 cal ka BP. Coinciding with Heinrich event 1, OM supply from deteriorating wetland soils may have been caused by early dry conditions. Further phases of increasing aridity and a shrinking water body drove changing OM quality and biomarker composition during the early and mid-Holocene. A pronounced shift in biomarker distributions at 4 cal ka BP suggests that the supply of plant litter from resinous trees and grasses increased, likely reflecting the establishment of modern vegetation. Our results illustrate the potential of biomarker applications in the area, adding to the evidence of hydroclimate variability and enabling reconstructions of local ecosystem dynamics.

J	Dahms, DE; Rawlins, CL				Dahms, DE; Rawlins, CL			A two-year record of eolian sedimentation in the Wind River Range, Wyoming, USA	ARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Eolian sediment collected at three locations in the Wind River Range at seven seasonal intervals from December 1988 to October 1990 were used as a baseline from which to estimate the effects of eolian sedimentation in this region. Dust was collected from snow- and rain-catch instruments installed by the U.S. Forest Service at Hobbs Lake, Lester Pass, and Black Joe Lake. These data show that dust influx rates varied from 0.23 to 31.0 X 10(-7) g cm(-2) d(-1) during the sampling period. The highest sedimentation rates occur during the late summer from July through September and the lowest rates occur during the winter. High influx rates during the summer months apparently reflect the dry, snow-free conditions in the adjacent Green River Basin, from which much of the eolian sediment originates. Accumulations of dust that originates outside the Wind River Range may affect the ability of soils and sediments of the range to buffer increases in SO4 and NO3 deposition.

Ring Structures on Baikal Ice and Local Upwelling Cases in Summer	WATER RESOURCES												Ring structures on Baikal ice were found in satellite images in the period when ice cover thickness decreased (April). Analysis of satellite data on lake surface temperature in summer showed that local zones with lower temperature of water surface can sometimes be seen during the navigation period. According to field studies of ring structures on lake ice, they form and develop under the effect of currents which contribute to a decrease in ice thickness. The available data show that the generation of anticyclonic currents can be caused by a local rise of deep water. Similar phenomena can be seen in summer. Data of satellite temperature measurements show local drops of lake surface temperature in summer caused by upwelling. This is directly related with the rise of cold water from a deep zone. Depending on the temperature stratification (direct or reverse), upwelling contributes to the generation of either cyclonic or anticyclonic currents, respectively. The different directions of currents are due to the difference between temperature stratification in winter and summer. The formation of ring structures on ice and local drops of surface water temperature in summer are due to local water rises (upwelling). The upwelling can be caused by convection. The decrease in the density of the underlying water can be due to (a) temperature increase; (b) a decrease in salinity; (c) an increase in the concentration of methane dissolved in water in bottom zone. In addition, the upward flows can be due to ascending gas hydrates.

J	Gong, G; Wang, L; Lall, U				Gong, Gavin; Wang, Lucien; Lall, Upmanu			Climatic precursors of autumn streamflow in the northeast United States	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												In this study, statistical linkages between autumn streamflow in the northeast United States and preceding summer sea surface temperatures are developed to establish predictive potential for climate-informed seasonal streamflow forecasts in this region. Predictor regions with physically plausible teleconnections to local streamflow are identified and evaluated in a multivariate and nonlinear framework using local regression techniques. Three such regions are identified, located in the Bering Sea, the tropical Pacific just west of Mexico, and the tropical Atlantic off the coast of Africa. Asymmetries in each region's univariate local regression result are apparent, and bivariate local regressions are used to attribute these asymmetries to interactions with physical mechanisms associated with the other two regions, and possibly other unaccounted for climatic predictors. A bivariate model including the tropical Pacific and tropical Atlantic regions yields the strongest local regression result, explaining 0.68 of the interannual streamflow variability. An analogous multivariate linear regression analysis is only able to explain 0.20 of the streamflow variability and thus the use of nonlinear methods' results in a marked improvement in streamflow simulation capability. Cross-validation considerably weakens the streamflow forecasts using this model; however, forecast skill may improve with a longer period of record or the inclusion of additional predictors.

S	Morofsky, E		Paksoy, HO		Morofsky, Edward			HISTORY OF THERMAL ENERGY STORAGE	THERMAL ENERGY STORAGE FOR SUSTAINABLE ENERGY CONSUMPTION: FUNDAMENTALS, CASE STUDIES AND DESIGN	NATO Science Series II-Mathematics Physics and Chemistry											This chapter discusses the history of thermal energy storage focusing on natural energy sources. Links are made to recent trends of using renewable energy to achieve greater energy efficiencies in heating, cooling and ventilating buildings. The Deep Lake Water Cooling development in Toronto is presented as a typical modern interpretation of past practices with an integration of municipal services of water supply and district cooling. Environmental concerns and restrictions have also stimulated thermal energy storage developments. Cold storage in aquifers originated in China where excessive groundwater extraction related to industrial cooling had resulted in significant land subsidence. To rectify the subsidence problem, cold surface water was injected into the aquifers. Subsequently, it was observed that the injected and "stored" water had maintained its cool temperature for months and was suitable for industrial cooling. Thus, aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES) was born. The Netherlands restricted groundwater mining for industrial cooling but left an exemption if reinjection using ATES for cooling were implemented. This stimulated interest in ATES and led to many implemented projects. In some areas such as Winnipeg, Manitoba, the natural groundwater temperature (6 degrees C) is suitable for direct cooling. The reinjection of warm waste energy results in a gradual warming of the aquifer, ultimately leading to lower system efficiency for cooling. Using the aquifer for ventilation air preheating in winter helped the WINPAK plant maintain the natural groundwater temperature. Ground source technologies combined with underground thermal energy storage are seen as the best current method of combining natural energy sources with modern energy efficient building design. The latest technical findings have been incorporated into codes, standards and guidelines. Some of these are briefly described. Storing freely available energy to meet the requirements of a later season is "seasonal storage". Three principal stimuli to the development of large-scale seasonal energy storage are: (1) the decoupling of electricity and heat production in cogeneration plants with heat storage increasing the fraction of the annual heat demand met by cogeneration; (2) seasonal storage-assisted central solar heating plants to enable solar energy to supply winter heating demands; (3) the storage of ambient winter air temperatures for summer cooling. Thermal storage associated with cogeneration and district heating is a standard application. Central solar heating plants have been investigated, constructed and monitored as part of the International Energy Agency, Task VII of the Solar Heating and Cooling Implementing Agreement "Central solar heating plants with seasonal storage". The storage of ambient winter air temperature is particularly suited to continental climates characterized by long cold winters with brief hot summers. Ice and snow are practical latent energy storage media for cold winter air. Snow and ice may be fabricated or gathered from natural sources. In larger commercial buildings, particularly those of energy efficient design, the energy expended for cooling can be a major proportion of the total energy requirement. This combination of a suitable ice-making climate with significant building cooling demands stimulated interest in seasonal thermal energy storage. Various design alternatives were investigated, tested, evaluated and demonstrated. These efforts originated in the USA and Canada but now have been applied successfully in Sweden.																			1568-2609		978-1-4020-5290-3				2007	234						3	22				10.1007/978-1-4020-5290-3												WOS:000270056600002

Qilu Lake Basin is an important agricultural area in Southwest China, with huge consumption of neonicotinoids. However, the lack of data on neonicotinoid residues in Qilu Lake Basin challenges us with assessing the environmental contamination levels and the potential risks for the local aquatic ecosystem. Therefore, in this study, the occurrence and spatiotemporal distribution of three neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam) in surface waters of Qilu Lake Basin were investigated. Their concentrations ranged from 0.65 ng/L (thiamethoxam in spring) to 1041.21 ng/L (imidacloprid in summer), which exhibited decreasing trends from the surrounding rivers to Qilu Lake. The highest concentrations were observed in summer, owing to the intensive application of pesticides and the heavy precipitation and surface runoff in this season. Imidacloprid and thiamethoxam presented relatively high ecological risks, and clothianidin was the most threatening compound, with high risk quotient values in every season owing to its low predicted no-effect concentration values and high toxicity.

The geomorphic mapping along the periphery of the lake suggested the presence of four palaeolake level strands located at 6, 4.8, 3.8 and 1.25 m above the present lake level. The gullied periphery expose relict deltaic sediments where sedimentological study enabled us to identify four deltaic lobes that make a classic Gilbert-type delta with well-developed top-set, fore-set and bottom-set. The top-set of the stratigraphically oldest delta lobe that corresponds to the highest lake level shows the presence of freshwater molluscs identified as Radix and a burnt sediment layer (hearth). The charcoal derived from this layer yielded C-14 date as 1.7 ka BP and six luminescence ages from different delta lobes suggested that delta evolution and lake level fall of similar to 6 m took place between similar to 2-1 ka. Review of palaeoclimate record available from NW Himalaya and Pangong Tso suggests that late Holocene aridity might be responsible for this rapid lake level fall. Sclerochronological analysis carried out on 54 subsamples from three Radix specimens suggested that the modern type of seasonal conditions may have prevailed at similar to 1.7 ka BP.

J	Ferreira, V; Panagopoulos, T				Ferreira, Vera; Panagopoulos, Thomas			Seasonality of Soil Erosion Under Mediterranean Conditions at the Alqueva Dam Watershed	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The Alqueva reservoir created the largest artificial lake of Western Europe in 2010. Since then, the region has faced challenges due to land-use changes that may increase the risk of erosion and shorten the lifetime of the reservoir, increasing the need to promote land management sustainability. This paper investigates the aspect of seasonality of soil erosion using a comprehensive methodology that integrates the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) approach, geographic information systems, geostatistics, and remote-sensing. An experimental agro-silvo pastoral area (typical land-use) was used for the RUSLE factors update. The study confirmed the effect of seasonality on soil erosion rates under Mediterranean conditions. The highest rainfall erosivity values occurred during the autumn season (433.6 MJ mm ha(-1) h(-1)), when vegetation cover is reduced after the long dry season. As a result, the autumn season showed the highest predicted erosion (9.9 t ha(-1)), contributing 65 % of the total annual erosion. The predicted soil erosion for winter was low (1.1 t ha(-1)) despite the high rainfall erosivity during that season (196.6 MJ mm ha(-1) h(-1)). The predicted annual soil loss was 15.1 t ha(-1), and the sediment amount delivery was 4,314 x 10(3) kg. Knowledge of seasonal variation would be essential to outline sustainable land management practices. This model will be integrated with World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies methods to support decision-making in that watershed, and it will involve collaboration with both local people and governmental institutions.					; Ferreira, Vera/AAV-6616-2021; Panagopoulos, Thomas/A-3048-2012	Ferreira, Vera/0000-0001-5688-1298; Panagopoulos, Thomas/0000-0002-8073-2097													0364-152X	1432-1009				JUL	2014	54	1					67	83		10.1007/s00267-014-0281-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-014-0281-3								24794193					WOS:000337285900007

The model incorporates uncertainty in the sample estimates of the ''true'' mean total phosphorus values. We used Bayes Theorem to assess model parameters and predictive uncertainty from 19 years of data. When compared with a ''naive'' model that does not accommodate phosphorus uncertainty, the observation error model has a higher parameter variance, but lower prediction uncertainty. Lower prediction uncertainty occurs because some of the noise in the data is resolved as phosphorus uncertainty, thus reducing the variance of the model disturbance term. The observation error model results in less stringent phosphorus targets to meet acceptable blue-green levels than does the naive model because of this lower prediction uncertainty.					; Carpenter, Stephen/AAQ-6404-2020; Stow, Craig/AAG-8109-2020	Stow, Craig/0000-0001-6171-7855; 													0706-652X					FEB	1997	54	2					464	473		10.1139/cjfas-54-2-464	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-54-2-464													WOS:A1997XB78700022

However, due to the multitude of responses within lake ecosystems it is often difficult to understand how climate variability interacts with other environmental pressures such as eutrophication, and to attribute observed changes to specific causes. This is particularly challenging during the past 100 years when multiple strong trends are superposed. Here we present a high-resolution multi-proxy record of sedimentary pigments and other biogeochemical data from the varved sediments of Lake Zabinskie (Masurian Lake District, north-eastern Poland, 54 degrees N-22 degrees E, 120 m a.s.l.) spanning AD 1907 to 2008. Lake Zabinskie exhibits biogeochemical varves with highly organic late summer and winter layers separated by white layers of endogenous calcite precipitated in early summer. The aim of our study is to investigate whether climate-driven changes and anthropogenic changes can be separated in a multi-proxy sediment data set, and to explore which sediment proxies are potentially suitable for long quantitative climate reconstructions. We also test if convoluted analytical techniques (e.g. HPLC) can be substituted by rapid scanning techniques (visible reflectance spectroscopy VIS-RS; 380-730 nm). We used principal component analysis and cluster analysis to show that the recent eutrophication of Lake Zabinskie can be discriminated from climate-driven changes for the period AD 1907-2008. The eutrophication signal (PC1 = 46.4%; TOC, TN, TS, Phe-b, high TC/CD ratios total carotenoids/chlorophyll-a derivatives) is mainly expressed as increasing aquatic primary production, increasing hypolimnetic anoxia and a change in the algal community from green algae to blue-green algae. The proxies diagnostic for eutrophication show a smooth positive trend between 1907 and ca 1980 followed by a very rapid increase from ca. 1980 2 onwards. We demonstrate that PC2 (24.4%, Chl-a-related pigments) is not affected by the eutrophication signal, but instead is sensitive to spring (MAM) temperature (r = 0.63, p(corr) < 0.05, RMSEP = 0.56 C; 5-yr filtered). Limnological monitoring data (2011-2013) support this finding. We also demonstrate that scanning visible reflectance spectroscopy (VIS-RS) data can be calibrated to HPLC-measured chloropigment data and be used to infer concentrations of sedimentary Chl-a derivatives {pheophytin a + pyropheophytin a). This offers the possibility for very high-resolution (multi)millennial-long paleoenvironmental reconstructions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We evaluated which metrics were most appropriate for, and effective in, discerning differences among the sites. Dramatic and consistent seasonal differences in metric scores were observed across all sites. All metric scores indicated markedly better biological health during winter months than during summer months. The biological impairment designation was highest in the summer at the suburban and agricultural sites. Coefficients of variation were considerably greater at the lower stream order sites. The metrics that were most appropriate and effective in assessing benthic assemblage health in this study were: richness, percent model affinity, family-level biotic index, and Ephemeroptera-Plecoptera-Trichoptera index. These indices correlated with a low amount of redundancy in a Pearson matrix, had significant discriminatory power in assessing biological impairments across sites, and had low variation within sites and seasons. This suggests these metrics should be selected for bioassessments in similar Great Lakes watersheds.					; inamdar, shreeram/B-7433-2009	pennuto, christopher/0000-0002-0584-4005; 													0270-5060	2156-6941				DEC	2007	22	4					539	551		10.1080/02705060.2007.9664815	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2007.9664815													WOS:000251330600001

Glacial kettles as archives of early human settlement along the Northern Rocky Mountain Front	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												The Northern Rocky Mountain Front (hereafter Northern Front) is a prominent geographic feature in archaeological models of human dispersal in the terminal Pleistocene and Early Holocene of North America. Testing those models has been arduous because of local geomorphological factors that tend to obliterate or otherwise limit access to archaeological finds of relevant age. In this paper, we present well-stratified archaeological and environmental records dating back to 14,000-13,000 cal yr BP from the site of Billy Big Spring (Blackfeet Indian Reservation, Montana), located on a glacial kettle, a type of landform that has been largely ignored by regional archaeological research to date. Findings from Billy Big Spring show the continuous use of the Northern Front foothills throughout the major climatic and environmental disturbances of the Early Holocene, and possibly the terminal Pleistocene as well. As such, Billy Big Spring contributes to refining several archaeological models of early settlement of the Northern Front, particularly those that posit differential use of foothills versus plains settings during the midst of the Holocene Thermal Maximum. The record at Billy Big Spring also suggests that kettles, regardless of physiographic setting, provide a yet unsuspected and unsampled potential for preserving high-quality and easily accessible early archaeological and paleoenvironmental records.																			0033-5894	1096-0287				JAN	2022	105						135	150		10.1017/qua.2021.40	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/qua.2021.40													WOS:000749708100010

MODEL DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												A mathematical model for dissolved O2 was formulated for Lake Ontario. The lake was treated as 1 box during winter circulation but as 2 boxes (epilimnion, hypolimnion) during summer stratification; inflows, outflows, vertical transport across the thermocline, atmospheric reaeration, photosynthesis, and decompositon were considered. For each year, temperature data were used to estimate the vertical exchange coefficient and the thermocline depth as a function of time. Predictions of the O2 model showed reasonable agreement with observations for 9 yr. This agreement provided some verification for the model and for the application of the oceanic stoichiometry of Redfield to lakes. Model predictions and observations suggested that O2 was transported from the hypolimnion to the epilimnion and from the epilimnion to the atmosphere during summer stratification. Vertical transport accounted for .apprx. 10% of the hypolimnetic loss of O2.																			0013-936X	1520-5851					1985	19	2					173	179		10.1021/es00132a011	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es00132a011													WOS:A1985AAT8100015

This is especially true in the Arctic, where climate is intensely seasonal and proxies that can distinguish climate conditions of multiple seasons in a single year are relatively rare. We propose that submerged aquatic mosses, which are abundant subfossils in some Arctic lake sediments and have distinctive seasonal growth morphologies, can be used to estimate past lake water oxygen isotope composition (delta O-18(lw)) across multiple seasons. Aquatic mosses are abundant, well preserved, and grow continuously in Arctic lakes whenever light is available, with some species displaying unique seasonal morphologies influenced by water temperature. Although Greenland paleorecords suggest that aquatic moss oxygen isotope values (delta(18)Oom) reflect the delta O-18 values of lake water, no modern calibration between delta(18)Oom and delta O-18(lw) exists in Greenland. We present a modern delta(18)Oom vs. delta O-18(lw) calibration using multiple moss species or morphotypes from eight lakes and ponds near Pituffik (Thule), northwest Greenland. We find strong linear relationships (r2 = 0.76-0.85) between the delta(18)Oom and delta O-18(lw) values of multiple species or morphotypes across the range of relatively low delta O-18(lw) values at Pituffik, and our results indicate isotopic fractionations are similar to those found previously at lower latitudes. To assess the potential of mosses as archives of seasonal delta O-18(lw) values, we analyzed delta(18)Oom in season-specific segments of moss strands, with seasons identified based upon growth morphology. Moss inferred lake water delta O-18 values (delta O-18(lwom)) are higher in autumn than spring or summer, likely due to increasing contributions of O-18 enriched precipitation and the cumulative effects of lake water evaporation throughout the ice-free season. For moss subsampled throughout summer, delta O-18(lwom) values generally increased through the season in parallel with observed delta(18)Olw values. Potential temperature dependent fractionation effects during biosynthesis, however, remain unconstrained and should be further addressed with future research. Overall, these findings suggest that aquatic mosses from lake sediments could be used to directly resolve climate seasonality of the past.

The present study explores the spatial and temporal changing patterns of the rainfall erosivity in the Yangtze River basin of China during 1960-2005 at annual, seasonal and monthly scales. The Mann-Kendall test is employed to detect the trends during 1960-2005, and the T test is applied to investigate possible changes between 1991-2005 and 1960-1990. Meanwhile the Rescaled Range Analysis is used for exploring future trend of rainfall erosivity. Moreover the continuous wavelet transform technique is using studying the periodicity of the rainfall erosivity. The results show that: (1) The Yangtze River basin is an area characterized by uneven spatial distribution of rainfall erosivity in China, with the annual average rainfall erosivity range from 131.21 to 16842 MJ mm ha(-1) h(-1). (2) Although the directions of trends in annual rainfall erosivity at most stations are upward, only 22 stations have significant trends at the 90 % confidence level, and these stations are mainly located in the Jinshajiang River basin and Boyang Lake basin. Winter and summer are the seasons showing strong upward trends. For the monthly series, significant increasing trends are mainly found during January, June and July. (3) Generally speaking, the results detected by the T test are quite consistent with those detected by the Mann-Kendall test. (4) The rainfall erosivity of Yangtze River basin during winter and summer will maintain a detected significant increasing trend in the near future, which may bring greater risks to soil erosion. (5) The annual and seasonal erosivity of Yangtze River basin all have one significant periodicity of 2-4 years.

J	Effler, SW; Peng, F				Effler, Steven W.; Peng, Feng			Long-term study of minerogenic particle optics in Cayuga Lake, New York	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The dynamics of light scattering by minerogenic particles in the upper waters of Cayuga Lake, New York, were characterized for the spring-autumn interval of 8 yr (1999-2006) at pelagic and nearshore sites with a scanning electron microscope interfaced with automated image and x-ray analyses (SAX). SAX results were used to estimate the minerogenic scattering coefficient (b(m)) through Mie theory calculations. SAX-Mie supported a two-component model for particulate scattering (b(p)) that included an organic component of scattering (b(o)), estimated from a bio-optical model. The credibility of the b(m) estimates and the two-component modeling approach was demonstrated through good closure of the modeling results with bulk values of b(p) (estimated from measurements of the beam attenuation coefficient at 660 nm). The average of the ratio b(p) : (b(m) + b(o)) was 1.03 (average relative error 19.4%). Two minerogenic particle types were important in regulating the dynamics of b(m)-clay minerals that increased in concentration in response to runoff events, and calcium carbonate precipitated mostly on small organic particles during short-term late-summer whiting events. b(m) was attributed to particles in the size range of 1-10 mu m. Variations in b(m) dominated the overall variations in b(p) and Secchi disk depth; differences in b(o) explained well those observed in b(p) during dry weather intervals of low b(m). Higher bm values, mainly associated with clay mineral particles, were observed at the nearshore site as opposed to the pelagic location; there was a positive linkage between these levels and tributary flow rate.

Habitat utilization and movement patterns of sub-harvestable largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) in the Ohio River	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Electrofishing surveys were conducted seasonally from summer 1998 through summer 2000 in main channel, embayment, and tributary macrohabitats of the Ohio River. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) was low within macrobabitats, averaging from 0.00 to 6.76 sub-harvestable largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides)/hour. Embayment CPUE was higher than tributary or main channel CPUE except in spring 1999, when tributary CPUE was highest. Core use areas were calculated from biotelemetry data and ranged from 88 to 59,400 M, representing 0.02 to 89.00% of available study location macrohabitat. Bass movement was limited to nursery embayments or tributaries with infrequent movement to nearby main channel areas. Bass preferred a mixed microhabitat consisting of a combination of vegetation and woody debris. This mixed microbabitat was less common in main channel habitat assessments compared to tributaries and embayments. Core use areas of Ohio River sub-harvestable bass are larger than reported in impoundment studies (< 11,684 m(2)), suggesting Ohio River habitat is poorer than other systems.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				DEC	2006	21	4					663	672		10.1080/02705060.2006.9664128	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2006.9664128													WOS:000242201300014

Using airborne thermal imaging to understand American Coot movement patterns in a hot spring refugium during winter	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												We examined the movement patterns of American Coots relative to water temperature and heat index where a geothermally heated stream enters Utah Lake, UT, USA during winter using a thermal imager onboard an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS). Observations of Coots in different water temperatures (n = 2354) were compiled during 31 flights in January-March, 2020. Coots were actively swimming during 82.3% of the observations, fleeing during 8.1%, and sedentary in water during 9.6%. The population spent more time swimming in cooler water and were sedentary for longer in warmer water. The only instance of uniform behavior occurred during an anomalously cold period in which Coots stood huddled in the warmest available water. Using a linear model framework, we found that Coot time spent increased with water temperature when heat index decreased. Coots' swim paths deviated away from warmer water more than cooler water and more so as heat index increased. We suggest that Coots use the spring water primarily for ice-free habitat and maintain metabolic rates via a combination of thermal conductance, caloric ingestion, and exercise, but only exploit the heated water strictly for thermoregulation during anomalously cold periods. We discuss the benefits and hindrances of using UASs amidst a rapidly expanding assortment of sensors and aircraft available to researchers. Given wetlands' immediate conservation concern, ecosystem services they provide, and support of unique species assemblages, our research provides valuable insight into documenting wildlife's use of wetlands with relatively low scientific take and human interference.																			0923-4861	1572-9834				2023 SEP 25	2023										10.1007/s11273-023-09957-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11273-023-09957-w		SEP 2023											WOS:001070269600001

Studying the annual use of aquatic habitats provides information on how to manage wetlands for waterfowl, and to predict possible detrimental effects associated with extended usage by these birds. This is particularly important for species like the mute swan (Cygnus olor Gmelin), given its recent dramatic demographic expansion, causing concern in both Europe and America. We studied the extent of usage (swan.days.ha(-1)) of habitat patches by mute swans in a heterogeneous and fluctuating fishpond landscape. We assessed seasonal differences of swan usage of fishponds, annual variation for a given fishpond, and determined which habitat factors drive swan usage over the year. The seasonal use pattern was regular: a similar proportion of fishponds was used heavily, moderately or lightly in all seasons. Flocking throughout the year and breeding during summer were associated with heavy use of fishponds, i.e. large number of swan.days.ha(-1). Flocking on some fishponds during several successive seasons demonstrated that some waterbody provide valuable habitats over time for swans. However, swans did not use individual fishponds to the same extent each season, mostly depending on the fluctuating ecological requirements of swans and variation in habitat properties. Agricultural practices on fishponds drastically affected swan usage during autumn and winter: formerly dried fishponds were used preferentially once reflooded. The specific agricultural crops used during the drought period had no influence though. The large-sized fishponds and fishponds within a dense network of waterbody were the most heavily used by swans throughout the year. Our results may thus be helpful to predict and prevent possible habitat damage by swans. They also provide information on habitats that are valuable for waterfowl species in general, by using mute swans as a proxy for waterfowl requirements. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The lake has a previous record of shifts between clear-water and turbid states. but the causes behind these shifts are not well known. During the recent shift, which occurred in 1995-1997, Submerged vegetation Subsequently declined after a 30-year period of clear-water and abundant vegetation. Among the possible explanations we identify several processes unlikely to have contributed to the recent shift from clear to turbid conditions. including long-term changes in external input of phosphorus. fluctuations in water level. and changes in zooplankton grazing pressure. Instead, likely scenarios to have contributed to the macrophyte decline, and thereby to the shift were: (1) a series of mild winters with short ice cover and absence of winter-kills of fish, leading to high biomasses of benthivorous and planktivorous fish before the shift, and thereby increased bioturbation and internal nutrient recycling, (2) unusually cool and windy springs the years before and during, the shift, leading to unfavourable conditions during the establishing phase of submerged macrophytes. Both shorter periods of ice cover and high wind velocity in winter and spring were associated with climate. approximated by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). We argue that none of these processes alone can force the lake front the clear to the turbid state, but that several stress factors in concert are necessary to initiate a shift. Hence, we conclude that climate variability is likely to have contributed to a multi-causal stress. reducing the resilience of the clear-water state and finally triggering the Shift through inter-year dependent changes; in biomass of submerged macrophytes and fish, organism groups known to have key roles in the dynamics of shallow lakes.

Studying their physiological characteristics and survival strategies are of great significance for understanding microbial existence in extreme environments and developing and utilizing salt-alkali-adapted microbial resources. In this study, we focused on the rhizosphere soil of Tamarix chinensis and investigated the differences in fungal community structure and diversity in different seasons and habitats within the saline-alkaline wetland. Through high-throughput sequencing analysis, we found that the phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the predominant taxa in the fungal community of this saline-alkaline wetland, with Fusarium and Alternaria being the dominant genera. We also observed that the diversity and abundance of soil fungal communities were significantly influenced by seasonal and humidity changes. Different dominant fungal genera were observed in different seasons and environments, such as Talaromyces in spring and Emericellopsis in autumn. However, compared to seasonal variations, changes in wet-dry environments had a more pronounced impact on the diversity of the fungal community in the rhizosphere soil of Tamarix chinensis. Furthermore, we found that fungal genera exhibited preferences for different physicochemical factors in wet and dry environments. For example, Fusarium showed a significant positive correlation with organic nitrogen (AN) in dry environments (P < 0.05), while it exhibited a significant negative correlation with pH in wet environments (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the diversity and abundance of soil fungi in the Ebinur Lake saline-alkaline wetland exhibit dynamic changes in response to seasonal and wet-dry environmental variations, with higher diversity and abundance observed in autumn and wet conditions.																			1387-585X	1573-2975				APR	2025	27	4					8693	8709		10.1007/s10668-023-04250-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-023-04250-5		DEC 2023											WOS:001116451500004
J	Nelson, ED; McConnell, LL; Baker, JE				Nelson, ED; McConnell, LL; Baker, JE			Diffusive exchange of gaseous polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polychlorinated biphenyls across the air-water interlace of the Chesapeake Bay	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Dissolved and gas-phase concentrations of nine polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and 46 polychlorinated biphenyl congeners were measured at eight sites on the Chesapeake Bay at four different times of the year to estimate net diffusive air-water gas exchange rates. Gaseous PAHs are absorbed into the bay's surface waters during the spring, and lighter compounds revolatilize in the late summer and early fall due to seasonal changes in surface water temperature and atmospheric PAH levels. On an annual basis, the atmosphere is a net source of volatile PAHs to the Chesapeake Bay, and gas absorption may be the largest external source of fluorene and phenanthrene, providing up to three times the combined loadings from wet and dry aerosol deposition and from tributaries. Largest PAH absorptive fluxes occurred in the northern Chesapeake when prevailing winds carried PAH-enriched air from the Baltimore-Washington urban area over the bay. In contrast to PAHs, PCBs volatilize from the Chesapeake Bay throughout the year, with the largest fluxes occurring in September and the smallest fluxes in June. However, higher chlorinated (6-8) homologues are absorbed by bay waters during most of the year. Highest PCB volatilization rates were observed in the northern Chesapeake Bay and near the James River in the southern bay, indicating volatilization offsets PCB loading from the bay's tributaries. Volatilization is the dominant removal process for PCBs from the Chesapeake Bay, removing an estimated 400 kg/year. This value is larger than current external PCB loadings, suggesting that release of PCBs from historically contaminated sediments supports volatilization from the bay.

We chose C. raciborskii for a 4-year study of the seasonal patterns of all life cycle stages in the pelagic and benthic zones of shallow eutrophic lake in NE Germany Akinete production started when C. raciborskii populations reached maximum cell abundance and water temperatures started to decrease, resulting in an increase in the number of akinetes at the sediment surface. The number of akinetes on the sediment (inoculum for the next year) was population size dependent. It decreased slightly in winter but dropped sharply from end of April to June/July, reflective of germination. Thus, germination started at temperatures of about 13 degrees C. Typically, first filaments appeared in June and populations peaked in August. However, the Size of the population in summer was not determined by the size of the inoculum. Consequently, it is assumed that population development is determined by growth conditions and loss processes after germination.					; Rücker, Jacqueline/H-8994-2019	Rucker, Jacqueline/0000-0001-6841-7724; 													0142-7873	1464-3774				OCT	2009	31	10					1151	1159		10.1093/plankt/fbp067	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbp067													WOS:000270269800004

At present, many studies have focused on the interannual water balance of lakes, but lake level and area can change remarkably with seasons, especially for lakes with seasonal ice cover. Zhari Namco, a seasonal frozen lake, was selected as an example to investigate its seasonal water balance. Multi-source altimetry and Landsat data were used to obtain the seasonal lake level and area from 1992 to 2019, and seasonal lake volume variations were also estimated. The results indicated the average lake level, area and volume in autumn were the largest. The lake level, area, and volume experienced three turning points approximately in 2000, 2010, and 2016, and showed an overall increasing trend from 1992 to 2019, with slopes of 0.15 m/year, 2.17 km2/year, and 0.14 km3/year, respectively. The lake area expanded significantly in autumn, which was related to the abundant precipitation. Delay time of land surface runoff, increased temperature, and evaporation may be the reason for the low lake level and volume in summer. The precipitation was the dominant factor of water balance, which explained 62.09%, 62.43%, and 62.10% of the variations in lake level, area, and volume, respectively.					duan, zheng/D-6409-2011														1674-487X	1867-111X				OCT	2024	35	5					1679	1691		10.1007/s12583-022-1639-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12583-022-1639-8													WOS:001344200800013

Elevated Incidences of Antimicrobial Resistance and Multidrug Resistance in the Maumee River (Ohio, USA), a Major Tributary of Lake Erie	MICROORGANISMS												Maumee River, the major tributary in the western basin of Lake Erie, serves as one of major sources of freshwater in the area, supplying potable, recreational, and industrial water. In this study we collected water samples from four sites in the Maumee River Bay between 2016-2017 and E. coli was isolated, enumerated, and analyzed for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and multidrug resistance (MDR). Strikingly, 95% of the total isolates were found to be resistant to at least one antibiotic. A very high resistance to the drugs cephalothin (95.3%), ampicillin (38.3%), tetracycline (8.8%), gentamicin (8.2%), ciprofloxacin (4.2%), cefoperazone (4%), and sulfamethoxazole (1.5%) was observed within isolates from all four sampling sites. Percentages of AMR and MDR was consistently very high in the summer and fall months, whereas it was observed to be lowest in the winter. A remarkably high number of the isolates were detected to be MDR-95% resistant to >= 1 antibiotic, 43% resistant to >= 2 antibiotics, 15% resistant to >= 3 antibiotics, 4.9% resistant to >= 4 antibiotic and 1.2% resistant to >= 5 antibiotics. This data will serve in better understanding the environmental occurrence and dissemination of AMR/MDR in the area and assist in improving and establishing control measures.

These remain frozen and snow-covered from October to June. The lake snow is thinner, denser, harder and has less water equivalent than snow on the surrounding tundra. It contains less depth hoar than land snow, yet paradoxically is subject to stronger temperature gradients. It also has fewer layers and these have been more strongly affected by wind. Dunes and drifts are better developed on lakes, they have wavelengths of 5-20 m, compared to < 5 in on land. Because of these differences, lake snow has roughly half the thermal insulating capacity of land snow. The winter mass balance on lakes is also different because (1) some snow falls into the water before the lakes freeze, (2) some snow accumulates in drifts surrounding the lakes, and (3) prevailing winds lead to increased erosion and thinner snow on the eastern lake sides. Physical models that extrapolate land snow over lakes without appropriate adjustments for depth, density, distribution and thermal properties will under-predict ice thickness and winter heat losses.

Water level affects availability of optimal feeding habitats for threatened migratory waterbirds	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Extensive ephemeral wetlands at Poyang Lake, created by dramatic seasonal changes in water level, constitute the main wintering site for migratory Anatidae in China. Reductions in wetland area during the last 15years have led to proposals to build a Poyang Dam to retain high winter water levels within the lake. Changing the natural hydrological system will affect waterbirds dependent on water level changes for food availability and accessibility. We tracked two goose species with different feeding behaviors (greater white-fronted geese Anser albifrons [grazing species] and swan geese Anser cygnoides [tuber-feeding species]) during two winters with contrasting water levels (continuous recession in 2015; sustained high water in 2016, similar to those predicted post-Poyang Dam), investigating the effects of water level change on their habitat selection based on vegetation and elevation. In 2015, white-fronted geese extensively exploited sequentially created mudflats, feeding on short nutritious graminoid swards, while swan geese excavated substrates along the water edge for tubers. This critical dynamic ecotone successively exposes subaquatic food and supports early-stage graminoid growth during water level recession. During sustained high water levels in 2016, both species selected mudflats, but also to a greater degree of habitats with longer established seasonal graminoid swards because access to tubers and new graminoid growth was restricted under high-water conditions. Longer established graminoid swards offer less energetically profitable forage for both species. Substantial reduction in suitable habitat and confinement to less profitable forage by higher water levels is likely to reduce the ability of geese to accumulate sufficient fat stores for migration, with potential carryover effects on subsequent survival and reproduction. Our results suggest that high water levels in Poyang Lake should be retained during summer, but permitted to gradually recede, exposing new areas throughout winter to provide access for waterbirds from all feeding guilds.

Characteristic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and their sources in surface water in North China	6TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WATER RESOURCE AND ENVIRONMENT	IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science				6th International Conference on Water Resource and Environment (WRE)	AUG 23-26, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK					Sixteen priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in nine typical surface water sources in North China have been analyzed by solid phase extraction-gas chromatography tandem triple four-stage mass spectrometry (SPE-GC-MS-MS). The results showed that eleven in sixteen PAHs were detected except BkFL, BaP, InP, BghiP and DBA. The range of total PAHs in spring water body of nine water sources is 23.76-71.47 ng/L, and that is 83.72-277.8 ng/L in summer. The results showed that the seasonal pollution of PAHs was significantly different, and the pollution status of PAHs in summer was significantly higher than that in spring because the non-point source pollutants including PAHs would easily enter surface water sources with rainfall-runoff. The results also showed the PAHs are mainly composed of medium and low cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (2-3 rings). In addition, the ratios of Ant /(Phe+Ant), Flu /(Pyr+Flu) and BaA /(BaA+Chr) indicate the PAHs pollutants should be mainly from coal and wood burning in the upstream area of these water sources, entering water sources through surface runoff, which is not obviously affected by the pollution of oil leakage and discharge. Generally, the concentration of the PAHs in surface water sources in North China is still lower, but it is suggested that we should pay more attention to PAHs risk assessment for the drinking water sources.																			1755-1307						2020	612								012067	10.1088/1755-1315/612/1/012067	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/612/1/012067													WOS:000646217700067

From 1955-1962 P. casertanum was numerically dominant (peak density of 3273 ind m-2 was attained in 1957); at other times P. subtruncatum dominated (peak 3025 ind m-2 in 1955). After 1957-1958 the densities of both species were below 1000 ind m-2. The peak density of P. henslowanum [370 (individuals) m-2] was attained in 1057. All the species laid their eggs in spring (April-May), but the young were not released until the following winter, the exact time depending on the temperature and O2 conditions. Only some of the eggs laid developed into young, and the size of the brood depended on parental size. The young reached maturity at the age of 2 yr, with a probably maximum life-span of 4-5 yr. The regularly occurring O2 eficiency in the hypolimnion in summer caused heavy mortality in the dominant species and halted growth of individuals. Both the standing crop and annual production were lower in the population of P. subtruncatum, which is a smaller species. The annual P/B[production/biomass]-ratios were circa 1 in both the dominant populations.																			0030-1299	1600-0706					1983	41	1					99	117		10.2307/3544352	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3544352													WOS:A1983QZ55900014

Measurements were made in two frost-crack polygons, two palsas and a mineral palsa (lithalsa). Important for the formation of permafrost at all locations are (i) the absence of snow and, (ii) local soil properties. The seasonal variation in apparent thermal diffusivity-with higher diffusivities in summer than in winter in the mineral soil of the frost-crack polygon and relatively little seasonal variation in the peat of the palsas-is the main cause for the cooler conditions in the palsas in summer. Morphology adds to the temperature fluctuations as indicated by highly fluctuating ground temperatures in the dome-shaped mineral palsa as compared to the frost-crack polygon. Occasional ground temperature gradients of more than -10 degreesC/m are probably sufficient for seasonal frost cracking.

Two morphological descriptors were proposed, cellular projected area () and flattening index (f), which were able to he cellular light-harvesting potential and energy requirement, respectively. A model was established to describe the effects of natural light availability on selecting phytoplankton assemblages with underwater field and mixing process in the water column considered. Based on the data collected from the eutrophic Yanghe Reservoir, the model was derived as where V is bio-volume, lambda is a function of solar elevation angle (theta) and mixing/euphotic depth ratio (z (mix)/z (eu)) in water, and Post-analysis of the model results revealed that species with large and f in general have advantages in spring and winter when underwater light availability is low; by contrast, those with small and f have advantages in summer. Larger and f mean that the cells could harvest more light energy and consumed less, allowing them to be selected under low light availability; and vice versa. We thus concluded that the underwater light field probably the most important factor in selecting phytoplankton morphology in eutrophic water bodies.

This can affect the matter and energy transfer through the food web, of which zooplankton is of crucial importance. We traced seasonal changes in the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope signatures of suspended particulate matter and crustacean zooplankton from a small Mediterranean reservoir. The delta C-13 and delta N-15 isotopic baseline signature of the lake varied seasonally, becoming more C-13-depleted and N-15-enriched in winter and less C-13-depleted and N-15-enriched values in the drier summer months, when external water inputs were negligible. Seasonal changes in the delta C-13 and delta N-15 SPM isotopic signature were well reflected in the herbivorous cladocerans. delta N-15 of the calanoid and cyclopoid copepods were at least 3% greater than for the herbivorous cladocera, suggesting their potential use as a food resource. delta C-13 of predatory copepods were also consistent with seasonal fluctuations in the delta C-13 SPM baseline, except during the heavy rains in early spring, when they were observably rich in lipids with a higher C/N ratio, suggesting that they had entered dormancy and were not actively feeding in the water column. This indicates the importance of taking into account not only the seasonality, but the community dynamics and trophic level of zooplankton taxa when interpreting stable isotope studies.

A 14 mo. study was conducted to investigate D. tigrina''s population ecology and the effect a thermally altered environment might have on Dugesia. D. tigrina is possibly limited by intraspecific competition for food during and after reproduction. In spring, both the normal water and heated water triclad populations grew rapidly and produced cocoons. Recruitment of young intensified food competition, causing shrinkage and mortality. The spring gain in length and weight was lost through shrinkage of individuals, and numbers of triclads in autumn were similar to prebreeding numbers. The hypothesis is supported for populations in the thermally altered and the normal lake habitats. Triclads from the thermally enriched environment were 2 .times. as fecund as normal lake triclads. Cocoon production was probably increased to some extent by thermal effluent. The elevated mortality rate caused by the mechanical harvesting of abundant macrophyte populations in the warm water area, estimated at 1-3 .times. the standing crop of triclads, probably accounts for much of the increased fecundity.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1978	59	5					966	975		10.2307/1938548	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1938548													WOS:A1978GJ06400009

Hamilton Harbour over the last 25 years: Insights from a long-term comprehensive water quality monitoring program	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Hamilton Harbour was identified by the International Joint Commission as a problem area in 1978 and later identified as an Area of Concern in 1985. In response to its Remedial Action Plan, the harbour has been systematically monitored since 1987. In this study, we present the long-term water quality record (1987 to 2012) of Hamilton Harbour, focusing on the parameters and seasonal intervals of particular importance to the Remedial Action Plan beneficial use impairments. The long-term summer records showed that total phosphorus concentrations decreased in the first decade and have remained relatively unchanged since 1998, while an increasing trend in Secchi disc depth was observed until 2005 only to be reversed since then. No significant changes in chlorophyll a concentrations have been observed since 1987 despite significant changes in total phosphorus. Hypoxia in the hypolimnion of Hamilton Harbour remains a common occurrence and despite long-term trend improvements there has been little change over the last decade. Spring conditions have also changed, and higher conductivity values and chlorophyll a concentrations have been measured in recent years. A strong correlation between spring hypolimnetic dissolved organic carbon concentrations and dissolved oxygen depletion rates was found suggesting the organic material load to the harbour is an important controlling factor for hypoxia. Finally, the data suggest that the hypolimnetic accumulation rate of soluble reactive phosphorus in the summer has increased since 1987, most notably since the early 2000s. However, it is only since 2008 that this translated into an increasing trend in hypolimnetic soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations. These data suggest that conditions have recently changed in Hamilton Harbour and that sediment phosphorus release may delay water quality improvements for many years following reductions in total phosphorus loadings. Further research is needed to understand the implications to the Remedial Action Plan water quality goals.

The Xiangxi River, the largest tributary near the dam, has experienced algal bloom phenomena for several years. However, the characteristics and influencing factors of water quality during different operational periods of the reservoir remain unclear. This study analyzes 12 physical and chemical parameters of the Xiangxi Bay (XXB) from 2019 to 2023, employing a data-driven approach to explore the temporal and spatial characteristics of water quality under varying operational conditions of the TGR. It discusses the influencing factors and proposes countermeasures to address water quality challenges. The results indicate that: (1) Water quality parameters in XXB exhibit significant spatial and temporal variability, peaking in summer, with higher values observed in the middle and upper reaches. The Water Quality Index (WQI) indicates overall good water quality, while the Trophic Level Index (TLI) suggests medium eutrophication, particularly evident in spring and summer. (2) The backwater effects of the TGR have altered hydrodynamic conditions and mixing processes in XXB, significantly impacting water quality and promoting eutrophication. (3) Water quality is influenced by nutrient, organic matter, algae, and temperature, especially during low water levels in summer, with the middle and upper reaches being most affected. Key factors driving algal growth during this period include Total Nitrogen (TN), Transparency (SD), and Water Temperature (WT). (4) Effective control of eutrophication and algal blooms in XXB should focus on long-term upstream source management, close monitoring and prediction during spring and summer, and ecological operation of reservoir. This study enhances our understanding of the temporal and spatial characteristics of water quality in XXB under the operational dynamics of the TGR, providing guidance for eutrophication management and bloom prevention.					jin, tiantian/IUN-7144-2023														0169-7722	1873-6009				MAR	2025	270								104518	10.1016/j.jconhyd.2025.104518	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconhyd.2025.104518		FEB 2025						39978298					WOS:001429750600001
J	Lepori, F; Tolotti, M				Lepori, Fabio; Tolotti, Monica			Effects of nitrogen on benthic diatom assemblages in high-elevation central and eastern alpine lakes	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												We explored patterns of benthic diatom composition across sixty-two high-elevation alpine lakes spanning a wide range of nitrogen (N) concentrations due to atmospheric deposition and background variation in lake and watershed characteristics. Our goals were to (1) assess the effect of lake water N concentration on benthic diatom composition during late summer or fall conditions and (2) identify policy-relevant response thresholds. The analyses were carried out on a large set of diatom and water chemistry data, integrated with new data. Multivariate and correlation analyses revealed associations between pH, N concentration, and benthic diatom composition, but the effects of pH and N were confounded. However, partial correlation analysis allowed us to identify "N-responsive diatoms"; that is, diatom taxa with nonspurious associations with N. Focusing on these taxa, we detected a decline in the abundance of taxa preferring low N concentrations and an increase in the abundance of taxa preferring high N concentrations starting at NO3 concentrations of approximately 5 mu mol L-1. We interpreted this shift as an effect of watershed N saturation due to atmospheric deposition. Based on the results, we suggest a late-summer or fall concentration threshold of 5 mu mol NO3 L-1 to prevent change in benthic diatoms in high-elevation alpine lakes.

Climate-induced changes in high elevation stream nitrate dynamics	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Mountain terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems are responsive to external drivers of change, especially climate change and atmospheric deposition of nitrogen (N). We explored the consequences of a temperature-warming trend on stream nitrate in an alpine and subalpine watershed in the Colorado Front Range that has long been the recipient of elevated atmospheric N deposition. Mean annual stream nitrate concentrations since 2000 are higher by 50% than an earlier monitoring period of 1991-1999. Mean annual N export increased by 28% from 2.03 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) before 2000 to 2.84 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) in Loch Vale watershed since 2000. The substantial increase in N export comes as a surprise, since mean wet atmospheric N deposition from 1991 to 2006 (3.06 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) did not increase. There has been a period of below average precipitation from 2000 to 2006 and a steady increase in summer and fall temperatures of 0.12 degrees C yr(-1) in both seasons since 1991. Nitrate concentrations, as well as the weathering products calcium and sulfate, were higher for the period 2000-2006 in rock glacier meltwater at the top of the watershed above the influence of alpine and subalpine vegetation and soils. We conclude the observed recent N increases in Loch Vale are the result of warmer summer and fall mean temperatures that are melting ice in glaciers and rock glaciers. This, in turn, has exposed sediments from which N produced by nitrification can be flushed. We suggest a water quality threshold may have been crossed around 2000. The phenomenon observed in Loch Vale may be indicative of N release from ice features such as rock glaciers worldwide as mountain glaciers retreat.

Some planktonic organisms were characterized by vertical migrations. The species distribution patterns in different lakes and during different years were similar. Zooplankton distribution at various depths changed during spring and summer. Distribution in the tundra lakes was similar to those in other areas. Inequality of distribution at different depths was due mainly to water temperature, O2 content and illumination of water layers.																			0044-5134						1977	56	5					691	697																WOS:A1977DG22800003

Oxygen and deuterium isotope characteristics of Teesta river catchment from Sikkim Himalaya, India: Implications of different moisture sources	GEOCHEMICAL JOURNAL												The present investigations of delta O-18 and delta D values of Teesta river system (glacier fed; Eastern Indian Himalaya) along a steep altitudinal gradient has helped to better understand the spatial variability of the isotopic composition in water and moisture sources. We have used the stable isotope composition of the main Teesta River, its major tributaries, glacial melt streams (nallah) and few high altitude lakes. As the region is dominated by Indian Summer Monsoon precipitation brought by the Bay of Bengal Branch, the delta O-18 values ranges from similar to-11 to -15 parts per thousand and OD from similar to-41 to -128 parts per thousand in the main Teesta River. We propose that as the monsoonal moisture penetrates along the river valleys towards higher Himalaya, a progressive depletion in O-18 and D isotopes take place during orographic lifting, resultant cooling and progressive rainout. It is observed that d-excess values range between -1 to 18 and suggests mixed moisture source having contributions from moisture originating in Bay of Bengal and mid-latitude westerlies.

In temperature regions, a seasonal snowpack accumulates and stores atmospherically derived chemical ions or contaminants from winter to spring and solutes are released with snowmelt to the watershed. Due to spring runoff in the mountainous areas, the acidification of the nearby lakes and streams has been reported, which is called the "ionic pulse". The major cause of the ionic pulse is attributed to the preferential elution of chemical impurities from a snowpack to the lake or stream during the earlier phase of snowmelt. Since solutes are positioned outside of the snow grains during snow metamorphism, they are easily washed out from the snow grains. Because the magnitude of ionic pulse relies on the solute transport mechanism, several mechanisms have been suggested. Among them, a mobile-immobile model can explain many features of the previous tracer experiments. In this review, solute transport mechanisms in a snowpack are introduced and suggested in near future in Korea.

Pigment ratios and carotenoid chlorophyll a ratios are inaccurate and insensitive pigment characteristics, and in the description of diversity of pigments there is no alternative to chromatographic analysis. The chromatographically purified chlorophyll a fraction together with the occurrence of breakdown products of chlorophyll a gave valuable information on the stage of growth of phytoplankton populations. The pigment fractions fucoxanthin, peridinin, lutein and/or chlorophyll .beta. and myxoxanthophyll were used to indicate the contribution of the different major algal types to total phytoplankton community pigments.

Phosphoethanolamine in brain of the euritherm lake fish Perccottus glehni (Eleotridae, Perciformes, Dyb. 1877) as a phenomenon depending on temperature factor	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY												The present work studied effect of a seasonal decrease of environmental temperature and cold shock on pools of free amino acids (FA) in brain of the euritherm lake fish P. glehni. For the first time, non-protein amino acid, phosphoethanolamine (PEA), revealed in the great amounts under conditions of near-zero temperatures was found in brain of ectothermic animals. An intensive rise of the PEA pool from 0.3% during the summer period to 33.6% at winter was shown to occur in the brain of P. glehni as a result of a seasonal temperature decrease. In contrast, the level of taurine showing the greatest pool in comparison with other FA (29.0% of the total pool) in summer decreases to 8.9% in the beginning of winter period. Similar negative correlation between the taurine and PEA content was found under effect of acute cold shock (1A degrees C): the taurine level decreased for 4 days from 32.2 to 14.5% of the total pool, whereas the PEA level sharply increased (from 2.1 to 15.3%). Both types of the low-temperature actions have revealed, besides PEA, an intensive rise in the pool of serine and accumulation of phosphoserine. The role of PEA in biochemical evolution and adaptation of the brain to low temperatures is discussed. It is supposed that accumulation of PEA, phosphoserine, and serine is associated with changes in the status of membrane phospholipids at low temperatures.																			0022-0930					MAY	2013	49	3					291	299		10.1134/S0022093013030031	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0022093013030031													WOS:000323107300003
J	Steinman, AD; Ogdahl, M				Steinman, Alan D.; Ogdahl, Mary			Ecological effects after an alum treatment in Spring Lake, Michigan	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												A whole-lake alum treatment was applied to eutrophic Spring Lake during October and November 2005. Eight months later. an ecological assessment of the lake was performed and compared with data collected in 2003 and 2004. Field measurements showed reduced soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in the water column the summer after the alum application, but chlorophyll levels and irradiance profiles were not significantly affected. Total macroinvertebrate density declined significantly in 2006 compared with 2004, with chaoborids and oligochaetes experiencing the greatest reductions. Internal phosphorus release rates, measured using sediment cores incubated in the laboratory, ranged from -0.052 to 0.877 mg TP m(-2) d(-1) under anaerobic conditions. These internal loading rates were significantly lower than those measured in 2003 at three out of four sites. Mean porewater SRP concentrations were lower in 2006 than in 2003, but this difference was statistically significant only under aerobic conditions. The NaOH-extractable SRP fraction in the sediment was also significantly lower in 2006 compared with 2003, whereas the HCl-extractable SRP sediment fraction showed the opposite pattern. Overall, these results indicate that the alum treatment effectively reduced internal P loading in Spring Lake. However, watercolumn phosphorus concentrations remain high in this system, presumably due to high external loading levels, and may account for the high chlorophyll levels. An integrated watershed management approach that includes reducing internal and external inputs of P is necessary to address the cultural eutrophication of Spring Lake.

Wetlands are the primary stopover for many waterbirds and restoration of these wetlands involves both hydrological restoration and water resource management. To protect the stopover sites of Siberian Cranes, we collected Siberian Crane stopover numbers, meteorological and hydrological data, and remote sensing data from 2008 to 2011 in Momoge National Nature Reserve, one of the largest wetlands in northeastern China. A model was developed to estimate the suitability of Siberian Crane stopover sites. According to our results, the most suitable daily water level for Siberian Cranes between 2008 and 2012 occurred in the spring of 2008 and in the Scirpus planiculmis growing season and autumn of 2010. We suggest a season-dependent water management strategy in order to provide suitable conditions at Siberian Crane stopover sites.																			1932-6203					APR 15	2015	10	4							e0122687	10.1371/journal.pone.0122687	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0122687								25874552					WOS:000353015800071
J	Danubio, ME; Amicone, E				Danubio, ME; Amicone, E			Biodemographic study of a central Apennine area (Italy) in the 19th and 20th centuries: Marriage seasonality and reproductive isolation	JOURNAL OF BIOSOCIAL SCIENCE												This study investigates seasonality of marriages and reproductive isolation in six long-isolated communities in the central Apennines (Italy). It had two objectives: (1) the identification of an Apennine biodemographic model in comparison with mountain communities of other regions, and with non-Apennine communities in Abruzzo, and (2) to identify the possible effects of the drainage of Lake Fucino (1854-1876) on that area. Marriages in this region show two very stable seasonal patterns: one is typical of sedentary rural societies, with summer migrations and marriages preferentially celebrated in the winter, and the other has marriages that are strongly concentrated in the summer months, i.e. between 75%, and 93.5%, of marriages were celebrated between June and October in these communities in the 1800s. These were traditionally pastoral communities with winter transhumance of the flocks and their shepherds towards the lowlands of southern Italy. In both groups, restrictions imposed by the Catholic Church do not seem to have affected the timing of marriages. Indeed, economic factors related to work activities seem to have had more influence. Concerning reproductive isolation, the results show high rates of endogamy: between 85% and 98%, in both the 19th and 20th centuries. Rates of consanguineous marriages were between 5% and 20%, and those of isonymous marriages rarely exceeded 9%. The coefficient of inbreeding alpha shows that there was a delayed, limited period of increased consanguinity in the few decades around the turn of the century. This is different from the national situation, and thus could be a consequence of the Lake Fucino drainage.

J	Gao, J; Tian, LD; Liu, YQ; Gong, TL				Gao Jing; Tian LiDe; Liu YongQin; Gong TongLiang			Oxygen isotope variation in the water cycle of the Yamzho lake Basin in southern Tibetan Plateau	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN												Given the potential use of stable isotope in the paleoclimate reconstruction from lacustrine records as well as in the local hydrology cycle, it is crucial to understand the processes of stable isotope evolution in catchment in the Tibetan Plateau region. Here we present a detailed study on the water oxygen isotope based on 2 years observation including precipitation, river water and lake water in the Yamzho Lake, south of the Tibetan Plateau. Temporal variation of local precipitation delta(18)O shows an apparent "monsoon cycle". In monsoon season, delta(18)O in waters is lower. In non-monsoon season, delta(18)O in precipitation and lake water is higher and higher river delta(18)O exists in spring, probably reflecting the effect of land surface evaporation, together with the higher delta(18)O values in spring precipitation. It is also found that the surface lake water delta(18)O varies seasonally and annually. The lower lake water delta(18)O in the late summer is apparently related to the summer monsoon precipitation. The mean delta(18)O value of lake water in 2007 is 1.2% higher than that in 2004, probably due to the less monsoon precipitation in summer of 2007, as can be confirmed from the precipitation data at the Langkazi meteorological data. It is also found that an obvious shift of vertical lake water delta(18)O reflects the fast mixture of lake water. delta(18)O values of lake water are over 10% higher than those of precipitation and river water in this region due to the evaporation fractionation. The modeled results show that the evaporation process of the lake water is sensitive to relative humidity, and the present lake water delta(18)O reflects a relative humidity of 51% in the Yamzho Lake. It shows that the lake will take 30.5 years to reach present lake water delta(18)O given a large shift in the input water delta(18)O. The modeled results also reveal that surface lake water temperature and inflow delta(18)O have slight effect on the isotopic balance process of lake water in the Yamzho Lake.					liu, yongqin/LFF-8837-2024														1001-6538					AUG	2009	54	16					2758	2765		10.1007/s11434-009-0487-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-009-0487-6													WOS:000269212800006

These water bodies provide the population with an adequate supply of drinking water and support most of the irrigation requirements of local agriculture. Moreover, they respond to the Mediterranean climate, with sequential, seasonally predictable events of flooding and drying and whose intensity varies markedly between years. As a consequence of summer drought and the policy to meet water demand throughout the season, the reservoirs experience massive dewatering, resulting in a reduction in the spring storage volume of 90%. Thus, they start the hydrological season as water bodies deep enough to form stable stratification but a thermocline has generally disappeared by the middle of summer and, as a consequence of the intense drawdown, they are transformed into shallow water bodies. This dual behaviour, driven by a progressive and conspicuous depth decrease, interferes with nutrient and phytoplankton dynamics, enhancing eutrophication phenomena and contributing to the selection of planktic cyanobacteria that are potentially dangerous to human health.

Therefore, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the seasonal and diel differences in movement rates, site fidelity, and home range of bluegills in a shallow, natural Great Plains lake. A total of 78 bluegills (200-273 mm total length) were implanted with radio transmitters in March and May 2000. Of these fish, 10 males and 10 females were randomly selected and located every 2 h during one 24-h period each month from April to September 2000. Bluegill movement peaked during midsummer; however, there was little difference in diel movements, suggesting relatively consistent movement throughout the 24-h period. Home range estimates (which included the 24-h tracking plus an additional six locations from the same fish located once per day for six consecutive days each month) ranged up to 172 ha, probably because only about half of the bluegills exhibited site fidelity during any month sampled. Bluegill movement did not appear to be strongly linked with water temperature, barometric pressure, or wind speed. These results suggest that bluegills move considerable distances and that many roam throughout this 332-ha shallow lake. However, diet patterns were not evident. Sampling bluegills in Great Plains lakes using passive gears (e.g., trap nets) may be most effective during the summer months, when fish are most active. Active sampling (e.g., electrofishing) may be more effective than the use of passive gears in spring and fall, when bluegills are less active.					; Willis, David/D-3400-2009; Bouchard, Michelle/AAW-3379-2020	Bouchard, Michelle/0000-0002-6353-3491; Paukert, Craig/0000-0002-9369-8545													0275-5947					FEB	2004	24	1					154	161		10.1577/M03-004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M03-004													WOS:000220169400017

Distribution and source assessment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons levels from Lake IJssel (the Netherlands) and their responses to hydrology	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												Based on field efforts in Lake IJssel (the Netherlands) from 2000 to 2010, dynamics of 15 priority PAHs in suspended particulate matter (SPM) and in seawater were determined. This study examined time-varying changes in PAH concentration and composition, apportioned potential anthropogenic sources, and quantified their linkages to hydrological factors. The sum of individual PAHs (defined as n-ary sumation (15)PAHs) varied widely throughout the study period in Lake IJssel, ranging from 0.76 to 9.66 mg/kg in SPM and from 0.014 to 0.136 mu g/L in seawater. High molecular weight PAHs were the most abundant PAH compounds, responsible for 73%-97%. Seasonal variation in n-ary sumation (15)PAHs level was distinguished, peaked in late winter and early spring, and reached a minimum in summer. Over site, the heavy contamination was found at the river mouth (e.g., Genemuiden). The driving factors of SPM and water temperature controlled the fate of PAHs. Principal component analysis and diagnostic ratios suggested that PAHs may have been derived from different input sources through various transport pathways,for example, coal combustion source and petroleum source. The findings are useful for filling the knowledge gap of PAH dynamics in Lake IJssel and Wadden Sea, which exerts significant influences on lake's environment. Practitioner points HMW PAHs (4-6 rings) were the most abundant PAH compounds. Heavy contamination was found in the mouth of IJssel River. Time-varying change in PAHs level was significantly correlated with riverine input. PAHs sources were apportioned via principal component analysis and diagnostic ratios.					; van Gelder, Pieter/D-5834-2014	Niu, Lixia/0000-0002-2460-6125; van Gelder, Pieter/0000-0002-0001-0351													1061-4303	1554-7531				AUG	2020	92	8					1214	1229		10.1002/wer.1317	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/wer.1317								32118337					WOS:000556580200013

Median total OPE concentrations (Sigma OPES) ranged from 41.2 pg/m(3) at Eagle Harbor, Michigan to 1320 pg/m(3) at Cleveland, Ohio. Tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCIPP) was the most abundant OPE measured in these samples and contributed 26% to Sigma OPE concentrations. The spatial distribution of OPEs among the sites suggests that OPEs with longer atmospheric half-lives and relatively high octanol-air partitioning coefficients (K-O(A)) are likely to have a greater potential to undergo long-range atmospheric transport. OPE particle-phase partitioning fraction (Phi) significantly and positively correlated with K-OA, but declined with increasing relative humidity. Phi values varied seasonally and were lower in the summer for volatile OPEs. In addition, samples collected in the summer had significantly higher levels of Sigma OPES than samples collected in the winter. The estimated dry deposition flow of Sigma OPES to the Great Lakes was 1.22 tons/year, exceeding the corresponding flows reported for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs).					; Wu, Yan/C-4680-2017	Salamova, Amina/0000-0003-2174-030X; Venier, Marta/0000-0002-2089-8992; Wu, Yan/0000-0001-7876-261X													0013-936X	1520-5851				MAY 5	2020	54	9					5400	5408		10.1021/acs.est.9b07755	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b07755								32289228					WOS:000530651900015

Understanding the spatiotemporal characteristics of crane habitats is of great importance for ecological environment governance and biodiversity protection. The shallow water, grassland, and soft mudflat regions of the Poyang Lake wetland are ideal habitats for wintering Siberian cranes. Based on Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and Operational Land Imager (OLI) remote sensing images, habitat areas were extracted and associated with various water levels taken on multiple dates. Landscape metrics were applied to describe the spatial structural characteristics of the crane habitats, and spatial statistics are used to explore the cold and hot spots of their distribution. Moreover, three indicators including sustainability, stability, and variety were applied to evaluate the vulnerability of the crane habitats under different hydrological conditions. Our findings indicate: (a) The main crane habitats exhibit a gradual decreasing degree of fragmentation in time, an obvious uncertainty of shape complexity and a relatively stable connectivity. (b) The crane habitats have a consistent spatial pattern of highly aggregated distributions associated with various water levels. (c) The hot spots of the habitats formed multiple "sheet" belts centered on the "Lake Enclosed in Autumn" regions, while the cold spots indicate a spatial pattern of axial distributions. (d) The majority of the hot spots of the habitats were distributed in sub-lakes found in the southeast part of the Poyang Lake watershed and the Nanjishan and Wucheng nature reserves, while the cold spots were mainly distributed in the main channels of the basins of Poyang Lake. (e) The sustainable habitats were mainly distributed in the "Lake Enclosed in Autumn" regions and intensively aggregated in two national nature reserves.

J	Yu, Y; Ginoux, P				Yu, Yan; Ginoux, Paul			Assessing the contribution of the ENSO and MJO to Australian dust activity based on satellite- and ground-based observations	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Despite Australian dust's critical role in the regional climate and surrounding marine ecosystems, the controlling factors of the spatiotemporal variations of Australian dust are not fully understood. Here we assess the connections between observed spatiotemporal variations of Australian dust with key modes of large-scale climate variability, namely the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). Multiple dust observations from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET), weather stations, and satellite instruments, namely the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), are examined. The assessed multiple dust observations consistently identify the natural and agricultural dust hotspots in Australia, including the Lake Eyre basin, Lake Torrens basin, Lake Frome basin, Simpson Desert, Barwon-Darling basin, Riverina, Barkly Tableland, and the lee side of the Great Dividing Range, as well as a country-wide, austral spring-to-summer peak in dust activity. Our regression analysis of observed dust optical depth (DOD) upon an ocean Nino index confirms previous model-based findings on the enhanced dust activity in southern and eastern Australia during the subsequent austral spring and summer dust season following the strengthening of austral wintertime El Nino. Our analysis further indicates the modulation of the ENSO-dust relationship with the MJO phases. During sequential MJO phases, the dust-active center moves from west to east, associated with the eastward propagation of MJO, with the maximum enhancement in dust activity at about 120, 130, and 140 degrees E, corresponding to MJO phases 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6, respectively. MJO phases 3-6 are favorable for enhanced ENSO modulation of dust activity, especially the occurrence of extreme dust events, in southeastern Australia, currently hypothesized to be attributed to the interaction between MJO-induced anomalies in convection and wind and ENSO-induced anomalies in soil moisture and vegetation.

J	Bouchard, V				Bouchard, Virginie			Export of organic matter from a coastal freshwater wetland to Lake Erie: An extension of the outwelling hypothesis	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												I tested the hypothesis that seiches in large lakes play a role similar to tides in marine system by exporting detrital carbon from coastal wetlands to adjacent open waters. The study was conducted at a wetland site located along the shore of the Lake Erie. Water samples were collected at the outlet of the marsh, during inflow and outflow events, over a 19-month period. Water isotopes were also measured in the lake and in the marsh to establish the magnitude of the mixing between the two water masses. On average, the concentrations of the outflow water samples was enriched by 7.3 mg DOC l(-1) and 3.4 mg POC l(-1)compared to the inflow water samples, while no difference observed in inorganic carbon fluxes. Organic carbon was exported during fall, winter and early spring which coincide with period of organic matter decomposition. Such a concept of outwelling is not new for marine ecosystem, but is demonstrated in this study for the first time in a large lake setting influenced by seiche events. Ultimately to understand the role that these fluxes may play in maintaining the integrity of the wetland-lake system, it will be necessary to investigate whether the detrital material exported from coastal freshwater wetlands is incorporated into the open lake foodweb.																			1386-2588	1573-5125				MAR	2007	41	1					1	7		10.1007/s10452-006-9044-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-006-9044-4													WOS:000243649200001
J	BURNS, CW; MITCHELL, SF				BURNS, CW; MITCHELL, SF			SEASONAL SUCCESSION AND VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION OF ZOOPLANKTON IN LAKE HAYES AND LAKE JOHNSON	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Seasonal variations in the species composition, abundance, biomass and vertical distribution of zooplankton in 2 eutrophic, warm-monomictic lakes are described for the period Dec. 1969-Feb. 1972. In Lake Hayes, Boeckella dilatata was the dominant crustacean and Ceriodaphnia dubia was subdominant. Lake Johnson was dominated by Ceriodaphnia and Bosmina meridionalis and Boeckella were subdominant. Daphnia were common in spring in Lake Hayes, but very rare in Lake Johnson. Chydorus and Asplanchna appeared in summer in both lakes. Zooplankton were slightly more abundant in both lakes in 1971 than in 1970; the annual mean was 1.7 times higher in Lake Johnson than in Lake Hayes in both years. Biomass was highest in spring. In Lake Hayes it ranged from 0.7-4.6 g .cntdot. m-2 dry weight; in Lake Johnson it fluctuated in 1971 from 0.3 g .cntdot. m-2 in March to 7.4 g .cntdot. m-2 in Nov. Animals occurred at all depths during holomixis, but were nearer the surface during stratification. Vertical distribution was often bimodal, with a peak in the metalimnion and a 2nd, smaller one in the epilimnion. In Lake Johnson a stratum of anoxic water developed in the metalimnion each summer. In 1971 Boeckella were confined to the oxygenated hypolimnetic water below this zone, and almost disappeared from the lake as the hypolimnion became anoxic in late summer. In 1970, when they were largely confined to the epilimnion, the population increased over the same period. Ceriodaphnia had a similar vertical distribution to Boeckella in 1971, but did not decline in numbers, perhaps because of reproduction by the small number of animals remaining in the epilimnion. An increase in the cyclopoid population of the oxygenated hypolimnion probably was the result of recruitment, either from the benthic region or by migration from the epilimnion through the anoxic layer. Chydorus has appeared in the plankton of Lake Hayes since 1953, and cyclopoids have become more abundant. These changes are consistent with other evidence that the lake is becoming more eutrophic.																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1980	14	2					189	204		10.1080/00288330.1980.9515860	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1980.9515860													WOS:A1980KS41300010

Shoot and crown dry weights and crown moisture, Na, Mg and S contents were all strongly influenced by variables related to soil conductivity. Increased levels of soil Na and Mg salts were reflected by increased concentrations of Na, Mg and S in the crown tissue. In contrast, crown Ca content decreased significantly with increased soil salinity. Soil salinity had a variable effect on cold hardiness. Although the general trend was towards reduced cold tolerance of plants with increased salt stress, reductions were not large enough to be of practical concern.

In 2012-2013, EM was applied in Muchawka Reservoir situated in the town of Siedlce (eastern Poland). Analyses of water parameters and bottom sediments were carried out, in 2011, before the EM technology was implemented and again in 2013-2015 after the EM application was completed. In spring 2011, the average total nitrogen (TN) content at the surface was 3.1 mg dm(-3) while the total mineral nitrogen content equalled 0.893 mg dm(-3). After the EM application was completed, in the summer of 2013, the TN content was on average 2.5 mg dm(-3). The content of nitrates and nitrites in the summer of 2013 reached 1.20 mg dm(-3) at the most. Lower levels of such forms of nitrogen were observed in 2013 and also in subsequent years at the bathing beach (site 1) and the hostel (site 3) than at the inflow (site 4). Likewise, the highest content of phosphates was recorded at the inflow site (4), being four-fold lower at the other sites (1, 3). The average content of TP before the EM technology was applied cc as 0.205 mg dm(-3), whereas after the application of effective microorganisms it fell down to 0.189 mg dm(-3) (2013-2015). Only slight changes of TSITP indicated that waters in Muchawka Reservoir were eutrophic. After EM was applied twice, no streaks, cyanobacterial scums or pollution at the bathing sites were visible. The bacteriological evaluation of the water samples was carried out by the County Branch of the State Sanitary Inspectorate in Siedlce. The bacteriological water quality was described as "excellent". These findings suggest that the method developed by SITNREK, combined with probiotic preparations, could be a useful tool in the restoration of water bodies, but the conclusion requires further detailed verification.					; Kapusta, Andrzej/GVS-3584-2022; Mazur, Robert/C-7811-2018; Napiorkowska-Krzebietke, Agnieszka/I-3874-2018; Stawecki, Konrad/AAP-2235-2021	Stawecki, Konrad/0000-0002-8904-8996; Mazur, Robert/0000-0001-7869-1823; Napiorkowska-Krzebietke, Agnieszka/0000-0001-8361-0290; Kapusta, Andrzej/0000-0001-8979-5468; 													1644-2296						2017	22	2					529	543		10.5601/jelem.2016.21.2.1196	http://dx.doi.org/10.5601/jelem.2016.21.2.1196													WOS:000399340700011

However, the potential seasonal turbine entrainment vulnerability patterns of potadromous salmonids are not well understood. Here, we use acoustic telemetry to test the hypothesis that adults of two species of the Salvelinus genus (bull trout and lake trout) differ in their seasonal patterns of entrainment and entrainment vulnerability over a 2-year period. Our results show that while both species were entrained at similarly low annual rates (similar to 1%), these two salmonids differed in their patterns of forebay residency and proximity, with implications for entrainment risk. Bull trout occupied the forebay at low rates across all seasons, with no clear seasonal pattern of forebay proximity. In contrast, lake trout displayed a strongly seasonal pattern of entrainment vulnerability with a distinct movement away from the forebay during the summer, and a large increase in forebay proximity and use in the winter and spring. These findings provide a novel species-specific demonstration of the potential entrainment vulnerability of lake trout. The seasonal patterns of entrainment vulnerability seen in previous bull trout studies, where bull trout occupied top pelagic predator niches, were not replicated in our study where bull trout occur in sympatry with another top pelagic predator. These findings, which indicate that species composition plays an important role determining entrainment vulnerability, have important implications for the conservation of indigenous lake trout and bull trout populations, and together highlight the need for a site-specific approach to entrainment quantification.					; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010	Harrison, Philip/0000-0002-4791-3232; Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659; Crossman, James/0000-0002-7134-982X; 													1535-1459	1535-1467				SEP	2020	36	7					1033	1045		10.1002/rra.3617	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.3617		MAR 2020											WOS:000522273200001

The relationship between environmental factors and radial growth was studied in 50 100-m2 quadrats laid out in five Fraxinus-dominated stands. Response function coefficients showed that the weather in the year before growth, i.e. in the time of bud formation, had a strong influence on radial increment. Temperatures in April of the year before (year i - 1) and May (i - 1) were positively correlated with growth, while precipitation in April (i - 1), May (i - 1) and June (i - 1) were negatively correlated. Climatic factors positively associated with growth during the year of bud expansion were April (i) temperature and June (i) precipitation. Redundancy analysis showed that radial growth in Fraxinus nigra responded to variation in elevation and geomorphological landform. These differences in stand location and elevation were also related to different responses to climate. The sites most exposed to flooding responded much more to the negative impact of spring precipitation, while the more elevated sites were more responsive to summer precipitation. This study showed that black ash could be used for long term reconstruction of climatic and hydrological fluctuations.																			1100-9233					NOV	1993	4	6					751	758		10.2307/3235611	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3235611													WOS:A1993MM74700005

The major cations, anions, and delta C-13(DIC) values were analyzed. It was found that the dissolved compositions are dominated by carbonate weathering, while sulfuric acids may play a relatively important role during carbonate weathering and increasing DIC concentration. Different reservoirs had variable characteristics of water physiochemical stratification. The DIC concentrations of reservoir water were lower in summer than those in winter due to the dilute effects and intensive aquatic photosynthesis, as well as imported tributaries. The delta C-13(DIC) values in Tingzikou Reservoir were higher during summer than those in winter, which indicated that intensive photosynthesis increased the delta C-13(DIC) values in residual water, but a similar trend was not obvious in other reservoirs. Except for in Xinzheng Reservoir, the delta C-13(DIC) values in inflow and outflow reservoir water were lower than those in the surface water of stratified sampling in summer. For stratified sampling, it could be found that, in summer, the Tingzikou Reservoir delta C-13(DIC) values significantly decreased with water depth due to the anaerobic breakdown of organic matter. The significant correlation (p < 0.01 or 0.05) between the DIC concentrations, the delta C-13(DIC) values and anthropogenic species (Na++K+, Cl-, and ) showed that the isotope composition of DIC can be a useful tracer of contaminants. In total, Tingzikou Reservoir showed lacustrine features, Xinzheng Reservoir and Dongxiguan Reservoir had "transitional" features, and Caojie Reservoir had a total of "fluvial" features. Generally, cascade reservoirs in the Jialing River exhibited natural river features rather than typical lake features due to characteristics of reservoir water in physiochemical stratification, spatiotemporal variations of DIC concentrations and isotopic compositions. It is evident that the dissolved inorganic carbon dynamics of natural rivers had been partly remolded by dam building.						/0000-0001-8761-4512													2096-0956	2365-7499				DEC	2017	36	4			SI		581	597		10.1007/s11631-017-0155-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11631-017-0155-5													WOS:000416237700002

Microbial community structure and dynamics in the largest natural French lake (Lake Bourget)	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												We investigated the dynamics and diversity of heterotrophic bacteria, autotrophic and heterotrophic flagellates, and ciliates from March to July 2002 in the surface waters (0-50 m) of Lake Bourget. The heterotrophic bacteria consisted mainly of "small" cocci, but filaments (> 2 mu m), commonly considered to be grazing-resistant forms under increased nanoflagellate grazing, were also detected. These elongated cells mainly belonged to the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium (CF) cluster, and were most abundant during spring and early summer, when mixotrophic or heterotrophic flagellates were the main bacterial predators. The CF group strongly dominated fluorescent in situ hybridization-detected cells from March to June, whereas clear changes were observed in early summer when Beta-proteobacteria and Alpha-proteobacteria increased concomitantly with maximal protist grazing pressures. The analysis of protist community structure revealed that the flagellates consisted mainly of cryptomonad forms. The dynamics of Cryptomonas sp. and Dinobryon sp. suggested the potential importance of mixotrophs as consumers of bacteria. This point was verified by an experimental approach based on fluorescent microbeads to assess the potential grazing impact of all protist taxa in the epilimnion. From the results, three distinct periods in the functioning of the epilimnetic microbial loop were identified. In early spring, mixotrophic and heterotrophic flagellates constituted the main bacterivores, and were regulated by the availability of their resources mainly during April (phase 1). Once the "clear water phase" was established, the predation pressure of metazooplankton represented a strong top-down force on all microbial compartments. During this period only mixotrophic flagellates occasionally exerted a significant bacterivory pressure (phase 2). Finally, the early summer was characterized by the highest protozoan grazing impact and by a rapid shift in the carbon pathway transfer, with a fast change-over of the main predators contribution, i.e., mixotrophic, heterotrophic flagellates and ciliates in bacterial mortality. The high abundance of ciliates during this period was consistent with the high densities of resources (heterotrophic nanoflagellates, algae, bacteria) in deep layers containing the most chlorophyll. Bacteria, as ciliates, responded clearly to increasing phytoplankton abundance, and although bacterial grazing impact could vary largely, bacterial abundance seemed to be primarily bottom-up regulated (phase 3).

The present knowledge about ASM variations since the last glaciation in South China largely relies on several precisely-dated speleothem stable oxygen isotope (delta O-18) records. Although these speleothem delta O-18 signals provide useful evidence for regional past environmental changes, their validity for denoting ASM intensity remains a great controversy. The Huguangyan Maar Lake (HML) provides one of the most complete archives of environmental and climatic changes in the tropical-subtropical South and East Asia since the last glaciation. Here we document a continuous centennial- to millennial-scale ASM record over the past 16 ky BP from the high-sedimentation-rate HML sediments. In contrast with the low-amplitude variations of Chinese speleothem-derived delta O-18 signals and the Chinese loess-based monsoon precipitation proxy indexes, our multi-proxy records reveal a pattern of high-amplitude regional climatic fluctuations, including fine-scale oscillations during the Bolling-Allerod warming, the 8.2 ka cooling event, and an abrupt climate shift from 6.5-5.9 ka. The existence of Bond-like cold/dry events indicates a distinct influence of the North Atlantic circulation on low-latitude monsoon changes. The broad comparability between the HML paleo-proxies, Chinese speleothem delta O-18 records, and the northern hemisphere summer insolation throughout the Holocene, suggests that solar insolation exerts a profound influence on ASM changes. These findings reinforce a model of combined insolation and glacial forcing of the ASM. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Restoration of Wildcelery, Vallisneria americana Michx., in the lower Detroit River of the Lake Huron-Lake Erie corridor	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												American wildcelery (Vallisneria americana Michx.) is a valuable submersed aquatic plant that was negatively affected by pollution and urban runoff in the lower Detroit River for much of the 20th century. Following 25 years of water-pollution and urban- runoff abatement initiated in the early 1970s, we postulated that water clarity had increased and that this would allow restoration of wildcelery in the lower Detroit River. In addition, water clarity increased in the late 1980s due to waterfiltration and particulate removal by exotic dreissenid mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and D. bugensis), which could contribute to potential wildcelery restoration. We sampled wildcelery in 1996-97 and compared these data to wildcelery data from 1950-51 and 1984-85. Over the 48-year period of comparison, areal density of wildcelery tubers decreased 72% (from 51.2 million to 14.4 million tubers) between 1950-51 and 1984-85 then increased 251% (from 14.4 million to 50.5 million tubers) between 1984-85 and 1996-97. As a result, overall areal abundance was about the same in 1950-51 as in fall 1996-97. However, tuber densities in spring 1996 were similar to historical low abundances in springs of 1984-85. Then between spring and fall 1996, tuber densities increased 333% and remained relatively abundant through October 1997 indicating the beginning of the restoration of wildcelery in the lower Detroit River. In addition, we believe further reductions of turbidity through continued pollution-abatement programs and water filtration by dreissenid mussels combined with habitat protection and active management of wildcelery will contribute even further to the restoration of wildcelery in the Detroit River in the 21st century.																			0380-1330					MAY	2007	33			1			8	19		10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[8:ROWVAM]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[8:ROWVAM]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000247272000002

Lakeside carbonates provide a rare example of onshore groundwater spring deposits connected to lacustrine microbialite reefs. Clotted fabrics and mineralized bacteriomorphs suggest microbial influence both in groundwater spring and littoral carbonates. Thrombolitic clotted aragonite and dendritic clotted intermediate magnesium calcite may document two distinct microbial ecosystems each with a specific mineralogy. Radiocarbon dates from interior to outer layers of a 20 cm littoral microbialite suggest several thousand years of domal growth. Climate fluctuations may be recorded in littoral deposits by the alternation of ooids (increased salinity, arid conditions) with ostracods (fresher water, humid conditions). Successive higher frequency cycles of sedimentation, exposure, microkarst and early diagenesis were cemented by vadose and phreatic very high magnesium calcite and non-stoichiometric dolomite. Several layers of littoral and beach deposits accumulated during longer lacustrine transgressive-regressive cycles. Clastic detritus and lack of known initial U and Th concentrations could explain the lack of correlation between widely scattered U-Th ages and closely grouped C-14 dates. Calibrated ages from radiocarbon dating may have been increased by long residence time of groundwater in bedrock, since Sr-87/Sr-86 signatures do indicate possible littoral-zone mixing of lake water with groundwater from outcropping and subsurface Mississippian Great Blue Limestone. The perplexing Lakeside carbonate system is the result of interaction between microbial and chemical processes during sedimentation and early diagenesis.

Neutron activation analysis was used to determine if potentially toxic trace elements were present in higher concentrations at stations near the basin than at reference stations a few kilometers away. Of the 29 trace elements examined, arsenic and cobalt were significantly (p < 0.05) more concentrated in sediment nearest the coal ash basin except in spring, when little or no difference was detected. Arsenic and bromine were significantly higher in oligochaetes, and selenium was significantly higher in both oligochaetes and chironomids taken from proximal stations than in those taken from reference stations. Selenium, bromine, cobalt, nickel, and chromium were higher in young-of-the-year brown bullheads taken nearer the disposal basin in fall 1983. Selenium was higher in adult spottail shiners taken at the proximal station in spring 1984, and bromine was higher in yearling white bass from the proximal station in fall 1983 and 1984. None of the trace elements was higher in adult yellow perch or adult brown bullheads at any time. Fewer spottail shiners and yearling white bass were caught close to the disposal basin than far away, which may indicate avoidance by these fish of increased concentrations of trace elements contained within the ash effluent.																			0270-5060					SEP	1992	7	3					257	270		10.1080/02705060.1992.9664694	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1992.9664694													WOS:A1992JV65800003

This phenomenon occurs when cold air flows over the warm water surface, enhancing convection and leading to heavy snow fall. Six snowband events from 1985 to 2010 are simulated by using the coupled atmosphereocean- ice model COSMO-CLM/NEMO. The model resolution is reasonably high to capture the snowbands; the atmospheric model COSMO-CLM has a horizontal grid-spacing of approximately 25 km and the ocean sea-ice model NEMO has a horizontal grid-spacing of approximately 3 km. The model results show that the coupled system COSMO-CLM/NEMO successfully reproduced the snowband events with a high contrast of temperatures between the surface and the atmosphere, sharp bands of precipitation over the sea, as well as the enormous heat fluxes released by the ocean to the atmosphere during the days when snowbands occurred. In the two cases when radar data are available, the model precipitation is shown to be in satisfactory agreement. The precipitation patterns closely follow the cloud shapes on satellite images. When not coupled with the ocean model, the atmospheric stand-alone model provided acceptable results if forced by high-quality sea surface temperatures (SSTs) from reanalysis data. However, COSMO-CLM forced with lower quality SSTs could not recreate the snowbands. The results indicate the need of an atmospheric model with high SST skill or a coupled ocean model when extreme event climatology is the primary aim in the Baltic Sea area.

J	ALPINE, AE; CLOERN, JE				ALPINE, AE; CLOERN, JE			TROPHIC INTERACTIONS AND DIRECT PHYSICAL EFFECTS CONTROL PHYTOPLANKTON BIOMASS AND PRODUCTION IN AN ESTUARY	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The recent invasion of San Francisco Bay by the suspension-feeding clam Potamocorbula amurensis has provided an opportunity to document the ecological consequences of a major biological disturbance. Previous work over the last two decades has shown that phytoplankton biomass in the upper estuary is low (2-3 mg Chl a m-3) during seasonal periods of high river flow and short residence time, and it is usually high (peak > 30 mg Chl a m-3) during the summer-autumn seasons of low river flow and long residence time. However since P. amurensis became widespread and abundant in 1987, the summer phytoplankton biomass maximum has disappeared, presumably because of increased grazing pressure by this newly introduced species. For the period 1977-1990, mean estimated primary production was only 39 g C m-2 yr-1 during years when bivalve suspension feeders were abundant (>2,000 m-2), compared to 106 g C m-2 yr-1 when bivalves were absent or present in low numbers. These observations support the hypothesis that seasonal and interannual fluctuations in estuarine phytoplankton biomass and primary production can be regulated jointly by direct physical effects (e.g. river-driven transport) and trophic interactions (episodes of enhanced grazing pressure by immigrant populations of benthic suspension feeders).					; Cloern, James/C-1499-2011	Cloern, James/0000-0002-5880-6862; 													0024-3590					JUL	1992	37	5					946	955		10.4319/lo.1992.37.5.0946	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1992.37.5.0946													WOS:A1992JX35800003

J	Hegg, A; Radersma, R; Uller, T				Hegg, Alexander; Radersma, Reinder; Uller, Tobias			A field experiment reveals seasonal variation in the Daphnia gut microbiome	OIKOS												The gut microbiome is increasingly recognized for its impact on host fitness, but it remains poorly understood how naturally variable environments influence gut microbiome diversity and composition. We studied changes in the gut microbiome of ten genotypes of water fleas Daphnia magna in submerged mesocosm enclosures in a eutrophic lake over a period of 16 weeks, from early summer to autumn. The microbial diversity increased when Daphnia were reintroduced from the laboratory to the lake, and the composition of gut microbes drastically changed. Both gut microbiome diversity and composition continued to change over the 16-week period, with alpha diversity peaking in late summer. The gut microbiome community was clearly distinct from that of the surrounding water, and temporal changes in the two communities were independent of each other. There were no consistent differences in the gut microbiomes among Daphnia genotypes in the lake environment. The change in gut microbiome over the season was accompanied by a decline in reproductive output and survival. There were weak, but statistically supported, effects of microbiota composition on Daphnia fitness, but there was no evidence that natural variation in microbiome diversity or composition was associated with tolerance to the cyanotoxin microcystin. We conclude that the gut microbiome of Daphnia is highly dynamic in a natural lake environment, but that host genetic effects on microbiome diversity and composition between genotypes within a population can be vanishingly small. These results emphasize that establishing the ecological effects of gut microbiota will require large-scale experiments under natural conditions.

Sinninghe; Reichart, Gert-Jan			A late Holocene molecular hydrogen isotope record of the East Asian Summer Monsoon in Southwest Japan	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Precipitation in Japan is strongly affected by the East Asian monsoon system, resulting in wet summer conditions and relatively dry winter conditions. Few paleo-monsoon records exist from northeastern Asia, especially records showing decadal- to centennial-scale variability. Here we present a molecular hydrogen isotope (delta D) record from Lake Kaiike, a small coastal lake in southwest Japan, to provide insight into monsoonal precipitation over the past two millennia. The delta D record of friedelin, a terrestrial higher plant lipid, reveals three major shifts in precipitation: a decline from >-185% to <-190%o at 1700 cal yr BP suggests a change to wetter conditions; values between -187.5%o and -180%o from 1480 to 800 cal yr BP indicate reduced precipitation; and a decline to below -195%0 after 800 cal yr BP reflects moist conditions during the Little Ice Age. These results highlight variability in the intensity of the East Asian Summer Monsoon occurring on decadal- to centennial time scales. El Nino-like conditions are likely responsible for periods of high monsoon intensity, but comparison with other records in the region (northeast China and Japan) shows that contradicting patterns also exist, and so explaining these rainfall patterns is not straightforward.

Seasonal shifts in genotype frequencies in the invasive cladoceran Daphnia lumholtzi in Lake Texoma, USA	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												P>1. We examined the ecological genetics of the invasive cladoceran Daphnia lumholtzi in a reservoir (Lake Texoma) in the southern USA. This species originates from the Old World subtropics and has spread across North America since the late 1980s after its inadvertent introduction to a reservoir in northeastern Texas. 2. The population genetic structure of D. lumholtzi was examined seasonally on 22 dates over a 3-year period along a natural temperature and salinity gradient. 3. A two-allele polymorphism at the phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) locus was detected, while other loci tested showed no variation. Significant temporal heterogeneity existed in genotype frequencies with a major shift between summer and autumn. 4. Results of a multiple linear regression analysis revealed that a significant amount of variation was explained by day length, temperature and conductivity. Additionally, significant spatial heterogeneity of genotype frequencies between lake stations was observed, but was restricted to the summer. 5. Clonal isolates were used in controlled laboratory temperature and salinity tolerance experiments. Results suggest that salinity and temperature tolerance differed between PGI genotypes. 6. Genotype x environment interactions may play a significant role in the micro-evolutionary dynamics of this invasive species and may have facilitated its rapid expansion across the North American continent.

Sistan district with a population density of 43 people per square kilometer is the most densely populated human ecosystem in east Iran. This population is distributed in more than 1000 cities, villages, and nomadic settlements. Sistan plain is extensively exposed to vigorous winds. In the last 5years, with the spread of drought and drastic reduction of Hirmand River's water flow, dust storms have become more severe and long lasting. Winds of 120days are the most significant wind in the region which starts every year at the end of the spring and lasts all through the beginning of autumn, with a mean velocity of 100km/h. This research utilizes a survey/descriptive method coupled with medical documents to rank the risk of destructive eolian sediment dispersion in different regions of Sistan alongside the frequency of citizen's reference to medical centers due to respiratory problems or eye damages caused by these sediments during the summer of 2017. The research findings show more risk of dispersion of eolian sediments in human environment in near the Iranian-Afghan border. The Level of the risk of respiratory and eye damages for citizens exposed to dust distribution with the rate of distribution of eolian sediments in the environment is statistically significant. Human ecosystems (1) Dehno-Piran, (2) Bazzi-Allari, (3) Muhammad-Shah-Karam, and (4) Abbas-Rostam regions in Sistan area have the highest risk for citizens due to respiratory problems and eye damages caused by eolian sediment dispersion.					; afshari, mahdi/CAH-4121-2022	Afshari, Mahdi/0000-0002-3159-8741; 													1866-7511	1866-7538				APR	2019	12	7							227	10.1007/s12517-019-4324-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12517-019-4324-1													WOS:000461764800006
J	Oroud, IM				Oroud, Ibrahim M.			Spatial and temporal surface temperature patterns across the Dead Sea as investigated from thermal images and thermodynamic concepts	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												The annual cycle of the Dead Sea surface temperature was investigated using band 10 onboard Landsat 8 during 2017-2018 and thermodynamic concepts. Retrieved Dead Sea temperatures are congruent with field observations with a mean square error of 1.22 degrees C and a correlation coefficient of 0.983. A new method employing thermodynamic concepts is presented in this paper to address the influence of buoyant plumes generated by freshwater influx on evaporation from hypersaline lakes/lagoons. Thermal images reveal a distinct spatial temperature pattern across the Dead Sea which reflects differential heating and cooling caused by variations in thermophysical characteristics of the deep sea compared with the shallow shoreline. The temperature patterns are negatively skewed in winter and positively skewed in summer. These temporal and spatial temperature patterns were illustrated using observed hourly data combined with energy balance calculations. The presence of buoyant plumes is found to alter evaporation compared with the undisturbed sea brine, and the effect of these plumes on evaporation is controlled by the simultaneous departure of temperature and activity compared with the undisturbed sea brine. Analysis shows that evaporation from buoyant plumes is more likely to be smaller than that from the open sea in winter and larger than its corresponding part from the open sea in summer. Thermal images can be used as surrogates to intensive field campaigns to examine temperature and evaporation regimes of lakes/salt flats.																			0177-798X	1434-4483				OCT	2020	142	1-2					569	579		10.1007/s00704-020-03343-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-020-03343-9		JUL 2020											WOS:000553276600001

Relation of surface and underground waters in Chungara and Cotacotani lake districts, northern Chile:: an isotopic study	REVISTA GEOLOGICA DE CHILE												Lake Chungara and Cotacotani lake districts are surface water bodies located to the northwest of Lauca Basin in the northern Chilean Altiplano. Surface and underground waters show low to moderate saline content and an electrical conductivity in the range of 48.7 to 3090 mu S/cm. The lakes are related to a system of aquifers on the nearby volcano flanks and debris avalanche deposits of Parinacota. volcano. On the basis of delta O-18 and delta D isotopic composition and its correlation with the chloride content in Chungara and Cotacotani lake, spring, and Chungara river waters it is demonstrated that: a. Lake Chungara's waters show vertical and horizontal homogeneous isotopic composition, which indicates a good mixture of waters in the lake; b. an important part of the Cotacotani lake recharge feeding come from Lake Chungara, that flows laterally as groundwater; c. the groundwater that feeds the springs of the area has its main recharge in the spring-summer (October-March) precipitation. The high content of tritium (H-3) measured in spring waters of the area suggested a very recent recharge (last decades) of the aquifer system. The application of lumped parameter models to interpret the water residence time in the aquifer indicates that the piston flow model shows the best fit to the isotopic composition of Chungard-Cotacotani groundwater.

The spotted frog in Tule Valley breeds in cold-water portions of the peripheral wetlands, which exhibit maximum temperature variations (1-25 degrees C), maximum conductivity up to 3200 mu mhos/cm, and maximum pH values up to 9.7. Adult frogs are found in habitats with temperatures of 29 degrees C, conductivity of 4700 mu mhos/cm, and pH above 9.0 in the summer. The increased summer salinity and pH in frog habitats returns to lower values by the next breeding season due to underground recharge. Breeding in Tule Valley occurs earlier than in other Bonneville locations because of the warm-water sources.

On the basis of the remote sensing data and ground monitoring data, this study firstly constructed a more accurate retrieval model for total phosphorus (TP) concentration by comparing 12 machine learning algorithms, including support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), Bayesian ridge regression (BRR), lasso regression (Lasso), elastic net (EN), linear regression (LR), decision tree regressor (DTR), K neighbor regressor (KNR), random forest regressor (RFR), extra trees regressor (ETR), AdaBoost regressor (ABR) and gradient boosting regressor (GBR). Then, this study applied the constructed retrieval model to explore the spatial-temporal evolution of the Miyun Reservoir and finally assessed the water quality. The results showed that the model of TP concentration built by the ETR algorithm had the best accuracy, with the coefficient R-2 reaching over 85% and the mean absolute error lower than 0.000433. The TP concentration in Miyun Reservoir was between 0.0380 and 0.1298 mg/L, and there was relatively significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity. It changed remarkably during the periods of the flood season, winter tillage, planting, and regreening, and it was lower in summer than in other seasons. Moreover, the TP in the southwest part of the reservoir was generally lower than in the northeast, as there was less human activities interference. According to the Environmental Quality Standard for the surface water environment, the water quality of Miyun Reservoir was overall safe, except only for an over-standard case occurrence in the spring and September. These conclusions can provide a significant scientific reference for water quality monitoring and management in Miyun Reservoir.

DOC samples from epilimnion, metalimnion, hypolimnion, and from the main inflowing tributary were fractionated into four fractions by using resin adsorbants: hydrophobic acids (same as aquatic humic substances; AHS), hydrophilic acids (HiA), hydrophilic bases (HiB), and hydrophilic neutrals (HiN). Before the monsoon, in spring and early summer, DOC concentration was consistently low (ca. 1.5 mg/l). Heavy rains associated with the summer monsoon had substantial impact on the distributions and characteristics of DOC in the lake. The fractional composition of DOC and the specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) varied with sampling dates and depth. AHS and HiA were major fractions of DOC in both Lake Soyang and the inflowing river, except in the bottom layer of the lake. In the inflowing river water HiA (50.2 +/- 4.9 %) was larger component than AHS (38.7 +/- 0.8 %) in pre- and post-monsoon seasons, whereas AHS (58.1 +/- 2.7 %) prevailed over HiA (37.4 0.8 %) during the summer monsoon. In the epilimnion of the lake, HiA (36-63 %) was more abundant than AHS (34-38 %) in all fractionation samples. In the metalimnion the proportions of AHS was higher with the effect of allochthonous DOC inputs during the summer monsoon. The HiN fraction was negligible in the epilimnion and the metalimnion, but it was sometimes major portion at the anoxic bottom layer (up to 78 %). SUVA of each fraction of DOC was in the order of [AHS>total DOC>hydrophilic fraction] in both lake water and inflowing river water.																			0003-9136					SEP	2002	155	2					333	352																WOS:000178539100009

The lake trophic states were assessed using the comprehensive trophic state index (CTSI) and rotifer trophic state index (TSIROT). The results indicated that 69.1% of the lake area showed slight eutrophication, 29.3% showed mesotrophication, and 1.6% showed moderate eutrophication. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index and Pielou evenness index were employed to assess the community diversity of phytoplankton and zooplankton. The dominant taxa and most dominant species of phytoplankton and zooplankton were determined; Cyanophyta and Rotifera were the dominant phytoplankton and zooplankton taxa, respectively. Microcystis sp. and Polyarthra vulgaris were the most dominant species of phytoplankton and zooplankton, respectively. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was applied to identify the key environmental variables that influenced the species, diversity indices and species abundance of phytoplankton and zooplankton. The results showed that ammonia nitrogen (NH4+), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and dissolved oxygen (DO) were the main environmental factors influencing the species abundance and diversity. The current lake plankton species number and diversity index were lower than those in past decades, as determined by comparing the community characteristics of phytoplankton and zooplankton with historical records. Comparisons of TN:TP ratios with those of other lakes suggested that nitrogen was the limiting nutrient for lake eutrophication. Baiyangdian Lake could have a high potential for eutrophication based on the environmental and ecological characteristics of the lake.

J	Dos Santos, ACA; Calijuri, MC				Dos Santos, ACA; Calijuri, MC			Survival strategies of some species of the phytoplankton community in the Barra Bonita Reservoir (Sao Paulo, Brazil)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The dynamics of the phytoplankton community in the Barra Bonita Reservoir (Sao Paulo, Brazil) were studied through daily sampling in the field (integrated samples from the euphotic zone) and microcosm experiments, for two short periods: the winter of 1993 (June 30 to July 10) and the summer of 1994 (January 24 to February 2). The goal of the study was to evaluate and compare the variations in the composition of isolated phytoplankton community which occur over short periods of time. Three series were separated into Erlenmeyer flasks for each study period, with samples from the euphotic zone divided into three portions: total, smaller than 64 mu m, and smaller than 20 mu m. All of the Erlenmeyer flasks were inclubated in situ at the sampling station. The maximum period of incubation was 10 d. Variations of the community in the euphotic zone were characterised by high diversity and a community in a state of non-equilibrium in winter, without the predominance of any species. In the summer, the community presented a low diversity and a state of equilibrium, with the predominance of Microcystis aeruginosa. The microcosm experiments showed that the confinement of the community in the Erlenmeyer flasks, and therefore in isolation from the physical variability of the ecosystem, especially in relation to the mixing patterns, stimulated the return of the community to the initial phases of succession with the predominance of small species and those which grow rapidly (r-selective or C-strategist).

J	Cui, YD; Liu, XQ; Wang, HZ				Cui, Yong-De; Liu, Xue-Qin; Wang, Hong-Zhu			Macrozoobenthic community of Fuxian Lake, the deepest lake of southwest China	LIMNOLOGICA												Located in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau in southwest China, Fuxian Lake covers an area of 211 km(2), with maximum depth of 155 m. It is known to have a unique fauna, including 14 described endemic species. In order to describe the zoobenthic community of the lake more completely, the present study was conducted from August 2002 to August 2003. Altogether 62 benthic taxa, including 22 oligochaetes, 21 molluscs and 18 insects were identified, of which the dominant taxa belonged to Potamothrix, Procladius and Paraprososthenia. The standing stocks of benthos were much higher in the littoral (824 ind/m(2) in density, 3.72 g/m(2) in biomass) than in the profundal region (23 ind/m(2) in density, 0.10 g/m(2) in biomass). Species richness was greatest in summer and standing stocks were larger in spring and summer than in other seasons. Analyses of functional feeding groups indicated that collector-gatherers and scrapers were predominant in entire lake. Stepwise multiple regression analysis demonstrated that the water depth is the most important factor affecting the distribution of macrozoobenthos. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

J	Moore, CW; Obrist, D; Luria, M				Moore, Christopher W.; Obrist, Daniel; Luria, Menachem			Atmospheric mercury depletion events at the Dead Sea: Spatial and temporal aspects	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Atmospheric cycling over the saline Dead Sea is highly dynamic due to high atmospheric BrOx (Br + BrO) concentrations. Elevated atmospheric BrOx concentrations cause large and frequent atmospheric mercury (Hg) depletion events (AMDEs), whereby the normally dominant gaseous Hg(0) drops well below global background levels and oxidized forms - particularly Hg(II)(gaseous) - increase dramatically. The high BrOx concentrations also cause ozone (O-3) depletion events (ODEs), and the corresponding depletions of Hg(0) and O-3 provide strong evidence that Dead Sea AMDEs are linked to active halogen chemistry. We conducted two measurement campaigns in the Dead Sea basin (summer 2009 and winter 2009/2010), and here provide: spatial and temporal data on atmospheric levels of Hg(0), Hg(II) (gaseous and particulate), and O-3; Dead Sea water methyl-Hg and total-Hg concentrations; and an evaluation of the performance of current Hg measurement techniques under the particularly high atmospheric Hg(II) concentrations found at the Dead Sea. AMDEs (Hg(0) <1.0 ng m(-3)) occurred on 20 of 29 days in summer, of which eight events were very strong (<0.5 ng m(-3)); in winter, they occurred on eight of 20 days, of which four were very strong. Although all AMDEs occurred when BrO levels (measured by LP-DOAS) were enhanced, only four and three of the strong AMDEs (in summer and winter, respectively) showed corresponding ODEs, while other events showed no corresponding O-3 concentration declines. This indicated that AMDEs can occur without detectable ODEs, even though BrOx chemistry is considered to drive AMDEs. We attribute these patterns to the fact that Hg concentrations seem more sensitive to active halogen chemistry than O-3 which occurs at concentrations orders of magnitude higher and also shows photochemical daytime production. A second observation site some 400 m above the Dead Sea surface showed that AMDEs and ODEs occur throughout the Dead Sea basin and are not limited to the shore, although their frequency was lower (four events with levels <1.0 ng m(-3) in winter). Total-Hg and methyl-Hg concentrations of the Dead Sea water were not enhanced in spite of the regular occurrence of AMDEs, with methyl-Hg concentrations below detection limits and total-Hg concentrations below 5 ppt. We further found that even at high Hg(II)(gaseous) concentrations, the commonly-used Tekran Model 2537 Hg vapor analyzer predominantly measures Hg(0) - as opposed to total gaseous Hg (TGM: GEM + Hg(IIgaseous); and that at high Hg(II)(gaseous) levels, the Tekran speciation unit experiences enhanced system blank levels because glassware possibly has difficulty fully retaining Hg(II).

Acoustic assessment of the fish spatio-temporal distribution during the initial filling of the Three Gorges Reservoir, Yangtze River (China), from 2006 to 2010	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												The aim of this study was to quantify the fish fauna in the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) and assess the tendency for change as well as for any spatial and temporal distribution. Two types of echo-sounder equipment (HTI Model 241 and Simrad EY60) were used to detect the fish density and fish spatio-temporal distribution. Eight surveys were conducted between 2006 and 2010, with the results showing that fish abundance in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) increased yearly from 15.5 to 123ind./1000m(3), a change apparently correlated with the corresponding increase in the reservoir water level. Horizontally, fish density increased from the lower reaches to the upper reaches. Fish preferred inhabiting the area around the Zhongxian section during winter and the Chongqing section in spring. Vertically, fish density was highest in the lower layer, followed by the middle layer. The difference in fish density in different water layers observed in spring was not as evident as in the winter. Fish target strength throughout the eight investigations showed a skewed distribution with respect to fish size. The overall increasing tendency of fish density and the spatio-temporal distribution of fish species were closely related to the water level of the TGR during the impounding period. Other influencing factors included water flow rate, water depth, reservoir shape, habitat type, and protection policy.																			0175-8659	1439-0426				DEC	2013	29	6					1395	1401		10.1111/jai.12370	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jai.12370													WOS:000327212000040

The distribution of Yellow Wagtails in West Africa, prior to northward (spring) migration, is affected by food supplies and by different racial and sexual responses to environmental factors. Consequently, each breeding population relies on a wide range of sites, but those occupied towards the end of the dry season and ones used as stepping-off points for migration may be particularly vital. Energetic considerations point towards a non-stop trans-Saharan flight being used rather than a series of short flights with resting stops in the desert. However, adverse conditions during migration could make stop-overs unavoidable. The most direct routes between wintering and breeding areas are preferred, and the initial desert crossing is accomplished at a faster pace than later stages of the journey. Yellow Wagtails emigrate from West Africa in a sequence related to the onset of spring on their breeding sites, rather than in response to rainfall in Africa: moult, fattening and emigration are probably endogenously controlled. However, competition from African resident birds may also be an important factor affecting the timing of migration. Races breeding in southern Europe are most likely to be adversely affected by degradation of the Sahel. Empirical evidence suggests that conditions on the wintering grounds are more likely to regulate population size than conditions experienced on migration, but more detailed studies are needed in Africa before sound conservation strategies can be designed.																			0019-1019						1992	134			1			66	76																WOS:A1992JF56600011

Patterns and isotopic composition of greenhouse gases under ice in lakes of interior Alaska	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Arctic and boreal lake greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) are an important component of regional carbon (C) budgets. Yet the magnitude and seasonal patterns of lake GHG emissions are poorly constrained, because sampling is limited in these remote landscapes, particularly during winter and shoulder seasons. To better define patterns of under ice GHG content (and emissions potential at spring thaw), we surveyed carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) concentrations and stable isotopic composition during winter of 2017 in 13 lakes in the arid Yukon Flats Basin of interior Alaska, USA. Partial pressures of CO(2)and CH(4)ranged over three orders of magnitude, were positively correlated, and CO(2)exceeded CH(4)at all but one site. Shallow, organic matter-rich lakes located at lower elevations tended to have the highest concentrations of both gases, though CH(4)content was more heterogeneous and only abundant in oxygen-depleted lakes, while CO(2)was negatively correlated to oxygen content. Isotopic values of CO(2)spanned a narrow range (-10 parts per thousand to -23 parts per thousand) compared to CH4, which ranged over 50 parts per thousand (-19 parts per thousand to -71 parts per thousand), indicating CH(4)source pathways and sink strength varied widely between lakes. Miller-Tans and Keeling plots qualitatively suggested two groups of lakes were present; one with isotopically enriched source CH(4)possibly more dominated by acetoclastic methanogenesis, and one with depleted signatures suggesting a dominance of the hydrogenotrophic production. Overall, regional lake differences in winter under ice GHG content appear to track landscape position, oxygen, and organic matter content and composition, causing patterns to vary widely even within a relatively small geographic area of interior Alaska.

J	Robe, WE; Griffiths, H				Robe, WE; Griffiths, H			Adaptations for an amphibious life: changes in leaf morphology, growth rate, carbon and nitrogen investment, and reproduction during adjustment to emersion by the freshwater macrophyte Littorella uniflora	NEW PHYTOLOGIST												Littorella uniflora (L.) Ascherson is a small, perennial, amphibious rhizophyte of rosette life-form which is common along the margins of lakes, tarns and reservoirs where water-level fluctuations are often rapid and unpredictable. The majority of plants are continuously submersed and reproduce vegetatively, but a small proportion become completely emersed for variable lengths of time, when flowering and seed set occur. To find out how L. uniflora adjusts to sudden emersion we studied the plants at a reservoir where water level falls each spring and remains low throughout the summer; L. uniflora adjusted very quickly showing a degree of phenotypic plasticity not expected in a 'stress tolerator', including the production of a new set of terrestrial leaves with reduced lacunal volume and increased stomatal density, a rapid increase in leaf growth rate, and flowering within 3-4 wk. Comparison of terrestrial L. uniflora with aquatic plants growing permanently submersed in lake and tarn habitats showed that three to fourfold more carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) was incorporated into above-ground biomass by emersed plants. However, ramet production in the aquatic environment appeared to be more costly, in terms of C and N invested, than terrestrial flower and seed production. The combination of continuous, submersed vegetative spread with the capacity for a high degree of phenotypic plasticity allowing some flower and seed production to occur during brief periods of emersion seems to account for the success of this plant in the amphibious niche.																			0028-646X					SEP	1998	140	1					9	23		10.1046/j.1469-8137.1998.00257.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1469-8137.1998.00257.x													WOS:000076565000002
J	Webb, BW; Walling, DE				Webb, BW; Walling, DE			Long-term variability in the thermal impact of river impoundment and regulation	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												A long-term study of the thermal impact of a reservoir in southwest England is reported, Detailed records collected from the regulated River Haddeo and the neighbouring (unregulated) River Pulham in a 14-year period following the attainment of top water level in the reservoir (Wimbleball Lake) show that the main thermal effects of impoundment and regulation have been to raise mean water temperature, eliminate freezing conditions, depress summer maximum values, delay the annual cycle and reduce diurnal fluctuation, However, the study also highlights pronounced year-to-year contrasts in the thermal impact of river impoundment and regulation, These can largely be explained with reference to inter-annual variations in both reservoir operation and weather conditions, which primarily control the amount of water released in summer months, and the volume of flow passing the spillway in the winter period, respectively.

J	Praharaj, T; Fortin, D				Praharaj, T; Fortin, D			Indicators of microbial sulfate reduction in acidic sulfide-rich mine tailings	GEOMICROBIOLOGY JOURNAL												Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are thought to be actively involved in the cycling of sulfur in acidic mine tailings. However, most studies have used circumstantial evidence to assess microbial sulfate activity in such environments. In order to fully ascertain the role of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in sulfur cycling in acidic mine tailings, we measured sulfate reduction rates, sulfur isotopic composition of reduced sulfide fractions, porewaters and solid-phase geochemistry and SRB populations in four different Cu-Zn tailings located in Timmins, Ontario, Canada. The tailings were sampled in the summer and in the spring, shortly after snowmelt. The results first indicate that all four sites showed very high sulfate reduction rates in the summer (greater than or similar to100-1000 nmol cm- 3d-1), which corresponded to the presence of sulfide in the porewaters and to high SRB populations. In some of the sites, zones of microbial sulfate reduction also corresponded to a decline of organic carbon and to an apparent pyrite (with slightly negative delta(34)S values) enrichment around the same depth. Microbial sulfate reduction was also important in permanently acidic (pH 2-3) mine tailings sites, suggesting that SRB can be active under very acidic conditions. Secondly, the results showed that microbial sulfate reduction was greatly reduced in the spring, suggesting that temperature might be a key factor in the activity of SRB. However, a closer look at the results indicated that temperature was not the sole factor and that acidic conditions and limited substrate availability in the spring appeared to be important as well in limiting microbial sulfate par reduction in sulfidic mine tailings. Finally, the results indicate that sulfur undergoes rapid cycling throughout the year and that microbial sulfate reduction and metal sulfide precipitation do not appear to be a permanent sink for metals.																			0149-0451	1521-0529				OCT-NOV	2004	21	7					457	467		10.1080/01490450490505428	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490450490505428													WOS:000223977000003
J	Simonson, MA; Weber, MJ; McCombs, A				Simonson, Martin A.; Weber, Michael J.; McCombs, Audrey			Hyperstability in Electrofishing Catch Rates of Common Carp and Bigmouth Buffalo	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Electrofishing catch per unit effort (CPUE) can be an effective index of relative abundance when CPUE is proportional to population density. However, the relationship between fish catch rates and density can be variable and not proportional because catchability may not be constant under a range of environmental conditions. Hyperstability occurs when catch rates change faster than population density, whereas hyperdepletion occurs when catch rates change slower than population density. We used capture-mark-recapture methods to estimate density of Common Carp Cyprinus carpio and Bigmouth Buffalo Ictiobus cyprinellus across 24 lake-years. Next, we developed log-linear mixed-effects models to assess the relationship between catch rates and density to predict electrofishing CPUE based on density and environmental covariates. Common Carp and Bigmouth Buffalo electrofishing CPUE exhibited hyperstability; CPUE initially increased faster at low density but reached an asymptote as density continued to increase. Common Carp catch rates increased with water temperature and were negatively associated with season; highest catch rates occurred in the warmest temperatures of spring, whereas the lowest catch rates occurred in the coldest temperatures of fall. Bigmouth Buffalo electrofishing CPUE was negatively related to water temperature but had a quadratic relationship with season; catch rates were highest in the spring and fall when water temperatures were coldest. Secchi depth, shoreline length, and maximum depth did not influence our model predictions in either species. Electrofishing had little power to detect simulated changes in Bigmouth Buffalo density regardless of sampling effort, whereas power to detect changes in Common Carp density increase with population changes and sampling effort. At low population densities for both species, electrofishing CPUE is expected to increase or decrease faster than density and can obscure conclusions about population trajectories but may still be useful for monitoring population fluctuations if hyperstability is accounted for by a correction factor.

To understand monsoon strength during the past six centuries, we analyzed proxy record from the Sherla lake which is a closed lake located in the northern state of Haryana, India. Chronology of the sediment is based on five radiocarbon AMS C-14 dates, encompassing the last similar to 600 years. Among proxies, we have analyzed stable isotope ratios (delta O-18(carb), delta C-13(carb), delta N-15 and delta C-13(OM)) in bulk sediment samples (carbonate and organic) along with grain size distribution (GSD) and geochemical parameters (CaO%, Rb/Sr and Si/Ca ratios). The Sherla lake data reveal significant changes since the Little Ice Age (LIA) (similar to 1360-1750 CE) to the Current Warm Period (similar to 1850 CE to the Present). From similar to 1360 to similar to 1500 CE (early phase of the LIA), the proxy data indicate more evaporative and less humid conditions along with low energy conditions corroborated by limited catchment weathering in the study area which suggests a weak ISM with mixed C-3- and C-4-type vegetation. From similar to 1600 to similar to 1780 CE (later phase of the LIA), multi-proxy parameters suggest that precipitation was more stable with high energy conditions along with enhanced catchment weathering and increasing trend of C-3-type vegetation, reflecting moist and wet conditions during this time slice. Spectral analysis of different proxies suggests prominent influence of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and solar forcing on Indian monsoon. Increased precipitation over the Himalayan foothills may have resulted from more break events in the core monsoon zone in India during periods of increased ENSO activity. During the later phase of the LIA, the study area received significant moisture during winter months as the winter precipitation over the Himalayan foothill region is largely controlled by the changes in the intensity of North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index.					; Jaiswal, Manoj/L-9967-2019; Kumar, Pankaj/M-8612-2015	Kaushik, Arun/0000-0002-5725-3418; Kumar, Pankaj/0000-0001-7050-582X													1040-6182	1873-4553				FEB 1	2025	718								109583	10.1016/j.quaint.2024.11.001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2024.11.001		JAN 2025											WOS:001411491100001

Speed of sound gradients due to summer thermal stratification can reduce the detection range of acoustic fish tags: results from a field study in Hamilton Harbour, Ontario	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Understanding detection range is a key factor for the use of acoustic telemetry in fisheries research. Lakes have strong seasonal changes in thermal stratification, as well as short-term changes due to internal seiches. These thermal gradients in lakes imply strong sound-speed gradients that can refract and diverge acoustic signals, leading to acoustic attenuation and smaller detection range. Using field-based range testing and the Bellhop acoustic model, we investigated how changes in stratification lead to changes in detection range within Hamilton Harbour, Ontario, Canada. During the summer stratified period, the detection range was less than 350 m, whereas in the isothermal fall, range was up to 500 m. Range test data from three separate field observations showed a good correlation with Bellhop predictions. Owing to the intense internal seiches in Hamilton Harbour, the stratification in the shallower littoral regions essentially switched between stratified and isothermal conditions over short timescales, which is predicted to lead to high temporal variability in detection range that must be accounted for during the analysis and interpretation of telemetry-derived data.					; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010	Semcesen, Patricia/0000-0002-3575-7172; Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659													0706-652X	1205-7533				MAR	2021	78	3					269	285		10.1139/cjfas-2020-0078	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2020-0078													WOS:000625880800007
J	Taylor, WD; Carter, JCH				Taylor, WD; Carter, JCH			Zooplankton size and its relationship to trophic status in deep Ontario lakes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We found the size distribution of crustacean zooplankton in deep (>20 m) oligotrophic to mesotrophic lakes in southern Ontario to be highly variable. Mean lengths varied from 0.48 to 1.12 mm. This difference is not strongly correlated to community composition at the genus to family level but is related to the presence of planktivores, cisco (Coregonus artedii) and Mysis relicta. Empirical analysis of our data demonstrates that mean zooplankton length is correlated to the residuals of the chlorophyll - summer total phosphorous relationship and also to the decline in total phosphorus from spring to summer. Our analysis suggests that zooplankton size distribution plays a significant role in determining the trophic status of these lakes, and we speculate that human alteration of fish communities may affect zooplankton size distribution and trophic status.

However, how environmental changes mediate the community structure and functional genes of nitrogen removal bacteria in lakes remain unclear. Using metagenome and amplicon sequencing, we investigated the anammox and denitrifying bacteria and their nitrogen removing potentials in lakes experiencing significant spatiotemporal and environmental variations. The community structure of anammox and denitrifying bacteria exhibited stronger lake-wide spatial variations than that of seasonality, while only the denitrification-related functional genes showed substantial variations in both lakes. Anammox genes (e.g., hzsA/B/C and hdh) showed no significant spatial variations. However, the abundances of anammox and denitrifying genes were significantly higher in winter than in summer. The mesotrophic Lake Weishan demonstrated a greater capacity for complete denitrification in winter, while the eutrophic Lake Donghu exhibited a higher potential of anammox in summer. Differences in functional gene abundances between lakes were more pronounced than variations in phylogenetic diversity, indicating clear functional adaptations to local environments. The coupled nitrogen removal potentials also reflected ecological interactions among anammox and denitrifying genes. Importantly, anammox and denitrifying bacterial communities and their functional genes were primarily driven by dissolved organic carbon, total phosphorous and zinc (Zn). The dissimilarities of anammox and denitrifying bacterial communities increased with geographic distance, indicating a clear distance-decay effect. This study highlights the anammox and denitrifying bacteria and their nitrogen removal potentials in lake sediments that are mediated by both spatial and seasonal environmental changes.

J	Kurczewski, FE				Kurczewski, FE			Comparison of spider wasp faunas from two ecologically distinct sites in Erie County, Pennsylvania (Hymenoptera: Pompilidae)	JOURNAL OF THE KANSAS ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY												Although separated by only 8-12 km, Presque Isle State Park and Wintergreen Gorge Cemetery, both in Erie County, Pennsylvania, have dissimilar elevation, climate, soils, and vegetation. Nonetheless, 46 (72%) of the 64 species of Pompilidae observed and collected in this 35 year-long study probably inhabited both localities. Six species were confined to Wintergreen Gorge Cemetery and upland Erie County, and 12 mostly psammophilous species were restricted to Presque Isle State Park and the lake plain. Thirty (47%) of the 64 species, including the vast majority of large spider wasps, had a univoltine life cycle. The univoltine species had distinct vernal. mid-summer and late summer-early fall flight seasons. Fifteen species of Pompilidae emerged as early as May at Wintergreen Gorge Cemetery. Several ground-nesting, bi- and multivoltine species emerged two to three weeks later but flew for three to four weeks longer on the lake plain. Late October and early November adult pompilid activity at Presque Isle State Park was probably related to the high heat capacity of Lake Erie.																			0022-8567					OCT	1999	72	4					339	360																WOS:000088819300001

To date, several reports regarding these outbreaks have been published, however a comprehensive study including geographical and time course validations has not been performed. Herein, 58 Japanese HPAI virus (HPAIV) isolates from the 2016-2017 season were added for phylogenetic analyses and the antigenic relationships among the causal viruses were elucidated. The locations where HPAIVs were found in the early phase of the outbreaks were clustered into three regions. Genotypes C1, C5, and C6-8 HPAIVs were found in specific areas. Two strains had phylogenetically distinct hemagglutinin (HA) and non-structural (NS) genes from other previously identified strains, respectively. The estimated latest divergence date between the viral genotypes suggests that genetic reassortment occurred in bird populations before their winter migration to Japan. Antigenic differences in 2016-2017 HPAIVs were not observed, suggesting that antibody pressure in the birds did not contribute to the selection of HPAIV genotypes. In the late phase, the majority of HPAI cases in wild birds occurred south of the lake freezing line. At the end of the outbreak, HPAI re-occurred in East coast region, which may be due to the spring migration route of Anas bird species. These trends were similar to those observed in the 2010-2011 outbreaks, suggesting there is a typical pattern of seeding and dissemination of HPAIV in Japan.

J	Wang, ZP; Han, XG				Wang, ZP; Han, XG			Diurnal variation in methane emissions in relation to plants and environmental variables in the Inner Mongolia marshes	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Plants and environmental variables are of importance for methane (CH4) emission from soils to the atmosphere. To understand the key factors controlling CH4 emission in temperate wetlands, we performed field measurements in the Inner Mongolia marshes to compare the diurnal CH4 fluxes between summer and winter, between a sandy site and an organic site, and between the wet meadow and the waterlogged habitat of each site. (i) In the summer, we found apparent diurnal patterns in CH4 emission with unique peaks. For the sandy site, temperatures and water table were mediated to some degree by solar radiation, and thus their overall effect was noted in a diurnal cycle of CH4 flux. Plant photosynthesis greatly affected the mechanisms of CH4 production, oxidation and transport, resulting in a diurnal variation of CH4 emission with a peak in the late afternoon and the lowest value immediately prior to sunrise of the next day. In the organic site, plant-mediated CH4 transport, together with the absence of a significant relationship between CH4 flux and environmental variables, indicated that diurnal CH4 flux was deter-mined by vascular plants. (ii) In the winter, we found slight double peaks in CH4 emissions in the sandy site but no diurnal variation rhythm in the organic site. The slight double peaks coincided with the maximal temperatures. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The index of relative importance (MI%) of each prey consumed varied within species. Diet diversity (Shannon-Wiener index, H') and diet breadth (Levins' standardized index, B') exhibited their highest values for almost all species in summer and in small size classes. Dietary overlap (Schoener's index, S) was higher between the different size classes of the same species. Cluster analysis, carried out on seasonal MI data, differentiated the following groups: (i) species feeding mainly on fish in all seasons (piscivorous), (ii) species feeding seasonally exclusively on zooplankton (zooplanktivorous), (iii) species with omnivorous feeding habits and preference in detritus and Chironomidae and (iv) omnivorous species that consumed mainly arthropods. Fish trophic niche widths were low, indicating a rather specialized feeding strategy for most species. The results will contribute to (a) understand species function in lake's food web, and (b) design commercial fisheries management strategies in the lake.					; Bobori, Dimitra/AAH-1625-2019; Michaloudi, Evangelia/AAS-4574-2021	Salvarina, Ioanna/0000-0002-9354-4095; Michaloudi, Evangelia/0000-0001-8194-2865; 													1790-045X	2241-5793					2013	19						139	149																WOS:000317256100017

Reproducibility across two summer interviews and one winter interview for estimates of seasonal and yearly intake of Great Lakes fish was moderate (intraclass correlation coefficients: .51-.61). Detailed questioning, by species, resulted in higher estimates of mean overall consumption (44.6-57.8 meals/y) than did asking about any fresh-water fish consumed (33.5-46.1; differences 5.1-15.7). Estimates based on the fish consumption frequency questionnaire (i.e., 6.2 +/- 2.0 meals per winter season) were comparable with those based on extrapolation from a 1-mo calendar (5.8 +/- 5.6); however, both estimates of consumption were far less than a weighed record (29.1 +/- 22.2). The results of this study suggest that measurement variation in fish consumption estimates should be detailed in research reports and should be discussed with respect to risk assessments.

Seasonal peaks of drift occurred in spring for 4 weeks following ice out and in autumn for 7-8 weeks from mid-September through ice formation, and may have continued under ice cover when our gear was not operated. These findings are consistent with the known movement pattern of these insects to fly from lentic habitats to streams to overwinter but also suggest longitudinal movement via drift, perhaps to reach specific overwintering sites. Drift was significantly correlated with declining water temperatures in 1989 but not in 1990. Most drift occurred at water temperatures less than 12-degrees-C. There was no correlation between drift and river discharge. Drift rates were consistently low with a maximum by volume of 9 animals per 10,000 m3.																			0090-0222					SUM	1992	25	2					85	89																WOS:A1992JN19800005

Several surface water samples from these wetlands were studied in two seasons (winter and summer) for various physico-chemical properties (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, electrical conductivity, alkalinity, major cations and anions) including trace metals. Water from all these wetlands are alkaline and show seasonally varying chemical composition. Hydrogeochemistry (Piper plot and Gibb's diagram) indicates that water from Bhalswa lake is Na+ - SO42- type and shows an evaporation dominance regime, whereas water from the other three wetlands is Na+ - SO42- and Ca2+ - Mg2+ - SO42- type, and show a dominance of rock-water interaction. The water quality index reveals that water from all the wetlands is poor to unsuitable for drinking. Concerning irrigation water quality, water from Bhalswa lake is unsuitable, whereas water from other wetlands is marginal to suitable. Both drinking and irrigational water quality deteriorate during summer. In light of the immense ecological importance of these wetlands, urgent measures are required to arrest their deteriorating health.					; Dixit, Arohi/IQT-2398-2023	JOSHI, PRERNA/0000-0002-3451-6211; Dixit, Arohi/0009-0002-0251-2387; 													0275-7540	1029-0370				FEB 7	2021	37	2					104	131		10.1080/02757540.2020.1836164	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02757540.2020.1836164		OCT 2020											WOS:000584034200001

Using high-resolution, high-frequency sampling, we provide an account of the distribution and movements of adult European grayling, Thymallus thymallus, in a recently colonised subarctic lake. We evaluated summer home range size, daily and seasonal patterns in vertical movement and vertical distribution of individuals relative to the summer thermocline. There was an allometric relationship between body size and home range area. Individuals showed diverse patterns of daily movement and some clear circadian cycles, likely mediated by light. All individuals that were monitored during the winter under ice were within 2m of the surface. Most fish associated with the thermocline during the period for which we were able to estimate its centre point. We propose that the patterns we observed are primarily driven by foraging opportunity and that foraging tactics differ between individuals and seasons.					; Vøllestad, Leif/H-7305-2019	Haugen, Thrond Oddvar/0000-0001-6562-5317; Vollestad, Leif Asbjorn/0000-0002-9389-7982; 													0906-6691	1600-0633				APR	2014	23	2			SI		149	160		10.1111/eff.12056	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12056													WOS:000332209100006
J	ELORANTA, P				ELORANTA, P			PAPER-CHROMATOGRAPHY AS A METHOD OF PHYTOPLANKTON COMMUNITY ANALYSIS	ANNALES BOTANICI FENNICI												The phytoplankton in a small, 7.5-m-deep, eutrophic lake was monitored from the beginning of March to October 1983, using microscopic, direct spectrophotometric and paper chromatographic methods. The phytoplankton community consisted mainly of green algae and diatoms together with cryptomonads, dinoflagellates and euglenophytes. The phytoplankton biomass had two maxima (60-70 mg chlorophyll a/m3), in late April and September. The summer biomass was 10-20 mg chl. a/m3. In the summer green algae dominated in the phytoplankton, but during the plankton maxima diatoms prevailed. The chromatography indicated that the main features of the phytoplankton community structure are reflected in the pigment composition, and it thus offers a rapid means of obtaining information on the physiological state of algae. The relative contribution of chlorophyll a to the total pigment extract was higher in rapidly increasing than in declining populations. The proportion of chlorophyll a was also higher in the dark season than in summer (40-50 and 25-35%, respectively). The carotenoids/chlorophyll a ratio increased from ca. 1 to 2.54 during the nutrient depletion and decline of biomass after the spring maximum in May. According to paper chromatography, phaeophytin a is much rarer in phytoplankton than is indicated by direct spectrophotometry after acidification. The other degradation products, such as chlorophyllides, which can be determined only by chromatography, was more common and abundant.																			0003-3847	1797-2442					1986	23	2					153	159																WOS:A1986C939100006

A taxonomic analysis of 171 phytoplankton samples obtained from Crater Lake, Oregon, between 1985 and 1987 revealed 132 taxa in the upper 250 m of the water column. The greatest temporal variation in taxonomic structure occurred between 40 and 80 m below the water surface, a depth range which corresponded to the zone of maximum primary production. 2. Phytoplankton cell biovolume in the upper 20 m of the water column was relatively high during the summer months, a period when Nitzschia gracilis was dominant in the epilimnion. However, 72% or more of the cell biovolume between 0 and 200 m was distributed below 20 m and, during the winter and spring months, 61% was found below 80 m. 3. Cluster analysis indentified a sparse, temporally ubiquitous flora which was modified to various degrees when environmental conditions became favourable for the growth of a few dominant taxa. These surges of dominance by individual taxa accounted for 2 to 5-fold increases in cell biovolume and generated a pronounced taxonomic discontinuity between the floras in the epilimnion and hypolimnion. 4. While the taxonomic structure of the phytoplankton in the epilimnion corresponded closely with the structure found in a 1978-80 study, the flora below the metalimnion was more diverse and less predictable in species composition than the pattern reported in the earlier study.																			0046-5070					FEB	1991	25	1					95	104		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1991.tb00476.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1991.tb00476.x													WOS:A1991FA88500010
J	JAMES, MF				JAMES, MF			HISTOLOGY OF GONADAL CHANGES IN THE BLUEGILL, LEPOMIS-MACROCHIRUS-RAFINESQUE, AND THE LARGEMOUTH BASS, HURO-SALMOIDES (LACEPEDE)	JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY												Largemouth bass at Fork Lake spawned during late Apr. and May while bluegills spawned from June to late Aug. Maturation occurred earlier in the gonads of the sexually mature bass than in the mature bluegills. In early spring, the lobules of the mature testes of both spp. were filled with cysts whose cells were dividing rapidly. Later large quantities of sperm were found. The spring increase in the wt. of the mature ovaries was due to increase in size of the eggs brought about by the deposition of yolk, and a decrease in size of the ovaries after spawning was followed by resorption of any unextruded mature eggs. The return of the ovary to prespawning size between fall and spring paralleled the development of the immature eggs. The bass seemed to spawn during a comparatively short period and different individuals varied but slightly in the time of spawning, whereas the bluegill spawned in a succession of partial extrusions. The bluegill spawned at the age of 1 yr. In the largemouth bass sperm were produced in the larger l-yr.-old [male] [male], but no [male] [male] produced mature eggs until 2 yrs. of age. There was a definite relationship between condition of gonads and condition of fish. The histologic changes of the gonads coincided very closely with changes in their gross anatomy during the different seasons.																			0362-2525	1097-4687					1946	79	1					63	91		10.1002/jmor.1050790104	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jmor.1050790104								20994834					WOS:A1946UV16400003

Because this benthic phase remains somewhat unknown, we developed an approach using flow cytometry to follow the esterase activity of this species in the Grangent reservoir. The esterase activity of benthic cyanobacteria extracted from two layers of sediment (0-2 cm and 2-4 cm deep) was measured weekly, as an indicator of viability, by flow cytometry with carboxyfluorescein diacetate. In parallel, the concentration of benthic cyanobacteria was estimated under epifluorescence microscopy and the water temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration were measured in the hypolimnion. Esterase activity increased gradually as spring temperatures increased. This metabolic reactivation allowed one part of the benthic cyanobacteria to regain the water column, entailing a simultaneous decrease of their number in the upper sediment (0-2 cm). Then, after a maximum in summer, esterase activity decreased while the number of colonies increased. This corresponded with the domination of the senescent planktonic form following the decline of the bloom.

RELATIONS BETWEEN ABIOTIC-PHYTOPLANKTON AND ZOOPLANKTON PARAMETERS IN 0-20 METER AREA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												At 1197 m in the French Massif Central, lake Pavin has a volcanic origin. It is a meromictic lake of 44 ha area and 98 m depth. Zooplankton samples (250 l) were collected bimonthly with a water pump from May 1973-April 1974 at 6 depths from the surface to 20 m. Countings were made to study the dynamics of 2 Cladocera (Daphnia longispina and Ceriodaphnia quadrangula), 2 copepode populations, the calanoide Acanthodiaptomus denticornis and the cyclopoide Cyclops abyssorum. For the last 2 spp., males, females, ovigerous females, nauplius larvae and each of the 5 copepodite stages were differentiated. If Cladocera have a period of development limited from June-Sept. for Ceriodaphnia and from June-Dec. for Daphnia, copepods are present all year, with 2 principal periods of reproduction. The 1st is during spring (March-April), and the 2nd is during fall (Oct.-Nov.). If this 2nd generation presents an important development for C. abyssorum, that is not the same for A. denticornis, in which species nauplius larvae died in winter. The synthetic mathematical model realized by principal components analysis illustrates the relationships between phyto- and zooplankton and bio-physico-chemical parameters and in this lake, the highest values of phytoplankton primary production and activity coefficient (production/standing crop) are found when herbivorous zooplankton presents the more important development and nutrients their lowest concentrations.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1980	68	1					17	34		10.1007/BF00009059	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00009059													WOS:A1980JD38400003

La Mancha Humeda Biosphere Reserve in central Spain has many inland wetlands of this type, but the driving ecological processes of species richness are poorly understood. This study examines the association of landscape and local variables with species richness patterns of inland wetlands of La Mancha Humeda Biosphere Reserve during winter and the breeding season. The number of lakes in several increasing radii was a proxy of connectivity, and maximum flooded surface and shoreline length were surrogates of the species-area relationship. Other landscape and local habitat variables, such as hydroperiod (length of inundation period), distance from human settlements, shoreline development index, vegetation surface cover, average lake depth, number of islands and surface area of islands were also analysed. Hierarchical partitioning analysis was used to evaluate the contribution of the environmental variables to explain the species richness of waders. Species richness (26 species, four threatened in Europe) had different associations with the variables during the wintering and breeding seasons. The richness of breeding and wintering species was positively associated with hydroperiod and maximum flooded surface area respectively. No variable measured was negatively associated with species richness in any season. Hydroperiod and flooded surface area are altered directly by human activities. Water extraction for irrigation reduces hydroperiod in some wetlands, whereas wastewater input extends hydroperiod in others, promoting wader concentrations in lakes flooded in summer and potentially favouring botulism outbreaks. In addition, the lack of protection and management on most of the lakes in La Mancha Humeda Biosphere Reserve also favours encroachment of agriculture, destroying and degrading habitat for wintering and breeding waders.

Water-quality variables and periphyton samples were collected on navigational buoys near Montreal during the spring, summer and fall of 1994 and 1995. Exposure to urban wastewater varied widely within the sector surrounding the island of Montreal, with some areas upstream receiving no direct effluents and areas further downstream receiving treated and untreated wastewater. Faecal coliform concentrations provided a good tracer of effluents and were significantly correlated to nutrient concentrations (r= 0.33-0.72, p < 0.001) and water transparency (r = 0.70, p < 0.001). Despite a strong gradient in faecal coliform concentration (< 2 to > 20 000 UFC/100 mi), algal biomass and diversity did not reflect differences between sites with varying levels of urban wastewater. Taxonomic composition of periphyton communities, particularly the presence of the cyanophyte Plectonema notatum Schmidle, was related (r = 0.48, p = 0.004) to exposure to urban effluents. Variables describing seasonal changes (temperature, Julian day, river discharge, conductivity, NO2-NO3) explained a large fraction of total variance (38-52% of total variance) and thus exerted the predominant influence on algal biomass and species composition in the St Lawrence River. Variables describing the presence of effluents explained 1-22% of the variance in compositional data. Subtle changes in periphyton species composition were the only response to different levels of exposure to urban wastewater in the Montreal area, which represented relatively small differences in comparison to natural seasonal variability.

Prefledging Growth and Recruitment of Female Lesser Scaup	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Annual variation in juvenile recruitment is an important component of duck population dynamics, yet little is known about the factors affecting the probability of surviving and breeding in the first year of life. Two hypothesized mechanisms to explain annual variability are indirect carry-over effects (COEs) from conditions experienced during the prefledging period and direct effects from climatic conditions during the postfledging period. We used Cormack-Jolly-Seber models to estimate apparent survival and detection rates of 643 juvenile female lesser scaup (Aythya affinis) marked just prior to fledging at Red Rock Lakes National Wildlife Refuge in southwestern Montana, USA, 2010-2018. We evaluated COEs from hatch date, a hatch date x spring phenology interaction, and conspecific duckling density in addition to a direct climatic effect of winter conditions (indexed by the El Nino Southern Oscillation [ENSO]) and spring habitat conditions on the study area. We used growth data from a subset (n = 190) of known-aged ducklings to estimate the influence of hatch date and conspecific density on prefledging growth to help identify mechanisms underlying COEs. Prefledging growth and juvenile apparent survival were negatively related to measures of conspecific duckling density. We found evidence that detection probability varied annually for juvenile (but not adult) scaup, possibly representing decisions to delay breeding and not return to or remain at the study site in their first year of life. Like with apparent survival, there was suggestive evidence that detection probability decreased with increasing duckling density in the previous year. Hatching date was weakly negatively related to detection probability, but unrelated to apparent survival, whereas neither vital rate was related to winter ENSO index. Our results are consistent with a process where density-dependent growth rates in the prefledging period carry over to influence fitness in subsequent life-cycle stages. If this pattern generalizes to other systems, this density COE may have important implications for our understanding of duck population dynamics and reaffirms the importance of maintaining abundant brood-rearing habitats in conservation and management of ducks.

J	BAIRLEIN, F				BAIRLEIN, F			HABITAT SELECTION AND ASSOCIATIONS OF SPECIES IN EUROPEAN PASSERINE BIRDS DURING SOUTHWARD, POST-BREEDING MIGRATIONS	ORNIS SCANDINAVICA												From 1972-1978 more than 46,000 birds of 36 sp. were investigated during their autumn passage (late June to early Nov.) at the west end of Lake Constance, Germany. Each species investigated was characterized by a species-specific distribution of habitats in which it was caught at the field station site. These patterns of trapping were highly consistent from year to year and represent species-specific habitat preferences. Cluster analysis resulted in groupings of species which associated with each habitat. Groups comprised of species of diverse genera fell into groups associated with distinct habitats. Some species, particularly late migrating, insectivorous species, show within-season shifts of habitat preference that can be related to changes in food supply. Comparisons of the habitat distributions of juveniles and adults suggest that the species-specific selection of habitat is largely innate, because little modification occurs in association with age-related learning.																			0030-5693						1983	14	3					239	245		10.2307/3676157	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3676157													WOS:A1983RE68400009

J	Xu, QR; Zhou, LZ; Xia, SS; Zhou, J				Xu, Qingru; Zhou, Lizhi; Xia, Shanshan; Zhou, Jian			Impact of Urbanisation Intensity on Bird Diversity in River Wetlands around Chaohu Lake, China	ANIMALS												Simple Summary The continuous intensification of urbanisation has led to severe degradation and loss of bird habitats, directly affecting the diversity of birds. In this study, we focused on seven representative river wetlands around Chaohu Lake (China) to analyse the impact of urbanisation on bird diversity. The species richness at sections of the lake entrance was higher than in the middle sections of the river, and the Shannon-Wiener index during autumn was higher than that during winter. Urbanisation was an important driving factor that changed land use types near rivers and the structure of bird communities. The response model of river ecological indicators to the intensity of urbanisation shows a negative exponential correlation between the waterbird diversity index and the urbanisation intensity. Our research is of great significance for future urban landscape planning and bird community diversity protection. Urbanisation is known to result in 'urban stream syndrome', which poses a huge threat to the river health. Birds, which are an important part of the river ecosystem, are sensitive to environmental changes in the basin. The ratio of the impervious surface area is a macroscopic indicator of urbanisation intensity in river basins. In this study, we combined the results of a year-round field survey of seven river wetlands around Chaohu Lake (China) with satellite remote sensing image data from the same period. The species richness at sections of the lake entrance was higher than in the middle sections of the river, and the Shannon-Wiener index during autumn was higher than that during winter. The waterbird diversity index declined exponentially with increases in the intensity of urbanisation. The changes in the land use patterns around river wetlands associated with urbanisation resulted in the loss of food resources and habitats. Therefore, the intensity of urbanisation was an important driving factor that leads to changes in the bird community structure of river wetlands, so it had a significant impact on the diversity of river wetland birds in all four seasons combined with a variety of influencing factors. Our research could be a guide for urban landscape planning and bird diversity protection. For example, the results suggested that it is necessary to identify river wetlands as an important part of the urban ecosystem, reduced building area, increased vegetation coverage, and retained slope protection and river beach land.

J	Kumar, S; Finlay, JC; Sterner, RW				Kumar, Sanjeev; Finlay, Jacques C.; Sterner, Robert W.			Isotopic composition of nitrogen in suspended particulate matter of Lake Superior: implications for nutrient cycling and organic matter transformation	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Lake Superior, one of the largest lakes in the world, is an ecosystem where nitrate (NO(3) (-)) concentration has risen almost fivefold in the last century. Recent studies suggest that this increase may be due to lack of a significant nitrogen (N) sink, such as sedimentary denitrification or burial, because of low organic matter supply to the lake bottom. In light of these new findings, it is imperative to examine the origin and transformation of suspended particulate organic matter (POM) in the lake as N biogeochemistry is inextricably linked to POM dynamics. We present an analysis of spatial and temporal variations in delta(15)Ie of POM (delta(15)Ie(POM)) in the lake and draining rivers based on extensive sampling and a synthesis of recent studies of N cycling. The delta(15)Ie(POM) in the lake ranged from -4.7 to 7.6aEuro degrees and showed a significant (p < 0.001) temporal variability in the surface waters with relatively enriched delta(15)Ie during winter (mean +/- A SD similar to 1.5 +/- A 2.3aEuro degrees; n = 13) compared to summer (mean +/- A SD similar to -2.0 +/- A 1.4aEuro degrees; n = 20). Temporal variability in delta(15)Ie(POM) and data for delta(15)Ie of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) together suggest a seasonal shift in nutrient sources for plankton along with possible detrital and higher trophic level contributions to POM during winter. On an annual basis, ammonium (NH(4) (+)) appears to be the dominant N source to plankton in the lake. NO(3) (-) use was lower but seasonally variable with higher contributions to plankton in summer than winter. During a period of high riverine discharge, no significant difference in coastal and open-lake delta(15)Ie(POM) was found, indicating limited effect of riverine POM on the lake. Significant increase in delta(15)Ie(POM) and decreases in particulate N concentration with depth indicate transformations of organic matter settling to the lake bottom that are consistent with the hypothesized influence of low organic matter supply to the lake bottom leading to limited benthic denitrification.					; Finlay, Jacques/B-6081-2011	Sterner, Robert/0000-0003-2292-6122; Finlay, Jacques/0000-0002-7968-7030													0168-2563					APR	2011	103	1-3					1	14		10.1007/s10533-010-9441-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-010-9441-6													WOS:000287750100001

Increases in hypolimnetic concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and ammonium-nitrogen were the most striking changes in water chemistry. After a few months, high densities of ciliates were recorded in the hypolimnion, suggesting an increased microbial activity in the decomposition of fish carcasses. Correspondingly, hypolimnetic bacterial biomasses in summer 1993 were higher than earlier. In crustacean zooplankton: the densities of planktonic cladocerans were lower in the fishless side of the lake in summer 1993 than before the fish kill in the previous summer. The decline in cladocerans was probably due to predation by the rapidly increased numbers of Chaoborus larvae and corixids after the disappearance of fish. The mean biomass of zoobenthos also increased following the fish kill. The remaining perch in the control basin started to grow very rapidly. Instead of the normal length increase of 1-2 cm per year, they grew 5-7 cm in the summer of 1993 and their weight increased ten times more than that of perch of the limed basin of the lake. The mercury concentrations and radioactivity of the perch showed a 50% decrease, probably due to the growth dilution. A behavioural change in the golden-eye, Bucephala clangula, was also recorded. The breeding individuals continued to use both basins of L. Iso Valkjarvi, but the brood clearly preferred the control basin after the collapse of the perch population.

Gross release rates were 15, 21, 33, and 100 mg P m-2 d-1 (average summer values). In three of the lakes, water temperature alone explained approximately 70% of the seasonal variation in sediment P release. Long-term experiments with undisturbed sediment cores revealed that the P release was significantly influenced by temperature and NO3- in all four lakes, but by pH only in one lake when these three parameters varied within the normal seasonal range (temperature: 0-degrees-21-degrees-C; NO3-: 0-200-mu-M; pH: 7.5-10.5). Q10 values for the temperature effect were between 4.1 and 6.8 in the three lakes with large proportions of Fe-bound P in the sediment, but only 3.5 in the lake in which the P pool was relatively small. The thickness of the oxidized layer at the sediment surface varied from 3 to 15 mm and decreased when temperature increased. High NO3- concentrations increased the thickness throughout the season and accordingly sediment P release was reduced in winter and early summer. Meanwhile, in late summer when inorganic N was depleted in lake water, NO3- additions increased the P release from sediment, probably by stimulating the mineralization process.																			0024-3590					MAY	1992	37	3					577	589		10.4319/lo.1992.37.3.0577	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1992.37.3.0577													WOS:A1992JH23500010

This work aims to study the temporal and spatial distribution of plastics in sediments from three different Tunisian ecosystems; Rimel Beach, Bizerta lagoon and Ichkeul lake. Sediment sampling was conducted in surface (2 cm) and depth (15 cm) during spring, summer and winter. Plastics debris were separated by size fractions: macro (>5 mm), meso (1-5 mm) and microplastics (<1 mm) to optimize the time necessary for their characterisation. Macroplastics and mesoplastics were identified using an IR Attenuated total reflectance (ATR) and microplastics with Imaging Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectroscopy after an optimized extraction protocol. Results indicate that, the lowest contamination degree with macroplastics was recorded in Ichkeul lake, 2 macro debris/m(2) (marinc pmtected area, national pare of Ichkeul). Mesoparticles were only detected in lagoon of Bizerte in large quantities (4900 item/kg of sediment in surface and 680 item/kg of sediment in depth) and were identified principally as paint pmducts. For microplastics, the repartition was quite homogeneous between the three sites with an average abundance was 130.55 +/- 65.61 items/kg for all seasons. The variations of microplastics abundances on the three sites could not be clearly related to the seasons. Whereas the polymer characterisation in the surface and depth sediments of the throe studied areas were principally due to eight types of polymers (PVC, PET, PP, PE PS, Polyamide (PA) and polymeric methyl methacrylate (PMMA)) as reported in many other studies, surprisingly all MPs recovered in the study were smaller than 300 mu m, >70 % being fragments. This study brings new results as regards to the state of plastic contamination in Tunisian coast and shows the importance of investigating different ecosystems in such studies.

Algal Community Composition from Kaolin Recovery Ponds Located in Middle Georgia	SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST												This is the first floristic and ecological evaluation of small pond systems developed over different periods of time after seized kaolin mining operations. Assessment of the total algal assemblage was used to infer environmental conditions of the aquatic habitats and also provided information about the ecological health and integrity of the aquatic ecosystems. The main objectives of this study were to document algal community composition and discern the amount of time it takes for a mined pond to reach its high biodiversity of primary producers. Winter and summer samples were taken from a pond developing for two years after removal of kaolin and from a pond that was thirty years old. Both pond systems contained rich algal communities predominantly from Cyanobacteria, Bacillariophyta, and Chlorophyta; however, the 30-year pond had higher Shannon-Wiener diversity, richness, and evenness values in both sampling seasons. In winter, filamentous Zygnematales dominated algal communities in the 2-year pond, while the 30-year pond community was dominated by diatoms. In both sites, the most taxon-rich group was green algal representatives of Desmidiaceae. In summer, potentially toxin-producing filamentous Cyanobacteria of the Nostocales were recorded in the 2-year pond, while the 30-year pond had higher average algal cell evenness and few toxic Nostocales. The average abundance of 11 diatom species, seven green algae, and one representative each of Euglenophyta, Cyanobacteria, and Cryptophyta resulted in less than 20 percent overall similarity between the two ponds. Our findings suggest that after two years of development potentially harmful kaolin residues are removed by natural sorption processes and do not negatively influence primary producers. However, stabilization processes in those manmade ecosystems may potentially take more than two years to produce high species richness and prevent toxic algal blooms.

Host and seasonal distribution of fish acanthocephalans from the lake Biwa Basin, Japan	COMPARATIVE PARASITOLOGY												Six species of acanthocephalans were collected from 30 of 62 surveyed species of fish in Lake Biwa, the most ancient lake in Japan, and from various water bodies in the lake's drainage basin including the Seta and Daido Rivers. The 3 most common species were Acanthocephalus opsariichthydis Yamaguti, 1935 (8 new host records), Echinorhynchus cotti Yamaguti. 1935 (7 new host records), and Pseudorhadinorhynchus samegaiensis Nakajima and Egusa, 1975 (7 new host records; perhaps endemic to Lake Biwa and its basin). The latter 2 species were found only in the spring. Specimens of both species were also found in Gymnogobius isaza (Tanaka, 1916) in the autumn. Gravid females of all 3 species were found in the spring. Developed cystacanths of Southwellina hispida (Van Cleave, 1925) Witenberg. 1932 were also collected (5 new host records). Anatomical similarities between these species and the original descriptions are clearly evident, but differences in certain key characteristics are noted.

The objective of this paper is to characterize the water balance of this watershed using the Thornthwaite & Mather method. All the information required for this modelling is derived from climatological and remotely-sensed physical data. The calibration carried out over one hydrological year provided a Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of 0.88. Annually, the average runoff into Ba 136 Lake is nearly 800 mm, while seasonally, 82% of the runoff occurs during summer. In general, the monthly runoff is underestimated in winter and overestimated in summer, while the simulated annual runoff is more accurately reproduced. A sensitivity analysis showed that the two-parameter Thornthwaite & Mather model was less sensitive to the maximum available water content (A WC) than the fraction of soil water (lambda) coming from the previous month's water surplus.																			0262-6667	2150-3435				AUG	2007	52	4					654	670		10.1623/hysj.52.4.654	http://dx.doi.org/10.1623/hysj.52.4.654													WOS:000248730300005
J	PRISCU, JC; GOLDMAN, CR				PRISCU, JC; GOLDMAN, CR			SEASONAL DYNAMICS OF THE DEEP-CHLOROPHYLL MAXIMUM IN CASTLE LAKE, CALIFORNIA	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Vertical profiles of chlorophyll concentration measured during 1980 in Castle Lake showed that a deep maximum developed immediately after ice thaw and persisted in the deep basin of the lake until autumn overturn. In the early portion of the ice-free season, low epilimnetic turbidity allows enough light to reach this deep-chlorophyll layer to produce a deep-primary productivity maximum. Photoautotrophic growth appears to maintain the deep-chlorophyll maximum early in the season whereas the accumulation of sinking organisms appears to do so later in the season. Although the deep-water phytoplankton have reduced rates of photosynthesis late in the season, they maintain their ability to photosynthesize immediately upon exposure to light. Consequently, the redistribution of deepwater chlorophyll at fall overturn can increase the chlorophyll concentration of the euphotic zone (0-15 m) by 58% which can potentially increase primary productivity in this zone by 81%.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1983	40	2					208	214		10.1139/f83-031	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f83-031													WOS:A1983QC08800013
J	Massé, S; Botrel, M; Walsh, DA; Maranger, R				Masse, Stephanie; Botrel, Morgan; Walsh, David A.; Maranger, Roxane			Annual nitrification dynamics in a seasonally ice-covered lake	PLOS ONE												We investigated the variability in ammonia oxidation (AO) rates and the presence of ammonia-oxidizing archaea and bacteria (AOB and AOA) over an annual cycle in the water column of a small, seasonnally ice covered, temperate shield lake. AO, the first step of nitrification, was measured in situ using N-15-labelled ammonium (NH4+) at 1% and 10% of photosynthetic active radiation during day and at the same depths during night. AO was active across seasons and light levels, ranging from undetectable to 333 nmol L-1 d(-1) with peak activity in winter under ice cover. NH4+ concentration was the single most important positive predictor of AO rates. High NH4+ concentrations and reduced chlorophyll a concentrations under ice, which favoured AO, were coherent with high nitrate concentrations and super saturation in nitrous oxide. When targeting the ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) gene in samples from the photic zone, we found AOA to be omnipresent throughout the year while AOB were observed predominantly during winter. Our results demonstrate that AO is an ongoing process in sunlit surface waters of temperate lakes and at all seasons with pronounced nitrification activity observed during winter under ice. The combination of high NH4+ concentrations due to fall overturn, reduced light availability that limited phytoplankton competition, and the presence of AOB together with AOA apparently favoured these elevated rates under ice. We suggest that lake ice could be a control point for nitrification in oli-gotrophic temperate shield lakes, characterized as a moment and place that exerts disproportionate influence on the biogeochemical behaviour of ecosystems.					; Botrel, Morgan/HCH-3627-2022; Maranger, Roxane/HLH-6435-2023	Botrel, Morgan/0000-0001-6313-8996; 													1932-6203					MAR 20	2019	14	3							e0213748	10.1371/journal.pone.0213748	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0213748								30893339					WOS:000461765900049

Sixty-one recaptures of live birds or recoveries of dead birds (together termed "encounters") banded at these stations and recaptures at these stations of birds banded elsewhere occurred during this period. The farthest. saw-whet owl encountered was 2315 km from the banding station (Last Mountain Lake, Saskatchewan, to Hebron, Pennsylvania). Almost half of the encounter locations were east or southeast of the associated banding site. The overall average speed of within-season travel was 37 km/night; however, the average speed of eastward movements was 81 km/night (n = 9). Of 19 within-season (mid-August to mid-December) encounters, hatch-year females en = 11) travelled farther (615 km +/- 464.9) than after-hatch-year females (n = 5; 110 km +/- 33.6; P = 0.047). Three owls apparently overwintered in Alberta and Saskatchewan. During the nonbreeding season, saw-whet owls in Alberta and Saskatchewan may employ more than one movement strategy, including migration, overwintering in the region, and possible nomadism, which suggests that the species is a variable partial migrant. Birds banded at Alberta stations had more southward encounters than those banded at Saskatchewan stations, which were encountered mostly to the southeast, suggesting that autumn movements of saw-whet, owl are influenced by the presence of suitable forested habitat.																			0892-1016	2162-4569				DEC	2010	44	4					300	310		10.3356/JRR-09-25.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.3356/JRR-09-25.1													WOS:000285441200006

Expected Climate Change in the High Arctic-Good or Bad for Arctic Charr?	FISHES												Lakes in the High Arctic are characterized by their low water temperature, long-term ice cover, low levels of nutrients, and low biodiversity. These conditions mean that minor climatic changes may be of great importance to Arctic freshwater organisms, including fish, by influencing vital life history parameters such as individual growth rates. In this study, Arctic charr sampled from two Svalbard lakes (78-79 degrees N) over the period 1960-2008 provided back-calculated length-at-age information extending over six decades, covering both warm and cold spells. The estimated annual growth in young-of-the-year (YOY) Arctic charr correlated positively with an increasing air temperature in summer. This increase is likely due to the higher water temperature during the ice-free period, and also to some extent, due to the winter air temperature; this is probably due to thinner ice being formed in mild winters and the subsequent earlier ice break-up. However, years with higher snow accumulation correlated with slower growth rates, which may be due to delayed ice break-up and thus a shorter summer growing season. More than 30% of the growth in YOY charr could be explained specifically by air temperature and snow accumulation in the two Arctic charr populations. This indicated that juvenile Svalbard Arctic charr may experience increased growth rates in a future warmer climate, although future increases in precipitation may contradict the positive effects of higher temperatures to some extent. In the longer term, a warmer climate may lead to the complete loss of many glaciers in western Svalbard; therefore, rivers may dry out, thus hindering migration between salt water and fresh water for migratory fish. In the worst-case scenario, the highly valuable and attractive anadromous Arctic charr populations could eventually disappear from the Svalbard lake systems.

Forest lakes are abundant in these regions and substantial contributors of methane emissions. To investigate the effect of reduced snow cover, we experimentally removed snow from an anoxic frozen lake. We observed that the removal of snow increased light penetration through the ice, increasing water temperature and modifying microbial composition in the different depths. Chlorophyll a and b concentrations increased in the upper water column, suggesting activation of algal primary producers. At the same time, Chlorobiaceae, one of the key photosynthetic bacterial families in anoxic lakes, shifted to lower depths. Moreover, a decrease in the relative abundance of methanotrophs within the bacterial family Methylococcaceae was detected, concurrent with an increase in methane concentration in the water column. These results indicate that decreased snow cover impacts both primary production and methane production and/or consumption, which may ultimately lead to increased methane emissions after spring ice off. IMPORTANCE Small lakes are an important source of greenhouse gases in the boreal zone. These lakes are severely impacted by the winter season, when ice and snow cover obstruct gas exchange between the lake and the atmosphere and diminish light availability in the water column. Currently, climate change is resulting in reduced spring snow cover. A short-term removal of the snow from the ice stimulated algal primary producers and subsequently heterotrophic bacteria. Concurrently, the relative abundance of methanotrophic bacteria decreased and methane concentrations increased. Our results increase the general knowledge of microbial life under ice and, specifically, the understanding of the potential impact of climate change on boreal lakes.					; Székely, Anna/J-5876-2018; Garcia, Sarahi/H-4365-2014; Garcia, Sarahi L./H-4365-2014	Peura, Sari/0000-0003-3892-8157; Garcia, Sarahi L./0000-0002-8622-0308														2379-5042				JAN-FEB	2019	4	1							e00626-18	10.1128/mSphere.00626-18	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/mSphere.00626-18								30626619					WOS:000460444700033
J	Stapleton, HM; Skubinna, J; Baker, JE				Stapleton, HM; Skubinna, J; Baker, JE			Seasonal dynamics of PCB and toxaphene bioaccumulation within a Lake Michigan food web	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Seasonal variations in PCB and toxaphene concentrations were measured in bulk zooplankton, mysid shrimp, benthic amphipods, alewife, and bloater chub collected from Grand Traverse Bay, Lake Michigan between April and September of 1997 and 1998. Concentrations of PCBs in the dissolved phase of the water column were consistent over time; however, seasonal changes in contaminant concentrations within the biota were significant. Seasonal changes were most pronounced in zooplankton, which displayed highest PCB burdens in April and decreased by as much as 75% through September, coincident with changes in phytoplankton biomass, species composition, and changes in the particulate pools of PCBs within the water column. Mysis sp. display a similar PCB trend as zooplankton, while Diporeia sp. displayed maximal PCB concentrations in late summer during 1997. PCB trends in the primary forage fish alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) and bloater (Coregonus hoyi) were correlated more to shifts in lipid content and seasonal diet preferences. PCB concentrations were higher (p < 0.01) in bloater (310 +/- 98 ng/g wet weight) than alewife (233 +/- 70 ng/g wet weight), however alewife possessed higher toxaphene burdens (198 +/- 72 ng/g wet weight) than bloater (88 +/- 36 ng/g wet weight). Alewife contaminant burdens were high in spring and fall of both years, decreasing by as much as 60% in midsummer, and were reflective of changes measured in their lipid content associated with gamete production and spawning. These results suggest that despite invariant concentrations of the dissolved Pool of PCBs within the lake, accumulation of PCBs by the biota on seasonal scales is controlled appreciably by growth and lipid dynamics, and foraging behavior.

The Rongcheng Lake is an important wintering ground for migratory birds in Central Asia, especially for whooper swans Cygnus cygnus. In this study, we investigated the numbers and behaviours of the whooper swans in the different habitats of the Swan Lake from November in 2015 to April in 2016, collected 72 water samples in the estuaries, and carried out food addition experiments in order to analyse the behavioural responses and adaptability of the whooper swans to the changing environment. Our results showed that the dominant behaviour of the whooper swans was resting, followed by feeding and locomotion and the whooper swans mainly distributed in the beach, estuary, and lagoon. Moreover, their distributions were affected by fresh water and food availability, whereas the human disturbance played an important role in their distributions and behavioural variations. To adapt to the changing environment, different wintering strategies were adopted by the whooper swans during the different overwintering period. The estuary protection and human feeding were very vital tools to help the whooper swans adjust their body to prepare for migrating next year.						liu, yu hong/0000-0002-7302-843X													1936-0584	1936-0592				OCT	2018	11	7							e2013	10.1002/eco.2013	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eco.2013													WOS:000446431200028
J	Millett, B; Johnson, WC; Guntenspergen, G				Millett, Bruce; Johnson, W. Carter; Guntenspergen, Glenn			Climate trends of the North American prairie pothole region 1906-2000	CLIMATIC CHANGE												The Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) is unique to North America. Its millions of wetlands and abundant ecosystem goods and services are highly sensitive to wide variations of temperature and precipitation in time and space characteristic of a strongly continental climate. Precipitation and temperature gradients across the PPR are orthogonal to each other. Precipitation nearly triples from west to east from approximately 300 mm/year to 900 mm/year, while mean annual temperature ranges from approximately 1A degrees C in the north to nearly 10A degrees C in the south. Twentieth-century weather records for 18 PPR weather stations representing 6 ecoregions revealed several trends. The climate generally has been getting warmer and wetter and the diurnal temperature range has decreased. Minimum daily temperatures warmed by 1.0A degrees C, while maximum daily temperatures cooled by 0.15A degrees C. Minimum temperature warmed more in winter than in summer, while maximum temperature cooled in summer and warmed in winter. Average annual precipitation increased by 49 mm or 9%. Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) trends reflected increasing moisture availability for most weather stations; however, several stations in the western Canadian Prairies recorded effectively drier conditions. The east-west moisture gradient steepened during the twentieth century with stations in the west becoming drier and stations in the east becoming wetter. If the moisture gradient continues to steepen, the area of productive wetland ecosystems will shrink. Consequences for wetlands would be especially severe if the future climate does not provide supplemental moisture to offset higher evaporative demand.																			0165-0009	1573-1480				MAR	2009	93	1-2					243	267		10.1007/s10584-008-9543-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-008-9543-5													WOS:000263523300013
J	Alvo, R; Blomme, C; Weseloh, DV				Alvo, R; Blomme, C; Weseloh, DV			Double-crested Cormorants, Phalacrocorax auritus, at inland lakes north of Lake Huron, Ontario	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												Three long-term data sets were used to document the use of inland lakes north of Lake Huron by Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus). After the first reported sighting in the Sudbury Region in 1971, the species was observed regularly from 1979 onwards. It was not a summer resident in the area until 1987 and noteworthy multiple numbers were not reported until 1991. These non-breeding birds may have originated as spring migratory "overshoots" from Georgian Bay, Lake Huron; birds observed in the autumn were probably migratory stragglers from farther north. It is unlikely that they came from the east or west because present day colonies there were not active yet. The only two known breeding sites in the region are at Kelley Lake and Lake Wanapitei. Breeding at Kelley Lake began in 1996; in Lake Wanapitei, breeding was confirmed in 1999, but may have begun earlier. These sightings represent the earliest movements of cormorants away from the Great Lakes since their resurgence there, and these birds may establish breeding sites at small inland lakes in this area. These movements into the Sudbury Region are not to be confused with daily foraging flights to inland lakes which are seen within several kilometres of the Great Lakes. Further research is required to study what impact cormorants might have on inland lake ecosystems and to determine whether cormorants are seen with increased frequency elsewhere in the Great Lakes watershed.																			0008-3550					JUL-SEP	2002	116	3					359	365																WOS:000182545900001

Development and Use of a Method for the Determination of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon and Organochlorine Pesticide Concentrations in Freshly Fallen Snow	POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC COMPOUNDS												An analytical method was developed and validated for the quantitative analysis of 18 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and 57 organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and degradation products in 5kg samples of freshly fallen snow, using Oasis HLB solid-phase extraction (SPE) with quantitation by Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectroscopy (GC/MS). The Estimated Detection Limits (EDLs) for PAHs ranged from 53 +/- 1 pg/L-SWE to 222 +/- 3 pg/L-SWE, while the EDLs for pesticides ranged from 5 +/- 0.1 pg/L-SWE to 750 +/- 5 pg/L-SWE, with most relative standard deviations (RSDs) below 8%. Mean analyte recovery for the entire analytical method was 63% +/- 11% for OCPs and 47% +/- 11% for PAHs. The method was applied to samples of freshly fallen, pre-metamorphic snow collected from two remote alpine sites of similar altitude and exposure in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon, USA during the winter of 2012-2013. PAHs were detected in freshly fallen snow at concentrations of 1.3-2.2ng/L of snow water equivalents (SWE). The pesticides dacthal, alpha-HCH and chlorpyrifos were detected at concentrations of 45-220 pg/L SWE. Spatial analysis showed statistically significant between-site differences in alpha-HCH, dacthal, fluorine, and fluoranthene concentrations, indicating variability in persistent organic pollutant (POP) deposition on the 10km scale.																			1040-6638	1563-5333				JAN 1	2015	35	1			SI		57	73		10.1080/10406638.2014.910239	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10406638.2014.910239													WOS:000344866600006

Sedimentation was the most important algal loss in spring when colonial diatoms and calanoid copepods dominated the plankton. Grazing was the most important loss during summer when phytoflagellates and Daphnia spp. dominated. Comparisons between algal community production and loss due to sedimentation and grazing suggest that natural mortality may be significant, but it does not dominate control.

J	Jones, JB; Mulholland, PJ				Jones, JB; Mulholland, PJ			Influence of drainage basin topography and elevation on carbon dioxide and methane supersaturation of stream water	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												The partial pressures of CO2 (pCO(2)) and CH4 (pCH(4)) in streams rue not only governed by instream processes, but also by transformations occurring in soil and groundwater ecosystems. As such, stream water pCO(2) and pCH(4) can provide a tool to assess ecosystem respiration and anaerobic metabolism throughout drainage basins. We conducted three surveys sampling the gas content of streams in eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina to assess factors regulating ecosystem metabolism in catchments with contrasting geomorphologies, elevations and soil organic matter storage. In our first survey, the influence of drainage basin geomorphology on ecosystem respiration was examined by sampling streams draining catchments underlain by either shale or dolomite. Geomorphology is influenced by geology with shale catchments having shallower soils, broader, unconstrained valley floors compared with dolomite catchments. pCO(2) varied little between catchment types but increased from an average of 3340 ppmv in spring to 9927 ppmv in summer or 9.3 and 28 times atmospheric equilibrium (pCO(2(equilib))), respectively. In contrast, pCH(4) was over twice as high in streams draining shale catchments (306 ppmv; pCH(4(equilib)) = 116) compared with more steeply incised dolomite basins (130 ppmv; pCH(4(equilib)) = 51). Using the ratio of pCH(4):pCO(2) as an index of anaerobic metabolism, shale catchments had nearly twice as much anaerobiosis (pCH(4):pCO(2) = 0.046) than dolomite drainages (pCH(4):pCO(2) = 0.024). In our second survey, streams were sampled along an elevational gradient (525 to 1700 m) in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, USA where soil organic matter storage increases with elevation. pCO(2) did not vary between streams but increased from 5340 ppmv (pCO(2(equilib)) = 15) to 8565 ppmv (pCO(2(equilib)) = 24) from spring to summer, respectively. During spring pCH(4) was low and constant across streams, but during summer increased with elevation ranging from 17 to 2068 ppmv (pCH(4(equilib)) = 10 to 1216). The contribution of anaerobiosis to total respiration was constant during spring (pCH(4):pCO(2) = 0.017) but during summer increased with elevation from 0.002 at 524 m to 0.289 at 1286 m. In our last survey, we examined how pCO(2) and pCH(4) changed with catchment size along two rivers (ca. 60 km stretches in both rivers corresponding to increases in basin size from 1.7-477 km(2) and 2.5-275 km(2)). pCO(2) and pCH(4) showed opposite trends, with pCO(2) decreasing ca. 50% along the rivers, whereas pCH(4) roughly doubled in concentration downstream. These opposing shifts resulted in a nearly five-fold increase of pCH(4):pCO(2) along the rivers from a low of 0.012 in headwaters to a high of 0.266 65-km downstream. pCO(2) likely declines moving downstream as groundwater influences on stream chemistry decreases, whereas pCH(4) may increase as the prevalence of anoxia in rivers expands due to finer-grained sediments and reduced hydrologic exchange with oxygenated surface water.

The spatial interpolation method, known as kriging, was used with the following forcing parameters: the geographical coordinates, elevation of the terrain, and percentage share of lakes and sea. Homogenised data was used, and thus the most important factor affecting the accuracy of the interpolated data was the uneven distribution of the available observation stations both in time and space. The uncertainty due to the homogenisation adjustments made earlier was notably smaller. In the mid-1800s, the uncertainty in the annual and seasonal mean temperatures was large, with a maximum in winter of over +/-2.0 degrees C, but the accuracy improved quickly with time as the number of the observation stations increased. At the beginning of the 20th century, the uncertainty related to the limited station network was less than +/-0.2 degrees C, in winter less than +/-0.4 degrees C. According to the data, the rise in Finland's annual mean temperature has been statistically significant during the last 100, 50 and 30 years. During the last 100 years the increase in the mean temperature was largest during spring, but during the last 50 years winters have warmed up the most. The temperature time series obtained are compatible with grid point values picked from the global temperature data grids starting from the 1880s, though the global data sets tend to smooth the extremes.

The contaminant removal rate (CRR) and the contaminant removal capacity (CRC) were used as water self-purification parameters. The CRR was calculated as the difference between contaminant mass flow rates at downstream and upstream gauging stations. The CRC was calculated as the quotient of the CRR and the change in water discharge between downstream and upstream gauging stations. Whether the CRR and CRC have positive or negative values depends on whether contaminant release or removal occurs in the water body. The CRR depends on the size of the water body. The lowest and the highest CRRs observed for Baikal were equal to -15 mg/s (PAHs) to -7327 g/s (DOC), whereas the highest PAH and DOC removal rates observed for Selenga River (the major Baikal tributary) in summer were equal to -9 mg/s and -3190 g/s correspondingly. The highest PAH and DOC removal rates observed for small tributaries were equal to 0.0004 mg/s and -0.7 g/s respectively. The amplitude of annual CRR oscillations depends on contaminant abundance. The highest amplitude was typical for most abundant contaminants such as N-min. and DOC. In unpolluted sections of the Selenga River the highest rates of N and C removal (-85 g/s and -3190 g/s, respectively) were observed in summer and the lowest rates (4 g/s and 3869 g/s, respectively) were observed in the spring. The lowest amplitude was typical for PAHs and some low-abundance TM such as V and Ni. The highest summer rates of V and Ni removal were equal to -378 mg/s and -155 mg/s respectively, whereas lowest spring rates are equal to 296 mg/s and 220 mg/s. The intermediate CRR amplitudes were typical for most abundant TM such as Sr, Al, and Fe. The spatial CRR variability depends on water chemistry and the presence of pollution sources. The lowest (up to 38 g/s) rates of N-min. removal was observed for polluted lower Selenga sections characterized by low water mineralization and high DOC concentrations. The highest rates (-85 g/s) were observed for unpolluted upper sections. Seepage loss from the river to groundwater was also recognized as an important means of contaminant removal. The CRC values depend mostly on water residence time. The DOC removing capacity value of Baikal (-26 g/m(3)) were lower than those of Selenga in summer (-35 g/m(3)) but higher than the CRCs of all tributaries during the other seasons (from 30 mg/m(3) to -10 g/m(3)).

We examined the hypothesis that currents generated by waves and river flow control spatial and temporal variations of L. wollei biomass in a large river system. We measured L. wollei biomass together with meteorological, physical, and chemical variables during 2009-2011 at 10 sites along a gradient of exposure to current and wind in Lake Saint-Louis, a large (148 km(2)) fluvial lake of St Lawrence River. Where water chemistry was conducive to L. wollei growth, wave exposure and current velocity controlled spatial and temporal biomass variations. Biomass increased from May to November and persisted during winter. Interannual variations were primarily controlled by river flow (water level), and high spring discharge dislodged mats from the previous growing season. Under climate-change scenarios, anticipated declines in water level and rising storm intensity may lead to an increase in the areas colonized by L. wollei, more frequent than present-day episodes of mat disruption, water-use impairment, and beach fouling.					; Levesque, David/W-8683-2019	Levesque, David/0000-0001-7532-0146; Hudon, Christiane/0000-0003-4629-0683; 													2161-9549	2161-9565				SEP	2015	34	3					867	880		10.1086/682007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/682007													WOS:000359667700005

An experimental radar survey was carried out in Spring-Summer 1986-7 using an aircraft side-looking radar at wavelength 2.5 cm. In the processing of the radar survey material the water surface of inland lakes was used as a reference. Invariant calibration characteristics were obtained for five dates of survey and numerical estimates of the relative ESS were compared for different agricultural objects (bare soils, pasture, cereal and tilled crops).																			1024-5251						1998	15	1					63	77																WOS:000075049900005
J	DAVISON, W; WOOF, C; RIGG, E				DAVISON, W; WOOF, C; RIGG, E			THE DYNAMICS OF IRON AND MANGANESE IN A SEASONALLY ANOXIC LAKE - DIRECT MEASUREMENT OF FLUXES USING SEDIMENT TRAPS	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Sediment traps [20] were employed for a year in 5 arrays at 3 locations in a seasonal anoxic basin in Esthwaite Water, U.K. Accumulated Fe and Mn were measured fortnightly, as were vertical profiles of temperature, O2, total Fe and Mn, polarographically determined Fe(II) and Mn(II) and light attenuance. Most of the Fe and Mn flows into the lake in winter and is nearly all caught in sediment traps in deep hypolimnetic water, indicating that both elements are transported to the sediment. Accumulation rates in the sediments show that the Fe retained with minimal loss. Although dissolved Fe increases to very high concentrations in the hypolimnion during the period of summer anoxia, this accumulation only accounts for a small fraction of the annual Fe loading to the lake. The overall cycling of Fe in the lake is consistent with a simple conception of sediment-water interactions. When a redox boundary exists in the water column there is a separate cycle of Fe due to vertical transport of ferrous Fe by eddy diffusion, oxidation to Fe(III) by O2, sinking of the resultant ferric particles, and redissolution to ferrous Fe. The Mn cycle contrasts markedly with that of Fe. The Mn which reaches the sediment in winter is rapidly reduced and released to the overlying oxic water so that < 10% is permanently accumulated in the sediment. During summer the Mn never reaches the sediment because it is reduced and accumulated in the anoxic hypolimnion. Relatively little Mn is supplied from the sediment during this time because the supply of particles is interrupted. Although most of the Mn which enters the lake is washed out again it will nearly all have undergone a redox cycle.

Diet differences between wild and stocked age-0 to age-3 lake trout indicate influence of early rearing environments	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Wild lake trout recently began to appear in abundance in Lake Champlain after over 40 years of stocking, providing an opportunity to compare the seasonal diet of wild and stocked juveniles. We sampled 2,349 age-0 to age-3 lake trout collected in bottom trawls from April to November 2015-2018, and examined the relationship between diet and spatial heterogeneity in abundance of wild and stocked juveniles. Stocked fish were, on average, the size of wild fish one year older. Wild juveniles had fewer empty stomachs and more items per stomach than stocked fish at each age. Mysis diluviana dominated the diet of age0 and age-1 wild lake trout until they began to consume fish in fall at age-1. In contrast, the diet of newlystocked fish (age-1) comprised rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus), alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), with Mysis only abundant in summer and fall. Number and composition of diet items varied among geographic areas of the lake but did not explain differences in abundance of wild or stocked fish by area. Diet overlap was high between wild and stocked fish for each age class at each season, except in fall at age-0. Differences in the diet of wild and stocked juveniles likely reflect effects of early rearing experience. Recruitment of wild lake trout depends on availability and abundance of Mysis, but our diet data do not provide insight to explain why recruitment is finally occurring after a protracted delay.

Results are shown for 13 toxic chemicals for which all or nearly all of these input pathways could be evaluated. The percentage of direct atmospheric contributions relative to total input to Lake Erie calculated for the 13 species are: PCBs, 26%, PAHs, 21%; benzo-a-pyrene, 66%; hexachlorobenzene, 9%; 2,3;7,8- TCDD, 2%; 2,3,7,8- TCDF, 38%; mercury, 22%; lead, 23%; cadmium, 59%; chromium, 17%; arsenic, 8%; dieldrin, 34%; DDT, 29%. For most species the Detroit River was the major input pathway. Vapor phase fluxes out of the lake are indicated for mercury, and for several organic chemicals. Volatilization of PCBs, DDT, and mercury out of the lake is reduced in winter relative to summer, and the vapor flux of PAHs changes direction from volatilization in summer to deposition in winter. The main conclusion of this study is that atmospheric input to Lake Erie may be a significant contributor of certain toxic chemicals.																			0380-1330						1991	17	4					504	516		10.1016/S0380-1330(91)71386-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(91)71386-5													WOS:A1991GZ44900009

Hence, population exposure risk to AOD becomes a research hotspot. The arid Central Asia (ACA) has a generally high AOD and is a major source area for dust aerosols in the world. Only few studies have discussed population exposure risk to AOD in ACA. Based on multisource remote sensing data, and used population exposure risk model, this study evaluated population exposure risk to AOD in six ecological zones (Northern steppe region of ACA (NSCA), Aral Sea desert area (ASDA), Tianshan Mountains (TSMT), Junggar Basin desert area (JBDA), Tarim Basin desert area (TBDA) and Hexi corridor desert area (HCDA)). Generally, AOD in ACA was kept increasing from 2000 to 2015, and it increased mostly in HCDA and areas near the Aral Sea (p < 0.001). With respect to seasonal variations, the maximum AOD was observed in spring and autumn, and the minimum was in winter. Considering land use changes, AOD was mainly manifested by the reduction of water bodies and expansion of construction lands. This was the mostly significant in NSCA and ASDA (p < 0.01). The population exposure risk to AOD in ACA was increasing continuously from 2000 to 2015, and high-value regions (>9) concentrated in oases, specifically, in the Aral Sea basin and Tarim River basin.The Aral Sea basin became the major AOD source region in ACA due to the shrinking water area after unreasonable development and utilization of water resources. These further increase population exposure risk to AOD in the Aral Sea area. Hence, ecological restoration in terminal lakes of ACA will become the key to lower population exposure risk to AOD practically. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Havens, KE; Beaver, JR				Havens, Karl E.; Beaver, John R.			Composition, size, and biomass of zooplankton in large productive Florida lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Crustacean zooplankton data were compiled from long-term observational studies at seven large shallow Florida lakes, to determine whether there are general characteristics in regard to species composition, body size, and biomass. In particular, we examined whether patterns in body size and species richness fit empirical models developed by Stanley Dodson. The lakes included range in size from 125 to 1730 km(2) and encompass mesotrophic to hyper-eutrophic conditions. We found that zooplankton biomass was strongly dominated by one species of calanoid copepod-Arctodiaptomus dorsalis. Large daphnids were absent, and Cladocera assemblages were dominated by small taxa such as Ceriodaphnia, Chydorus, and Eubosmina. The total number of species of pelagic cladocerans (8-12) was consistent with Dodson's predictions based on lake area. The average size of crustacean zooplankton in Florida lakes is small in comparison with temperate communities. A. dorsalis is the smallest calanoid copepod in North America, and the mean length of Cladocera (0.6 mm) is consistent with Dodson's results that size decreases from temperate to tropical zones. Total biomass of crustacean zooplankton was very low, ratios of zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass (0.01-0.1) are among the lowest reported in the literature, and the zooplankton displayed short-lasting early spring peaks in biomass. Cladocera were almost entirely absent in spring and summer. Factors known to occur in Florida lakes, which appear to explain these characteristics of biomass, include intense fish predation and high summer water temperature.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2011	668	1					49	60		10.1007/s10750-010-0386-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0386-5													WOS:000290177300005

Morphological and Ecological Differentiation of Sympatric Forms of Arcrtic Charr Salvelinus alpinus (Salmonidae) in Lake Tokko (Northern Transbaikalia)	JOURNAL OF ICHTHYOLOGY												Based on data from 1997-2019, morphology, growth, feeding, reproduction and early development of Arctic charr from Lake Tokko (Olekma basin, northern Transbaikalia) were studied. Three charr forms, large, small and dwarf differing in growth rate were recorded in the lake. During the last years, the large form disappeared, the small form became rare and the dwarf form became highly abundant; the proportion of old small and dwarf charr sharply decreased. The dwarf form differs in morphology from the small and large forms, which are morphologically similar. In the summer period of 1997-2001, the large form fed on fish, the small form fed mainly on amphibious insects (chironomid pupae), and the dwarf form fed on amphibious insects and benthos. Presently the small form transited to piscivorous and the dwarf form to predominantly planktivorous feeding. The dwarf form spawns from late July to mid-August at stony sites of underwater shore slope when water temperature is 5.0-6.5 degrees C; laid eggs develop till late November-early December at water temperature decreasing to 3.0-3.5 degrees C. According to data needing verification, the small form spawns in late autumn, but some individuals spawn in summer at the same time as the dwarf form. The results suggest substantial, though incomplete reproductive isolation between the dwarf and the small forms. It is supposed that nowadays the degree of their introgressive hybridization has increased following anthropogenic changes in population structure.

Understanding local vegetation changes is crucial for projecting ecosystem dynamics. In this paper, we make a case for Himalayan mountain areas to explore vegetation dynamics and their influencing factors. Firstly, the interannual trends of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were extracted by the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) algorithm and linear regression method. Moreover, the influence of environmental factors on interannual NDVI trends was assessed using the Random Forests algorithm and partial dependence plots. Subsequently, the time-lag effects of seasonal NDVI on different climatic factors were discussed and the effects of these factors on seasonal NDVI changes were determined by partial correlation analysis. The results show that (1) an overall weak upward trend was observed in NDVI variations from 1982 to 2015, and 1989 is considered to be the breakpoint of the NDVI time series; (2) interannual temperature trends and the shortest distance to large lakes were the most important factors in explaining interannual NDVI trends. Temperature trends were positively correlated with NDVI trends. The relationship between the shortest distance to large lakes and the NDVI trend is an inverted U-shaped; (3) the time-lags of NDVI responses to four climatic factors were shorter in Autumn than that in Summer. The NDVI responds quickly to precipitation and downward long-wave radiation; (4) downward long-wave radiation was the main climate factor that influenced NDVI changes in Autumn and the growing season because of the warming effect at night. This study is important to improve the understanding of vegetation changes in mountainous regions.

The tree sways reached up to 160 mm. Maxima were registered during winter time. No correlation was found between the direction of the sways and the root collar. On shallow rooted sites the Norway spruce trees swayed significantly more than on deep rooted sites. According to the wind direction the sways dominated in the region north of Lake Constance (Oberschwaben) and in the northern part of the Black Forest to east, and in the southern part of the Black Forest to north-east. Only small changes in the vertical position were registered. 10 trees with the greatest sways have been felled for growth analysis and studies in root area. There was found a correlation between ring width and pressure wood. Other ring widths could be explained by fertilization. No indications could be found that the trunc sways caused root damages to such an extent that physiological stress (in water supply) should happen. On shallow rooted sites the root plate moves, but as a whole and without any damages. Only small damages were registered when wood had contact with large undivided rocks and when they did not find a possibility to fix themselves, for instance in crevices.																			0002-5852					MAY-JUN	1991	162	5-6					85	92																WOS:A1991FV08500001
J	Agbeti, MD; Kingston, JC; Smol, JP; Watters, C				Agbeti, MD; Kingston, JC; Smol, JP; Watters, C			Comparison of phytoplankton succession in two lakes of different mixing regimes	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The influence of frequent water-column mixing on phytoplankton succession and species composition was studied by comparing plankton dynamics in two lakes (Lake Opinicon and Upper Rock Lake) which have similar water chemistry, but differ widely in their basin morphometries: Opinicon is shallow and frequently-mixed during the ice-free season, whereas nearby Upper Rock is deep and dimictic. The species composition and the seasonal succession of phytoplankton were broadly similar in both lakes over the three years of study. The spring phytoplankton in both lakes consisted of diatoms that were replaced in the summer and fall by cyanobacteria. Diatom peaks in Opinicon preceded similar peaks in Upper Rock. Loss of diatoms from the phytoplankton in Upper Rock appeared to be related to sedimentation; in contrast, zooplankton herbivory may have resulted, partly, in loss of diatoms in Opinicon. Lightly-silicified and spindle-shaped diatoms (Rhizosolenia and single-celled Fragilaria) were more abundant in the dimictic lake, whereas heavily-silicified diatoms (Aulacoseira) were more abundant in the frequently-mixed lake. Zooplankton taxa and their seasonal patterns were similar in both lakes, but populations were considerably denser in the frequently-mixed lake. The results of canonical correspondence analysis and detrended correspondence analysis (multivariate ordination techniques) indicated that, although phytoplankton growth was influenced by similar physical and chemical variables in both lakes, the influence of chemical variables was stronger in Upper Rock. A frequently-mixed system such as Lake Opinicon, appeared to provide a similar environment for plankton development to a well-mixed epilimnion of a typical dimictic lake, such as Upper Rock Lake.

J	CLARKE, JDA				CLARKE, JDA			LAKE LEFROY, A PALAEODRAINAGE PLAYA IN WESTERN-AUSTRALIA	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Lake Lefroy is a medium-sized playa lake within the Lefroy Palaeodrainage on the Yilgarn Craton of Western Australia. The climate is semi-arid with summer and winter rainfall maxima. Evaporation exceeds precipitation by a factor of 10. Prevailing strong winds are westerly in winter, and northerly in summer. Lake shorelines are erosional along northern and western shores and depositional along eastern and southern shores. Islands consist of gypsum dunes, siliciclastic dunes and bedrock. The evaporitic succession is up to 9 m thick. Deposition has occurred episodically since the earliest Pliocene. Wind and wave-driven currents rework sediments that are then deflated by the wind to be redeposited in marginal dunes. The gypsum content of the sediment increases away from the shore and much of the lake is underlain by crystalline gypsum within a siliciclastic to slightly calcareous matrix. Surface water in Lake Lefroy is supplied largely by surface runoff, yet there is also a limited contribution from near-surface aquifers. The surface brine pool is partly isolated from the main palaeodrainage aquifers and regional basement groundwater by essentially impermeable sediments of probable Miocene age. Lake brines are of sodium chloride type and salinities are as high as 462 000 ppm total dissolved solids. The pH ranges from neutral to weakly acid. The probable origin of the solutes is marine salt derived from rainfall.																			0812-0099					OCT	1994	41	5					417	427		10.1080/08120099408728152	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08120099408728152													WOS:A1994PL84100003

Wet deposition fluxes of P species were collected by automatic rainfall collection instrument, and dry deposition fluxes were estimated using airborne concentration measurements and inferential models. The results reveal that among the different P components, DOP had the highest contribution (50%) to wet TP deposition (average all sites 12.7 +/- 0.7 mg P m 2 /yr), followed by PP (40%) and DIP (10%). Similarly, DOP (51%) was the major contributor to dry TP deposition (average two sites 2.4 +/- 0.9 mg P m 2 /yr), followed by DIP (35%) and PP (14%). Wet deposition dominated the annual total TP deposition (wet plus dry), accounting for approximately 83%. The key seasons for dry deposition were spring and autumn, which accounted for 64% of the annual total dry TP deposition. In comparison, wet deposition was significantly higher in the summer, accounting for 73% of the annual total wet TP deposition. The results of the potential source contribution function and concentrationweighted trajectories analysis indicate that local source emission and long-range transport from surrounding cities jointly exerted a substantial influence on aerosol P concentrations, particularly in the eastern and northwestern regions of the lake. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the different P components in atmospheric deposition, which is beneficial for developing effective strategies to manage the P cycle in Lake Erhai.

Scott			Fall survival of American woodcock in the western Great Lakes Region	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												We estimated fall (10 Sep-8 Nov) survival rates, cause-specific mortality rates, and determined the magnitude and sources of mortality of 1,035 radio-marked American woodcock (Scolopax minor) in Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin during 2001-2004. In all 3 states, we radio-marked woodcock on paired study areas; 1 of which was open to hunting and expected to receive moderate to high hunter use and the other of which was either closed to hunting (Michigan and Minnesota) or was relatively inaccessible to hunters (Wisconsin). We used Program MARK to estimate fall survival rates, to evaluate a set of candidate models to examine the effects of hunting and several covariates (sex, age, year, state) on survival, and to examine the relationship between survival rates and kill rates due to hunting. Hunting accounted for 70% of the 86 woodcock deaths in the hunted areas, followed by predation (20%) and various other sources of mortality (10%). Woodcock deaths that occurred in the non-hunted and lightly hunted areas (n=50) were caused by predators (46%), hunting (32%), and various other sources (22%). Based on small-sample corrected Akaike's Information Criterion values, variation in fall survival of woodcock was best explained by treatment (i.e., hunted vs. non-hunted), year, and period (pre-hunting season intervals vs. hunting season intervals). The average fall survival estimate from our best model for woodcock in the non-hunted areas (0.893, 95% CI=0.864-0.923) was greater than the average for the hunted areas (0.820, 95% CI=0.786-0.854 [this estimate includes data from the lightly hunted area in Wisconsin]), and the average treatment effect (i.e., greater survival rates in non-hunted areas) was 0.074 (95% CI=0.018-0.129). The kill rate due to hunting was 0.120 (95% CI=0.090-0.151) when data were pooled among states and years. We detected a negative relationship between hunting kill rates and survival in our hunted areas, which suggests that hunting mortality was at least partially additive during fall. Our results illustrate the influence of hunting relative to other sources of mortality in Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, and indicate that managers may be able to influence fall survival rates by manipulating hunting regulations or access on public land.

Isotope signatures of sampled waters gained insight into the recharge source of the groundwater. The summer Heihe River water and most of the spring water in Zhangye and Yongchang basins plotted above the global meteoric water line (GMWL) on the delta O-18-delta D plot. The spring water had R/Ra ratio > 1, low TDS and high tritium, which indicates origin from Qilian Mountain glacier meltwater. The groundwater of Qilian Mountains was transported to the Hexi Corridor (in which Zhangye Basin is located) through underground fault zones. Additionally, some of the groundwater in the alluvial plain, and all spring water surrounding Zhangye Basin, plotted below the GMWL on the delta O-18-delta D plot along an evaporation line, and had R/Ra ratio < 1 and high TDS. It is proposed that the Tibetan rivers or lakes source the Hexi Corridor groundwater through either the NE-trending or NW-trending buried fault zones. The isotopic signatures presented as part of this study rule out the conventional viewpoint that groundwater of the Zhangye Basin was recharged by local precipitation and infiltration of Heihe River water on the alluvial plain.

Five river sectors were surveyed on four dates between April 2016 and February 2017. In the Petrohue River, 2400 fish were sampled (42.9% rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss; 23.8% brown trout Salmo trutta, and 33.3% Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), while in the Puelo River, 1972 fish were examined (51.6% rainbow trout; 30.4% brown trout and 18% Chinook salmon). Fry and fingerling stages accounted for the highest proportion of fish collected by electrofishing In the Petrohue and Puelo rivers, rainbow trout fry and fingerlings represented 96.3 and 99.2% of the fish sampled, respectively; 96.8 and 97.1% in the case of brown trout, while for Chinook salmon, parr and pre-smolts represented 97% of the fish examined in the Petrohue River and 98.3% in the Puelo River. Rainbow and brown trout shared the same habitats and food items in both rivers, and the two oldest trout recorded 5(+) and 6(+) years. Parr and pre-smolt Chinook salmon were present mainly in the winter and spring seasons and were aged 1(+) and 2(+), respectively. There were no differences in the food items recorded from the juvenile fish sampled in both rivers. The mature, returning adult Chinook salmon aged between 1.5(+) and 1.6(+) years were devoid of food and were recorded over the autumn season with the highest abundance in the Petrohue River. The study did not identify any adverse competition or negative interactions among the three main salmonid species sharing the same habitat.

J	Fekadu, A; Chanie, S				Fekadu, Addisu; Chanie, Solomon			A seasonal study on phytoplankton diversity and dynamics of Lake Chamo, Ethiopia	AQUATIC LIVING RESOURCES												Phytoplankton succession in open lakes depends on the availability of nutrients, temperature, light intensity and transparency. Phytoplankton communities usually undergo a fairly predictable annual cycle, but some species may grow exponentially forming the blooms. Accordingly, the seasonal diversity and dynamics of phytoplankton and their correlation with environmental factors were investigated in Lake Chamo, from December, 2013 to November, 2014. Samples were taken from four different sites of the lake; each of these sampling sites had their own unique characteristics. Seasonal plankton samples were collected using nylobolt plankton net (No. 25). pH, water temperature, specific conductivity, saturation, total dissolved solids, salinity and dissolved oxygen were measured in the field. The results showed that there is significant difference in the mean value of pH across the different seasons at the first sampling site, season II having significantly higher value than season I and IV. Water temperature also significantly varied among sampling sites and seasons, site 3 in spring 2014 having significantly higher value (30.4 +/- 0.21 degrees C) than site 2 during summer 2014 (26.0 +/- 0.12 degrees C). Cyanophyta, Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta accounted 96% of the total phytoplankton abundance during the study period. Pediastrum, Scendesmus and Closterium species were the predominant Chlorophyta, during the rainy seasons. The average Cyanophyta count was positively and non-significantly correlated with water temperature and turbidity of the lake. Overall, the four seasons exhibit different phytoplankton species composition across different sites. The diversity was high during winter season in all sampling sites.

J	Ma, HM; Venkatesh, S; Jantunen, LM				Ma, HM; Venkatesh, S; Jantunen, LM			Evidence of the impact of ENSO events on temporal trends of hexachlorobenzene air concentrations over the Great Lakes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												This study presents an evidence for association of the air concentrations of HCB measured in the Great Lakes region with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) during the 1990s. The measured HCB concentrations in the atmosphere collected by the Integrated Atmospheric Deposition Network (IADN) program in the Great Lakes during the 1990s show strong correlations with the Multivariate ENSO index (MEI) during winter (December-February) and spring (March-May) seasons. These correlations are stronger in the western upper Great Lakes than in the eastern portion of the Great Lakes ecosystem (lake Ontario), and correspond well to the spatial variability of the surface air temperature in North America during El Nino years. Departures of HCB air concentrations for each winter during 1992-1999 from that averaged over all winters of 1992-1999, i.e. the anomaly, also show the same temporal trend as that of the MEI during the same period. In the same time period, it has been reported that direct HCB emissions from application of HCB in agriculture, from industrial sources in North America and in the rest of the world have decreased substantially compared to those in the 1970s and could not by themselves account for observed HCB air concentrations around the Great Lakes since the 1990s. Interannual fluctuations of HCB concentrations are caused most likely by reemission due to volatilization of HCB from the soil contaminated from past use, followed by long-range transport associated with ENSO events. In addition to the high correlation (R-2=0.61) between winter HCB air concentrations averaged over the Great Lakes region and the MEI the atmospheric circulation patterns associated with ENSO events are conducive to the long-range transport of HCB into the Great Lakes region.

J	Nolet, BA; Gyimesi, A				Nolet, Bart A.; Gyimesi, Abel			Underuse of stopover site by migratory swans	JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												Many migratory birds use a chain of stopover sites to fuel their migration. Under time-minimizing migration, fuelling time and giving-up density at stopovers are predicted to depend on fuelling conditions. Fluctuations in food accessibility likely lead to changes in fuelling conditions, which should in turn be reflected in fuelling time and giving-up density. During their migration, Bewick's Swans Cygnus columbianus bewickii refuel on below-ground tubers of Fennel Pondweed Potamogeton pectinatus in shallow lakes. We studied giving-up density and stopover use (expressed in bird-days) of Bewick's Swans at an autumn stopover site (Lauwersmeer, The Netherlands) during 1995-2008, as dependent on local environmental conditions. High water levels were hypothesized to restrict access to tuber stocks. High water levels at the stopover site were predicted to lead to higher giving-up densities and less bird-days spent at the stopover. Annual variation in giving-up densities and number of bird-days was strongly associated with year-to-year differences in initial tuber biomass density and number of days with high water levels. As predicted, giving-up density increased and bird-days decreased with the number of days with high water level. We conclude that, in line with time-minimizing migration, changes in fuelling conditions may lead to underuse of a stopover site. Underuse of stopovers by migratory birds has been reported before but only in the sense that more food was left at stopover sites than at wintering sites. In contrast, in our case, dealing with a given stopover site, more food is left behind in some years than in other years.

The freshmen of the Robotics Engineering Group in the Summer Bridge 2011 Program designed and built an underwater ROV (remotely-operated vehicle) to perform underwater exploration of, for example, local ponds and lakes. The duration for the project was four weeks in July and the first part of the Fall semester. The students were given instruction in the basic electrical and mechanical principles associated with the project, and introduced to a set of components that would be available in the completion of the project, through a sequence learning activities that included lectures and laboratory exercises. Students were also given instruction on the engineering design process paradigm. The separate elements of the course were integrated as the students designed, constructed, tested, and modified a prototype ROV.																			2153-5965						2012																								WOS:000380250101049
J	Parish, MC; Calder, WJ; Shuman, BN				Parish, Meredith C.; Calder, W. John; Shuman, Bryan N.			Millennial-scale increase in winter precipitation in the southern Rocky Mountains during the Common Era	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												We employed the modern analog technique to quantitatively reconstruct temperature and precipitation over the past 2500 yr based on fossil pollen records from six high-elevation lakes in northern Colorado. Reconstructed annual temperatures for the study area did not deviate significantly from modern over the past 2500 yr despite hemispheric expressions of Medieval Climate Anomaly warmth and Little Ice Age cooling. Annual precipitation, however, shifted from lower than modern rates from 2500 to 1000 cal yr BP to higher than modern rates after 1000 cal yr BP, a greater than 100 mm increase in precipitation. Winter precipitation accounts for the majority of the change in annual precipitation, while summer precipitation rates did not change significantly over the past 2500 yr. The large change in winter precipitation rates from the first to second millennium of the Common Era is inferred from a shift in fossil pollen assemblages dominated by subalpine conifers, which have southern sites as modern analogs, to assemblages representing open subalpine vegetation with abundant Artemisia spp. (sagebrush), which have more northern modern analogs. The change helps to explain regional increases in lake levels and shifts in some isotopic and tree-ring data sets, highlighting the risk of large reductions in snowpack and water supplies in the Intermountain West.

Analysis of bacterioplankton genes in an impaired Great Lakes harbour reveals seasonal metabolic shifts and a previously undetected cyanobacterium	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY												Hamilton Harbour is an impaired embayment of Lake Ontario that experiences seasonal algal blooms despite decades of remedial efforts. To study the harbour's cyanobacterial and heterotrophic bacterial communities, we extracted and sequenced community DNA from surface water samples collected biweekly from different sites during summer and fall. Assembled con-tigs were annotated at the phylum level, and Cyanobacteria were further characterized at order and species levels. Actinobac-teria were most abundant in early summer, while Cyanobacteria were dominant in mid-summer. Microcystis aeruginosa and Limnoraphis robusta were most abundant throughout the sampling period, expanding the documented diversity of Cyanobacte-ria in Hamilton Harbour. Functional annotations were performed using the MG-RAST pipeline and SEED database, revealing that genes for photosynthesis, nitrogen metabolism, and aromatic compound metabolism varied in relative abundances over the season, while phosphorus metabolism was consistent, suggesting that these genes remained essential despite fluctuating environmental conditions and community succession. We observed seasonal shifts from anoxygenic to oxygenic phototrophy, and from ammonia assimilation to nitrogen fixation, coupled with decreasing heterotrophic bacteria and increasing Cyanobac-teria relative abundances. Our data contribute important insights into bacterial taxa and functional potentials in Hamilton Harbour, revealing seasonal and spatial dynamics that can be used to inform ongoing remediation efforts.					; Short, Steven/F-5578-2011; P, C/KHV-7567-2024	Short, Steven/0000-0002-6576-4883; Palermo, Christine/0000-0003-3037-0064; 													0008-4166	1480-3275				AUG	2023	69	8					281	295		10.1139/cjm-2022-0252	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjm-2022-0252		APR 2023						37054443					WOS:000985335100001

Lake-water samples were collected in winter during water mixing, and in early summer during stratification. The population abundance in each sample was determined by flow cytometry. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments from organisms measuring less than 2 mu m was used to assess eubacterioplankton community composition. In winter, no obvious differences were observed in either the abundance or the diversity of the bacterial community, on either the horizontal or the vertical scales. The only influence detected was that of river water input, but this was at a very minor scale relative to the surface area of the lake. In early summer, changes were found in the community composition on the vertical scale related to the thermal stratification of the water column. There were also marked differences on the horizontal scale at 15 m depth due to internal waves. The implications of these findings for sampling strategies are very important from the perspective of comparative studies of free-living bacterial community diversity and functioning in large and deep lakes.

In this work, a coaxial type borehole exchanger has been integrated with a single basin solar still. Transient and steady-state heat transfer models are presented to assess the behaviour of the combined system for a four-month winter period corresponding to the Urmia Lake region in Iran. Because ground serves as a heat source during winters and a heat sink during summer, integration with a ground exchanger is seen to increase the solar still's productivity for the winter months, by about 126 % for the considered values of parameters. It is also seen that the steady model over calculates the total distillate collected, by about 7 % for ground exchanger integrated still and underestimates it by about 0.2 % for an independent still, respectively. It is observed that larger inner and smaller outer radius of the ground exchanger are desirable. Further, the water mass flow rate is seen to possess an optimal value at which the still's output gets maximized. This work is proposed to be a first step in analysing the usefulness of extracting geothermal energy via a borehole exchanger for desalination application via a solar still.

J	Wang, SF; Zhao, L; Wang, YW; Li, Y; Wang, LX; Zhao, JT				Wang, Shengfeng; Zhao, Lin; Wang, Yuanwei; Li, Yan; Wang, Lingxiao; Zhao, Jianting			Spatial and temporal characteristics of actual evapotranspiration and its influencing factors in Selin Co Basin	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												Selin Co basin, a representative lake basin situated in the central region of the Tibetan Plateau (TP), is characterized by extensive areas of frozen ground and has undergone a remarkable expansion in its lake area. Evapotranspiration, as an important variable within the lake water cycle, as well as its influencing factors are still under debate at this basin. Actual evapotranspiration (ETa) plays a vital role in influencing land-atmosphere interaction processes and the hydrological cycle. By quantifying the amount of water that is actually transpired by vegetation and evaporated from soil surfaces, ETa provides important information about the mechanisms controlling evapotranspiration. In this study, the advection-aridity (AA) model was employed to estimate ETa in Selin Co basin. The estimated ETa and its influencing factors were investigated between 2001-2018, with an emphasis on examining both spatial and temporal trends. The results demonstrated that the multiyear mean ETa in the basin was 430.3 mm (excluding lakes) with an overall significantly decreasing trend (-5.8 mm/yr). In terms of its seasonal variation, ETa exhibited highest value during summer, while experiencing comparatively lower rates in autumn and spring. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of both the annual and seasonal ETa exhibited a similar decreasing trend from the southeast to the northwest of the basin. The sensitivity of several meteorological variables to modifications in ETa was also examined. Results indicated that specific humidity was the predominant variable, followed by net radiation, air temperature, precipitation, atmospheric pressure, and wind speed. In addition, the area covered by permafrost and seasonally frozen ground was approximately about 1.58 x 104 km2 and 4.22 x 104 km2 in the basin, and permafrost degradation in the northern region of the Selin Co basin resulted in increased average soil moisture content and underground ice melting, leading to a subsequent increase in ETa.

Sequence analysis and acoustic tracking of individual lake sturgeon identify multiple patterns of river-lake habitat use	ECOSPHERE												Understanding the spatial ecology of sturgeon (Acipenseridae) has proven to be a challenge due to the life history characteristics of these fish, especially their long life span, intermittent spawning, and long-distance migrations. Within the Huron-Erie Corridor (HEC) of the Laurentian Great Lakes, habitat use of 247 lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) was monitored over a three-year period (2015-2017) with acoustic transmitters. Extensive spatial coverage of receivers throughout the St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair, and Detroit River between Lake Huron and Lake Erie (similar to 150 km) allowed for continuous monitoring of the movements of acoustic-tagged individuals. Sequence analysis of individual detection histories was used to describe lake sturgeon habitat use and to determine (1) whether distinct habitat-use patterns occurred within the HEC; (2) whether the range of habitats occupied varied across seasons among sturgeon grouped by common patterns; and (3) whether variation identified was related to tagging sites in the two rivers or sex. Lake sturgeon were active throughout the HEC, but five distinct habitat-use patterns were identified. River residents were not broadly distributed across entire rivers, but rather associated with particular segments (middle Detroit River, St. Clair River delta). Variations in habitat-use sequences were in part related to three river tagging sites, but not sex, and did not produce groups with sequences that reflected all five habitat-use patterns derived from cluster analysis. Lake sturgeon distribution was reduced to fewer habitat segments during winter and expanded to the maximum extent during the spring and summer. Conservation planning that incorporates behavioral diversity of habitat use is relatively rare due to a lack of observations on movements of individuals at biologically relevant spatial and temporal scales, but using telemetry and sequence analysis methods may promote the success of conservation and restoration efforts.

Invasive Phragmites australis management outcomes and native plant recovery are context dependent	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												The outcomes of invasive plant removal efforts are influenced by management decisions, but are also contingent on the uncontrolled spatial and temporal context of management areas. Phragmites australis is an aggressive invader that is intensively managed in wetlands across North America. Treatment options have been understudied, and the ecological contingencies of management outcomes are poorly understood. We implemented a 5-year, multi-site experiment to evaluate six Phragmites management treatments that varied timing (summer or fall) and types of herbicide (glyphosate or imazapyr) along with mowing, plus a nonherbicide solarization treatment. We evaluated treatments for their influence on Phragmites and native plant cover and Phragmites inflorescence production. We assessed plant community trajectories and outcomes in the context of environmental factors. The summer mow, fall glyphosate spray treatment resulted in low Phragmites cover, high inflorescence reduction, and provided the best conditions for native plant recruitment. However, returning plant communities did not resemble reference sites, which were dominated by ecologically important perennial graminoids. Native plant recovery following initial Phragmites treatments was likely limited by the dense litter that resulted from mowing. After 5 years, Phragmites mortality and native plant recovery were highly variable across sites as driven by hydrology. Plots with higher soil moisture had greater reduction in Phragmites cover and more robust recruitment of natives compared with low moisture plots. This moisture effect may limit management options in semiarid regions vulnerable to water scarcity. We demonstrate the importance of replicating invasive species management experiments across sites so the contingencies of successes and failures can be better understood.

An assessment of nitrogen removal from headwater streams in an agricultural watershed, northeast Ohio, USA	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The objective of this project was to assess in-stream nitrogen removal capacity in a fragmented agricultural landscape and to compare removal capacities in streams with agricultural or residential (hereafter referred to as agricultural streams) and forested riparian land use. We also identified what stream characteristics control nitrogen removal in these systems. We examined paired reaches (one agricultural and one forested reach) along five headwater streams in an agricultural watershed (Upper Sugar Creek Watershed) in northeast Ohio. Although denitrification rates were high (<0.1-17.2 mg N m(-2) h(-1)), annual nitrogen removal was most likely low because during spring and fall, when in-stream nitrogen loads were high, removal was low, and during summer when in-stream nitrogen loads were low, removal was high. Between the agricultural and forested reaches removal rates were similar in terms of loss rate and uptake velocity. Removal capacities were similar despite forested reaches having higher hydraulic residence times. Using a redundancy analysis we identified temperature, in-stream nitrate concentration, and relative transient storage as stream characteristics that affect nitrogen removal. Further analysis suggests that nitrogen removal via denitrification in these headwater streams was not limited by the availability of nitrate. In this fragmented agricultural watershed in-stream nitrogen removal was low and riparian land use had no effect on this process, most likely because of nitrate saturation.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2008	53	6					2573	2582		10.4319/lo.2008.53.6.2573	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2008.53.6.2573													WOS:000261355500019

Changes in the thermal stability of Lake Simcoe from 1980 to 2008	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Climate change is anticipated to have major physical and biological effects on aquatic ecosystems. Changes to the thermal regime of lakes such as shorter duration of ice-cover, earlier onset of stratification and an increase in the length of the stratified period have already been observed in some lakes in North America and Europe. Using vertical temperature profiles of Lake Simcoe during the open-water period from 1980 to 2008 we evaluated trends in water column stability, the onset of stratification and the timing of fall turnover at three stations situated in the lake's two bays and its main basin. Dramatic changes were observed at the three stations; each stratified earlier in the spring, mixed later in the fall and remained stratified for more than a month longer in 2008 compared to 1980. Long-term monotonic trends in the timing of the onset of thermal stratification, fall mixing and duration of stratification were significant. These trends resulted from changes in water column density that are strongly correlated with increasing average air temperatures over time, indicating that climate warming has had a significant effect on the thermal regime of Lake Simcoe.

Environmental Factors Influence Lesser Scaup Migration Chronology and Population Monitoring	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Identifying environmental metrics specific to lesser scaup (Aythya affinis; scaup) spring migration chronology may help inform development of conservation, management and population monitoring. Our objective was to determine how environmental conditions influence spring migration of lesser scaup to assess the effectiveness of the Waterfowl Breeding Population and Habitat Survey in accurately estimating scaup populations. We first compared peak timing of mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and scaup migration from weekly ground surveys in North Dakota, USA because the Waterfowl Breeding Population and Habitat Survey is designed to capture annual mallard migration. As predicted, we detected that peak timing of scaup and mallard migrations differed in 25 of 36 years investigated (1980-2010). We marked scaup with satellite transmitters (n = 78; 7,403 locations) at Long Point, Lake Erie, Ontario, Canada; Pool 19 of the Mississippi River, Iowa and Illinois, USA; and Presque Isle Bay, Lake Erie, Pennsylvania, USA. We tested the assumption that our marked scaup were representative of the continental population using the traditional survey area by comparing timing of migration of marked birds and scaup counted in the North Dakota Game and Fish Department survey. We detected a strong positive correlation between marked scaup and the survey data, which indicated that marked scaup were representative of the population. We subsequently used our validated sample of marked scaup to investigate the effects of annual variation in temperature, precipitation, and ice cover on spring migration chronology in the traditional and eastern survey areas of the Waterfowl Breeding Population and Habitat Survey, 2005-2010. We evaluated competing environmental models to explain variation in timing and rate of scaup migration at large-scale and local levels. Spring migration of scaup occurred earlier and faster during springs with warmer temperatures and greater precipitation, variables known to influence energy budgets and wetland availability. Our results suggest that surveys designed to index abundance of breeding mallards is imprecise for estimating scaup abundance, and inaccurate at estimating breeding population size by survey stratum.

J	Quinn, GP; Lake, PS; Schreiber, ESG				Quinn, GP; Lake, PS; Schreiber, ESG			A comparative study of colonization by benthos in a lake and its outflowing stream	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The patterns of colonization of Littoral benthos onto hard substrata on an exposed and a sheltered shore of Lake Purrumbete in Victoria, Australia, and the riffles of its outflow stream (Curdies River) were examined experimentally in winter and summer. The common taxa in the lake (gastropods, amphipods, isopods, planarians, ostracods) also occurred in the stream, although they were not abundant. The stream fauna was dominated by insects. 2. Defaunated half-bricks were sampled at each of three sites at the three different locations (exposed shore, sheltered shore, stream) in winter and summer at weekly or biweekly intervals, with natural stones also being sampled during the colonization period. Colonization patterns of individual taxa which occurred in both the lake and stream, and stream-only taxa, were compared using ANOVA, and the changes in the assemblage through time and between locations were analysed with non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and analysis of similarities (ANOSIM). 3. Colonization in the lake was very rapid, with species richness and assemblage composition on bricks after just one day matching that of natural stones. Colonization in the stream was slower, the assemblage composition not matching natural stones after 42 days in winter but being comparable after 28 days in summer. There was considerable species turnover during colonization in the stream, but little turnover in the lake, with most common taxa back after one day. There was little difference between the two lake shores in colonization patterns. 4. Taxa that occurred. in both lake and stream showed broadly similar patterns of colonization, with early occupancy at high densities. In contrast, stream insects showed a variety of colonization strategies. 5. These results indicate that rates and patterns of colonization on to hard substrata are quite different in Lake Purrumbete compared with its outflowing stream. The rapid colonization in this lake indicates great mobility for much of the fauna on hard substrata, possibly by swimming, benthic crawling or passive drift (even attached to floating vegetation). This may be an appropriate strategy in lake littoral zones where the amount of inhabitable hard substrata and accompanying food resources may be limited.																			0046-5070					JUN	1998	39	4					623	635																WOS:000074535600003
J	CORNWELL, JC; BANAHAN, S				CORNWELL, JC; BANAHAN, S			A SILICON BUDGET FOR AN ALASKAN ARCTIC LAKE	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The cycling of dissolved reactive silicate (DRS) and sedimentary biogenic SiO2 has been examined in ultraoligotrophic Toolik Lake, Alaska. Watershed output of DRS (approximately 7 mmol m-2 yr-1) is similar to other arctic study sites, but a short water residence time results in the poor retention of DRS (approximately 17 %) within the lake. Biogenic SiO2 concentrations in surficial sediments average 123 mg g-1 with the highest concentrations arising from the production of benthic diatoms in the littoral zone. Lake water DRS concentrations are highest prior to spring flow and photic zone concentrations exceed 23 mumol l-1 at the time of greatest primary production. Wintertime increases in watercolumn DRS concentrations and spring and summer pore water DRS flux estimates indicate that internal cycling within the lake may supply an amount of DRS equivalent to that which biologically utilized.

The increased interest in these colloids is due to their large impact on the transport, redistribution and bioavailability of numerous chemical compounds (such as trace metals, nutrients and organic pollutants). This paper presents a review of different analytical techniques available for determination of some of the properties of interest (e.g., colloid concentration, size distribution, mineral composition and surface properties). It is obvious that most methods suffer from limitations and that the only feasible way to overcome these problems is by using a combination of different techniques. Sampling in a Swedish lake, as an example, illustrates one promising combination including light scattering and gravimetric analysis for determination of colloid concentration, photon correlation spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy for size distribution measurements and energy dispersive microscopy; powder X-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy in order to obtain information about mineral constituents and general surface properties. Size fractionations were performed by filtration and centrifugation to gain information regarding the distribution of metals and organic matter between dissolved and solid phases. The study indicated, for instance, a seasonality of the size distribution of the colloidal matter, with smallest colloids (range 120-340 nm) found in spring, while the colloid samples during summer and autumn have a size distribution in the range 280-700 nm. This result also illustrates the limitations when using filters with, e.g., a pore size of 0.45 mu m for the distinction between particulate and dissolved substances.

This phenomenon can be caused by similar environmental conditions across physically separated populations. In the context of the ongoing climate change, it is essential to test this hypothesis, identify the factors driving the synchrony and elucidate the mechanisms, in the attempt to improve fisheries management. This study investigates synchronic variations in European whitefish (Coregonus spp.) populations in five peri-alpine lakes. The hypothesis suggests that shared biotic or abiotic factors contribute to similar trends in whitefish landings. Environmental and seasonal variables impacting the early life stages of the species were analyzed, and the Euclidean distances between the multivariate time series were calculated to identify similarities or dissimilarities in lake environmental parameters. We found that regional winter and spring temperatures were consistent across the lakes, but these factors did not fully account for variations in landings statistics. Wind intensity, water level and zooplankton abundance showed lake-specific patterns that could better explain local conditions and dynamics. Linear models did not reveal a coherent correlation with a common environmental variable across all lakes. However, distinct relationships were found in four of the lakes, with local factors significantly contributing to abundance variations. The spring abundance ofDaphnia spp., a primary food source for whitefish larvae, was the main factor correlated with fish landing trends in Lake Geneva and Lake Bourget. Higher availability ofDaphnia spp. may decrease intraspecific competition and density-dependent mortality. In Lake Neuchatel, winter water temperature was negatively mortality. temperature negatively correlated with fish abundance proxies, suggesting that warmer winters may compromise reproduction success. Lake Annecy saw an increase in whitefish landings following a substantial re- duction in fishing efforts during the late 2000s. A significant negative correlation was found between whitefish landings and fishing efforts. No relationship was found for Lake Aiguebelette, maybe due to a lack of zooplankton data. In conclusion, the ob- served synchrony in the European whitefish population is likely driven by a combination of interacting environmental and an- thropogenic factors rather than a single common variable. Fur- ther research and a more detailed dataset are needed to better understand these complex relationships.					; GUILLARD, Jean/A-2577-2011	Bourinet, Fabien/0000-0001-7095-9178; Drouineau, Hilaire/0000-0001-9206-0040; Guillard, Jean/0000-0003-0116-1167; Richard, Alexandre/0009-0001-4318-3594													1129-5767	1723-8633					2023	82	1							2134	10.4081/jlimnol.2023.2134	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2023.2134													WOS:001009723500001

However, whether and how the associated microbes affect PPE communities remain unknown. We used flow cytometric cell sorting combined with parallel high-throughput sequencing of the 18S and 16S rRNA genes to simultaneously investigate PPEs and their associated microbial communities in the Yangtze-connected Lake Dongting. The lake harbors a great diversity of PPEs. PPE communities exhibited significant temporal rather than spatial variations. Two distinct PPE taxa affiliated with Discostella nipponica and Poterioochromonas malhamensis were dominant during winter/spring and summer, respectively. Parallel high-throughput sequencing revealed a great diversity of associated bacteria and non-pigmented eukaryotes (NPEs) in PPEs sorts. Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Cyanobacteria among the associated bacteria and fungi among the associated NPEs were dominant. PPEs were more apparently associated with bacteria than with NPEs. The co-occurrence network of PPEs and associated microbes formed five major modules, which exhibited distinct temporal patterns, being specific to a certain period. Variations in PPEs communities were significantly correlated with both environmental factors and associated microbial communities. In variation partitioning analysis, the associated bacteria explained the greatest variations in PPE communities, and associated bacteria and NPEs co-explained a large portion of environmental effects on PPE communities. Our results highlight the significance of associated microbes in shaping PPE communities.					; Gu, Qian/HJA-9047-2022	, Shengnan/0000-0002-8846-2183; Gu, Qian/0000-0002-0458-0378													0095-3628	1432-184X				MAY	2023	85	4					1164	1178		10.1007/s00248-022-02001-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-022-02001-z		MAR 2022						35355086					WOS:000776051300001

Recent studies on surface water-groundwater relationships at hydro-projects in India using environmental isotopes	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Environmental isotopes ((2)H or D, (18)O, (3)H), along with geology, hydrochemistry and in situ physiochemical parameters (EC, T. DO, pH) were employed to study surface water (reservior, lake)-groundwater (spring) relationships at (1) Nagewadi, a minor irrigation project in the State of Maharashtra, Western India; (2) Kanhirapuzha reservoir in the State of Kerala, Southern India and (3) Ghatghar Pumped Storage Hydroelectric Project in the State of Maharashtra. Western India for the purpose of understanding the seepage/leakage and its associated problems. The studies concluded that the springs found downstream of the Nagewadi project originate from the reservoir and not from the abutments or shallow aquifers. The Kanhirapuzha reservoir receives a substantial base-flow component compared to riverine inputs. The reason for the water-logging problem at a nearby downstream village during the non-summer periods is due to the change in the upstream groundwater flow direction under reservior filling conditions and is not due to reservior leakage. Most of the springs in the approach tunnel to the underground power house of the Ghatghar Project originate from the lower reservior and not from the upper reservoir or the overburden rock matrix. The above case studies illustarte the diversity of environmental isotope applications in surface water (reservoir, lake)-groundwater (spring) relationship related to sustainability of hydro-projects.

However, these environments are particularly vulnerable to climate change, drought, water diversion, and fire suppression which all have contributed to the degradation of cieenegas along the U.S.-Mexican borderlands. Therefore, identifying the timing of precipitation patterns in this region is of particular interest because of its relationship to many ecological responses of the landscape such as groundwater recharge and fire. Here, we present the first-ever fire paleoenvironmental record from Cieenega Chimeneas, a cieenega complex in the Sierra de Juaerez of Baja California. We explore how changes in the amount and seasonality of moisture affected cieenega complexes and fire activity from across the southwestern North American region over the past 45,000 years. Our record suggests that during the late glacial period, 41,000-21,000 cal yr BP, the increase of Larrea and Quercus indicate an increase in summer precipitation. Subsequently, when summer precipitation increased, pollen preservation and pollen accumulation rates (PAR) also increased. Increased vegetation allowed for increased fire activity during the late glacial period. Regionally, most of the comparison sites also indicated wet conditions during the full glacial period. However, around 21,000 cal yr BP, effective moisture decreased resulting in a dramatic change in the vegetation assemblage. Specifically, the summer wet taxa disappeared, while pollen preservation and PAR decreased, suggesting a dry period until similar to 14,000 cal yr BP. Little fire activity is recorded after 21,000 cal yr BP, likely due to the absence of fuels. At similar to 14,000 cal yr BP, Larrea and Quercus reappear suggesting increased summer precipitation. However, the appearance of Cyperaceae and increases in grasses suggest increased winter precipitation. We suggest that the combination of summer wet and winterwet taxa similar to 14,000 cal yr BP represents an increase in ENSO conditions, while the summer moisture controls remained relatively constant.

Adult and larval fish assemblages vary among small tributary mouths of Green Bay, Lake Michigan	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Small tributaries of the Great Lakes serve as important habitat during critical life stages of many fish species, though temporal and spatial dynamics of the assemblage that uses these systems are seldom investigated. This study quantifies larval and adult fish assemblages captured by fyke net and light traps among small tributary mouths of Green Bay, Lake Michigan. Ten tributaries harbored a total of 45 species representing 17 families, with the most abundant including spottail shiner (Notropis hudsonius (Clinton, 1824)) in adult assemblages and white sucker (Catostomus commersonii (Lacepede, 1803)) in larval assemblages. Larval fish assemblage structures differed over five biweekly sampling events in May and June. Adult fish assemblage structures varied among tributaries but not among spring, summer, and fall samples. Larval and adult species assemblages at these river mouths are likely influenced by hydrology, habitat structure, and species-specific ecology. Water movement may transport larvae into river mouths, as larval assemblages were dominated by species that spawn in coastal habitats. Adult species richness varied with longitude, with the greatest diversity in tributaries on the west shore. This investigation of fish assemblages highlights the spatial and temporal variation that occurs in these systems and their role in shaping fish populations in Green Bay.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				APR	2021	99	4					319	329		10.1139/cjz-2020-0143	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2020-0143													WOS:000640452000009

In this paper, we report the detailed circumstances of the fall and the recovery of all documented Tagish Lake fragments from a strewnfield at least 16 km long and 3 to 4 km wide. Nearly 1 kg of '' pristine '' meteorites were collected one week after the fall before new snow covered the strewn field; the majority of the recovered mass was collected during the spring melt. Ground eyewitnesses and a variety of instrument-recorded observations of the Tagish Lake fireball provide a refined estimate of the fireball trajectory. From its calculated orbit and its similarity to the remotely sensed properties of the D- and P-class asteroids, the Tagish Lake carbonaceous chondrite apparently represents these outer belt asteroids. The cosmogenic nuclide results and modeled production indicate a prefall radius of 2.1-2.4 m (corresponding to 60-90 tons) consistent with the observed fireball energy release. The bulk oxygen-isotope compositions plot just below the terrestrial fractionation line (TFL), following a trend similar to the CM meteorite mixing line. The bulk density of the Tagish Lake material (1.64 0.02 g/cm(3)) is the same, within uncertainty, as the total bulk densities of several C-class and especially D- and P-class asteroids. The high microporosity of Tagish Lake samples (similar to 40%) provides an obvious candidate material for the composition of low bulk density primitive asteroids.					; Brown, Peter/C-8763-2018; Longstaffe, Fred/A-6843-2008	Longstaffe, Fred/0000-0003-4103-4808; Brown, Peter/0000-0001-6130-7039													1086-9379	1945-5100				MAR	2006	41	3					407	431		10.1111/j.1945-5100.2006.tb00471.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1945-5100.2006.tb00471.x													WOS:000236603000006
J	Basnett, S; Kulkarni, AV; Bolch, T				Basnett, Smriti; Kulkarni, Anil V.; Bolch, Tobias			The influence of debris cover and glacial lakes on the recession of glaciers in Sikkim Himalaya, India	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												We investigated area changes in glaciers covering an area of similar to 200 km(2) in the Tista basin, Sikkim, Eastern Indian Himalaya, between similar to 1990 and 2010 using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Indian Remote-sensing Satellite (IRS) images and related the changes to debris cover, supraglacial lakes and moraine-dam lakes. The glaciers lost an area of 3.3 +/- 0.8% between 1989/90 and 2010. More detailed analysis revealed an area loss of 2.00 +/- 0.82, 2.56 +/- 0.61 and 2.28 +/- 2.01 km(2) for the periods 1989-97, 1997-2004/05 and 2004-2009/10, respectively. This indicates an accelerated retreat of glaciers after 1997. On further analysis, we observed (1) the formation and expansion of supraglacial lakes on many debris-covered glaciers and (2) the merging of these lakes over time, leading to the development of large moraine-dam lakes. We also observed that debris-covered glaciers with lakes lose a greater area than debris-covered glaciers without lakes and debris-free glaciers. The climatic data for 24 years (1987-2011), measured at the Gangtok meteorological station (1812 m a.s.l.), showed that the region experienced a 1.0 degrees C rise in the summer minimum temperature and a 2.0 degrees C rise in the winter minimum temperature, indicating hotter summers and warmer winters. There was no significant trend in the total annual precipitation. We find that glacier retreat is caused mainly by a temperature increase and that debris-covered glaciers can retreat at a faster rate than debris-free glaciers, if associated with lakes.

J	BORG, H				BORG, H			TRACE-METALS AND WATER CHEMISTRY OF FOREST LAKES IN NORTHERN SWEDEN	WATER RESEARCH												To study the influence of airborne pollutants on water quality, water samples were taken from 59 forest lakes in northern Sweden along a section of about 1000 km in length. Determinations were made of pH, water colour, conductivity, major ions, nitrogen and phosphorus as well as the metals Fe, Mn, Al, Zn, Cu, Pb, Cd, Ni, Cr, Co, As and V. The lake waters were generally soft, with low levels of electrolytes. The pH values increased and the sulphate concentrations decreased from south to north. The lakes in the southern parts of the area showed evidence of increased deposition of acidifying substances, shown by higher Ca + Mg/alkalinity ratio. A geographical distribution pattern was observed from Zn and to some extent also for Pb and Cd, with the highest concentrations in the south. However, pH and water colour were of major importance for the distribution of trace metals. Mn, Al and Zn were negatively correlated to pH and Fe, Mn, Al, Pb and As were positively correlated to water colour. A multiple regression analysis showed that the distribution of Fe was influenced mainly by water colour, Zn mainly by pH, while Mn and Al were influenced both the pH and colour. Some of the lakes were sampled both in winter and summer and the concentration of metals was found to be around two-fold higher in winter than in summer.																			0043-1354	1879-2448				JAN	1987	21	1					65	72		10.1016/0043-1354(87)90100-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(87)90100-X													WOS:A1987F911100009
J	RAMLAL, PS; KELLY, CA; RUDD, JWM; FURUTANI, A				RAMLAL, PS; KELLY, CA; RUDD, JWM; FURUTANI, A			SITES OF METHYL MERCURY PRODUCTION IN REMOTE CANADIAN SHIELD LAKES	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Methylation and demethylation of mercury were studied in sediments and surface waters of several remote lakes on the Canadian Shield. Radiochemical assays of mercury methylating activity, which peaked during summer, were 20-40 times faster in epilimnetic than in hypolimnetic sediments. Demethylation rates were usually highest during winter and in hypolimnetic sediments. Epilimnetic sediments were capable of producing methyl mercury 20-40 times faster than hypolimnetic sediments sampled at the same time, with methylating activity peaking during the warm summer months. Because of the opposite pattern of methylating and demethylating activity and because epilimnetic sediments often constitute most of the surface area of these lakes, most of the net methylation (M/D) occurred in the epilimnion of the lakes during summer. Mercury methylation rates were not related to average sediment mercury concentrations, or directly to rates of microbial activity (decomposition) in sediments. It appeared that increasing temperature was an important controlling factor that stimulated methylation but retarded demethylation. Specific methylation rates, M/D, and the measured concentration of methyl mercury in the surface waters of the lakes all peaked during midsummer, suggesting that the radiochemical assays used reflected changes in the relative activities of natural methylating and demethylating microorganisms.

J	Vann, CD; Cronin, TM; Dwyer, GS				Vann, CD; Cronin, TM; Dwyer, GS			Population ecology and shell chemistry of a phytal ostracode species (Loxoconcha matagordensis) in the Chesapeake Bay watershed	MARINE MICROPALEONTOLOGY												Population ecology and shell chemistry were studied in the phytal ostracode Loxoconcha matagordensis (Swain 1955) collected from Zostera marina seagrass beds in the Chesapeake Bay to provide seasonal constraints on shell secretion time for paleothermometry. Population density and age structure were defined by two main breeding cycles that occurred between 01 to 15 June and 02 to 16 August 2001. The time interval between breeding cycles was similar to2 months and total juvenile standing crop increased almost three-fold between the first and second breeding cycles. Dark brown over-wintered adults comprised the majority of the population between March and April 2001, while newly secreted translucent adults were predominant between June and September. Seasonal shell Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios were positively correlated with water temperature at both sites, with the strongest correlations occurring between June and September from newly secreted shells at Dameron Marsh. Old, dark brown shells contained 10% to 23% and 1% to 6% less Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca, respectively, than new shells. Because a fossil assemblage of L. matagordensis will contain similar to30% old shells (dark-brown), these results suggest that fossil Mg/Ca ratios yield an integrated late spring to summer temperature signal. Shell Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios of specimens of L. matagordensis collected from living Zostera were positively correlated, suggesting that temperature may influence both elemental ratios. Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios of fossil shells of the related species Loxoconcha sp. A obtained from four sediment cores were also studied and exhibited a weaker correlation between the two elemental ratios. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Lesser scaup spring nutrient reserve dynamics on the lower great lakes	WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN												The North American lesser scaup (Aythya affinis) population has declined since the mid-1980s. The acquisition of nutrient reserves during spring migration may play a role in explaining that trend. We studied nutrient-reserve dynamics of lesser scaup collected during spring at 3 major stopover sites and assessed whether reserves of birds on the lower Great Lakes (LGL) differed from those at other staging (or breeding) areas. At lakes Ontario and St. Clair, males had larger fat reserves than females, but no other substantial sex-related differences were observed in fat, protein, or mineral reserve levels of lesser scaup. Protein in males and mineral reserves of both sexes at lakes Erie and St. Clair did not change throughout spring. Male fat reserves remained constant at Lake Erie and increased at Lake St. Clair whereas female fat and protein reserves increased at both stopover sites. Patterns of fat and protein dynamics in males partly may be due to energetic costs of courtship and pair-bond maintenance. However, maintenance and accumulation of fat reserves in both sexes while on the LGL is important for impending migration and subsequent reproduction. Female lesser scaup staging on the LGL had fat reserves comparable to, or slightly higher than, those reported in other studies of northern spring-staging and breeding birds. Fat reserves of LGL females, however, were much lower than those reported for birds at another midlatitude stopover site. These comparisons suggest that events occurring on Atlantic Flyway wintering areas or LGL staging areas are potential factors contributing to nutrient-reserve limitation and possibly to observed declines in scaup numbers in North America.																			1938-5463					JUN	2006	34	2					395	407		10.2193/0091-7648(2006)34[395:LSSNRD]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.2193/0091-7648(2006)34[395:LSSNRD]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000238702000019

This study focuses on the dunes around Cuona Lake on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. By combining wind simulation and flow calculation with physical and chemical analyses of the sediments (grain size parameter statistics, elemental composition), we infer the processes of lake dune formation in this semi-arid intramontane basin. Meteorological data were used to resolve the temporal variations in wind and precipitation, and sediment transport pathways were identified from simulations based on wind and topographic data. Grain size and elemental analyses of sediment samples were used to characterize the physical and chemical composition of the Cuona Lake Basin dunes and related sediments. Our results show that dune formation in the Cuona Lake Basin occurs under the alternating control of wind and water processes. Dunes form mainly from sediment transported from the lake beach by westerly winds in the winter and spring; rivers flowing in the opposite direction (eastward) in the summer transport dune sand back to the lake beach. This process accounts for the recycling of sand in the landscape. This spatiotemporal coupling between hydrodynamic and wind transport pathways provides a continuous sediment supply for dune formation around the lake.

A millennium-long perspective of flood-related seasonal sediment yield in Mediterranean watersheds	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Mediterranean mountains have been extremely vulnerable to land degradation and soil erosion due to climate factors (summer hydric stress, high storminess) and the long history of human pressure on these terrestrial ecosystems. The short-time span of instrumental monitoring datasets limits our ability to obtain a full depiction of the long-term drivers controlling flood intensity and frequency and soil erosion in Mediterranean watersheds. Here we have applied a novel methodology based on detailed microfacies analyses on annually-laminated (varved) lacustrine sediments to reconstruct floods and seasonal sediment yield and denudation rates in a mountainous Mediterranean watershed during the last 2775 years. The sediment yield reconstruction in this study agrees reasonably well with soil erosion rates from Pyrenean experimental watersheds supporting the validity of this methodology to assess the soil erosion and sediment production from a long-term perspective. The comparison with instrumental precipitation datasets demonstrates the different seasonal sensitivity of sediment yield to heavy rainfall magnitudes mostly depending on soil moisture conditions, soil and regolith erodibility and vegetation cover. During periods of reduced human impact in the watershed, the seasonal maxima in sediment production occurred in autumn, which corresponds to the season with more frequent and intense heavy rainfall in the region. The highest soil erosion rates occurred during periods with higher human impact in the watershed due to sustained burning, overgrazing and cereals cultivation that modified the seasonal sediment yield distribution, with the highest sediment production happening in winter. The most significant periods of increased sediment yield occurred during the Middle Ages (1168-1239 CE) and the 19th century (1844-1866 CE) due to an interplay between increased frequencies and magnitudes of heavy rainfall and intensive agropastoral activities in the lake's watershed. This study highlights the potential of seasonally-resolved archives to adequately evaluate the environmental drivers and mechanisms controlling flood dynamics and soil erosion at decadal to centennial time-scales in areas with strong seasonality.

However, few winter studies exist and interactions between fish hosts and their parasites are typically confined to snapshot studies restricted to the summer season whereas host-parasite dynamics during the ice-covered period rarely have been explored. The present study addresses seasonal patterns in the infections of intestinal parasites and their association with the diet of sympatric living Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) in Lake Takvatn, a subarctic lake in northern Norway. In total, 354 Arctic charr and 203 brown trout were sampled from the littoral habitat between June 2017 and May 2018. Six trophically transmitted intestinal parasite taxa were identified and quantified, and their seasonal variations were contrasted with dietary information from both stomachs and intestines of the fish. The winter period proved to be an important transmission window for parasites, with increased prevalence and intensity of amphipod-transmitted parasites in Arctic charr and parasites transmitted through fish prey in brown trout. In Arctic charr, seasonal patterns in parasite infections resulted mainly from temporal changes in diet toward amphipods, whereas host body size and the utilization of fish prey were the main drivers in brown trout. The overall dynamics in the community structure of parasites chiefly mirrored the seasonal dietary shifts of their fish hosts.

Abundances of rotifer species were positively correlated with experimental densities of 4th instar Chaoborus trivittatus larvae, a major crustacean predator in 1976. Experimental alteration of the densities of Daphnia rosea and Diaptomus leptopus and D. kenai in 1978 produced highly significant increases in rotifer biomass only under Daphnia removal, but not under copepod removal. Inorganic fertilizer additions to enclosures in 1978 and 1979 revealed minimal rotifer increases unless pulsed additions were large or Daphnia were also excluded. Large demographic responses of rotifers to low fertilizer loadings in the absence of Daphnia confirmed the pre-eminence of competitive food limitation in producing rotifer scarcity in summer.																			0029-8549	1432-1939					1984	61	2					175	181		10.1007/BF00396756	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00396756								28309407					WOS:A1984SD72000005

Sampling has been done during the summer time for the dry season and in winter for the wet season. The results have shown a high spatial and temporal variability of the physicochemical parameters of these waters. So, it comes true that the alternation of a wet season with a dry one in the Mediterranean climate causes a deep alternate modification of the hydrochemical characteristics of wetlands, in particular their ionic concentration and pH as well as their salinity.						, ENSA (Agro.)- NHSA (agronomy) - Algiers/0000-0002-9443-6811													0002-1857					MAR-JUN	2007	51	2-3					121	129																WOS:000250799400004

However, most of the lakes in the world freeze during the winter, and few studies of groundwater and surface water interaction (groundwater discharge tracing) focus on ice-covered lakes. This study investigated groundwater discharge into a large ice-covered lake, Xiao Qaidam Lake in the Tibetan Plateau (TP), using sat-ellite remote sensing and chemical and isotopic tracing. Analysis of chemical components, stable isotopes (D, O-18) and Rn-222 revealed that groundwater discharge occurred in the western and southern portions of Xiao Qaidam Lake. Remote sensing data (the distribution of and variation in lake surface temperature, LST) revealed these locations of groundwater discharge and indicated additional groundwater discharge in areas of springs. Based on the regression model between LST and Rn-222 activity in lake water and 222Rn mass balance model, the groundwater discharge into Xiao Qaidam Lake was estimated to be (2.77 +/- 0.26) x 10(5) m(3)/d, which is slightly higher than river water input at summer. In addition, this study also suggests that ice melting process should be considered when tracing groundwater discharge into an ice-covered lake, and that the LST distribution during the icing period is better than the LST variation for tracing groundwater discharge because the ice eliminated noise from wind and surface water. The study provides insight into the tracing of groundwater discharge into large ice-covered lakes in the TP and elsewhere.

J	Lindholm, T				Lindholm, T			Periodic anoxia in an emerging coastline lake basin in SW Finland	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Inre Verkviken, a fjord-like, 20 m deep inlet in northern Aland, SW Finland, was probably a holomictic brackishwater lake nearly completely isolated from the sea by land uplift (about 0.5 cm yr(-1)) before 1929 when a canal was built to the Bothnian Sea. The canal was enlarged in the 1950s and again in 1978, keeping Inre Verkviken brackish (5-6 parts per thousand). Inre Verkviken is now (the 1990s) in a phase of periodic meromixis - for the second time in about 100 years - as it undergoes a second process of lake formation due to land uplift. Anoxic conditions often prevail below 10-12 m depth. The summer oxygen conditions are unpredictable as they depend on the spring mixing patterns, which again largely depend on the duration of ice cover, the meteorological conditions, and the timing and quantity of spring runoff.																			0018-8158					JUN 14	1996	325	3					223	230		10.1007/BF00014988	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00014988													WOS:A1996UZ71200007

Here, we tested the hypothesis that the relative abundance of mixotrophic flagellates in lakes increases along an elevational gradient paralleling increasingly oligotrophic conditions. For this purpose, 12 lakes located between 575 and 2796 m above sea level were sampled in summer and fall to include two different seasonal windows in phytoplankton dynamics and environmental conditions. The degree of mixotrophy in phytoplankton was estimated in tracer experiments using fluorescently-labeled bacteria and done with composite samples collected in the euphotic zone and in samples obtained from the chlorophyll-a maximum. The results indicated the existence of a positive trend particularly in summer in the relative abundance of mixotrophic flagellates with elevation, however, this trend was not linear, and exceptions along the elevational gradient were found. Changes in the relative abundance of mixotrophic flagellates were related with significant changes in water transparency, DOC and phosphorus concentrations, as well as in bacterial and flagellate abundance. Overall, our results reveal that the harsh growth conditions found in oligotrophic high mountain lakes favor a mixotrophic trophic strategy among phytoplankton.

The Wular Lake is ideally situated close to the modern intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) in the NWH and fed by the Jhelum River draining the vast Kashmir Valley, which receives seasonal precipitations from the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) and Western Disturbances (WD). In this study, size segregated lithic fractions (sand, silt, and clay) and elemental concentrations (TOC, TN, Ba, Al, Mn, and Fe) have been measured in the C-14-AMS dated NWC sediment core collected from this lake. The continuous NWC sedimentary records reveal temporal environmental changes (water level, organic detritus supply, and redox conditions) in this open mega-lake system suggesting prevailed hydroclimate variations in the valley during the late Holocene. The captured hydroclimate variations are a wetter phase (~4.2-3.4 cal kyr BP) followed by relatively drier conditions and extreme drought before the wet Little Ice Age (LIA). The plausible forcing seems to be the latitudinal ITCZ migration regulated seasonal precipitations from the tropical/subtropical moisture sources. The ISM to WD moisture turnover dominated winter over summer precipitations in the valley during the former warm and wet phase but unequivocally reflected during the cold and wet LIA. Additional hydroclimate control comes from permafrost ice melting episodes of a few centuries duration during high solar activity events (sunspot number >= 50). A comparison with the regional studies further indicates that NWC records capture hydroclimate signatures widespread in the NWH.

The authors drew a parallel between other Finno-Ugric people's taboos. The article deals with spiritual and moral values which are reflected in Mari folklore. Outlook of the Mari is reflected in their relation to the surrounding world - the earth, sky, the sun, the moon, rivers, lakes, springs, forest and its inhabitants - animals, birds, and insects. Following the rules and principles established by the ancestors the Maris believe in preserving harmony with nature, relatives. Mari folk wisdom related with trees and sacred groves was worked out over the centuries, and it appeared from the experience and observation, folded tips, suggestions and restrictions which gradually became life principles and the guidelines that the Maris should abide strictly. The most part of Mari prohibitions, bans and taboos are related with ancient pagan cult concepts. They believed that existence and prosperity depended on worshiped objects and phenomena. The main function of bans and taboos was to respect for the objects of worship. Observance of taboos was to ensure the protection of these forces, security and well-being of the generation, family and relatives, an individual. Being surrounded by nature, drawing analogies between objects and phenomena of the world, ancient people made conclusions, influenced by the rules and laws that determined the range of restrictions and prohibitions. For example, seeing the growth of trees and how trees come to life in the spring and fall into a state of sleep in autumn the Maris concluded that the trees were alive. The Maris believed that trees felt pain as people. Consequently, it was not allowed to cut trees without any special needs. Mari taboos related with sacred trees and groves are inscribed in religious, ethical, aesthetic ideas. They govern the relationship between man and nature, define the hierarchy of relations between the members of the ethnic community and family, have a great educational effect, and define a man's place in the world.

This paper investigates the dynamic characteristics of phosphorus (P) contamination on the surface sediment at a river confluence of the Huai River, China, where water and sediment contamination is severe. The results highlight that P contamination of the surface sediment at a river confluence is more severe than that of the main stream of the river network to which the river confluence belongs. Floods have critical impact on the transport of sediment and its surface texture. In the annual water cycle the initial small flood can convey much more contaminated sediment and pollute the downstream river, whereas the subsequent large flood leads to the coarsening of the surface sediment and decrease of the total P (TP) content on the surface sediment (TPS). Water temperature is one of the most important factors affecting the temporal variability of the TPS at the river confluence. Higher P amounts are adsorbed on the surface sediment during lower water temperatures in winter and spring. Calcium bound P (Ca-P) is a relatively stable fraction of the sedimentary P during the dynamic processes of contamination of the surface sediment, and the nonapatite P gets released from the surface sediment during the summer. Effects of P concentration of the surface water and that of pH on TPS variability are not discernable in the current study. These results will be useful for controlling phosphorus contamination at river confluences and in river networks.

The seasonal development of epiphytes showed a pronounced productivity maximum in May (610 mg C m-2 Phragmites stand day-1) and a maximum chlorophyll a content of 414 mg m-2 Phragmites stand. Substratum limitation was indicated during the spring maximum. Primary productivity and biomass decreased to low values in late summer, mainly due to shading from the aerial shoots. Significant quantitative heterogeneities in epiphyte biomass occurred over a few decimeters of Phragmites stem. Productivity and biomass were higher on old stems than on new ones throughout the group period. The annual epiphyte production (23.7 g C m-2 Phragmites stand) was mainly a result of the spring maximum. The fact that 64% was produced on old stems emphasizes the importance of the highly variable degree to which these may be destroyed. The host plant phenology appears from this investigation to be a key factor affecting epiphyte growth in the emergent vegetation determined by the amount of available substratum and the light penetration through the canopy.																			0105-9327						1984	7	2					202	210																WOS:A1984SX64700015

Snow depth and density, and ice thickness were also measured in order to understand how they affected and were affected by ice temperature variability. The lowest ice temperature (-15.5 degrees C) and steepest temperature gradient (-39.8 degrees C m(-1)) occurred during a 9 week period in autumn 2002/03 when there was no snow on the ice. With snow on the ice, temperature gradients were more typically in the range -20 to -5 degrees C m(-1). Average ice temperatures were lower during the warmer, first winter, and higher during the cooler, second winter because of differences in the depth and duration of the snow cover. Isothermal ice near the freezing point resulted from flooding and snow-ice formation, and brief episodes of warm weather with freezing rain. Under these circumstances, congelation-ice growth at the bottom of the ice cover was interrupted, even reversed. it is suggested that the patterns in temperatures brought about by the snow-ice formation and rain events may become more prevalent due to the increase in frequency of these events in central Alaska if temperature and precipitation change as predicted by Arctic climate models.																			0260-3055		0-946417-35-0				2005	40						89	94		10.3189/172756405781813825	http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/172756405781813825													WOS:000235930300015
J	SMITH, MW; SAUNDERS, JW				SMITH, MW; SAUNDERS, JW			THE AMERICAN EEL IN CERTAIN FRESH WATERS OF THE MARITIME PROVINCES OF CANADA	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												Estimated standing crops of eels in eight Maritime lakes treated with fish poisons varied from 0 to 70.8 pounds per acre. Smaller standing crops were associated with greater distances of lakes from the sea, and with obstructions to ascending elvers. Few eels were found in small spring-fed streams. The eel is prominent in Maritime lakes, but frequently is not more successful than other fish considered inimical to game species. Seaward migrations of eels may represent major losses of organic matter to lakes. Scales appear on young eels at lengths from 16 to 20 cm, probably in their third or fourth year of age. Nine year-classes were found among eels with scales in each of three limnetic populations. Eels with three and four annual rings on the scales were dominant in the runs from lakes. Runs of eels from lakes occurred in April and May, and again, in larger numbers, from late August through November. These movements were at night, and usually coincident with rising water during and immediately following heavy rains. Silvering, an index of maturity, was manifest among only a portion of the largest of these eels. Fall runs of large eels from salt water into streams have been noted. Up-stream movements of elvers are most prominent in May and June, although they attempted to bypass a barrier in the outlet of one lake throughout the summer.																									1955	12	2					238	269		10.1139/f55-016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f55-016													WOS:A1955WZ51200003

The count of cellulolytic bacteria and decomposition rate of litter cellulose increased rapidly during the initial month. In contrast, the count of cellulolytic fungi was lowest in this period. Pseudomonas accounted for 65-90% of total isolates of cellulolytic bacteria up to 5 months.

In most cases, it is rather hard to restore a vegetated clear state due to reduced resilience caused by a blend of complicated factors. In this study, we successfully reestablished a plant community in a small hypereutrophic lake over a certain period. In winter and spring with transparency of >55 cm and temperature of <20 degrees C, a submerged stands bed formed gradually under strong human interventions. The reestablished plant bed displayed obvious seasonal succession and prolonged the clear-water stage until July 2005, when it collapsed. The regime shift to a turbid state was mainly attributed to the decreasing biomass of stands bed and mechanical damage brought about by the elimination of Spirodela polyrhiza, increasing water temperature. P concentration as well as periphyton biomass, etc. The reestablishment also changed the aquatic ecosystem greatly. A 'clear-water' stage was characterized by higher NO3--N, NH4+-N, electrical conductivity, transparency and TN/TP level and more cladocerans (mainly Daphnia pulex), while the turbid state was characterized by higher temperature, chlorophyll a and TP level and more abundant rotifers. It is thus viable to restore submerged macrophytes in such lakes in winter and spring, when transparency is relatively high while temperature and water level are low. Nevertheless, to obtain a long-term, vegetated clear state, control of internal nutrient loading by means of obstruction, purification, dredging or solidification, is extremely necessary since nutrients play an important role in regime shifts as evidenced by the present case, too.

Its ecosystem has been systematically investigated since 1976, and sporadically since the 1950s. Monitoring programmes have included studies on its hydrology, water chemistry and biology (phytoplankton, bacterioplankton, zooplankton, benthos, macrophytes and fish). The sampling frequency per vegetation season (spring, summer and autumn) has varied from 2 to 6 times, and samples have been collected at 20-60 fixed stations in the different zones of the lake. These long-term investigations covering over 40 years serve as a good basis for understanding the processes taking place in Lake Ladoga, as well as for assessing the changes and current environmental conditions. Until the early 1960s, Lake Ladoga was oligotrophic and characterized by good water quality; but within the past 30 years, as a result of human impact, its ecological state seems to have deteriorated. Especially since the 1970s, its trophic state has changed to mesotrophic, with elevated nutrient concentrations, reduced transparency and poorer fish catches, together with structural changes in its plankton, zoobenthos and fish communities. During the last decades, several planktonic, benthic and fish species that are sensitive to eutrophication have disappeared. Conditions in the whole lake, and especially at some of the worst-polluted sites, have actually improved in recent years, however, due to the closing of some of the sources of industrial pollution, and some signs of a recovery have been observed. The present species composition points to mesotrophic and eutrophic conditions in the coastal regions, but mainly oligo-mesotrophic conditions in the pelagic areas. The aim of this paper is to describe and assess monitoring practices in Lake Ladoga and the results obtained, future prospects, changes that have occurred and the current state of the ecosystems.																			1463-4988	1539-4077					2008	11	1					61	74		10.1080/14634980801891548	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634980801891548													WOS:000253732400009

Roadside snowmelt: a management target to reduce lake and river contamination	INLAND WATERS												Major ion concentrations have greatly increased in many north temperate lakes and rivers over the last 3 decades as the result of deicing materials applied to their surrounding roads in winter. Salt-based deicing will likely continue or increase in the future, and preventative management strategies require an improved understanding of the flow pathways and timing of road salt and associated contaminant fluxes to downstream receiving waters. In the present study, we focused on the catchment of Saint-Charles River and its reservoir that provides drinking water for Quebec City, Canada. Major ion concentrations were measured in river waters and snowbanks along roads in subcatchments that differed in degree of urbanization, and during the same winter-spring period a mooring system was installed in the reservoir to continuously record conductivity. Large significant differences were found in the concentration and temporal behavior of ions between urbanized and forested watersheds. Snow sampled at 1 m from the roads had elevated concentrations of salts and other contaminants, and the highest solute concentrations in the reservoir and river waters occurred during snowmelt events. The results indicate that management of roadside snowmelt runoff during thawing events may largely prevent salt-associated contamination, and that winter snowmelt will require increasing attention as the climate continues to warm.					; Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019	Fournier, Isabelle/0000-0002-0065-2338; Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938													2044-2041	2044-205X				JAN 2	2022	12	1			SI		47	60		10.1080/20442041.2020.1801312	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2020.1801312		NOV 2020											WOS:000596985300001

Habitat use by cranes wintering in the Rich Lake area was studied during January and February, 1979 and 1980. At least 150,000 cranes roosted on Rich Lake, and additional birds roosted on other pluvial lakes in the region. Percentage availability of each habitat type surrounding Rich Lake was compared to relative use by cranes, either by following radio-marked cranes or by systemic ground transects. Waste grain in harvested milo fields was the primary food. Milo stubble and playa lake habitats were used by cranes in greater (P < 0.05) and cotton stubble and native mesquite grasslands in lesser (P < 0.05) proportion than percentage availability. Hectares of milo stubble were 60% greater in 1979 than 1980, but the amount of waste grain in fields was three times greater in 1980. Fields disked or plowed prior to late February reduced the food base for wintering cranes. Pluvial lakes served as night roosts, and most drinking water was obtained from freshwater springs bordering the lakes. Daily mean distance cranes which flew from Rich Lake was 10.8 km in 1979 and 7.8 km in 1980. Crane density, habitat availability, and mean daily distances flown from Rich Lake differed between 1979 and 1980.																			0022-541X	1937-2817					1985	49	4					1074	1083		10.2307/3801398	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3801398													WOS:A1985ATT9300044

Liver, gills and kidney of both sexes were analyzed for total glutathione, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase, glyoxalase I, glyoxalase II, while muscle was analyzed for arsenic, lead, cadmium and mercury. The MRLs (maximum residue limits) set by actual regulation were not exceeded for heavy metals, but a seasonal and sex-linked variability of antioxidant parameters was observed, and major variations occurred especially in summer and autumn. In this shallow lake, heavy metal accumulation did not affect the biochemical variations, which are rather due to the decreased water level inducing hyperoxia and hypoxia within 24 h, high temperature and loss of mating and refuge areas.

J	Sutton, TM; Ney, JJ				Sutton, TM; Ney, JJ			Trophic resource overlap between age-0 striped bass and largemouth bass in Smith Mountain Lake, Virginia	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Small body size in fall and low winter survival of fingerling striped bass Morone saxatilis stocked into Smith Mountain Lake, Virginia, have been attributed to slow growth during summer months. Although small size at stocking appears to be the primary factor restricting fish prey consumption and rapid growth, trophic competition may also be a contributing factor. We examined the food habits of sympatric populations of age-0 striped bass and largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides over the 1994 and 1995 growing seasons to assess temporal and length-related patterns and similarities in trophic resource use. With increasing predator length, food habits for both species shifted from zooplankton to insect and then to fish as the principal prey items over both growing seasons. Except for fish smaller than 50 mm during June and July 1994, diet overlap was insufficient (Schoener's index value <0.60) to suggest trophic competition. Striped bass between 50 and 100 mm long primarily ate aquatic insects and cyprinids, whereas largemouth bass in the same length range ate aquatic and terrestrial insects. Cyprinids were the principal fish prey of striped bass less than 100 mm long, with age-0 alewives Alosa pseudoharengus becoming the predominant prey for larger individuals. Darters and age-0 sunfishes constituted the primary fish prey of largemouth bass regardless of body length. Although temporal and length-related segregation by food habitats may be sufficient to minimize trophic overlap, limitations in these resources may cause interspecific competition, especially for smaller individuals. We recommend releasing striped bass at a larger size (>50 mm) and earlier in the growing season to minimize the potential for trophic competition with age-0 largemouth bass immediately after stocking.

J	HEATH, MR				HEATH, MR			SIZE SPECTRUM DYNAMICS AND THE PLANKTONIC ECOSYSTEM OF LOCH-LINNHE	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Zooplankton data from 12 surveys in Loch Linnhe, west Scotland, conducted at monthly intervals have been used to assess some aspects of ecosystem size spectrum theory. On each survey sampling was carried out by towed deployments of an Optical PIankton Counter (OPC), together with lower resolution collections by conventional sampling nets. Comparisons between biomass analyses of the net-caught material, and the in situ OPC data showed acceptable agreement over the year. Monthly variations in net import/export and in situ production of particle size classes in each basin of the sea loch between successive surveys were estimated from the OPC and conservative tracer (salinity) data. The results showed that, despite the semi-enclosed nature of the system, exchange with the open sea was an important component of annual population dynamics. Import of zooplankton was especially significant during the spring period. Over the year as a whole, the loch was a net importer of small zooplankton and a net exporter of large size classes. Changes in the biomass of particle size classes, not accounted for by advection and mixing, were interpreted as being due to growth and mortality in the loch. The ratio of mortality:growth showed a consistent seasonal pattern of changes with size. Net biomass growth occurred only during the summer months, with net loss of biomass due to mortality during the winter. The results allow a quantitative illustration of the principles of the match-mismatch hypothesis, whereby species cohorts which coincide in time and size with periods of high net biomass growth are those which generate high recruitment.

During the research period. Sept. 1978 to March 1979, Idotea was found to be the most abundant (in terms of biomass) invertebrate species in the eelgrass beds of Lake Grevelingen. Calculations show that Idotea can only play a minor role in the breakdown of eelgrass after the growing season: only between 2.9 and 5.8% (maximally) of the standing crop of eelgrass at the 3 permanent plots was consumed by this invertebrate. The fast decline of the standing eelgrass crop after the growing season is mainly due to transport of large leaf fragments (> 10 cm) from the eelgrass beds by wind and wave action.																			0077-7579						1984	18	3-4					384	394		10.1016/0077-7579(84)90011-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0077-7579(84)90011-5													WOS:A1984ASJ2800011

Lynn			ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF PROJECTED CLIMATE CHANGE ON OUTDOOR RECREATION IN TENNESSEE	GLOBAL CHANGE AND FORESTRY: ECONOMIC AND POLICY IMPACTS AND RESPONSES	Climate Change and its Causes Effects and Prediction											Climate change projections from three General Circulation Models were used to adjust the temperature and precipitation in 2030 and 2080 in each of five ecological provinces in Tennessee to estimate the direct economic effects of the projected changes on recreation using the Tourism Climatic Index. The indirect effects on recreation were evaluated qualitatively, based on current demand for the unique values associated with current conditions. The results of the direct impact evaluation reveal that climate change will have variable effects on recreational activities in Tennessee. The magnitude and direction of the effects vary by the recreational activity involved, patterns of precipitation and temperature regimes, and specific location in Tennessee. Recreational activities such as rock climbing, winter activities independent of snow, and whitewater boating are likely to benefit from projected climate changes due to increased temperatures in the winter months. Summer-based activities such as lake recreation and camping are likely to decline with increasing seasonal temperatures. The indirect effects of climate change on recreation are likely to have a larger effect than the direct impacts of climatic variables.					; Dale, Virginia/ABI-6672-2020	Hodges, Donald/0000-0001-6751-0927; Fogel, Jonah/0000-0003-2785-3444; Dale, Virginia/0000-0002-4123-7202															978-1-60876-262-0				2010							17	31																WOS:000281447700002
J	HERCZEG, AL				HERCZEG, AL			A STABLE CARBON ISOTOPE STUDY OF DISSOLVED INORGANIC CARBON CYCLING IN A SOFTWATER LAKE	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												The dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) cycle in a softwater lake was studied using natural variations of the stable isotopes of carbon, 12C and 13C. During summer stratification there was a progressive decrease in epilimnion DIC concentration with a concomitant increase in .delta.13CDIC to preferential uptake of 12C by phytoplankton and a change in the dominant CO2 source from inflow and in situ oxidation to invasion from the atmosphere. There was an increase in hypolimnion DIC concentration throughout summer with a concomitant general decrease in .delta.13CDIC from oxidation of the isotopically light particulate organic carbon tha sank down through the thermocline from the epilimnion. Mass balance calculations of DI12C and DI13C in the epilimnion for the summer (June 23-September 25) yield a mean rate of net conversion of DIC to organic carbon (Corg) of 430 .+-. 150 moles d-1 (6.5 .+-. 1.8 mmoles m-2 d-1). Net CO2 invasion from the atmosphere was 420 .+-. 120 moles d-1 (6.2 .+-. 1.8 m moles m-2 d-1) with an exchange coefficient of 0.6 .+-. 0.3 m d-1. These results imply that at least for the summer months the phytoplankton obtained about 90% of their carbon from atmosphere CO2. About 50% of CO2 invasion and conversion to Corg for the summer occurred during a two week interval mid-summer. DIC concentration increased in the hypolimnion at a rate of 350 .+-. 70 moles DIC d-1 during summer stratification. The amount of DIC added to the hypolimnion was equivalent to 75 .+-. 20% of net conversion of DIC to Corg in the euphotic zone over spring and summer implying rapid degradation of POC in the hypolimnion. The .delta.13C of DIC added to the deep water (-22.permill.) was too heavy to have been derived from oxidation of particulate organic carbon alone. About 20% of the added DIC must have diffused from hypolimnetic sediments where relatively heavy CO2 (-7.permill.) was produced by a combination of POC oxidation and as a by-product of methanogenesis.

C10S14	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												[1] A recurrent coastal sediment plume (RCP) is an episodic event in the southern basin of Lake Michigan that typically coincides with the spring diatom bloom. Strong winter storm activity during El Nino conditions in 1998 resulted in a large and intense RCP event. Consistently higher values of the light-saturated rate of photosynthesis, P-max(B), were observed in spring 1998 compared to 1999 and 2000. Higher values of P-max(B) in 1998 appeared to be related to increased availability of phosphorus, as evidenced by significant correlations of P-max(B) with soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP). Light-saturated growth rates were also significantly correlated with SRP concentrations. These findings were consistent the view that the RCP was a source of enrichment. However, incubation experiments involving lake water enriched with sediments showed relatively small increases in growth and photosynthetic parameters, while enrichments with river water exhibited elevated rates. This result, along with increased levels of river discharge in 1998 and high levels of dissolved phosphorus in river water, supported the view that riverine inputs rather than the RCP were responsible for the higher photosynthetic parameters and growth seen for coastal margin assemblages. Despite the higher levels of P-max(B) in 1998, model analyses revealed that reduced light availability resulting from the intense RCP event constrained phytoplankton growth rates and primary production during this season and apparently suppressed the development of a typical spring bloom. These findings indicate a potential for reduced ecosystem productivity in response to extreme storm events, the frequency of which may increase with projected long-term climate changes.

J	LATHROP, RC				LATHROP, RC			EVALUATION OF WHOLE-LAKE NITROGEN-FERTILIZATION FOR CONTROLLING BLUE-GREEN-ALGAL BLOOMS IN A HYPEREUTROPHIC LAKE	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Indian Lake, a shallow hypereutrophic lake in southern Wisconsin [USA], was treated with ammonium nitrate to test whether high dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations or high total nitrogen to phosphorus (N:P) ratios could prevent the development of summer blue-green algal blooms (predominately Microcystis saeruginosa). The fertilizer was applied weekly from late April to early July 1981-82 in annual amounts of 14 and 23 g N/m2 respectively. In 1981, a dense summer blue-green algal bloom developed, although both dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) and algal P (particulate P/chlorophyll a) were lower than in summers without fertilizer treatments. In 1982, unusually clear water in May allowed aquatic macrophytes and associated filamentous algae to become very dense in June. The increase in water clarity and macrophytes was probably a response to a fishkill the previous winter. Later in the summer the macrophyte community disappeared and a blue-green algal bloom developed. After each fertilization in both treatment years, the NH4+ and NO3- decreased rapidly, suggesting nitrification/denitrification in the lake sediments. Whole-lake N fertilization did not prevent the summer blue-green algal blooms in Indian Lake. Low DIN apparently does not trigger the bloom development or cause the vernal nonblue-green algae to decline. Also, low total N:P ratios (< 11 by weight) during the blooms occur partly because of high DIP and because of high algal P levels resulting from luxury P consumption. The Indian Lake data suggest that low total N:P ratios are only predictive of (or resultant from) blue-green algal blooms rather than causative.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				DEC	1988	45	12					2061	2075		10.1139/f88-240	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f88-240													WOS:A1988R344700002
J	HAKANSON, L				HAKANSON, L			TIME COMPATIBILITY OF WATER CHEMICAL LAKE VARIABLES	INTERNATIONALE REVUE DER GESAMTEN HYDROBIOLOGIE												This paper summarizes results from extensive field work in 95 Swedish lakes. The focus is on methodological aspects of importance when establishing the time compatibility of traditional water variables (monthly data on pH, Secchi depth, temperature, alkalinity, total-P, conductivity, Fe, Ca, hardness and colour from 4 years, 1986 to 1989). From most textbooks in limnology, it is evident that there exist patterns, in terms of how the concentrations and the variability of the concentrations of these standard variables vary in lakes. Then it would be interesting to see if there exists patterns also for the time compatibility between different lake variables and different variants of the same variable, i.e., mean values from different periods. This issue is discussed in a systematic way in this paper with statistical methods. These results are of importance in ecosystem analyses, monitoring and modelling. These parameters generally vary in a lake, both temporally and areally, the focus here is on such variations and how to express lake-typical, time compatible values for longer periods of time. Selected results: High correlations (r2-values) exist between (1) mean annual pH and all the variants of alkalinity and lake colour for different periods of time, (2) between mean (3 year) total-P and most of the variants of total-P, especially those from the winter period (months 10 to 12; r2 almost-equal-to 0.95), but not for the variants from the spring and the summer periods, when the variability is great for total-P, (3) between mean (3 year) lake colour and most of the variants of Fe and pH, especially those from the first half of the year for pH and those from the second half of the year for Fe. Quite high r2-values, about 0.5, exist between colour and different variants from the winter period for total-P and Secchi depth.																			0020-9309						1994	79	2					197	212		10.1002/iroh.19940790205	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19940790205													WOS:A1994NW40300003

Geographical isolation and genetic differentiation: the case of Orestias ascotanensis (Teleostei: Cyprinodontidae), an Andean killifish inhabiting a highland salt pan	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY												Orestias ascotanensis is a killifish endemic to the Ascotan salt pan in the Chilean Altiplano, where it inhabits 12 springs with different degrees of isolation. This species is a suitable model for studying the effect of serial geographical isolations on the differentiation process among populations. The present study examines the genetic variation and structure of the species using mitochondrial DNA control region sequences and eight microsatellite loci, analyzing populations across its distribution range. The evaluation of genetic variation revealed high levels of diversity within the species. The genetic structure analysis showed the existence of four differentiated groups: two groups were formed by the springs located in the northern and southern extremes of the salt pan and two groups were found in the centre of the salt pan. The latter two groups were formed by several springs, most likely as a consequence of the South American summer monsoon that could connect them and allow gene flow. The patterns of genetic differentiation appear to be determined based on the physical isolation of the populations. This isolation may be the result of a combination of factors, including geographical distance, a historical decrease in water levels and altitude differences in the springs of the salt pan. Therefore, this system is a rare example in which hydrological factors can explain genetic differentiation on a very small scale.

J	Andrieux, F; Aminot, A				Andrieux, F; Aminot, A			A two-year survey of phosphorus speciation in the sediments of the Bay of Seine (France)	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												The distribution pattern and temporal variations of concentrations of phosphorus forms were studied in the sediments of the Bay of Seine in seven cruises over the period of 1992-1994. Calcium-bound phosphate (Ca-P) contributed over 50% of the sedimentary phosphorus pool, while exchangeable phosphate (exch-P) and Fe/Al-bound phosphate (Fe/Al-P) respectively made up less than 16% and 38% of total phosphorus. Concentrations of Ca-P were quite constant all over the bay, a consequence of the marine origin of the sediments' calcareous fraction. However, exchangeable phosphate and Fe/Al-bound phosphate (and thus total phosphorus) concentrations showed a mean east/west gradient highlighting the influence of particulate inputs from the Seine plume. Concentrations of inorganic phosphorus forms showed few temporal variations and are an almost permanent feature of the sediments. Finally, organic phosphorus (orga-P) was he only form to exhibit significant spatio-temporal variations. Its strong increase from winter to spring and summer can be related to phytoplankton growth, but remineralization prevents orga-P from accumulating. Potentially bioavailable phosphorus, constituted by orga-P and exch-P, represented mean proportions of no more than 20-40% of the total sedimentary phosphorus pool. This means that enrichment assessments based on total phosphorus alone are questionable. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Sedge/Grass Meadow Restoration on Former Agricultural Lands along a Lake Ontario Drowned-River-Mouth Tributary	ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION												Restoration of sedge/grass meadow habitat was implemented on former agricultural lands adjacent to a Lake Ontario drowned-river-mouth tributary at an elevation that historically supports this community type. Four hectares of land were disked in spring and seeded with diverse wetland mixes containing sedges, grasses, and f orbs, with additional Calamagrostis canadensis (bluejoint) and Carex stricta (upright sedge) seeds added. Seedling plugs of C. canadensis and C. stricta were also planted. Mowing at a height of 45 cm to control tall, invasive annual weeds prior to seed-set was conducted as an adaptive management practice. Three years after implementation, C. canadensis and C. stricta were not found, but seeded Carex vulpinoidea (fox sedge) was dominant, and seeded Carex lupulina (hop sedge) and Carex lurida (shallow sedge) were also present. Most invasive annuals were rare, but canopies created by larger perennials may pose future problems. Although a greenhouse seed-bank emergence study was conducted, field sampling suggested that plants growing on adjacent lands were a better predictor of future plant communities, with select seeded species serving as a secondary predictor. Failure of some sedges to survive after seeding likely was not related to stratification or diurnal temperature range. However, inadequate soil moisture related to soil type and a second-year drought likely played a role, as might loss of viability of seeds during storage. Future efforts on similar lands might use fresh Carex seeds broadcast in autumn for over-winter stratification, and specially developed seed mixes could focus on species that established at the site and native species found nearby, while avoiding some potential problem species.																			1543-4060	1543-4079				JUN 1	2016	34	2					135	146		10.3368/er.34.2.135	http://dx.doi.org/10.3368/er.34.2.135													WOS:000456494900009

The population in Gjende has an exclusive 2-yr life clcyle and that in Bessvatn a 3-yr cycle which is exceptionally long both among freshwater and marine zooplankton. Bessvatn is situated about 400 m higher than Gjende, and the heat preservation is lower with longer periods of ice cover and lower primary production explaining the difference in cycle length. The prolongation of the life cycle is due mainly to retardation of the developmental rate during the long periods of winter stagnation with water temperatures mostly below 2.degree. C. The retardation is especially evident in the nauplii and in the copepodid instars III, IV, and V. Neither population diapauses.

Since the 1950s, 24 reservoirs have been constructed along a 918 km stretch of the upper Yellow River (UYR), creating the highest concentration of cascade reservoirs. This development has had significant ecological impacts on the surrounding environment. This study examines the relationship between reservoir attributes and climate factors to evaluate the environmental effects of reservoirs in the UYR. (1) Following reservoir construction, the average annual temperature and precipitation increased by 3-10%, though seasonal and spatial distributions varied. Temperature increases were most pronounced in winter, while precipitation decreased in some regions during spring and summer, although the overall trend remained positive. (2) The ecosystem experienced significant post-construction changes, including reductions in arable land, grassland, and unused land, while water bodies, construction land, and forests expanded. Consequently, the ecosystem within the reservoir area now accounts for 5.2-12.5% of the total area of the region. (3) Temperature and precipitation were closely linked to reservoir attributes, with storage volume (CAP) and long-term average flow (DIS) significantly affecting precipitation, while surface area (AREA) and normal storage level (FSL) had a greater influence on temperature. In conclusion, the dual impacts of reservoir construction on local climate and land use highlight the complex environmental mechanisms involved, providing valuable insights for future reservoir development and ecological protection in the Yellow River Basin and similar regions.																				2076-3417				MAR	2025	15	5							2816	10.3390/app15052816	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app15052816													WOS:001442374300001

We studied the vertical distributions of Cyclops cf. sibiricus in Lake Toya, a north temperate oligotrophic lake. During the winter circulation period, their distribution was vertically homogeneous both day and night. During the summer stratification period, C. cf. sibiricus stayed below the thermocline. Diel vertical migration (DVM) was pronounced in advanced developmental stages, although the upper limit of the migration became deeper as the thermocline gradually descended. This seasonal change was observed throughout the 4-year study period, implying that thermal structure is the primary determinant of C. cf. sibiricus distribution. 2. In a field experiment, C. cf. sibiricus incubated in the summer epilimnion, which most of the population never experience, developed faster and grew better than in their original habitat. We consider that trans-thermocline DVM would not have evolved because of possible disadvantages such as the cost of migration offset the benefit observed in the field experiment. The rapid temperature change at the thermocline may act as a swimming-cost estimator for the copepod. 3. Low food availability in deep water during the summer stratification period seemed to determine the lower limit of C. cf. sibiricus distribution, and the copepod minimised the risks of predation by fish via DVM. These results suggest that C. cf. sibiricus modified their distribution seasonally to obtain maximum benefit in terms of individual fitness.					; Yoshida, Takehito/O-9983-2014; Makino, Wataru/GLS-2518-2022	Ban, Syuhei/0000-0002-7168-5583; Yoshida, Takehito/0000-0001-9178-3634; Makino, Wataru/0000-0003-3240-3763; 													0046-5070					SEP	2003	48	9					1551	1562		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01108.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01108.x													WOS:000185095700005

Here, through a source -to -estuary survey of the Yangtze River in March (spring) and October (autumn) of 2018, we revealed that labile dissolved organic matter (DOM) and nitrogen inputs remarkably modified the spatiotemporal distribution of dGHG. The average partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2), CH4 and N2O concentrations of all sampling sites in the Yangtze River were 1015 +/- 225 mu atm, and 87.5 +/- 36.5 nmol L-1, and 20.3 +/- 6.6 nmol L-1, respectively, significantly lower than the global average. In terms of longitudinal and seasonal variations, higher GHG concentrations were observed in the middle -lower reach in spring. The dominant drivers of spatiotemporal variations in dGHG were labile, protein -like DOM components and nitrogen level. Compared with the historical data of dGHG from published literature, we found a significant increase in N2O concentrations in the Yangtze River during 2004-2018, and the increasing trend was consistent with the rising riverine nitrogen concentrations. Our study emphasized the critical roles of labile DOM and nitrogen inputs in driving the spatial hotspots, seasonal variations and annual trends of dGHG. These findings can contribute to constraining the global GHG budget estimations and controls of GHG emission in large rivers in response to global change.

The distribution of softwater and acid tarns and streams in central Cumbria is briefly summarized and compared for the periods 1983-85 and 1949-56. 2. Fifty-three upland tarns (altitude > 350 m) and forty lowland tarns (altitude < 320 m) were sampled on Skiddaw Slates, the Borrowdale Volcanic Series, and igneous intrusions. On these bedrocks, tarns and streams would be highly sensitive to further acidification if acid deposition increases above current levels. Twenty-six upland and seven lowland tarns are permanently acid with zero or negative alkalinity values throughout the year; mean pH ranged from 5.3 to 4.2. The other sixty upland and lowland tarns had positive mean Alk in the summers of 1983-85, ranging from 7 to 1227 .mu.equiv .cntdot. l-1 Alk and mean pH 5.7 to > 7.0. Thirty-one of the sixty tarns had mean Alk < 100 .mu.equiv .cntdot. l-1 in summer (May-September); sixteen became temporarily acid (negative Alk) for varying periods in winter. Acid episodes also occurred in the tarns in 1949-56. 3. Acid and very low alkalinity tarns and streams commonly occur on the high western, central and northern fells. Few occur on the high eastern fells, where there are veins of calcite in exposed rocks. 4. Seventy-five lowland tarns were sampled on Silurian Slates in southern Lakeland. On these bedrocks, tarns and streams are not highly sensitive to further acidification. Only six tarns had summer mean Alk < 100 .mu.equiv .cntdot. l-1. No permanently acid tarns or streams were found. 5. Over a mean span of about 30 years, Eel Tarn appears to have become sligthly more acid and Harrop Tarn slightly less acid. The remainder of all terns surveyed in 1983-85 have altered little, although there is a heavy load of acidic deposition on to the catchments and some tarns contain very low conentrations of Alk. Rapid acidification in recent years has been prevented by the neutralizing capacity of volcanic and sedimentary rocks. These rocks produce relatively high concentrations of Alk, up to 650 .mu.equiv. l-1 in some spring-fed streams on the central fells and even more at lower altitudes. Absence of coniferous forest on the higher ground may be an important additional reason for the very slow rate of acidification in Cumbrian waters.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				APR	1988	19	2					179	189		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1988.tb00340.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1988.tb00340.x													WOS:A1988M736900004

The species belonged to the toxin producing genera Cylindrospermopsis, Planktothrix, Aphanizomenon and Anabaena, and to the nontoxic members of Limnothrix and Pseudanabaena. In German waters, Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii is a neophyte, and exhibits a comparatively low temperature requirement of about 17 degreesC for germination and growth. The nutrient concentrations were comparable in both the lakes, and did not change measurably during the summer succession. The dissolved nitrogen fractions were well below 50 mug l(-1) with total depletion of nitrate. Soluble reactive phosphate concentrations never fell below 3 mug l(-1) throughout the summer season. The light attenuation factors (K-d) of 3-5.8 m(-1) indicate high self-shading. However, under calm weather conditions, the cyanobacteria were not concentrated in near surface layers and the species composition was relatively uniform in the vertical. In mid-summer, the diazotrophic Nostocales were replaced by Oscillatoriales. Reduced light availability caused by mixing and self-shading is considered to be the main factor causing the summer decline of Nostocales. By means of two weather stations, more frequent, deeper and longer lasting mixing events could be observed in Langer See than in the more shallow. but wind protected Melangsee. The success of Planktothrix agardhii may be due to the more turbulent mixing regime in Langer See. The algal association, S of Reynolds (Reynolds, C.S., 1997), should be modified, since the different species grouped together in S have different responses to turbulent mixing.

J	Wagner, A				Wagner, Annekatrin			Light limitation increases the edibility of Asterionella formosa Hass. for Daphnia during periods of ice cover	LIMNOLOGICA												Morphological variations of Asterionella Formosa were studied both in field samples from Bautzen Reservoir, Germany, and in culture experiments. It was observed that this diatom exhibited considerable variation in the number of cells per colony, ranging from unicells to colonies with more than 16 cells. The winter period of two consecutive years which differed with respect to ice- and snow cover were compared (1995: no ice cover; 1996: all ice cover lasting 4 months). A. formosa was obviously inedible for Daphnia in winter 1995 whereas in the same period in 1996 this species represented a main food source for Daphnia galeata, as was demonstrated by microscopic observation of the gut content of D. galeata during periods of Asterionella blooms. From feeding experiments with C-14-labelled A. formosa of different colony sizes and from microscopic observations of Daphnia feeding in a suspension of Asterionella Colonies, I confirmed that only Asterionella colonies with up to 7 cells were effectively ingested by D. galeata. Above this threshold, the ingestion efficiency decreased to less than 30%. Steady-state populations of A. formosa in culture experiments showed a marked dependence on the number of cells per colony on light intensities. The mean colony size was usually less than 5 when light was limited (fell below a threshold of 20 mu E m(-2)s(-1)), and greater than 8 when light intensities exceeded 110 mu Em(-2)s(-1). In Bautzen Reservoir, low light penetration owing to snow-covered ice in winter 1996 resulted, similar to culture experiments, in Asterionella colonies with 4 or less than 4 cells. Contrary to 1996, non-limited light penetration corresponded to 8-celled colonies in winter 1995. Light limitation during periods of ice cover should therefore be a strong environmental predictor of the colony size of A. formosa and, consequently, of the ingestion efficiency of a Daphnia population, thereby strongly modifying trophic interactions in pelagic food webs.

River metabolic fingerprints and regimes reveal ecosystem responses to enhanced wastewater treatment	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Although many studies have examined how improvements in wastewater treatment impact river nutrient concentrations and loads, there has been much less focus on measuring river metabolism to evaluate the wider aquatic ecosystem benefits of reducing nutrient inputs to rivers. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of enhanced wastewater treatment (nitrification) on river metabolism in the Grand River, Canada's largest river draining into Lake Erie. Metabolic fingerprints and regimes (calculated from high-frequency dissolved oxygen [DO] measurements) were used to visualize whole-river ecosystem functional responses to these wastewater treatment upgrades. There was a 60% reduction in ecosystem respiration during summer, in response to reductions in effluent total ammonia inputs, causing a shift from net heterotrophy to net autotrophy, and contraction of river metabolic fingerprints. This resulted in major improvements in summer DO concentrations, with reductions in the percentage of days during summer that DO minima fell below water-quality guidelines for protection of aquatic early life stages, from 88% to <= 16%. The results also point to potential cascading impacts on coupled phosphorus and nitrogen cycles, which may generate further improvements in river water quality. During the summer, high rates of river metabolism and nutrient retention may result in measured water-column nutrient concentrations potentially underestimating nutrient pressures. This study also demonstrates the value of combining river metabolism with nutrient monitoring for a more holistic understanding of the role of nutrients in river ecosystem health and function.

In the past, the Fucino Plain (surface area: over 200 km(2)) hosted the largest lake of central Italy. In the late 1800s, the lake was drained to be used as farmland. Recently, however, the fast change in agricultural activities (with the expansion of water-intensive horticultural crops) and climate (decreasing precipitation and increasing temperature) has broken the environmental equilibrium of the plain, causing groundwater lowering, spring exhaustion, decreased canal discharge in summer and groundwater pollution risks connected with fertiliser and pesticide use. New data on water usage and farming made it possible to develop a new "integrated" water budget of the plain, taking into account the impact of human activities on the water cycle. Monitoring of the main well fields, of crop distribution and of natural discharge in canals and springs, will enable better management of local water resources, reducing their exploitation during the irrigation season.

Shainin Lake is a weakly stratified lake fed by distant glaciers, whereas Allison Lake is more strongly stratified and fed predominantly by proximal glaciers. At Shainin Lake, sediment accumulation started in late June and reached its maximum in mid-August, just before lake mixing and during a period of low river discharge. The grain size of the sediment reaching the sediment trap in Shainin Lake was homogenous throughout the summer. At Allison Lake, pulsed sedimentation of coarse particles during late summer and early fall storms were superimposed on the fine-grained sedimentation pattern similar to that observed at Shainin Lake. These storms triggered underflows that were observed in the thermal structure of the lake and deposited abundant sediment. The sequencing sediment traps reveal a lag between fluvial discharge and sediment deposition at both lakes, implying limitations to interpreting intra-annual sedimentary features in terms of inflow discharge.

For these species, burrow architecture can affect the quality and success of such processes, since characteristics like tunnel width and chamber depth influence access by predators, thermal insulation, and energy spent digging. Wolverines (Gulo gulo) living in Arctic tundra environments dig burrows in snow during winter for resting sites and reproductive dens, but there are few published descriptions of such burrows. We visited 114 resting burrows and describe associated architectural characteristics and non-snow structure. Additionally, we describe characteristics of 15 reproductive den sites that we visited during winter and summer. Although many resting burrows were solely excavated in snow, most incorporated terrain structures including cliffs, talus, river shelf ice, thermokarst caves, and stream cutbanks. Burrows typically consisted of a single tunnel leading to a single chamber, though some burrows had multiple entrances, branching tunnels, or both. Tunnels in resting burrows were shorter than those in reproductive dens, and resting chambers were typically located at the deepest part of the burrow. Reproductive dens were associated with snowdrift-forming terrain features such as streambeds, cutbanks on lake edges, thermokarst caves, and boulders. Understanding such characteristics of Arctic wolverine resting and reproductive structures is critical for assessing anthropogenic impacts as snowpack undergoes climate-driven shifts.					; Glass, Thomas/ABD-8355-2020	Kielland, Knut/0000-0001-6153-8232; Glass, Thomas/0000-0001-7494-4918; 													0004-0843	1923-1245				SEP	2022	75	3					291	299		10.14430/arctic75576	http://dx.doi.org/10.14430/arctic75576													WOS:000888876900001

(Asclepiadaceae) is a major concern in natural areas of the Lower Great Lakes Basin. Reproduction in this perennial occurs largely by polyembryonic seeds that mature from August to November. Many seeds produced in autumn germinate the following spring, but the germinability of seeds produced in late summer is unknown. The influence of parent plant light environment on seed characteristics in this species is also poorly understood. We examined the characteristics of V. rossicum seeds harvested in late August and early November 2002 from three habitats in central New York State, USA, differing in light availability. Site had a significant effect on seed weight and germination percentage, but not on the number of embryos germinating per seed or radicle length. Seeds produced in the shaded habitat in August weighed significantly more and had lower germin ability than seeds produced in an adjacent open habitat, but this was not observed in a second open habitat. The probability of germination decreased with seed size for seeds ranging from 2 to 8 mg. For the open sites, fresh seeds produced in August had approximately double the germination percentages of those produced in November. However, for all sites, germination following 18 weeks of cold storage was greatest for seeds harvested in November. The probability of multiple embryos germinating was influenced by seed weight. The nature of this relationship varied by site, but not by harvest date or storage duration. Larger seed size resulted in longer total radicle length after 7 d, regardless of site.

Sediment Properties and Seagrass Density Influence the Morphological Plasticity of Seagrass Zostera muelleri More Than Elevated Temperatures	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Understanding the long-term effects of elevated temperatures on foundational species like seagrasses is critical for predicting and managing the impacts of warming coastal ecosystems worldwide. Seagrasses exhibit plasticity in response to a range of environmental stressors, so the effects of climate change are likely to be context dependent. This study investigated differences in the growth and morphology of Zostera muelleri inside versus outside a warm water plume generated by a power station operating for similar to 26 years in Lake Macquarie, New South Wales, Australia. The effects of other factors, including sediment organic matter, season and seagrass density were also examined to ascertain their importance relative to elevated temperatures. Despite water temperatures in the thermal plume being equivalent to conditions predicted by 2090 under future climate scenarios (1.5-2.7 degrees C above ambient), there were no consistent effects of these elevated temperatures on Z. muelleri growth and morphology. Instead, growth at all sites (ambient and warm water) was greater by 40.3% in spring and 74.3% in summer when compared to winter. Increasing organic matter content in sediments was associated with a 69.8% rise in below-ground biomass and a subsequent 73.8% reduction in the ratio of above- to below-ground biomass. There was also evidence for seagrass density effects, with denser meadows having shorter leaves and reduced growth rates, likely due to self-shading. Overall, these findings demonstrate that Z. muelleri in the centre of its distribution in eastern Australia can tolerate moderate temperature increases over decadal scales.

J	Hulburt, EM				Hulburt, EM			Theory of adaptation: application of symbolic logic	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												The theory of adaptation takes up, first, completely symbolized expressions in which the basic element is the dyadic term Axy, x is adapted to y. When this is combined with a monadic term such as Ey, y is a moist environment, in (y)(Axy superset of Ey), validity can be achieved by reversal and denial (transposition): (y)(Axy superset of Ey)=(y)(similar to Ey superset of similar to Axy). This provides a full and complete description when applied as follows: the North American forest x is adapted only to moist environments if and only if it is not adapted ra any non-moist environments. Then dyadic-dyadic, monadic-dyadic-dyadic, and monadic-dyadic-monadic-dyadic combinations are presented and exemplified. The theory of adaptation lakes up, second, incompletely symbolized expressions such as:(x)(Fx v Hx),(x)[(Fx superset of Gx).(Hx superset of Ix)],therefore(x)(Gx v Ix)', which provides the structure for this description of temperate insects: all undergo diapause or nondiapause; all, if undergoing diapause, are winter adapted, and ii, undergoing nondiapause, are summer adapted; therefore, all are winter adapted or summer adapted. The phrases winter adapted, Gx, and summer adapted, Ix, are incomplete symbolizations since they are brief versions of (There Exists y)(Wy.Axy), x is adapted to winter, and of (There Exists y)(Sy.Axy), x is adapted to summer. The brief versions, however, make elaborations and extensions of the basic formulation possible. The formulas of complete symbolization provide for affirmation or denial of adaptation or no decision. Thus, in addition to the example of the North American forest other examples are species of the lizard Anolis, each of which is well adapted in its niche but not well adapted outside its niche, the associations of the North American forest which are tall, densely packed aid adapted in moist regions but short, scattered, and unadapted in non-moist regions and species of Cilia which are adapted to their habitats unless these habitats are not adapted to them. Then in small-to-moderate forest gaps regrowth of prevalent, adapted primary species contrasts with the regrowth of unadapted, non-prevalent pioneer species. But it cannot be decided whether the lizard Anolis allogus in a smaller niche on Cuba is adapted to this or is not adapted to this when comparing it to Anolis oculatus in its larger niche on Dominica. The formulas of incomplete symbolization provide only affirmation of adaptation. Examples in addition to the diapause-nondiapause case are for diatoms which are dark or light adapted and ciliates which are myxotrophically or heterotrophically adapted. Then, evolutionary pathways to warm bloodedness of fish include being adapted to fast swimming in tuna fish, or northern distribution in lamnid sharks, or deep diving in swordfish. And finally four basic evolutionary pathways include anaerobic and aerobic photosynthesis and thus adaptation to the lighted planetary surface and include chemosynthesis in two ways and thus adaptation to the dark ocean floor.

Amphibian (Leopard Frog, Bullfrog, Green Frog, American Toad) and reptile (Painted Turtle, Snapping Turtle, Blanding's Turtle and Garter Snake) mortality showed seasonal patterns consistent with life history phenology. Amphibian mortality was significantly associated with adjacent roadside vegetation and turtle road mortality with adjacent open water areas (P less than or equal to 0.05).

The C-band radar backscatter is shown from field measurements to be sensitive to changes in surface roughness at millimetric scale due to evaporative growth of halite and gypsum crystals. Backscatter increases gradually during the dry summer months and decreases rapidly in early winter as the rains begin. Episodic hydrogeological and sedimentological events including lake development, channel flow and aeolian deposition can also be detected in addition to the seasonal pattern.

Clutch size and reproductive effort (egg production/assimilation) were low, and the proportion of males decreased throughout the population cycle. The seasonal abundance pattern changed from perennial (pre-filling years) to a 7 month cycle.

This study investigates whether there were any changes in the water quality of the Lower Min River (China) during the lockdown period. The time-series remote sensing images from November 2019 to April 2020 was used to examine the dynamics of the river's total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations in the period. A new remote sensing-based prototype was developed to recalibrate an existing algorithm for retrieving TSS concentrations in the river. The Nechad and the Novoa algorithms were used to validate the recalibrated algorithm. The results show that the recalibrated algorithm is highly consistent with the two algorithms. All of the three algorithms indicate significant fluctuation in TSS concentrations in the Lower Min River during the study period. February (COVID-19 lockdown period) has witnessed a 48% fall in TSS concentration. The TSS in March-April showed a progressive and recovery back to normal levels of pre-COVID-19. The spatiotemporal change of TSS has worked as a good indicator of human activities, which revealed that the decline of TSS in the lockdown period was due largely to the substantially-reduced discharges from industrial estates, densely populated city center, and river's shipping. Remote sensing monitoring of the spatiotemporal changes of TSS helps understand important contributors to the water-quality changes in the river and the impacts of anthropogenic activities on river systems.					, GZ/AAK-9685-2020; Xu, Hanqiu/ABD-9626-2021														1569-8432	1872-826X				JUN	2021	98								102301	10.1016/j.jag.2021.102301	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2021.102301								35464667					WOS:000632601500002

Samples of phyto- and zooplankton were taken at weekly and biweekly intervals. At the end of March, a medium size pulse of spring flood was observed. At the beginning of May, it was followed by an unusually high pulse of flush floods caused by heavy rainstorms in the local drainage area. An overall increase of biomass and the number of taxa of planktonic communities during the filling and drainage phases of the spring floods was stated. The pulse of the flush floods resulted in a lower total biomass and higher species diversity, and can be regarded as a disturbance event. The high species diversity represented by a hump-shaped pattern caused by an intermediate disturbance that was measured by the rate of water level change during the floods according to Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis (IDH).

J	Rivals, F; Rindel, D; Belardi, JB				Rivals, Florent; Rindel, Diego; Belardi, Juan Bautista			Dietary ecology of extant guanaco (Lama guanicoe) from Southern Patagonia: seasonal leaf browsing and its archaeological implications	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE												The analysis of dietary traits of ungulates through tooth microwear and mesowear has been applied to archaeological sites to investigate seasonal changes in settlements by hunter-gatherers. In this paper we propose to test the hypothesis that tooth microwear (combined to mesowear) is able to indicate seasonality in the diet of extant ungulates in arid habitats (semi-deserts or steppe). The material analyzed comes from six faunal monospecific assemblages of guanaco (Lama guanicoe) resulting from a mass mortality event in winter 2000 near the Cardiel Lake in Southern Patagonia (Province of Santa Cruz, Argentina). Mesowear results indicate that the guanacos from the Cardiel Lake area are mixed feeders, and thus, have a diet that shifts seasonally. Moreover, microwear analysis supports the hypothesis that tooth microwear is able to indicate seasonality in the diet of extant guanaco in arid habitats. The pattern is clear for the winter sample and needs to be confirmed for a summer sample. Consequently, tooth microwear is proposed as a new potential proxy for detecting seasonal occupation in archaeological sites in Patagonia and other arid environments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Nitellopsis obtusa first appeared in early July, increased in biomass from July to September, remained at relatively high biomass from September to late January, and decreased substantially as ice breakup began in mid-February. By March it had become senescent, lacking chlorophyll and disintegrating easily. Nitellopsis obtusa was therefore available as a source of food and shelter for benthic and juvenile fish populations in late fall and winter, when other macrophytes were absent.																			0008-4026					JAN	1988	66	1					116	118		10.1139/b88-017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b88-017													WOS:A1988M228300017

Previous studies indicate that most MOB nutrient subsidies to zooplankton are focused largely on C subsidies; nevertheless, considering that N is important to zooplankton and phytoplankton growth, a better understanding of MOB N subsidies to plankton communities is needed. We examined changes in nutrients, phytoplankton mass-specific productivity, MOB reliance, C/N ratios and biomass of zooplankton between summer stratification and winter mixing periods based on in situ investigation in a subtropical deep oligotrophic freshwater ecosystem during 2010-2014. The results revealed that with increasing reliance on MOB during the winter mixing period, zooplankton C/N ratios decreased and had a significantly nonlinearly inverse relationship with zooplankton biomass. The negative relationship between zooplankton biomass and phytoplankton mass-specific productivity was further observed in synchronous time. The profundal MOB enhanced pelagic-profundal coupling and served as an alternative N support for pelagic plankton food webs during the winter and/or less productive seasons, adding to greater understanding of the role of methanotrophs in aquatic food webs.

Through the analysis of trace elements, gastropods, and sporopollen fossils in some layers of the MGS1, this study presents the monsoon climate fluctuations on the millennial-scale in the Mu Us Desert during the Holocene. The results show that the contents of trace elements (P, Pb, Rb, Nb, Zr, V, Sr, Cu, Ni, As, B a, and Co) have similar distribution characteristic, their contents are low in the dune sands but are relatively high in the overlying fluvio-lacustrine facies or paleosols showing 11 cycles in alternation of valleys and peaks. The trace elements in the paleo-mobile dune sands of MGS1 are quite consistent with those of modern mobile dune sands in Salawusu River Valley; therefore, paleo-mobile dune sands can be assumed to be a result of the main periods of the prevalence of East Asian winter monsoon. The increased element contents in the overlying fluvio-lacustrine facies or paleosols are mainly due to the prevailing East Asian summer monsoon. In addition, the 11 elements' cycles represent the climate changes on the millennial-scale in the alternation of East Asian winter and summer monsoons in the Holocene. The paleoecology indicated by gastropods and sporopollen fossils reflects the warm and humid sparse forest grassland environment prevailing in the East Asian summer monsoon when the fluvio-lacustrine facies were deposited; the sporopollen is missing in the dune sands, presumably, it might be dry and windy sandy desert then. The dominant periods of the winter monsoon in these cycles, in terms of time and nature of the climate, could correspond to the cold events in the North Atlantic and lakes, loess, peat and stalagmites in China. It probably indicates that the millennial-scale environmental changes in China's desert regions may be caused by the changes of solar radiation and the increase in ice volume in the Northern Hemisphere during the Holocene.

J	Zimmermann, H				Zimmermann, H			Interactions between planktonic protozoans and metazoans after the spring bloom of phytoplankton in a eutrophic lake, the Belauer See, in the Bornhoveder Seenkette, North Germany	ACTA PROTOZOOLOGICA												To obtain information about the planktonic protozoans that form a link in the flux of matter from bacterio- to metazooplankton in the eutrophic Belauer See, one of the lakes in the Bornhoveder Seenkette of North Germany, abundance, biomass, production, and grazing loss rates of the planktonic bacteria, algae, ciliates, flagellates, rotifers, and crustaceans were estimated. Different trophic levels were isolated using the size fractionation technique, and each was exposed for 24 and 48 h to ambient conditions. Changes in their population densities were recorded. Toward the end of winter, herbivorous protozoan plankton developed together with small algae. Protozoans that feed on algae were predominant during our experiments in spring. They were preyed upon in turn by rotifers and crustaceans. The protozoan community structure was influenced by the presence of cyclopoid copepods, which were also the main predators on rotifers. Cylopoids were the main top-down controlling organisms in the pelagic food web during the spring.																			0065-1583	1689-0027					1996	35	3					215	221																WOS:A1996VJ60800006

In aquatic ecosystems, artificial light at night (ALAN) may influence microbial communities living in the sediments. These communities are highly diverse and play an important role in the global carbon cycle. We combined field and laboratory experiments using sediments from an agricultural drainage system to examine how ALAN affects communities and alters carbon mineralization. Two identical light infrastructures were installed parallel to a drainage ditch before the start of the experiment. DNA metabarcoding indicated that both sediment communities were similar. After one was lit for five months (July-December 2012) we observed an increase in photoautotroph abundance (diatoms, Cyanobacteria) in ALAN-exposed sediments. In laboratory incubations mimicking summer and winter (six weeks each), communities in sediments that were exposed to ALAN for 1 year (July 2012-June 2013) showed less overall seasonal change compared with ALAN-naive sediments. Nocturnal community respiration was reduced in ALAN-exposed sediments. In long-term exposed summer-sediments, we observed a shift from negative to positive net ecosystem production. Our results indicate ALAN may alter sediment microbial communities over time, with implications for ecosystem-level functions. It may thus have the potential to transform inland waters to nocturnal carbon sinks.

Photoprotective compounds in weakly and strongly pigmented copepods and co-occurring cladocerans	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The prevalence of mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) - a group of potential ultraviolet (UV)-photoprotective compounds - was surveyed across 11 species of freshwater copepods from 20 lakes of varying ultraviolet radiation (UVR) transparency in North America, New Zealand and Argentina. Co-occurring cladocerans were also analysed (seven species from 12 lakes). Many of the calanoid copepod populations were red with carotenoid pigmentation, allowing comparison of MAA and carotenoid accumulation as photoprotective strategies. 2. In two Pennsylvania (U.S.A.) lakes, MAA and carotenoid contents were followed during the early spring to mid-summer period of lake warming. A pronounced seasonal pattern of higher carotenoid/low MAA content in spring, shifting to low carotenoid/higher MAA content in summer, was observed in calanoids from the more UV transparent lake. 3. All copepod samples contained MAAs. Visibly red calanoids, especially southern Hemisphere Boeckella, often had moderate to high concentrations (2.5-11 mu g MAA mg(-1) dw), but low concentrations (0.04-1 mu g MAA mg(-1) dw) in some N. American red calanoids show that high carotenoid pigmentation (e.g. 5-10 mu g carotenoid mg(-1) dw) does not necessarily imply high MAA content. 4. No cladoceran sample had more than trace amounts of MAAs (< 0.05 mu g mg(-1) dw). Therefore, MAA accumulation does not seem to be a photoprotective strategy utilized by Daphnia (five species from nine lakes) or other cladocerans. 5. Seven identifiable MAAs were widely distributed among both calanoids and cyclopoids. Shinorine was ubiquitous and was usually the most abundant MAA in N. American samples. In contrast, porphyra-334 was the predominant MAA in the southern Hemisphere Boeckella. 6. Copepods from higher UVR lakes tended to have a higher MAA content, but this relationship was statistically weak overall and taxon-specific when found.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				NOV	2007	52	11					2121	2133		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01833.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01833.x													WOS:000250145600005
J	Chemagin, AA				Chemagin, A. A.			Effects of temperature and water levels on dynamics of density and structure of the fish population of the channel-floodplain complex of a large river in the period of spring floods	BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY												The article discusses the features of the dynamic process of migration of ichthyofauna from wintering sites to the wetlands of a large boreal river for feeding and spawning. The influence of factors of temperature and water level on various groups of fish is estimated, and the role of water bodies of various types during fish migration in a flooded floodplain is also established. The research was performed during the spring flood in the floodplain-channel complex of the Irtysh River (Western Siberia, Russian Federation) in the water area of the conjugate water bodies: the lotic and lentic parts of the riverbed depression and the mouth of the tributary - transit section of the migration pathway of fish to the flooded floodplain. The research work was performed by "AsCor" - computerized hydroacoustic complex, hydroacoustic survey data were processed in the laboratory. The "AsCor" complex remotely performs taxonomic identification of abundant species of fish at the family level by groups (Cyprinidae, Percidae, Coregonidae-Esocidae, Acipenseridae- Lotidae). It was found that after the breakup of ice cover, maximum densities of fish were observed in the wintering sections - the initial location of the spring migration. During the 30-days observation period in the wintering sections and conjugate water bodies, the density of fish decreased from 4 to 13 times due to their migration to the floodplain. The response to a decrease in the overall density of fish in the year-round functioning lotic part of the riverbed depression to the influence of factors of water level and temperature regimes was >0.300 in general for ichthyofauna and for all groups of fish registered by hydroacoustic method (Cyprinidae, Percidae, Coregonidae- Esocidae, Acipenseridae-Lotidae). We constructed regression models of changes in the density of fish in the wintering sections of the river depending on the considered factors. Use of ANOVA analysis of variance confirmed the adequacy of the choice and the acceptability of the constructed models. We established a high statistically significant inverse correlation between the density of the fish, the water level and temperature regime for the mouth of the Konda River and the lentic part of the riverbed depression, which are transit sections of the migration pathway of fish in the floodplain. The lentic part of the riverbed depression may perform the function of a temporary station of fish during migration to the floodplain, which is beneficial from the point of view of bioenergetics resources. During the observation period, in the river flows there was a decrease in the proportion of larger fish and an increase in smaller individuals; in the lentic part of the riverbed depression, on the contrary, there was a reduced proportion of small fish and increase in the proportion of larger individuals.This pattern is explained by the reduced risk of predation by small fish in more turbulent conditions, as well as by an initial entry into the flooded floodplain of larger individuals of fish for spawning, followed by the smaller ones for feeding.					; Chemagin, Andrey/AAB-8156-2022	Chemagin, Andrey/0000-0003-2515-4244; 													2310-0842	2312-301X					2019	27	3					291	299		10.15421/011938	http://dx.doi.org/10.15421/011938													WOS:000492725200013
J	Fall, PL				Fall, PL			Timberline fluctuations and late Quaternary paleoclimates in the Southern Rocky Mountains, Colorado	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Pollen and plant macrofossils from eight sedimentary basins on the west slope of the Colorado Rocky Mountains document fluctuations in upper and lower timberline since the latest Pleistocene. By tracking climatically sensitive forest boundaries, the moisture-controlled lower timberline and the temperature-controlled upper timberline, paleoclimatic estimates can be derived from modern temperature and precipitation lapse rates. Pollen data suggest that prior to 11 000 yr B.P., a subalpine forest dominated by Picea (spruce) and Pinus (pine) grew 300-700 m below its modem limit. The inferred climate was 2-5 degrees C cooler and had 7-16 cm greater precipitation than today. Abies (fir) increased in abundance in the subalpine forest around 11 000 yr B.P., probably in response to cooler conditions with increased winter snow. Pollen and plant macrofossil data demonstrate that from 9000 to 4000 yr B.P. the subalpine forest occupied a greater elevational range than it does today. Upper timberline was 270 m above its modern limit, suggesting that mean annual and mean July temperatures were 1-2 degrees C warmer than today, Intensification of the summer monsoon, coupled with increased summer radiation between 9000 and 6000 yr B.P., raised mean annual precipitation by 8-11 cm and allowed the lower limit of the subalpine and montane forests to descend to lower elevations. The lower forest border began to retreat upslope between 6000 and 4000 yr B.P. in response to drier conditions, and the upper timberline descended after 4000 yr B.P., when temperatures cooled to about 1 degrees C warmer than today. The modern climatic regime was established about 2000 yr B.P., when the summer precipitation maxima of the early and middle Holocene were balanced by increased winter precipitation.																			0016-7606					OCT	1997	109	10					1306	1320		10.1130/0016-7606(1997)109<1306:TFALQP>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0016-7606(1997)109<1306:TFALQP>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1997YD00700006

The Seasonal Kendall test was conducted to identify the trends and a mixed model regression analysis was used to describe how catchment characteristics and hydrometeorological variables (e.g. precipitation, air and stream water temperatures, and atmospheric deposition) related to the variation in the concentration and export of stream water TOC. The 8 catchments varied in size from 29 to 494 ha and in the proportion of peatland they contained, from 8 to 70%. Runoff and TOC concentration were monitored for 15-29 years (1979-2006). Trends and variation in TOC levels were analysed from annual and seasonal time series. Mean annual TOC concentration increased significantly in seven of the eight catchments. The trends were the strongest in spring and most apparent during the last decade of the study period. The slopes of the trends were generally smaller than the variation in TOC concentration between years and seasons and between catchments. The annual TOC export showed no clear trends and values were largely determined by the temporal variability in runoff. Annual runoff showed a decreasing trend in two of the eight catchments. Mean annual air and stream water temperatures showed increasing trends, most clearly seen in the summer and autumn series. According to our modeling results. stream water temperature, precipitation and peatland percentage were the most important variables explaining annual and most seasonal TOC concentrations. The atmospheric deposition of SO(4), NH(4), and NO(3) decreased significantly over the study period, but no significant link with TOC concentration was found. Precipitation was the main hydrometeorological driver of the TOC export. We concluded that stream water TOC concentrations and exports are mainly driven by catchment characteristics and hydrometeorological factors rather than trends in atmospheric acid deposition.

The current study examined environmental variables and cyanobacterial biovolume (B-c(yano)) of 28 shallow lakes in the eastern China plains during the spring and summer of 2018. We used a 95% quantile regression model to explore season-specific response of B-c(yano) to total nitrogen (TN), or total phosphorus (TP), and robust linear relationships were observed between log(B-c(yano) +0.001) and log(TN), or log(TP) in both spring and summer periods. Based on these regressions, regional-scale and season-specific TN and TP thresholds are proposed for these lakes to ensure the safety for recreational waters and drinking water source. However, actual B-c(yano) for a given concentration of TN (or TP) for many observations were considerably lower than the results of the 95% regression model predict, indicating that other factors significantly modulated nutrient limitation of B-c(yano). Generalized additive model and quantile regression model were used together to explore potentially significant modulating factors, of which lake retention time, macrophytes cover and N: P ratio were identified as most important. Thus, it is necessary to develop type-specific nutrient thresholds with the consideration of these significant modulating factors. Furthermore, nutrient-B-c(yano) relationships of our studied lakes with lake retention time>100 days and no macrophyte were further explored and nutrient thresholds of this lake type were proposed. Nutrient thresholds proposed in this study may play an essential role in achieving a cost-effective eutrophication management for shallow lakes both in the eastern China plains and elsewhere with similar climatic background. On a broader scale, the approaches and findings of this study may provide valuable reference to formulate reasonable nutrient reduction targets for other ecoregions with different climatic conditions.

Thermal refuges remain suitably cool during summer and are often complementary to foraging, spawning, and rearing habitats. Although the benefits associated with the thermal aspects of refuges are well studied, much less is known about potential costs associated with nonthermal aspects. For example, crowding of cold-water fishes into seasonal refuge habitats could increase parasite loads and cause declines in fitness. We assessed lamprey and anchor worm parasitism in Upper Klamath Lake where adfluvial redband trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss newberrii) move to thermal refuge habitats during summer. We sampled trout in Upper Klamath Lake during spring and in adjacent thermal refuge habitats during summer. We also evaluated survival as a function of lamprey wounding using motion-sensing radio tags. There was a fourfold decline in the number of lamprey wounds on trout upon the onset of thermal refuge use. In contrast, cases of severe anchor worm (=20 sores) increased threefold during thermal refuge use. Survival in thermal refuge was not different for lamprey-wounded trout than for trout that migrated to thermal refuge without lamprey wounds. We found that both parasites were absent in a lotic population of redband trout downstream that lacked access to thermal refuge. Thus, the effects of seasonal refuge use on parasite load varied depending on the parasite taxon considered and local habitat conditions, implying that managers will likely require empirical data for focal habitats and taxa to understand how parasitism affects thermal refuge use.

Summer Habitat Use of Large Adult Striped Bass and Habitat Availability in Lake Martin, Alabama	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												To identify the summer habitat use by Gulf strain Striped Bass Morone saxatilis in Lake Martin, Alabama, 36 fish greater than 4kg were tracked weekly from June through September in 2009 and 2010. Temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles were collected biweekly from July to October each year and were incorporated into a hypsographic curve to estimate summertime volumes of Striped Bass habitat. Striped Bass moved downstream in the reservoir and deeper in the water column as the summer progressed in both years. Across all temperatures and dissolved oxygen concentrations (DOCs) measured, fish generally selected cooler temperatures when DOCs were greater than 3.1mg/L, but below that level, fish selected warmer temperatures. By early July each year, quality Striped Bass habitat (21.0 degrees C and 3.2mg/L DOC) comprised 40-50% of the total habitat available in Lake Martin. However, in 2009 all quality habitat was gone from the reservoir by August 1, and total habitat (25.0 degrees C and 1.6mg/L DOC) rapidly decreased until there was no suitable habitat found in Lake Martin by mid-September. The quantity of quality and total habitat declined more rapidly in 2009 than in 2010; although quality habitat was eliminated from the reservoir by the end of August 2010, total habitat persisted throughout the summer. In both years, habitat availability increased when reservoir destratification began. Analysis of historical data indicated that quality habitat was found in the lower portion of the reservoir during the latter half of August in only 6 of 15years; total Striped Bass habitat was available in all but 1 year. The amount of water flowing through the system during the spring and summer was a key determinant of Striped Bass habitat availability by late summer.					; Sammons, Steve/KHW-1491-2024; Glover, David/M-5804-2014	Sammons, Steve/0000-0002-7814-6400; 													0275-5947	1548-8675				AUG 1	2013	33	4					762	772		10.1080/02755947.2013.806381	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2013.806381													WOS:000323145400010

The pikeperch is the most important species from an economical point of view. A total of 2 299 individuals with a total length of 22-39.5 cm were marked with Dart tags during late June-early August 1990. The fish were caught in commercial trap-nets, measured, marked and released immediately at the place of capture. In total 1 900 recaptures were recorded and the number of recaptured individuals were 887 (38.6%). Six individuals were recaptured 20 times and one fish 39 times in trap-nets, before it was caught and killed in a gill-net. These figures show that the fishing is intense. 48% of the fish that were recaptured once and released were recaptured also a second time. They also show that the young pikeperch tolerate capture in trap-nets and also survive post-capture handling before the release quite well. The pikeperch showed a very stationary behaviour during the growth season and many individuals were captured repeatedly in the same trap-net, both during the season of tagging and following seasons. On average pikeperch smaller than 30 cm were caught less than 2 km from the point of release, whereas fish 35-39 cm on average were caught 4-5 km away during summer. In the autumn the pikeperch moved from shallower areas to the deeper central part of the lake and were caught in gill-nets in the winter-fishery. The average rate of growth of pikeperch in the size 25-30 cm at the time of marking was 51 mm/365 days until they reached 40 cm (legal size Limit). After that, the size selective gill-net fishery significantly affected the average growth rate, by catching and removing the most fast growing individuals.																			0003-455X						1996	33	3-4					569	575																WOS:A1996WB44500034

Differences in Stocking Success among Geographically Distinct Stocks of Juvenile Muskellunge in Illinois Lakes	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Muskellunge Esox masquinongy are broadly distributed across the northern United States and southern Canada. Intraspecific genetic variation suggests the existence of divergent stocks related to residence in major river drainages. Populations and stocks have likely adapted to specific environmental conditions associated with geographic location, especially latitude and the associated thermal regime. In this study, we examined differences in survival and growth among stocks of juvenileMuskellunge stocked into lakes throughout Illinois. Muskellunge fromthe Ohio River drainage stock, the upper Mississippi River drainage stock, and the current mixed Illinois broodstock were used for comparisons. Stocking mortality was related to temperature and was greatest for Illinois and Ohio River drainage fish that were stocked during the early fall. Mississippi River drainage fish experienced high mortality over the first summer after stocking, resulting in the lowest abundance during the second fall poststocking. In addition to low catch rates, Muskellunge from the Mississippi River drainage were significantly smaller than fish from the Illinois and Ohio River drainage stocks by the second fall. Populations from similar latitudes and climate (Illinois and Ohio) performed the best in terms of survival and growth and should be utilized in future stockings.																			0275-5947	1548-8675					2017	37	3					633	643		10.1080/02755947.2017.1308893	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2017.1308893													WOS:000402630900017

The gonad is active throughout the year in both sexes, suggesting the existence of an annual cycle with continuous gametogenesis. A spawning phase occurs during the spring-summer months. Spawning is partial and asynchronous in the specimens of the Chilean population studied from Lake Villarrica. No regression in gametogenic activity or rest period was observed.																			0042-3211					APR 1	1986	28	4					418	425																WOS:A1986A741000009

At the river mouths, we sampled water monthly and analyzed the nutrient concentrations and dissolved N2O and CH4 concentrations, We also sampled riverbed sediments to determine the SRP release potential, inorganic P fractions, and denitrification potential (dNp). Riverine SRP concentrations showed large spatial and temporal variations, with values increasing from summer to autumn in the three southernmost rivers (IKW, TYK, and BFM). High dissolved CH4 concentrations were observed in association with high SRI' concentrations, indicating that SRP was released from the sediments under hypoxic conditions. In contrast, NO3- concentrations did not differ among the rivers and decreased during summer, likely owing to denitrification, thereby decreasing DIN/SRP ratios to a level suitable for the formation of summer algal or cyanobacterial blooms in the three southernmost rivers. Sediment incubation demonstrated high SRP release rates and high dNp values in the sediments of these rivers due to their higher iron (Fe)-bound P and organic matter contents. The riverine SRI' concentration was significantly correlated with dissolved CH4 and sediment dNp in positive, and DIN/SRP in negative. In conclusion, differences in Fe-bound P and sediment organic matter content suggested to cause spatial and temporal variations in water quality, with high SRI' release and denitrification under hypoxic summer conditions, resulting in lower DIN/SRP ratios that may trigger algal or cyanobacterial blooms in this shallow eutrophic lake.

Siva			Carbon dioxide dynamics of Bhalswa Lake: a human-impacted urban wetland of Delhi, India	ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY												Urban lakes in developing economies face tremendous anthropogenic pressure which tends to modify their role in the regional carbon cycle. This makes it imperative to quantify their carbon budget and identify the underlying factors and processes. Present study aims to understand the seasonal carbon dioxide (CO2) dynamics of an urban lake in a semi-arid subtropical region and identify major controls operating on it. Systematic sampling of Bhalswa lake waters was undertaken in winter and summer of 2017-2018. The hydrochemical data generated were used to determine partial pressure and evasion flux of CO2 using pH and total alkalinity couple. The lake waters show CO2 supersaturation with respect to atmospheric equilibrium and act as a source of CO2 to the atmosphere in both seasons. The average partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) and CO2 evasion flux observed is 1033.73 +/- 229.07 mu atm and 6.33 +/- 2.23 mmol m(-2) d(-1), and 1034.99 +/- 187.37 mu atm and 11.65 +/- 3.42 mmol m(-2) d(-1) during winter and summer, respectively. Neither pCO(2) nor CO2 evasion flux shows any significant seasonal difference. For yearly dynamics, dissolved organic carbon, dissolved inorganic carbon and dissolved oxygen act as strong controls on lake water pCO(2). While for individual seasons, pH and water temperature act as significant controls. Among various pollution sources, untreated sewage and dairy waste, seepage of polluted groundwater and atmospheric dust impact the lake's carbon dynamics. The present study will help better understand the role of freshwater wetlands of ever-expanding urban areas in the regional carbon cycle of developing economies.

We present newly discovered giant lacustrine pockmarks in Lake Neuchatel (up to 160m diameter and 30m deep) that rank among the largest known pockmarks in lakes. Our multidisciplinary study reveals 60m of suspended sediment inside a pockmark. The sediment suspension is 2.6 degrees warmer and isotopically lighter in O-18(H2O) by 1.5 than the ambient lake water, documenting currently active fluid flow by karstic groundwater discharge from the Jura Mountain front into the Swiss Plateau hydrological system. Strikingly, the levees of the pockmarks comprise subsurface sediment mobilization deposits representing episodic phases of sediment expulsion during the past. They strongly resemble subsurface fluid flow features in the marine realm. Comparable processes are expected to also be relevant for other carbonate-dominated mountain front ranges, where karstic groundwater discharges into lacustrine or marine settings.					; Moernaut, Jasper/R-5188-2018; Bernasconi, Stefano/E-5394-2010; Strasser, Michael/A-2424-2009	Bouffard, Damien/0000-0002-2005-9718; Moernaut, Jasper/0000-0003-3164-4274; Anselmetti, Flavio/0000-0002-8785-3641; Bernasconi, Stefano/0000-0001-7672-8856; Strasser, Michael/0000-0003-3991-2405													0094-8276	1944-8007				MAY 16	2015	42	9					3465	3473		10.1002/2015GL064179	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2015GL064179													WOS:000355878300050
J	Kozerski, HP; Kleeberg, A				Kozerski, HP; Kleeberg, A			The sediments and benthic-pelagic exchange in the shallow lake Muggelsee (Berlin, Germany)	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY												The sediments and exchange processes of the shallow (mean depth 4.9 m), polymictic. eutrophic Muggelsee have been studied over more than 30 years. Here, previous results are summarised and completed by new data. Sediment analyses were used to identify changes in loadings and migration processes within the sediments of the 12 000 year old lake. The surficial oligohumic sediments are rich in Fe (8.8 +/- 1.9% DW) and in P (2.7 +/- 0.5 mg P g(-1) DW). Mass balances of P and Fe as well as sediment trap measurements and sinking velocity analyses showed that the retention of matter strongly varies within seasons and years. The lake amplifies the seasonal fluctuations of P in the River Spree system by a strong redox-controlled, benthic P-release in summer. Since 1988, P-release has exceeded retention so that the lake changed from a P-sink to a source. The retention rate dropped in summer to -7.3 mg P m(-2)d(-1) and in winter to 1.4 mg P m(-2)d(-1).																			1434-2944						1998	83	1					77	112		10.1002/iroh.19980830109	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19980830109													WOS:000073371600005
J	PADISAK, J; DOKULIL, M				PADISAK, J; DOKULIL, M			CONTRIBUTION OF GREEN-ALGAE TO THE PHYTOPLANKTON ASSEMBLAGE IN A LARGE, TURBID SHALLOW LAKE (NEUSIEDLERSEE, AUSTRIA-HUNGARY)	BIOLOGIA												Green algal species composition, horizontal distribution, seasonal- and longterm dynamics is described in the paper based on about 1100 quantitative phytoplankton samples taken between 1968 and 1992 in the shallow, turbid, turbulent, saline Neusiedlersee (Austria/Hungary). The main results can be summarized as: 1. Green algal contribution to total annual biomass varied within wide range (3-88%) without obvious long-term trend. Nevertheless, in most of the years a contribution of about 30% was found which corresponds to the average of the years between 1968-1992. The latter value exceeds that in other mesotrophic lakes by a factor of three. 2. In those years when green algal contribution is high, one to three green algal species provide a large summer peak; in other years the green algal development is bimodal with a spring and an autumn peak. Both types of seasonal growth occur in other lakes. Green algal development in Neusiedlersee differs significantly from that of the dominant diatoms which appeared to be highly meroplanktonic. 3. Species number of characteristic green algae is similar to the observed in a deep, mesotrophic lake (Mondsee, Austria) and much smaller than in a nearby large shallow lake (Balaton, Hungary). Green algal flora of Neusiedlersee includes almost exclusively chlorococcal species; desmids and Phytomonadina are more important in other lakes. In this respect the lake's flora resembles that in rivers. 4. Concerning long-term changes of green algal species, periodic appearances and disappearances are very characteristic. Annual average biomass of most species is growing for several (3-5) years, then declining with a similar rate. Dry periods during which water level declines, conductivity increases, nutrients and their ratio change, following trend-like periodicity are supposed to be responsible for the observed long-term periodicity of dominant species. An increased nutrient load in the seventies was superimposed on this cyclicity.					; Dokulil, Martin/J-3464-2019; Padisak, Judit/B-4514-2008	Dokulil, Martin/0000-0002-6369-1457; 													0006-3088					AUG	1994	49	4					571	579																WOS:A1994PM35100019

Short-term Variability of Physico-chemical Parameters and the Estimated Transport of Filterable Nutrients and Chlorophyll-a in the Urbanised Coombabah Lake and Coombabah Creek System, Southern Moreton Bay, Australia	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Extensive urban development has occurred within the Coombabah Creek catchment and surrounds over the last two decades, resulting in concerns about degrading water quality. Water quality was investigated three times during summer and three times during autumn/winter at two sites: within Coombabah Lake and at several km downstream within Coombabah Creek. Physico-chemical parameters, suspended solids, chlorophyll-a and filterable nutrients (reactive PO43-, NO2-, NO3- and NH3-) were measured hourly for 13 hours in order to compare the water quality under different tidal conditions at each site. Bathymetric and hydrological data were also collected, which allowed short-term nutrient loads to be estimated. From these measurements, the net transport of filterable nutrients and chlorophyll-a into Coombabah Lake and the intratidal variability of Coombabah Creek and Lake waters were determined. Physico-chemical parameters, suspended solids and chlorophyll-a concentrations demonstrated characteristic cyclic variations with the influence of tidal and diurnal cycles apparent. Despite elevated nutrient concentrations, chlorophyll-a values indicated an oligotrophic-mesotrophic environment, with concentrations ranging between 0.11-3.53 mu g L-1. Maximum concentrations occurred during ebb tides, coinciding with periods of increased solar radiation. Elevated total suspended solids were observed during increased current velocities during low tide periods and greater wind speeds within the lake. Filterable nutrient concentrations and transport estimations also demonstrated tidal influences, with increased concentrations observed during sampled high tide phases, indicating increased inputs of nutrients originating from sources other than the creek and lake. Observed reactive PO43-, NO(x)and NH3- concentrations exceeded Broadwater sub-region values within the Queensland Water Quality Guidelines (2006).					; Teasdale, Peter/AAC-1419-2020; Welsh, David/A-1227-2009; Ali, Ayub/KGK-5512-2024; Lemckert, Charles/D-2581-2011; Teasdale, Peter/K-7077-2012	Lemckert, Charles/0000-0002-1811-858X; Welsh, David/0000-0002-0228-0611; Teasdale, Peter/0000-0001-9891-0560													0749-0208	1551-5036					2007					50		1062	1068																WOS:000207860300193

To predict the effects of altered WLFs on lakeshore vegetation, lakeshore herbaceous plant guilds (LPGs) in six Yangtze floodplain lakes were classified in this study. The lakeshore herbaceous plant distribution pattern, main influencing factors, and responses of different LPGs to altered WLFs were analyzed. A total of 130 plant species were identified from the six lakes. With the increase in the amplitude of WLFs, the total species number in the six lakes showed a hump-shaped trend, whereas the lakeshore herbaceous plant coverage showed a positive correlation. The Qili Lake with the largest WLFs had the lowest species number and highest plant coverage. The species numbers, average biomass, and coverage of lakeshore herbaceous plants in all the six lakes were obviously higher in spring than in autumn. The lakeshore herbaceous plants in the six lakes were classified into eight guilds. Small differences in pH, organic matter, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus were detected in the substrate among the eight LPGs, but obvious differences in soil moisture content and duration and depth of submergence were observed. The canonical correspondence analysis showed that the main environmental factors affecting the distribution of different LPGs in the six lakes in spring and autumn were the amplitude of WLFs and duration of submergence. The regression analyses showed that the biomass of perennial mesophyte with erect stem guild and perennial hygrophyte with well-developed rhizome guild responded sensitively to alterations in the amplitude of WLFs and duration of submergence, and the guilds could be considered as indicator groups at a regional scale. Morphological parameters such as plant height, stem diameter, leaf thickness, and specific leaf area of the eight LPGs showed no significant linear relationships with the increase in WLFs. The use of these parameters in the evaluations of alterations in WLFs needs to be further analyzed.

Niche Partitioning among Native Ciscoes and Nonnative Rainbow Smelt in Lake Superior	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Several species of ciscoes Coregonus, subgenus Leucichthys that are native to the Laurentian Great Lakes are rare or extirpated. The restoration of Coregonus fishes is being actively pursued through stocking, and success may depend on the availability of unoccupied niche space. We described the spring-summer habitat occupancy and diets of three native cisco species (Bloater Coregonus hoyi, Cisco C. artedi, and Kiyi C. Kiyi) and invasive Rainbow Smelt Osmerus mordax in Lake Superior and measured niche overlap among these species for both small and large sizes. The potential habitat area was highest for Cisco and Kiyi, followed by Bloater and Rainbow Smelt. The probability of overlap in habitat occupation, as measured by bathymetric depth, fish capture depth, distance from shore, and fish capture water temperature was highest for small Rainbow Smelt and Cisco. Trophic overlap, as measured by stomach contents and stable isotopes, was highest between small Bloater and Cisco and between large Bloater and Kiyi. All of the species showed significant ontogenetic change in both habitat occupation and diet. The overall niche overlap in spring-summer habitat and diet was greatest between small Cisco and Rainbow Smelt and between large Bloater and Kiyi; however, differences in individual niche dimensions likely limit competition for both species pairs. Synthesizing the diet and habitat niche data revealed nuanced niches that allow these seemingly similar planktivorous species to coexist. Kiyi had the least niche overlap with other cisco species and Rainbow Smelt, so from an available niche perspective Kiyi would be a strong candidate for reintroduction into lakes from which they were extirpated.

These issues have arisen as a result of the combined impact of global warming and human activities in recent times. The study of the growth and distribution patterns of schizothoracinae fishes can support guiding policy decisions about the conservation of aquatic species and ecological habitats in the QTP. The investigation on fish resources was carried out in the QTP section of the Nujiang River during the spring and autumn seasons of 2017, 2018, and 2019. A total of seven sampling sites were established based on variations in elevation. According to length-weight relationship (LWR) analysis, Schizothorax nukiangensis mainly displayed a negative allometric growth while Ptychobarbus kaznakovi and Schizopygopsis thermalis mainly showed near isometric growth or positive allometric growth in the QTP section of the Nujiang River. Due to temperature and food abundance, the three schizothoracinae fishes showed better growth performance in autumn than spring. Spatial heterogeneity exhibited a greater influence on the LWR of S. nukiangensis and P. kaznakovi than seasonal variation. In contrast, seasonal variation on S. thermalis showed greater influence than spatial heterogeneity. According to the linear mixed effect model (LMM), both spatial factors and seasons had influence on fish growth in the QTP. Schizothorax nukiangensis was identified as the predominant species from CWL to BS, spanning an altitude range of 1800 to 2700 m. Ptychobarbus kaznakovi was identified as the main species at LL, BB, and BR, occupying an altitude range of 2700 to 3800 m. Schizopygopsis thermalis is primarily distributed at altitudes beyond 4000 m and along the tributary river Yuqu. Principal coordinates analysis (PCOA) and nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) divided schizothoracinae fish populations into three clusters by spatial differences.

Dietary overlap between two zooplanktivores in Lake Winnipeg, Manitoba: Rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) and cisco (Coregonus artedi)	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Dietary niche overlap between invasive rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) and the native cisco (Coregonus artedi) of similar size in Lake Winnipeg was examined using stomach content analysis throughout the open water period in 2010 and 2011. Although smelt and cisco were caught together in the North Basin (n = 7 stations), rainbow smelt were exclusively caught in the North Basin (n = 39 stations), whereas cisco were predominantly caught in the South Basin (n = 31 stations). Substantial dietary overlap was evident when found together and apart, illustrating little dietary niche differentiation between the two species in sympatry and allopatry in the lake. Both smelt and cisco appear to shift from copepods in spring to large-bodied cladocerans in summer and fall. Although high dietary overlap suggests that these species have the potential to compete for prey, differential abundance in each basin of Lake Winnipeg suggests possible environmental niche divergence between these two species. Overall, this study provides important baseline information to examine the impact of another recent invasive planktivorous species (e.g. Bythotrephes longimanus, spiny water flea) on the smelt-cisco competition as well as the commercially important piscivorous walleye (Sander vitreus) population in Lake Winnipeg.

Both annual mean density and biomass of macrozoobenthos were higher in Lake Biandantang than in Lake Houhu: 780 vs 532 indivials/m(2) and 37.1 vs 25.9 g wet mass/m(2), respectively. Abundance of functional feeding groups followed the order: scraper > collector > predator > shredder in Lake Biandantang, and collector > predator > scraper > shredder in Lake Houhu. Only 1 density peak occurred from winter to early spring in Lake Houhu; however, in Lake Biandantang, there were 2 peaks, the winter peak and spring peak. K-dominance curves and Shannon-Wiener, Simpson, and Margelef indices indicated that macrozoobenthos were more diverse in Lake Biandantang than in Lake Houhu Our study suggests that, in shallow lakes, submerged macrophytes are essential for the maintenance of biodiversity of macrozoobenthos mainly because the macrophytes increase habit heterogeneity and availability of suitable food, and may also decrease predation by fish on the macrozoobenthos.

The samples from tributary and brook spawning grounds of spring sockeye spawners are characterized by maximal frequencies of the Ldh-B1'' allele (0.3-0.9). Summer spawners from lake spawning grounds have a frequency of Ldh-B1'' allele near 0 (0.01-0.09), except for the population of Lake Azhabachye where it is about 0.3. Summer spawners from spring and river spawning grounds have intermediate Ldh-B1'' frequencies (0.1-0.3). The correlation (r = -0.72, P < 0.01) between Ldh-B1'' allele frequencies and the current velocity was observed for spawning grounds of tributary system of Lake Nachikinskoye. The adaptive significance of the Ldh-B1'' allele seemed to be connected with higher swimming stamina, in conditions of a high current velocity, low temperature and a high content of dissolved O2. The other allele (Ldh-B1) is adapted to lake spawning grounds characterized by a high temperature and the absence of current. No connection between Pgm allelic frequencies and the parameters of water environment was noted.																			0016-6758						1984	20	1					100	106																WOS:A1984SB96600012
J	Nifong, RL; Taylor, JM; DeVilbiss, S				Nifong, Rachel L.; Taylor, Jason M.; DeVilbiss, Stephen			Spatial and temporal patterns of benthic nutrient cycling define the extensive role of internal loading in an agriculturally influenced oxbow lake	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Benthic habitats in shallow oxbow lakes may serve as permanent nitrogen (N) sinks by facilitating denitrification. Oxbow sediments may also accumulate nutrients through uptake, deposition and heterotrophic N-2 fixation, and ultimately provide a significant internal source of N and phosphorus (P) through sediment release to the water column. To better understand nutrient source-sink dynamics in oxbow lakes, we explored seasonal and habitat specific patterns in sediment dissolved dinitrogen gas (N-2-N) and nutrient flux within an oxbow in the Mississippi Alluvial Plain. Time series models indicate a higher probability of positive N-2-N fluxes in fall through spring, significant negative summer fluxes, and clear differences among habitats with net annual N-2-N fluxes, ranging from - 2.34 g m(-2) Y-1 in open water habitat to 0.26 g m(-2) Y-1 in shoreline areas. Integrated lake-wide N-2-N sediment flux estimates were negative indicating the significant role of net N-2 fixation. More complex models explained similar amounts of variation (Adj. R-2 = 0.57 vs. 0.45) and indicated that benthic N-2-N fluxes were associated with changes in temperature, dissolved inorganic N, sediment oxygen demand, and sediment carbon:N ratios. Ammonium and P flux from sediments were substantial across all habitats and internal N regeneration far outpaced removal from the system by sediment N-2-N flux. Results indicate that nutrient release from sediments generate internal nutrient loads proportional to external loading from the watershed. Our results highlight the significant potential for internal nutrient loading and benthic N-2 fixation within sediments to regulate biogeochemical processes within understudied oxbow lake ecosystems.

Protist diversity along a salinity gradient in a coastal lagoon	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The importance of microbial eukaryotes to aquatic systems has been widely acknowledged in the last decade, and the application of high-throughput sequencing techniques has revealed an astonishing diversity and high proportions of novel taxa. Most studies have focused either on marine or freshwater ecosystems; thus, information on estuarine communities is either incomplete or missing. We assessed the composition of microbial eukaryotes along a South Australian coastal lagoon affected by a broad (7 to 65 PSU) salinity gradient, the Coorong Lagoon. This lagoon extends for over 170 km from the mouth of the River Murray (Murray Mouth) southwards, where the salinity increases up to hypersaline values. We sampled 5 stations during the austral summer and winter and sequenced the amplified V4 region of the 18S rRNA gene using Ion Torrent. Genetic libraries were mostly represented by reads from 5 phyla, with Chlorophyta prevailing in summer, diatoms in winter and Haptophyta in the southernmost sampling sites. In spite of the broad spatial and temporal salinity changes observed, the communities of small eukaryotes clustered in 2 groups reflecting the sample location. Moreover, dissimilarities between samples were unaffected by differences in salinity, but increased with increasing geographic distances. Microbial exchanges from the Coorong Lagoon towards both freshwater and seawater occur via the Murray Mouth and are likely to prevent the formation of communities adapted to local salinity conditions. However, such exchanges likely decrease with increasing distances from the Murray Mouth, resulting in distance-driven eukaryotic communities.

Tench caught in early spring and kept in the laboratory retained their natural infection throughout the summer. Starvation of hosts during 2 mo. caused disappearance of the infection. Experiments showed that metacercariae, introduced into the intestine of tench, can excyst within 1 h. In vitro, cysts in contact with tench bile opened within 15 s. Bile of several other cyprinid fish species caused excystment within 60 s. Asymphylodora eggs appeared in tench feces 7-10 days after infection.

J	Gunter, SA; Combs, GF				Gunter, S. A.; Combs, G. F., Jr.			Efficacy of mineral supplementation to growing cattle grazing winter-wheat pasture in northwestern Oklahoma	TRANSLATIONAL ANIMAL SCIENCE												Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of mineral supplementation to cattle grazing winter-wheat pasture. In experiment 1 (fall), 120 steers and heifers (body weight [13W] = 232 +/- 11.4 kg) were assigned randomly to four blocks of replicated pastures during the second week of November in 2008 and 2009 and all herds (6 animals/pasture; 4.9 ha/pasture) were allowed to graze for 84 d. In experiment 2 (spring), 216 steers (BW = 248 +/- 7.9 kg) were assigned randomly to five blocks of replicated pastures during the second week of February in 2009 and 2010 and all herds (12 or 6 animals/pasture; 4.9 ha/pasture) were allowed to graze for 84 d. Half the pastures in both experiments received a free-choice mineral mixture (Wheat Pasture Pro; Land O'Lakes Purina Feed, LLC; St. Paul, MN; Ca, 16% and P, 4%); mineral feeders were weighed weekly to determine mineral intake. All pastures were planted in early September of each year (67 kg of seed/ha) and fertilized with 50 kg of urea-N/ ha. Standing herbage dry matter was determined midway between weigh dates by clipping wheat forage to the ground along 122 cm of drill rows at 10 locations/pasture. Data were analyzed by ANOVA, with treatment as the fixed effect and pasture, animal sex (experiment 1), and block as random effects. In experiment 1, cattle offered minerals had a 43% faster average daily gain (ADG; P = 0.02, 0.73 kg) than cattle not offered minerals (0.51 kg); hence, supplemented cattle weighed 6% more (P = 0.04; 286 kg) after 84 d than nonsupplemented cattle (271 kg). In experiment 2, cattle offered the mineral supplement had a faster ADG (20% increase; P = 0.04; 1.00 kg) than cattle not offered minerals (0.83 kg). Further, supplemented cattle weighed 4% more (P = 0.03; 326 kg) after 84 d than nonsupplemented cattle (312 kg). In both experiments, daily standing herbage dry matter averaged 1,381 kg/animal and never differed (P >= 0.47) between treatments. Mineral intakes averaged 135 (experiment 1) and 124 (experiment 2) g/d, resulting in a cost of supplement to kilogram of added BW gain of $0.53 and $0.64, respectively (assuming a mineral cost of $0.88/kg). Overall, supplementing an appropriate mineral mixture to cattle grazing winter-wheat pasture increased ADG in a cost-effective manner.

Sex Ratios of Black Crappies Harvested during Spring Fisheries on Two Minnesota Lakes: Are Males in the Majority?	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Sex-selective fishing mortality can alter the demographics and life history patterns of fish populations, yet the extent of this mortality is rarely investigated in harvest-oriented recreational fisheries. Potential differences in habitat use between sexes and nest-guarding behavior suggest that male black crappies Pomoxis nigromaculatus could dominate angler harvest during spring fisheries. We examined the potential for male-dominated harvest in spring (late April to mid-June) recreational fisheries for black crappies occurring on two north-central Minnesota lakes. In the three spring fisheries we examined, males represented between 45% and 57% of all black crappies harvested by anglers, but sex ratios (expressed as the percentages of males) did not significantly deviate from 1:1. However, a temporal pattern in sex ratios was observed on Lake Hubert, where female black crappies dominated angler harvest before 19 May in both 2005 and 2006 (41 42% male) while the harvest on or after 19 May was dominated by males (69-75% male); this shift appeared to coincide with peak nesting periods. In fall electrofishing samples, the sex ratios of black crappies that had been exposed to exploitation during spring fisheries (i.e., fish age 4 and older) did not significantly deviate from 1:1, suggesting that total annual mortality rates were similar between sexes. The sex ratios of black crappies harvested by anglers during spring can vary within and among lakes and will not always be skewed toward male fish. Estimating population sex ratios and the sex ratio of black crappies harvested by anglers may improve our understanding of the effects of exploitation on crappie populations, particularly when fishing intensity during nesting is high and nests are easily located by anglers.																			0275-5947					JUN	2010	30	3					812	820		10.1577/M09-179.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M09-179.1													WOS:000279885000020

The influence of environmental conditions on the morphological variability of phytoplankton in an oligo-mesotrophic Turkish lake	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Phytoplankton dynamics and morphological plasticity were studied in an oligo-mesotrophic lake from late spring to early autumn in 2004 on a weekly to bi-weekly basis. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of environmental constraints on morphological plasticity and size structure of dominant species through the stratified period of the lake. While centric diatoms developed mainly in the epilimnion, Fragilaria crotonensis, Synedra sp. and Synedra acus were very well distributed through the whole water column. as was the cryptophyte Plagioselmis nannoplanctica. A filamentous cyanobacterium, Planktothrix rubescens. was stratified in the metalimnion throughout the sampling period, while Mougeotia sp. was entrained through the whole water column during the early autumn. Surface area / volume (S/V) ratios were calculated for the dominant species on each sampling date. The minimum S/V ratio was found with centric diatoms, while maximal values measured were for Synedra sp. and Asterionella formosa. The S/V ratio of the only dominant cryptophyte, Plagioselmis nannoplanctica was also high; variations were negatively correlated with NO3-N and PO4-P (-0.62 and -0.61, respectively) and positively correlated with euphotic depth (r=0.57) and temperature (r=0.82). On the other hand, the S/V ratios of Fragilaria crotonensis and Cyclotella ocellata each showed strong negative correlation with silica concentrations (-0.55 and -0.62, respectively). It is concluded that allometric relationships showed significant differences among species according to depth and season.					, reyhan/AAB-8612-2020; , merbay/AAB-9694-2020; Gürevin, Cenk/AAB-8531-2020; Çevik, Fatma/A-8063-2016	Gurevin, Cenk/0000-0002-5354-949X; 													0003-4088						2007	43	1					21	28		10.1051/limn/2007024	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2007024													WOS:000245376100003

However, previous studies have largely focused on marine ecosystems, leaving freshwater systems less studied. In this study, we elucidate the patterns of phytoplankton community succession based on their niche characteristics in the Shanmei (SM) Reservoir, a drinking water source in Quanzhou, Fujian Province. Additionally, variations in phytoplankton were mainly explained by their realized niche. In the SM Reservoir, total chlorophyll a concentrations ranged from 252 to 24,008 ng/L. The phytoplankton community was dominated by Chlorophyta and Cyanophyta, which consisted mostly of Pseudanabaena and Microcystis, especially in summer. This dominance was attributed to their wide niche breadth and high mean niche for temperature, nitrogen, and dissolved reactive phosphorus. On the other hand, Cryptophyta and Bacillariophyta reached higher concentrations in autumn and winter, linked to their low mean temperature niches. Under the multiple pressures of climate change and anthropogenic activities, Chlorophyta and Cyanophyta are likely to thrive in environments characterized by rising water temperatures and elevated nutrient concentrations. This is particularly true for buoyant cyanobacteria such as Pseudanabaena, which are well-suited to the stratified water layers induced by higher water temperatures. Therefore, incorporating niche characteristics of harmful bloom-forming species would contribute to the prevention and management of harmful phytoplankton blooms, ultimately improving the safety of drinking water.

To investigate the effects of drought events on the eutrophication and phytoplankton community structure of DTL, the lake was sampled twice in August and September 2022 based on the water level fluctuations resulting in 47 samples. Furthermore, we combined the comprehensive trophic level index (TLI) and phytoplankton Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H) to characterize and evaluate the eutrophication status. The key influencing factors of the phytoplankton community were identified using redundancy analysis (RDA), hierarchical partitioning, and the Jaccard similarity index (J). Our results showed that the TLI of DTL changed from light-moderate eutrophication status (August) to mesotrophic status (September), whereas the H changed from light or no pollution to medium pollution. The phytoplankton abundance in August (122.06 x 104 cells/L) was less than that in September (351.18 x 104 cells/L) in DTL. A trend in phytoplankton community succession from Bacillariophyta to Chlorophyta and Cyanophyta was shown. The combination of physiochemical and ecological assessment more accurately characterized the true eutrophic status of the aquatic ecosystem. The RDA showed that the key influencing factors in the phytoplankton community were water temperature (WT), pH, nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients, and the permanganate index (CODMn) in August, while dissolved oxygen (DO) and redox potential (ORP) were the key factors in September. Hierarchical partitioning further indicated that temporal and spatial variations had a greater impact on the phytoplankton community. And the J of each region was slightly similar and very dissimilar, from August to September, which indicated a decreased hydrological connectivity of DTL during drought. These analyses indicated that the risk to the water ecology of DTL intensified during the summer-autumn drought in 2022. Safeguarding hydrological connectivity in the DTL region is a prerequisite for promoting energy flow, material cycle, and water ecosystem health.																				2305-6304				OCT	2023	11	10							822	10.3390/toxics11100822	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/toxics11100822								37888674					WOS:001089957700001

We examined the effectiveness of alum (Al2(SO4)3.18H2O), gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O), and Epsom salt (MgSO4.7H2O) in reducing P loss from two flood prone agricultural fields (non-manured field with initial soil test P concentrations, STP, of 76 mg kg-1 and manured field with initial STP of 202 mg kg -1), during snowmelt on Canadian Prairies. Amendments were applied (2.5 Mg ha-1) in 2020 fall to four replicated plots (3 m x 1 m) with pre-installed runoff boxes (1.2 m 0.9 m). In the 2021 spring, snowmelt water in each runoff box was pumped out, volume recorded for each sampling day, and analysed for dissolved reactive P (DRP). Snowmelt DRP concentrations was greater in manured soil (0.73 +/- 0.23 mg L-1) with high STP, than in non-manured soil (0.28 +/- 0.10 mg L-1.) with low STP, implying a greater risk of P loss to snowmelt runoff when STP is high. Cumulative snowmelt DRP loads in non-manured soil ranged from 3.1 to 3.8 mg (equivalent to 0.03-0.04 kg ha-1) and were not significantly different among treatments. In the control treatment of the manured soil, the cumulative snowmelt DRP load from runoff boxes was 20.8 mg (equivalent to 0.19 kg ha-1), while amended treatments had 42 to 68 % lower cumulative DRP load than control, with the difference being significant only in Epsom salt treatment. Cumulative snowmelt DRP load was significantly and positively correlated to cumulative snowmelt volume (R2 = 0.84 for each soil). This study shows the potential of fall application of soil amendments, particularly Epsom salt, to reduce P loss to snowmelt from soils with high STP.

Simultaneously, fish are affected by physical in-lake factors, such as temperature and water transparency, with potential changes in their cascading effects on other communities. Here, we analysed the fish community structure and fish activity in four subtropical shallow lakes, varying in trophic state and water transparency, to assess changes promoted by temperature (i.e. summer and winter) and the light regime (i.e. day and night). We used a passive method (gillnets) during the day- and at night-time to detect changes in fish activity, but also sampled the littoral zone (during night) by point sample electrofishing to obtain a better description of the fish assemblage and habitat use. We observed different fish assemblages in the two seasons in all lakes. We captured more fish species and also obtained higher numbers (CPUE with nets) in summer. Contrary to our expectations, the visually oriented Characiformes were the most captured fish regardless of water transparency, at both day-time and night-time. We also found higher fish CPUE at night-time in all lakes. However, the differences between night and day decreased with decreasing transparency, being lower in the least clear lake, Lake Cisne. The nocturnal increase in fish CPUE (including visually oriented species) suggests that darkness serves as a good refuge for fish in shallow subtropical lakes, even at the likely cost of a lower feeding efficiency during the night. The importance of darkness seems to decrease with decreasing water transparency. We also argue that cascading effects of changes in the activity of piscivorous fish (seasonal changes in piscivores CPUE), when omni-planktivorous fish are indeed affected, may eventually reach the zooplankton, but may not be strong enough to reach the phytoplankton, regardless of water transparency.

Characterisation of stable isotopes to identify residence times and runoff components in two meso-scale catchments in the Abay/Upper Blue Nile basin, Ethiopia	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Measurements of the stable isotopes oxygen-18 (O-18) and deuterium (H-2) were carried out in two meso-scale catchments, Chemoga (358 km(2)) and Jedeb (296 km(2)) south of Lake Tana, Abay/Upper Blue Nile basin, Ethiopia. The region is of paramount importance for the water resources in the Nile basin, as more than 70% of total Nile water flow originates from the Ethiopian highlands. Stable isotope compositions in precipitation, spring water and streamflow were analysed (i) to characterise the spatial and temporal variations of water fluxes; (ii) to estimate the mean residence time of water using a sine wave regression approach; and (iii) to identify runoff components using classical two-component hydrograph separations on a seasonal timescale. The results show that the isotopic composition of precipitation exhibits marked seasonal variations, which suggests different sources of moisture generation for the rainfall in the study area. The Atlantic-Indian Ocean, Congo basin, Upper White Nile and the Sudd swamps are the potential moisture source areas during the main rainy (summer) season, while the Indian-Arabian and Mediterranean Sea moisture source areas during little rain (spring) and dry (winter) seasons. The spatial variation in the isotopic composition is influenced by the amount effect as depicted by moderate coefficients of determination on a monthly timescale (R-2 varies from 0.38 to 0.68) and weak regression coefficients (R-2 varies from 0.18 to 0.58) for the altitude and temperature effects. A mean altitude effect accounting for -0.12%/100 m for O-18 and -0.58%/100 m for H-2 was discernible in precipitation isotope composition. Results from the hydrograph separation on a seasonal timescale indicate the dominance of event water, with an average of 71 and 64% of the total runoff during the wet season in the Chemoga and Jedeb catchments, respectively. Moreover, the stable isotope compositions of streamflow samples were damped compared to the input function of precipitation for both catchments. This damping was used to estimate mean residence times of stream water of 4.1 and 6.0 months at the Chemoga and Jedeb catchment outlets, respectively. Short mean residence times and high fractions of event water components recommend catchment management measures aiming at reduction of overland flow/soil erosion and increasing of soil water retention and recharge to enable sustainable development in these agriculturally dominated catchments.

In one of these lakes, a core of the recent sediment has been sampled annually since 1979 (except 1984). These cores verify that one varve, comprising of a thick summer layer (often color-banded) and a thin winter layer, is formed each year.

Coastal Distribution and Consequent Factors Influencing Production of Endangered Snake River Sockeye Salmon	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Snake River Sockeye Salmon Oncorhynchus nerka were declared endangered in 1991 after several years of decreasing abundance. Several factors, including poor marine survival, likely contributed to the decline of Snake River Sockeye Salmon. Little is known about their migration and ocean distribution and the factors influencing their production. We sampled (1) coastal waters from southern British Columbia (BC) to southeast Alaska during June-July, October-November, and February-March 1998-2011; and (2) Oregon and Washington coastal waters during May-June and September 2007-2010. In total, 8,227 juvenile Sockeye Salmon were captured. Despite their extremely low abundance relative to other stocks, 15 coded-wire-tagged juveniles from Redfish Lake were recovered since 2007, primarily in spring and summer surveys off the BC coast. Genetic analyses revealed that an additional eight Redfish Lake juveniles were also present in this area during summer. Snake River smolts undertook a rapid northward migration that brought them well beyond the Columbia River estuary and plume, exposing them to ocean conditions prevailing off BC. Through a multimodel inference approach, we characterized associations between the number of returning adults and a suite of ocean and river variables. Seven ocean variables and five river variables were chosen for the model selection analysis (e.g., copepod biomass anomalies, coastal upwelling indices, date of the spring transition, river discharge, river temperature, and the proportion of smolts transported through the hydropower system). Although adult returns were highly correlated with smolt abundance, our analyses suggest that ocean conditions encountered during the first growing season (as indexed by copepod anomalies) contribute to the variability in total adult returns. There was also evidence for a negative effect of transporting smolts through the hydropower system, with the caveat that we used transportation data for steelhead O. mykiss as a proxy.

However, the occurrence of African dust out-breaks and biomass burning events produced significant increases in the PM10 levels at this monitoring site (daily mean levels of 29.2 mu g m- 3 and 13.7 mu g m- 3, respectively).Major organic compounds were levoglucosan, sacharides and 2-methyltetrols, markers for biomass burning, soil dust and BSOA respectively.SOA contributed more than 53% of the total measured organics in summer Samples with high levels of SOA include most of the African dust events, suggesting that African dust might promote the formation of oxygenated species such as SOA derivatives in this area. This contribution decreased to a 14% in winter. Biomass burning tracers represented 37% of the analysed organic pollutants in winter, indicating that this is the main source of organic compounds in the colder seasons, mainly due to the influence of regional biomass burning events and the use of biomass as fuel in domestic heating. Hence, the fact that African dust outbreaks and biomass burning events are likely to become increasingly frequent in the context of climate change makes this type of analysis particularly relevant for assessing their impact on natural protected areas.

J	NORSE, EA				NORSE, EA			ASPECTS OF ZOOGEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF CALLINECTES-(BRACHYURA-PORTUNIDAE)	BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE												Three aspects of the geographic distributions of swimming crabs in the genus Callinectes are examined. C. maracaiboensis, previously thought to be endemic to the Lake Maracaibo area [Venezuela], occurs in Jamaica, Colombia and Curacao [West Indies]. Although typically found in fresh and brackish waters, available evidence indicates that C. maracaiboensis cannot complete its life cycle in waters of low or highly variable salinity, and could not have evolved in Lake Maracaibo when it was cut off from the Caribbean. The larvae of C. sapidus, the species most successful in temperate waters, can neither hatch nor molt much below 20.degree. C, and females in the northerly part of the range spawn only during the warm season. The occurrence of Callinectes in a geographic area implies settlement from the plankton, rather than adult immigration. Callinectes make their farthest poleward penetration in West Atlantic areas having warmer summers and cooler winters than those at comparable latitudes in the East Pacific and East Atlantic. Thus, latitudinal distribution seems to be limited by the effects of summer temperatures on larvae, rather than winter temperatures. Caribbean high islands,typically possessing brackish and fresh as well as marine environments, have most or all potentially occurring Callinectes. Low islands, typically without significant amounts of water of reduced salinity, lack C. bocourti, C. maracaiboensis, C. sapidus and C. danae. Analysis of geographic records shows that low salinity water may be an ecological requirement for some Callinectes, which are distributed similarly to freshwater shrimps, genus Macrobrachium. The most eurytopic Callinectes are absent from areas of the Caribbean populated by their less eurytopic congeners due to their lack of suitable reduced salinity refuges.																			0007-4977	1553-6955					1977	27	3					440	447																WOS:A1977DP56300005

Temporal--spatial variations of chlorophyll a and primary production in Meiliang Bay, Lake Taihu, China from 1995 to 2003	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												There are few long-term data sets on primary production in a lake, which can be used to validate the output from a production model To address this need, we determined the temporal- spatial variations of chlorophyll a (Chl a) and primary production (PPeu) based on the vertically generalized production model (VGPM) by using 742 samplings at seven sites in Meiliang Bay in Lake Taihu from 1995 to 2003. An empirical model estimating primary production (PPin) was used to validate VGPM PP., and the dominant factors controlling PP were determined. Markedly higher Chl a and PPeu values wen, recorded in Meiliang Bay in 1996 and 1997 than in other years and a marked decrease in Chl a and PPeu was found between 2001 and 2003. Peaks of Chl a typically appeared in summer (June-August) and minima occurred in winter (January). The highest daily mean PPeu usually occurred in summer (June); the exception was at site 1, where peak daily mean PPeu occurred in spring (April). The lowest daily mean PPeu was recorded in winter (January). In Meiliang Bay, 43.0% of annual PP occurred in only 3 months, from June to August. The relative difference of maximum and minimum PPeu was markedly larger than the corresponding difference in Chl a. levels of both Chi a and PP,,, were markedly decreased from the inner to the outer areas of Meiliang Bay; the highest annual integrated PPeu was found at site 1, close to the inflow of the River Liangxi and this level was 1. 85 and 2.14 times higher than at sites 3 and 6. respectively, that were located in outer Meiliang Bay. The estimated daily mean PPeu variation closely matched with that of the Chl a concentration, implying that Chl a concentration can account for the considerable variation of PP The annual integrated PPeu of the euphotic zone in Meiliang Bay ranged from 3.44 x 10(4) tC year(-1) to 8.59 x 10(4) tC year(-1) with an overall mean of 5.65 x 104 tC year'. A significant positive linear relationship was found between VGPM PPeu and emperical model PPin [PPin = 0.826 ( +/- 0.015)PPeu + 272.0 ( +/- 25.0), r(2) = 0.80, n = 742, P < 0. 0001]. By considering the effect of water temperature, photosynthetically active radiation aid photoperiod on PP, the VGPM- generated PPeu more accurately captured monthly variations than did the empirical model that only included Chl a concentration.

The diffusion coefficients were determined by analytical and numerical modeling of the tritium profiles. During the summer, tritiated water diffuses into the sediment by molecular diffusion and this process is well approximated by a constant diffusivity model. The summer coefficients for diffusion were 1-2 .times. 10-5 cm2.cntdot.s-1 at a water depth of 1.5 m (20.degree. C) and 0.3 - 0.8 .times. 10-5 cm2.cntdot.s-1 at 8.75 m (4.degree. C). During fall overturn, evidence for enhanced mixing of pore waters to a sediment depth of 10 cm at water depths of 0.75 and 3.85 m was found. This enhanced mixing was not accompanied by mixing of the solid phase of the sediments.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1980	37	3					545	551		10.1139/f80-069	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f80-069													WOS:A1980JJ97200026

However, the triggering mechanism of whiting occurrences remains uncertain. The current study attempted to analyze potential factors that might account for whiting occurrences in a semi-enclosed gulf (namely the Arabian/Persian Gulf, hereinafter called the Gulf). First, spatial and temporal variability of whiting events and different potential driving factors (i.e., whiting seasonality, wind-induced mixing, sea surface temperature, and bathymetry) were explored and examined for five years (2015-2020). Second, as a general indicator of whiting occurrences in the Gulf, a whiting index (WI) was developed using time-series analysis and decision tree (DT) classification algorithm. Third, the correlation between the proposed WI and the spatial coverage of various whiting events was examined. Time-series analysis showed that whiting events during the winter season are associated with high winds that lasted for several days. Nevertheless, whiting events were rarely observed despite high wind speed and increased potential for CaCO3 precipitation in summer. This finding suggests that wind-driven forces might be potential sources for mixing water columns, resuspension of CaCO3 particles, and the appearance of whiting in the Gulf. The DT classification algorithm demonstrated that a minimum WI value of 1.1 can explain the initiation of most summer and winter whiting events. Furthermore, a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.73 was measured between WI and the extent of whiting along the UAE and Qatar coastlines in the Gulf. The proposed WI shows a simple yet effective method for identifying and estimating the extent of whiting in the Gulf.					; Al-Ruzouq, Rami/G-5564-2014; Imteaz, Monzur/AAX-6892-2020; A.Gibril, Mohamed/N-5291-2018	Al Mansoori, Saeed/0000-0001-8499-2809; Yilmaz, Abdullah Gokhan/0000-0002-6813-836X; Imteaz, Monzur/0000-0003-1800-3157; Al-Ruzouq, Rami/0000-0001-7111-0061; Shanableh, Abdallah/0000-0002-9808-4120; Khalil, Mohamad/0000-0002-3338-0092; 														2072-4292				DEC	2021	13	23							4795	10.3390/rs13234795	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13234795													WOS:000734656600001

Herbivory Dominates the Spring Diet of American Black Bears (Ursus americanus) in a Wood Bison (Bison bison athabascae) Neonatal Range, Suggesting Minimal Bison Consumption	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Studying an organism's foraging behavior, especially for predator species, provides insight into their ecology, habitat needs, and interspecific relationships. American black bears (Ursus americanus) are generalist omnivores, with a diet primarily composed of vegetation and are known predators of a number of ungulate species, particularly their neonates. In this study, we analyzed the spring diet of black bears occupying the neonatal range of a small, threatened wood bison (Bison bison athabascae) herd in the Ronald Lake area of northeast Alberta to determine the predation risk of neonate bison. To estimate black bear consumption rates of bison, we used scat analysis and DNA metabarcoding to describe the spring diet of bears occupying the Ronald Lake wood bison herd's (RLBH) neonatal range. If black bears occupying the RLBH's neonatal range are consuming bison, either through predation or scavenging, then we would expect bison DNA to be present in black bear scats. We predicted that the increased availability of neonate bison in the spring would provide bears with greater predation and scavenging opportunities. Conversely, if black bear predation risk is low within the RLBH's neonatal range, then we would predict that herbaceous plants would dominate black bear diet early in the spring and berries later in the spring and summer. The spring diet of black bears was dominated by herbaceous and fruiting plants. Bison DNA, without visual evidence of animal remains, was found in only 1 of 79 scat samples (1.3%). Our results suggest that consumption rates of bison are low and that predation risk to neonate wood bison, during the RLBH's occupancy of their neonatal range, from black bears is likely minimal despite the two species' overlap in space and time.

However, few studies have simultaneously focused on the sources of SPOM and SOM in closed inland lakes to reveal their differences and implications for water quality. The current study investigated the sources of SPOM and SOM in Daihai Lake, a typical closed inland lake in northern China, based on stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotopic compositions, during spring, summer, and autumn. The results showed that delta C-13(POC) and delta N-15(PN) (where POC and PN denote particulate organic carbon and nitrogen, respectively) of SPOM varied from -30.99%0 to -21.71%0 and 1.43%0-9.47%0, respectively. SPOM mainly originated from sewage, soil, and phytoplankton, with average contributions of 29.5%, 27.7%, and 19%, respectively, and each source of SPOM showed low spatial variation. However, the contribution of phytoplankton showed a decreasing trend from spring to summer, while the contribution of soil showed the opposite change. delta C-13(TOC) and delta N-15(TN) (where TOC and TN denote total organic carbon and nitrogen, respectively) of SOM varied from -26.41%0 to -23.99%0 and 3.3%0-7.66%0, respectively. Soil and sewage were the major sources of SOM, with average contributions of 43.3% and 27.8%, respectively, and each source showed small temporal and spatial variations. The differences between sources of SPOM and SOM revealed that phytoplankton-derived SPOM was easily degraded, whereas sewage- and soil-derived SPOM tended to deposit in the lake sediment. Additionally, the impact of SPOM on water quality significantly exceeded that of SOM. The source characteristics of SPOM were correlated with eutrophication and salinity indicators in the water, which have important implications for water quality. This isotopic evidence revealed that exogenous inputs were the main sources of OM in closed inland lakes, but there were some differences in the source characteristics between SPOM and SOM.

J	Nixon, JF; Holl, N				Nixon, JF; Holl, N			Geothermal modeling of soil or mine tailings with concurrent freezing and deposition	CANADIAN GEOTECHNICAL JOURNAL												A geothermal model is described that simulates simultaneous deposition, freezing, and thawing of mine tailings or sequentially placed layers of embankment soil. When layers of soil or mine tailings are placed during winter subfreezing conditions, frozen layers are formed in the soil profile that may persist with time. The following summer, warmer soil placement may not be sufficient to thaw out layers from the preceding winter. Remnant frozen soil layers may persist for many years or decades. The analysis is unique, as it involves a moving upper boundary and different surface snow cover functions applied in winter time. The model is calibrated based on two uranium mines in northern Saskatchewan. The Rabbit Lake scenario involves tailings growth to a height of 120 m over a period of 24 years. At Key Lake, tailings increase in height at a rate of 1.3 m/year. Good agreement between the observed position of frozen layers and those predicted by the model is obtained. Long-term predictions indicate that from 80 to 200 years would be required to thaw out the frozen layers formed during placement, assuming 1992 placement conditions continue. Deposition rates of 1.5-3 m/year give the largest amounts of frozen ground. The amount of frozen ground is sensitive to the assumed snow cover function during winter.																			0008-3674					APR	1998	35	2					234	250		10.1139/cgj-35-2-234	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cgj-35-2-234													WOS:000075505300005

The physical division of the lake into three main basins and the variation in chemical composition and temperature of the artesian springs feeding this shallow productive lake have large spatial effects. Variation in groundwater characteristics depends on percolation time and proximity to geothermal sources. Variation in precipitation is evened out by the porous volcanic soil and bedrock and the spring-water discharge is therefore very stable. A pulse of volcanic activity in 1975-1984 ( the Krafla Fires) heated the groundwater entering the North Basin of the lake and changed its chemistry. Although much reduced, these effects have not disappeared yet, but overall the impact of the volcanic activity on the biota seemed minimal. Recycling of nutrients through internal loading is important and occurs on various time scales. In winter, when the lake is ice-covered, the topmost 5-cm layer of sediment pore water has a hundredfold concentration of nutrients relative to the overlying lake water. The nutrients are released during the ice-free period by sediment resuspension, diffusion, bioturbation and recycling. In spring, resuspension events sometimes lead to spikes in dissolved phosphorus and nitrogen, but there is little evidence of any major desorption of nutrients from suspended particles during such events later in the summer. In contrast to the stable groundwater, the biota show more or less regular fluctuations with no straightforward correlation with external signals. The most prominent fluctuations, those of the chironomid Tanytarsus gracilentus seem to be driven by interactions between the species and its sediment resources. Fluctuations in other invertebrates could be a consequence of the Tanytarsus cycles due to the large impact this species has on the benthic environment of this detritus-driven ecosystem. Temporal variation in epibenthic chironomids and Cladocera translates into variable production of vertebrate predators (Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus, and ducks), body condition and mortality of fish and sometimes into return rates of migrating adult ducks. The waterfowl show large temporal variation on a centennial scale, e. g., the invasion of the tufted duck (Aythya fuligula) which arrived by the end of the 19th century and has by now outnumbered other species. Fluctuations of Cyanobacteria ( Anabaena) and the fish Gasterosteus aculeatus ( three-spined stickleback) harmonize with the cycles in the benthic community. Palaeolimnological studies indicate that primary production in the South Basin became increasingly benthic as the lake depth was reduced by sedimentation (around 2 mm year(-1)). Other trends include a decrease in Tanytarsus and Daphnia and an exponential increase in green algae (Cladophorales, Pediastrum) and associated organisms.					; Gudbergsson, Gudni/AAJ-5553-2020; Gislason, Gisli/B-2109-2008; Gislason, Gisli Mar/B-2109-2008	Wakana, Isamu/0000-0002-5048-0626; Gislason, Gisli Mar/0000-0001-8507-1796													1386-2588	1573-5125					2004	38	2					317	348		10.1023/B:AECO.0000032090.72702.a9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:AECO.0000032090.72702.a9													WOS:000222064400019
J	Strydom, NA				Strydom, N. A.			Patterns in Larval Fish Diversity, Abundance, and Distribution in Temperate South African Estuaries	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Estuaries are important nursery areas for fishes worldwide but large-scale studies of spatial patterns of use are lacking. This study presents data on larval fish diversity, abundance and distribution within and among a range of temperate estuary types, spanning 25 systems sampled from 1998 to 2008 in South Africa. A standardized boat-based plankton towing technique was used. Estuary type and physico-chemical conditions played a defining role in the trends observed. Estuary resident Clupeidae and Gobiidae dominated the mid-channel larval catch, particularly the preflexion stages in permanently and intermittently open estuaries and in estuarine lakes. Permanently open estuaries were also characterized by high numbers of larvae and early juveniles of marine migrant fishes. Density was higher in warmer months (spring and summer), which coincides with peak spawning in coastal habitats coupled with zooplankton maxima in the warm-temperate region. A strong seasonal component was also evident in larval fish catches in cool-temperate systems, but this peak coincided with late winter rainfall. River inflow provides a strong influence on food availability and larval survival. Species richness and diversity was higher in estuaries with either extensive habitat variability and/or a strong, natural good supply of river flow. This was particularly evident in the higher numbers of marine migrant larvae in these systems. Freshwater deprived estuaries also displayed high species diversity due to the higher incidence of marine straggler species. Characterization of salinity into zones provided a valuable means to understand distribution and abundance dynamics. Mesohaline zones had the highest density of larval fishes, providing ideal food patches. A select suite of species dominate the larval fish assemblages in the various estuary types studied. These patterns persist but species abundance and rank may vary interannually based on productivity and larval fish survival.

ROTIFERS OF KEPEKTAS DAM LAKE (ELAZIG-TURKEY)	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY TRANSACTION A-SCIENCE												With the aim of identifying the Rotifera fauna of Kepektas Dam Lake, samples were collected monthly between January-December 2005. In total 11 rotifer species were identified. As a species-wise percentage, Kellicttia longispina had the highest level with 57%. When the annual abundance of species was taken into consideration Polyarthra vulgaris, Colurella uncinata, Asplanchna priodonta and Keratella cochlearis were determined as dominant species. These species were observed in most months of the year and were well observed in their annual abundance. Notholca squamula was classified as cold steno-thermal species, as this species was recorded only in February and March. Increases in Rotifer individual numbers were observed in spring and summer months.					; Saler, Serap/V-9012-2018	saler, serap/0000-0001-5900-491X; 													1028-6276					WIN	2009	33	A1					121	126																WOS:000282797100012

The following species were held at ambient temperatures of ca. 1 degrees C (Notothenia coriiceps, Antarctica), 5 degrees C (Pleuronectes platessa, Myoxocephalus scorpius; North Sea), and 26 degrees C (Oreochromis niloticus, African lakes). The effects of seasonal acclimatisation to 4, 11 and 18 degrees C were also examined in rainbow trout in the winter, autumn and summer, respectively. Extracellular (whole blood) pH (pH(e)) did not follow the constant relative alkalinity relationship, where pH(+) = pOH(-) for any particular temperature, over a range of 1-26 degrees C (overall delta pH(e)/delta T = 0.009 +/- 0.002 U degrees C-1; P < 0.001), apparently being regulated by ionic fluxes and ventilation. Intracellular pH (pH(i)) was also regulated independently of pN(= 0.5 pK water) in all species of fish examined. The inverse relationship between pH(i) and environmental temperature gave an overall delta pH(i)/delta T of -0.010 +/- 0.001 U degrees C-1 (for both white and red muscle) and -0.004 +/- 0.093 U degrees C-1 (cardiac muscle). However, between 1 and 11 degrees C delta pH(i)/delta T was much higher (P < 0.001), -0.022 +/- 0.003 U degrees C-1 (white muscle) and -0.022 +/- 0.004 U degrees C-1 (red muscle). The possible adaptive roles for these different acid-base responses to environmental temperature variation among tissues and species, and the potential difficulties of estimating pH(i). are discussed.

J	STANSLEY, W; COOPER, G				STANSLEY, W; COOPER, G			AN ACIDIC SNOWMELT EVENT IN A NEW-JERSEY STREAM - EVIDENCE OF EFFECTS ON AN INDIGENOUS TROUT POPULATION	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Van Campens Brook is a circumneutral stream in northwestern New Jersey that supports reproducing populations of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), brown trout (Salmo trutta) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). A short-term pH depression occurred in the stream following a snowmelt in the spring of 1984. A stream pH of 4.5 was recorded shortly after the onset of the snowmelt and the pH remained depressed (5.2) a week later. Stream pH did not fall below 6.2 following other rain and snowmelt events monitored during 1985-1987. An electrofishing survey conducted in 1985 revealed a near-total absence of 1984 year-class rainbow trout, spring spawners that are highly sensitive to acidity. Brook and brown trout spawning appeared to be unaffected. Rainbow trout reproductive success was good during 1985-87.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				OCT	1990	53	3-4					227	237																WOS:A1990FF60500003

However, knowledge about the relative importance of these factors is limited. This study presents a case study conducted in semi-arid, shallow eutrophic lakes in China to evaluate the relative importance of physical, chemical, and nutritional characteristics of water quality and light effects on the spatiotemporal distributions of diversity and stability of plankton communities. The findings showed that the plankton community was the least diverse in winter and the most stable during the spring-to-summer transition. The results of partition variation showed that physical and chemical indicators, nutritional parameters, and light effects explained >70 % of the zooplankton community dynamics, compared with 37 % for phytoplankton. For phytoplankton community composition, physical and chemical parameters, followed by light, had the greatest influence. Further analysis showed that phytoplankton were influenced primarily by nutrients, water depth, and pH. Similarly, the diversity and stability of the zooplankton exhibited physical and chemical parameter responses, and the influence of nutrients also played a significant role. Structural equation modelling showed that light had minimal direct effect on the plankton and affected the plankton indirectly through changes in total nitrogen and NO3-N. This study estimates the distri-bution of plankton community in a shallow eutrophic lake, quantifying the relative effects of different envi-ronmental drivers on plankton diversity and stability, and provides an in-depth understanding for improving the lake water quality and controlling nutrients pollution.					li, meixia/LEM-7721-2024														1470-160X	1872-7034				NOV	2022	144								109560	10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109560	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109560		OCT 2022											WOS:000873914900005

In Harp Lake, the abundances of several cladoceran and one cyclopoid species fell after the invasion, and far fewer species benefited. To determine if Harp Lake provides typical results, we compared the summer crustacean zooplankton communities of 17 invaded and 13 noninvaded (reference) lakes in Ontario. The communities of the two lake groups differed. Average species richness was 30% higher in the reference (15.3 species) vs. the invaded lakes (11.8 species). Total zooplankton biomass was significantly lower in the invaded lakes, mainly because of lower abundances of all common epilimnetic cladoceran species. As these results were quite similar to those of Harp Lake, it is apparent that current summer zooplankton communities of Canadian Shield lakes with Bythotrephes differ substantially from noninvaded lakes.					; Yan, Norman/H-5235-2013	Yan, Norman/0000-0003-4870-6865; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				NOV	2003	60	11					1307	1313		10.1139/F03-111	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F03-111													WOS:000187754000001
J	Burns, DA; McDonnell, JJ				Burns, DA; McDonnell, JJ			Effects of a beaver pond on runoff processes: comparison of two headwater catchments	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Natural variations in concentrations of O-18, D, and H4SiO4 in two tributary catchments of Woods Lake in the west-central Adirondack Mountains of New York were measured during 1989-91 to examine runoff processes and their implications for the neutralization of acidic precipitation by calcium carbonate treatment. The two catchments are similar except that one contained a 1.3 ha beaver pond. Evaporation from the beaver pond caused a seasonal decrease in the slope of the meteoric water line in stream water from the catchment with a beaver pond (WO2). No corresponding change in slope of the meteoric water line was evident in stream water from the other catchment (WO4), nor in ground water nor soil water from either catchment, indicating that evaporative fractionation was not significant. Application of a best-fit sine curve to delta(18)O data indicated that base how in both catchments had a residence time of about 100 days, Ground water from a well finished in thick till had the longest residence time (160 days); soil water from the O-horizon and B-horizon had residence times of 63 and 80 days, respectively. Water previously stored within each catchment (pre-event water) was the predominant component of streamflow during spring snowmelt and during spring and autumn rainfall events, but the proportion of streamflow that consisted of pre-event water differed significantly in the two catchments. The proportion of event water (rain and snowmelt) in WO2 was smaller than at WO4 early in the spring snowmelt of March 13-17, 1990, but the proportions of source water components for the two catchments were almost indistinguishable by the peak flow on the third day of the melt. The event water was further separated into surface-water and subsurface-water components by utilizing measured changes in H4SiO4 concentrations in stream water during the snowmelt. Results indicated that subsurface flow was the dominant pathway by which event water reached the stream except during the peak flow of a rain-on-snow event on the last day of the melt. Streamflow from a spring rain storm with dry antecedent conditions two months later (May 16-18, 1990), was less than 5% event water at peak flow in WO2 and 26% in WO4. This change from the runoff pattern in March is attributed to retention of event water in the beaver pond favored by relatively low pre-event storage and isothermal (nonstratified) conditions in the pond that allowed mixing. Streamflow during several autumn storms was about 15-25% event water at peak flow in WO4; the highest values for event water were associated with wet antecedent moisture conditions. These results indicate that a beaver pond can significantly affect the downstream delivery of event water through evaporation and mixing, but provides minimal retention during large runoff events such as snowmelt. Beaver ponds are expected to provide greater opportunity for neutralization of acidic waters during most of the year in catchments treated with calcium carbonate, but little neutralization effect during snowmelt.

Oxidation, efflux, and isotopic fractionation of methane during autumnal turnover in a polyhumic, boreal lake	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												We studied the oxidation and efflux of methane (CH4) in a small, polyhumic lake, Mekkojarvi (southern Finland), during 6 weeks in autumn when the stability of the water mass first weakened, temporarily restabilized, and finally mixed completely. During the summer stratification period, CH4 had accumulated in the anoxic hypolimnion to high concentrations (>150 mmol m(-3)). Gradual mixing of the water column during the autumn allowed access to both oxygen and CH4 by aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) deeper in the water column. Thus the bulk (similar to 83-88%) of the CH4 accumulated in the hypolimnion was subsequently consumed by MOB while only 12-17% was lost from the lake to the atmosphere at a rate varying between 0.05 and 8.8 mmol m(-2) d(-1). Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analyses revealed that type I methanotrophs (MOB I) were responsible for this CH4 oxidation. The stable carbon isotope ratio of CH4 in the water column (delta C-13-CH4) ranged from -81.2% close to the bottom to -45.1% at the surface. At CH4 concentrations >1 mmol m(-3) the delta C-13-CH4 isotopic value was linearly related to the specific oxidation rate. The carbon isotopic fractionation factor a for aerobic CH4 oxidation calculated from the results (1.037) is within the range of maximum values reported in literature. Our results show that in stratified boreal lakes the greatest MOB activity and effluxes of CH4 both occur during autumnal mixing. Owing to their great abundance and areal cover, small water bodies should not be neglected in global analyses of the CH4 cycle.					; Jones, Roger/C-7703-2011; Taipale, Sami/AAO-3492-2020	Taipale, Sami/0000-0001-7510-7337; Jones, Roger/0000-0002-0835-8264; 													2169-8953	2169-8961				JUN 27	2007	112	G2							G02003	10.1029/2006JG000336	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2006JG000336													WOS:000247684300001

These interactions can be indirectly mediated by shared resources or consumers, or through interference by the production of allelochemicals. Allelopathic interactions and resource competition have been shown to occur among algae and associated microbes. However, little work has considered seasonal influences on ecosystem structure and function. Here, we report results of our investigations on seasonal changes in the interactions between benthic microbial assemblies and the bloom forming cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa. We show that phosphorus (P) competition and allelopathy by the microbial assembly vary seasonally and inhibit growth of M. aeruginosa. The interactions per unit biomass of the microbial assembly are stronger under winter than summer conditions and inhibit the recruitment of the cyanobacteria, thereby preventing the reoccurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in the following summer. The seasonality of these interactions correlates with changes in composition, metabolic activity and functional diversity of the microbial assembly. Our findings highlight the importance of competitive and allelopathic interactions in regulating the occurrence of harmful algal blooms. Our results also imply that seasonal variation of competition and allelopathy of the microbial assembly might be beneficial to adjust aquatic ecosystem structure and function.

Heavy metals content in hepatopancreas in males and females of P clarkii was low and did not vary through the sampling periods and between sexes. On the contrary, crayfish exhibited sex-dependent differences in levels of some enzyme activities and of total glutathione, and no apparent relationship was found between contaminant burdens and antioxidant indexes in hepatopancreas. Because measured metal concentrations were low, other factors, presumably, were involved in antioxidant variations in P clarkii and these latter seemed to be affected more by biological and environmental factors, other than those related to pollutants body burdens.

Very contrasting weather conditions were observed in the region in winter-spring months of 2010-2012, which largely determined the character of hydrologic and biologic processes in the pelagic water zone of Baikal. The cardinal difference in weather conditions before expeditions of 2010-2012 made it possible to estimate a wide range of interannual variations in these characteristics and to analyze their role in the formation of fluxes at different stages of springtime warming on the basis of three datasets. The quantitative characteristics of phytoplankton biomass are compared with the difference in partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the air-water system.

After feasibility experiments, the operation time and the distance of the traps from the benthic substrate were adjusted in order to minimize the effects of diurnal variation and the trapping of planktonic organisms. The trap catches of Eurycercus lamellatus were positively correlated with their abundance at the bottom as estimated by grab sampling (r = 0.910, P < 0.001). The usefulness of the activity trap was demonstrated by: (1) a lake-wide survey of the benthic Cladocera; ( 2) a study of the seasonal variation in the size distribution, abundance and sex ratio of E. lamellatus; and ( 3) a study of the seasonal succession of Chydorus sphaericus and Alona affinis. The variation of benthic Cladocera among 21 trap sites distributed on a 1-2-km scale across the lake exceeded the within-site variation. The sampling sites could be divided into five main groups based on cluster analysis. Eurycercus lamellatus was the most common species in the mat of filamentous green algae (Cladophorales). Alonella nana dominated the area of spring water inflow in the north basin and Macrothrix hirsuticornis the area of spring water inflow in the southeastern part of the lake. In other parts of the lake either Chydorus sphaericus or Alona quadrangularis tended to dominate. The size distribution and sex ratio of E. lamellatus was followed at two sites through one summer. In early summer most individuals were females less than 1.45 mm long. Around mid-summer they had grown to 0.69-3.1 mm. By the end of August the size distribution had become bimodal, with a large number of small males and a smaller number of much larger females. The seasonal succession in the abundance of E. lamellatus, A. affinis and C. sphaericus was followed at four sites over two seasons. With some exceptions the abundance of a species followed a similar seasonal trajectory on the different stations in any one year. There was, however, a marked difference between the two years ( 1991 and 1992), probably related to different temperatures.																			1386-2588	1573-5125					2004	38	2					239	251																WOS:000222064400012

To generate the business-as-usual scenario map for year 2050 we used the Land Change Modeler. With a combined change in land cover and climate, discharge is expected to decline in all seasons except the end of autumn and winter, based on the inter-model average and various climate models, which illustrated a high degree of uncertainty in discharge projections.

J	Nof, D; McKeague, I; Paldor, N				Nof, D; McKeague, I; Paldor, N			Is there a paleolimnological explanation for 'walking on water' in the Sea of Galilee?	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Lake Kinneret (the Sea of Galilee) is a small freshwater lake (148 km(2) and a mean depth of 20 m) situated in northern Israel. Throughout recent history there have been no known records of a total ice formation on its top. Furthermore, given that convection requires an initial cooling of the entire lake down to 4 degrees C, it is difficult to imagine how such a low-latitude lake, presently subject to two-digit temperatures during the winter, could ever freeze. Lake Kinneret is, however, unique in the sense that there are dense (warm and salty) springs along its western shore. The dynamics of the regions adjacent to these springs are investigated using a one-dimensional nonlinear analytical ice model, a paleoceanographic record of the sea surface temperature of the Mediterranean Sea, and a statistical model. We show that, because the water directly above the plume created by the salty springs does not convect when it is cooled down to 4 degrees C, freezing of the region directly above the salty springs was possible during periods when the climate in the region was somewhat cooler than it is today. We refer to this localized freezing situation as 'springs ice'. The analytical ice-model involves a slowly varying approach where the ice is part of a thin fresh and cold layer floating on top of the salty and warm spring water below. During the ice formation process, the ice is cooled by the atmosphere above and warmed by the spring water below. The plumes created by the springs have a length scale of 30 m, and it is argued that, during the Younger Dryas when the air temperature in the region was probably 7 degrees C or more cooler than today, 'springs ice' (thick enough to support human weight) was formed once every 27 years or less. During the cold events 1500 and 2500 years ago (when the atmospheric temperature was 3 degrees C or more lower than today) springs ice occurred about once in 160 years or less. Since the duration of these cold events is of the same order as the springs ice recurrence time, there is a substantial chance that at least one springs ice occurred during these cooler periods. With today's climate, the likelihood of a springs ice is virtually zero (i.e., once in more than 10,000 years). One set of those springs associated with the freezing is situated in Tabgha, an area where many archeological features associated with Jesus Christ have been found. On this basis, it is proposed that the unusual local freezing process might have provided an origin to the story that Christ walked on water. Since the springs ice is relatively small, a person standing or walking on it may appear to an observer situated some distance away to be 'walking on water'. This is particularly true if it rained after the ice was formed (because rain smoothes out the ice's surface). Whether this happened or not is an issue for religion scholars, archeologists, anthropologists, and believers to decide on. As natural scientists, we merely point out that unique freezing processes probably happened in that region several times during the last 12,000 years.					paldor, nathan/AAE-3186-2020														0921-2728	1573-0417				APR	2006	35	3					417	439		10.1007/s10933-005-1996-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-005-1996-1													WOS:000236090300001
J	Pyle, WH; Crawford, JA				Pyle, WH; Crawford, JA			Availability of foods of sage grouse chicks following prescribed fire in sagebrush-bitterbrush	JOURNAL OF RANGE MANAGEMENT												A study was conducted to determine the influence of prescribed fire on the availability of primary foods of sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus Bonaparte) chicks at Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge, Lake County, Ore, from 1987 to 1989. Responses of certain primary foods and general food categories to fire were evaluated in sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. vaseyana Beetle)-bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata Pursh.) communities with a randomized block design established in stands where shrub cover exceeded 35%. Within blocks, habitat response was evaluated far 2 growing seasons on 4 plots used as controls, 3 plots burned in November 1987, and 4 plots burned in March 1988. Fall burning increased (P < 0.05) frequency of taxa in the dandelion tribe (Cichoriene). Other primary foods, including microsteris (Microsteris gracilis Hook.), desert-parsley (Lomatium spp. Raf.), and ground-dwelling beetles (Scarabaeidae, Tenebrionidae) were not influenced by burning. Spring and fall burning increased (P < 0.05) total forb cover and diversity, but decreased (P < 0.05) sagebrush cover. Prescribed fire may increase the supply of forbs available to sage grouse in montane sagebrush habitats used for brood-rearing where shrubs dominate stands at the expense of the herbaceous component.																			0022-409X					JUL	1996	49	4					320	324		10.2307/4002590	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4002590													WOS:A1996UV41700006

The lake is temperate, monomictic, and poor in nutrients although some slight increases in nutrient levels were recorded. The phytoplankton was mainly composed of Bacillariophyta, Chlorophyta and Cyanobacteria. The dominating algae were Cyclotella ocellata and Fragilaria spp. in the upper water column and Planktothrix rubescens particularly in the metalimnion. Mougeotia sp. increased in late spring and early summer 1998. Members of four other divisions were rare and found only in small numbers. Density and biomass were low. The data suggest that the lake is still in an oligotrophic state slightly changing towards oligo-mesotrophy.					, merbay/AAB-9694-2020; AKTAN TURAN, Yelda/AAD-1812-2020; , reyhan/AAB-8612-2020														0029-5035	2363-7188					2006				130			325	337																WOS:000239016300023

Records of past Pw can offer important insight into long-term changes in atmospheric circulation, but few proxies are able to accurately capture winter climate variations in Scandinavia. Reconstructions of equilibrium-line-altitude (ELA) variations from glaciers that are sensitive to changes in Pw therefore provide a unique opportunity to quantify past winter climate in this region. Here we present a new, Holocene glacier activity reconstruction for the maritime ice cap Alfotbreen in western Norway, based on investigations of distal glacier-fed lake sediments and modern mass balance measurements (1963-2010). Several lake sediment cores have been subject to a suite of laboratory analyses, including measurements of physical parameters such as dry bulk density (DBD) and loss-on-ignition (LOI), geochemistry (XRF), surface magnetic susceptibility (MS), and grain size distribution, to identify glacial sedimentation in the lake. Both radiocarbon (AMS C-14) and Pb-210 dating were applied to establish age-depth relationships in the sediment cores. A novel approach was used to calibrate the sedimentary record against a simple ELA model, which allowed reconstruction of continuous ELA changes for Alfotbreen during the Neoglacial (when Alfotbreen was present, i.e. the last similar to 1400 years). Furthermore, the resulting ELA variations were combined with an independent summer temperature record to calculate Neoglacial Pw using the 'Liestol equation'. The resulting Pw record is of higher resolution than previous reconstructions from glaciers in Norway and shows the potential of glacier records to provide high-resolution data reflecting past variations in hydroclimate. Complete deglaciation of the Alfotbreen occurred similar to 9700 cal yr BP, and the ice cap was subsequently absent or very small until a short-lived glacier event is seen in the lake sediments similar to 8200 cal yr BP. The ice cap was most likely completely melted until a new glacier event occurred around similar to 5300 cal yr BP, coeval with the onset of the Neoglacial at several other glaciers in southwestern Norway. Alfotbreen was thereafter absent (or very small) until the onset of the Neoglacial period similar to 1400 cal yr BP. The 'Little Ice Age' (LIA) similar to 650-50 cal yr BP was the largest glacier advance of Alfotbreen since deglaciation, with a maximum extent at similar to 400-200 cal yr BP, when the ELA was lowered approximately 200 m relative to today. The late onset of the Neoglacial at Alfotbreen is suggested to be a result of its low altitude relative to the regional ELA. A synthesis of Neoglacial ELA fluctuations along the coast of Norway indicates a time transgressive trend in the maximum extent of the LIA, which apparently seems to have occurred progressively later as we move northwards. We suggest that this trend is likely due to regional winter precipitation differences along the coast of Norway. (C) 2015 The Authors.

J	Johnson, JH				Johnson, JH			Comparative survival and growth of Atlantic salmon from egg stocking and fry releases	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												First summer survival and subsequent growth of Atlantic salmon Salina salar planted as eggs and fry in a tributary of Cayuga Lake, New York, were examined for 3 years. Atlantic salmon were planted in December 1999-2001 in 20 Whitlock-Vibert (W-V) egg incubators, each containing 300 eyed eggs. The following May, 500 fin-clipped Atlantic salmon fry were released in the same stream section. In autumn, a back-pack electroshocker was used to capture fry to assess survival and growth. Mean survival was significantly greater for fry (27.9%) than eggs (0.8%). In autumn, mean length was significantly greater for Atlantic salmon released as fry (90.1 mm) than those planted as eggs (76.2 mm), probably owing to accelerated growth in the hatchery caused by warmer water temperatures (i.e., hatchery, 9.4degreesC; stream, 5.1degreesC). Releasing Atlantic salmon fry in May was nearly I I times more costly in terms of hatchery effort than was releasing eggs in December. Although the survival of Atlantic salmon eggs in W-V incubators was low, when considering production costs, the use of egg plantings may warrant consideration under certain restoration or enhancement situations.																			0275-5947					NOV	2004	24	4					1409	1412		10.1577/1548-8675(2004)24<1409:CSAGOA>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8675(2004)24<1409:CSAGOA>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000226080800029
J	Rojo, C; Kiss, KT; Alvarez-Cobelas, M; Rodrigo, MA				Rojo, C; Kiss, KT; Alvarez-Cobelas, M; Rodrigo, MA			Population dynamics of Cyclotella ocellata (Bacillariophyceae):: endogenous and exogenous factors	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Population dynamics of Cyclotella ocellata PANTOCSEK were examined from 1991 to 1993 in an oligo-mesotrophic, gravel-pit lake near Madrid (Spain). Monthly and daily sampling was carried out to track seasonal- and auxosporulation dynamics, respectively. This species was the most abundant planktonic diatom in the lake. The population increased steadily in spring until the seasonal peak (3.8 . 10(6)ind/L in April) and then abundance declined slowly through late winter. Time series techniques showed that the seasonal dynamics were driven by exogenous factors: there was a relationship between Cyclotella abundance and the chemical environment, both TP (synchronic) and SRSi (with delay). Auxosporulation (studied on a daily scale) occurred in late summer, when 90 % of cells had a diameter of less than 10 mu m. The smallest vegetative cells of C. ocellata (preauxospores) presented an endogenous dynamic: their dynamics had no relationship with environmental changes and the cell size dynamic seems to be the most important factor in inducing auxosporulation. The regenerated population (auxospores and initial cells) constituted the largest component of diatom biomass during thermal overturn, and followed the increase in nutrient concentration. The dynamic was also controlled by nutrients in the lake as influenced by mixing, hence it was driven by exogenous factors. The pattern of life history strategies followed by C. ocellata was that of synchronous sexuality under favourable conditions: vegetative growth throughout the year, a reduction in size when nutrients were decreasing until a critical size and a critical percentage of minor cells was reached and then, when more nitrogen became again available, the formation of auxospores for one month.

Here we presented a data synthesis of peatland initiation ages, area changes, and peat carbon (C) accumulation rate variations in China since the Holocene, along with total C pool estimates. The data showed different controls of peatland expansion and C accumulation in different regions. The peat C accumulation rates were 32.3 (ranging from 20.7 to 50.2) g C m(-2) yr(-1) in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) and 14.7 (ranging from 7.4 to 36.5) g C m(-2) yr(-1) in the Northeast China (NEC). The peaks of peatland expansion and C accumulation in the QTP occurred in the early Holocene in response to high summer insolation and strong summer-winter climate seasonality. The rapid peatland expansion and maximum C accumulation rate in the NEC occurred in the middle-late Holocene. Peatlands scattered in the coastal and lakeside regions of China expanded rapidly at the onset of the Holocene due to large transgression, consistent with the stronger summer insolation and monsoon, and during the middle and late Holocene, as a response to the high and stable sea level and the strong summer monsoon. The carbon storage of peatlands in China was estimated as 2.17 (ranging from 1.16 to 3.18) Pg, among which 1.49 (ranging from 0.58 to 2.40) Pg was contributed by peatlands in the QTP, 021 (ranging from 0.11 to 0.31) Pg by those in the NEC, and 0.47 Pg by those scattered in other regions of China. Our comparison of peatlands dynamics among regions in China showed that climate and monsoon are the essential factors in determining the expansion and carbon accumulation patterns of peatlands, although their effects on peatland formation and C accumulation is complex owing to land availability in peatland basins and regional moisture conditions.

J	Dvoretsky, VG; Dvoretsky, AG				Dvoretsky, Vladimir G.; Dvoretsky, Alexander G.			Winter Zooplankton in a Small Arctic Lake: Abundance and Vertical Distribution	WATER												Zooplankton assemblages are of great importance in aquatic food webs because they link lower (microplankton) and higher trophic levels (top predators). Small water bodies in the Arctic regions of Russia are less studied in winter because of severe ice conditions. For this reason, we analyzed the winter zooplankton community in Lake Kulonga (western coast of Kola Bay, Barents Sea). A total of 9 taxa were found in the samples. The total abundance varied from 200 to 1320 ind. m(-3), averaging 705 ind. m(-3). The total zooplankton biomass was 1.8-72.8 mg of wet mass m(-3) with an average of 30 mg m(-3). These parameters were lower than in other Russian Arctic and sub-arctic lakes in summer. Old copepodites of Cyclops spp. dominated the zooplankton community at deep-water stations in terms of the total abundance consisting of 24-33%. The copepod Macrocyclops albidus prevailed in terms of the total zooplankton biomass comprising 30-33% at deep-water stations while Cyclops scutifer and copepodites Cyclops spp. had the highest biomass at shallow water stations. Vertical distribution demonstrated different patterns at neighboring stations, probably as a result of differences in the density of fish predators.

Here we quantified the interaction between hydrology, aquatic metabolism and atmospheric CO2 exchange in the lacustrine Qu'Appelle arm of Lake Diefenbaker, Canada, by comparing total phytoplankton abundance (as Chlorophyll a), net primary productivity (NPP), ratios of microbial productivity (P) to respiration (R), and chemically-enhanced CO2 flux over four springs and summers (2010-2013) with contrasting hydrologic characteristics. Overall, dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations were correlated inversely (R-adj(2) = 0.63, p <0.0001) with delta O-18 values of DO indicating a strong metabolic coupling in this polymictic basin, whereas correlations between concentration and C isotope ratios of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) were not significant (R-adj(2) <0.05). In most years, P:R modeled from DO characteristics was >1, the basin was slightly autotrophic and CO2 was captured from the atmosphere. In contrast, the Qu'Appelle arm was a substantial source of CO2 during 2012 when river discharge was low, pH was <8.6, cyanobacteria were common, and P:R was <1. Multiple least-squares regressions and principal component analysis inferred that hydrologic variability influenced changes in water-column metabolism, whereas independent variation in pH was the main control of atmospheric CO2 exchange (R-adj CO2-pH(2) = 0.84, p <0.0001). Together, these findings suggest that lacustrine basins of alkaline reservoirs may lack strong coupling of water-column metabolism and CO2 dynamics on seasonal and inter-annual scales.

This study discusses the findings from a new pollen record from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Site U1427, situated off the northern coast of the Honshu Island in western Japan, which allows for direct comparisons with other oceanographic proxies from this area. Our findings demonstrate the orbital-scale vegetation changes in this area and their land-ocean-atmosphere linkages during the last 550 ka. During surface-water freshening events in the Japan Sea, likely associated with colder water temperatures caused by the very low eustatic sea levels and the consequent isolation from the surrounding seas during the full-glacial periods, cold-cool conifer forests became dominant under the extremely dry pseudo-continental conditions in the Japanese islands. In contrast, temperate broadleaf forests increased rapidly when the surface-freshening events ended and a weak inflow of warm water began at the onset of deglaciation, in addition to the rapid atmospheric climate warming during termination periods. During the intermediate periods between the full interglacial to the full-glacial, the Tp ratio (pollen temperature index) increased in association with the summer insolation maxima caused by the Earth's precession cycle that coincide with Chinese stalagmite negative delta O-18 peaks, whereas Cryptomeria pollen abundance (high-precipitation index) increased in association with the winter insolation maxima. Those orbital-scale vegetation fluctuations were attributed to the changes in seasonal temperature and precipitation patterns, where were influenced by the EAM changes that were associated with seasonal insolation changes around the Japanese archipelago. Cryptomeria forests likely developed under cool and wet conditions throughout a year with low seasonal contrasts, whereas deciduous broadleaf forests increased under condition of high seasonality with cool summers and colder, drier winters. Alternating fluctuations between the Tp ratio and Cryptomeria pollen abundance following the insolation changes were typically observed after MIS 9 and are thought to have been affected by the periodicity shift in the EAM fluctuations across the Mid-Brunhes Event.

We examined six groups of factors that potentially could affect the numbers of pairs nesting each year, including availability of nesting habitat, numbers of potential breeding gulls, environmental conditions along the Pacific coast in the preceding winter, spring conditions at the lake, food availability at the lake, and prior breeding experience. Four variables explained > 80% of the variation in the numbers of breeding gulls at Mono Lake between 1987 and 2003: the potential number of four-year-old gulls returning to the lake to breed for the first time, winter coastal conditions associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, density of endemic brine shrimp (Artemia monica) close to the time of egg-laying, and mean temperature in the month before egg-laying. Of the four factors the latter two, which reflect local conditions near the time of egg-laying, had the most profound direct effect on the numbers of breeding gulls. Yearly variation in the snow pack and spring runoff affects brine shrimp numbers through changes in limnological conditions, thus regional climate patterns may indirectly influence gull numbers.

The PAH profiles indicate that PAHs mainly have a pyrolytic origin, both in urban and industrial areas. PAH sources vary during the year with an increase of high molecular weight PAH proportions (especially for carcinogenic PAHs) in winter, that means an increase of combustion processes such as domestic heating. Ratios of indicator PAHs (FTH/FTH + PYR and IcdP/IcdP + BghiP) confirm the pyrolytic origin of PAHs. In summer, ratios show the presence of industrial sources. In addition to these two methods, a factor analysis/multiple linear regression model was applied and gave an approximation of PAH source apportionment. PAH were found to be associated predominantly with emissions from road traffic (gasoline and diesel), that accounts for 17-34%. Domestic heating is a very important PAH source in urban areas and accounts for up to 85% of PAHs in winter. Industrial emissions (refineries...) account for 25% in the industrial area in summer.

J	Luzón, A; Mayayo, MJ; Pérez, A				Luzon, A.; Mayayo, M. J.; Perez, A.			Stable isotope characterisation of co-existing carbonates from the Holocene Gallocanta lake (NE Spain): palaeolimnological implications	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												The sedimentary succession of Gallocanta lake, a closed saline lake located in the Iberian Range (NE Spain), documents two successive lacustrine stages: (1) brackish lake stage and (2) shallow saline lake stage. The saline stage corresponds to the present-day situation in which the lake water properties are mainly controlled by a strongly negative annual water balance. The carbonates of the brackish lake stage have relatively constant delta O-18 values, however, they are rather high (delta O-18(Do) = 2.4aEuro degrees and delta O-18(Cc) = 4.5aEuro degrees mean values) suggesting a hydrologically closed lake with a long residence time of the waters. delta O-18 values of carbonates from the saline stage vary greatly, and are lighter than in the previous stage (delta O-18(Do) = 0.5aEuro degrees, delta O-18(Cc) = -0.7aEuro degrees, delta O-18(Mgs) = -2.3aEuro degrees mean values). These carbonates also precipitated in a hydrologically closed lake, but in equilibrium with a lake water of more variable isotopic composition. The delta C-13 values for carbonates of both stages reflect a mixing of different pools of carbon, but during saline stage delta C-13 values have been more controlled by the equilibrium of the lake waters with atmospheric CO2. During the current stage, calcite and dolomite precipitate in Gallocanta lake mainly during spring and summer, although dolomite precipitation is more favoured towards the summer. Magnesite precipitates at the beginning of autumn, when the first rainfall re-dissolves the saline surface crust, producing saline waters with a high Mg2+ content. The isotopic composition of lake waters sampled in 2005 are far higher than those calculated from the carbonates. It is considered that this could be due to two factors: either because there have not been many extremely dry years (like the year 2005) during the development of the lake, or because the physical and chemical characteristics of the lake waters in such conditions are not appropriate for the development of these minerals.

J	Liboriussen, L; Jeppesen, E				Liboriussen, L; Jeppesen, E			Temporal dynamics in epipelic, pelagic and epiphytic algal production in a clear and a turbid shallow lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Pelagic and epipelic microalgal production were measured over a year in a pre-defined area (depth 0.5 m) in each of two lakes, one turbid and one with clear water. Further estimates of epiphytic production within reed stands were obtained by measuring production of periphyton developed on artificial substrata. 2. Total annual production of phytoplankton and epipelon was 34% greater in the turbid lake (190 g C m(-2) year(-1)) than in the clearwater lake (141 g C m(-2) year(-1)). However, the ratio of total production to mean water column TP concentration was two fold greater in the clearwater lake. 3. Phytoplankton accounted for the majority of the annual production (96%) in the turbid lake, while epipelic microalgal production dominated (77%) in the clear lake. The relative contribution of epipelic algae varied over the year, however, and in the turbid lake was higher in winter (11-25%), when the water was relatively clear, than during summer (0.7-1.7%), when the water was more turbid. In the clearwater lake, the relative contribution of epipelon was high both in winter, when the water was most clear, and in mid-summer, when phytoplankton production was constrained either by nutrients or grazing. 4. Compared with pelagic and epipelic primary production, epiphytic production within a reed stand was low and did not vary significantly between the lakes. 5. The study supports the theory of a competitive and compensatory trade-off between primary producers in lakes with contrasting nutrient concentrations, resulting in relatively small differences in overall production between clear and turbid lakes when integrating over the season and over different habitats.

After drainage of a lake, peat forming vegetation invaded rapidly. Comparison with palaeotemperature data shows that the initial formation of mature ridges coincided with a period of high summer temperatures around AD 1400. The ridges persisted and expanded during the subsequent colder ca 200 years. Partial collapse of various ridges at the end of the 18th century corresponded to a phase with low summer temperatures. During the warm, 20th century one collapsed ridge regenerated, whereas another persisted in its collapsed state. Ice-wedge polygons are, thus, complex and highly dynamic ecosystems, in which changes in temperature and precipitation may induce rapid ecological changes by the complex interplay of water, ice and vegetation. Our study indicates that global warming associated with a decrease in summer precipitation may initially result in enhanced polygon ridge formation. The combination of longer summers and increased winter precipitation, as predicted for high latitudes will, however, eventually result in larger meltwater input in the polygon mires, which may cause the (partial) collapse of polygon ridges and underlying ice-wedges.

Lake outflow discharge ranged from 21.7 .times. 105 to 177 .times. 105 m3 .cntdot. yr-1. Annual P input to the lakes from terrestrial drainage and precipitation totaled 36.3-188 kg .cntdot. yr-1. The lakes retained 16-41% of the annual input. These data were used to test a series of models that predict the spring total P concentration in lake water and the mean summer chlorophyll a. The predicted spring P concentration agreed well with measured values (within 1.3 mg .cntdot. m-3) except where human-associated P input may have contributed to the P budget of the lake. Agreement between predicted and measured chlorophyll a was not as close. A figue of 0.48 kg P .cntdot. capita-1 .cntdot. yr-1 was calculated as the human-associated supply.																									1978	35	3					300	304		10.1139/f78-054	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f78-054													WOS:A1978EM28600004

However, there was no apparent earthquake related radon anomaly in 5 years of monitoring. Physical mechanisms behind periodic as well as transient radon variations were investigated. The radon signal contained periodic daily and non-periodic multi-day variations as well as seasonal patterns with maxima during winter. Spectral analysis showed diurnal and semidiurnal periodic constituents while tidal effects were absent. In 2003 the long-term average radon concentration dropped by 35%. Coevally, the diurnal and semi-diurnal radon variability considerably decreased. In contrast, the intensity of large-scale signals, corresponding to multi-day radon variability, increased. At this stage the level of the Kinneret Lake is suspected to be the driving force for the radon drop. Until 2003 the lake level hovered around 214 m below sea-level. In spring 2003 the lake level had risen by 4 m. The distance between the monitoring station and the lake shore is about 50 m. The radon concentration inversely followed the lake level with a time delay of about 3 months. Radon measured at a natural hot spring should depend on the flow rate of the hot water rising on the border faults of the pull-apart basin. Increased flow means less time for radon to decay and thus a positive correlation between the flow rate and the radon concentration is expected. Flow velocity is controlled by (i) the pressure at depth, and (ii) the fracture width. Both are affected by the loading forces of the graben filling to which the water column of the lake contributes. Due to the lack of data about the mass flow rates from the spring, a direct link between the flow rate and the radon concentrations cannot be proven. In fact, the hot water discharge seemed to be very stable in time. So, either minor changes of the flow rate affect the radon concentration or another mechanism is needed to explain the observations, e.g., the pressure-dependent gas solubility or the pressure-dependent mixing of different groundwater components. Nevertheless, this does not explain the appearance of long-periodic, intra-seasonal radon signals (with periods in the order of I month) which were practically absent before 2003. Such long-periodic radon signals were not reported till today.

Upland Yedoma taliks are an unpredicted source of atmospheric methane	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Landscape drying associated with permafrost thaw is expected to enhance microbial methane oxidation in arctic soils. Here we show that ice-rich, Yedoma permafrost deposits, comprising a disproportionately large fraction of pan-arctic soil carbon, present an alternate trajectory. Field and laboratory observations indicate that talik (perennially thawed soils in permafrost) development in unsaturated Yedoma uplands leads to unexpectedly large methane emissions (35-78 mg m(-2) d(-1) summer, 150-180 mg m(-2) d(-1) winter). Upland Yedoma talik emissions were nearly three times higher annually than northern-wetland emissions on an areal basis. Approximately 70% emissions occurred in winter, when surface-soil freezing abated methanotrophy, enhancing methane escape from the talik. Remote sensing and numerical modeling indicate the potential for widespread upland talik formation across the pan-arctic Yedoma domain during the 21(st) and 22(nd) centuries. Contrary to current climate model predictions, these findings imply a positive and much larger permafrost-methane-climate feedback for upland Yedoma.

In both basins, the phytoplankton was dominated by small cells (pico- and nanoplankton). The contribution of picoplankton to both biomass and production remained relatively constant throughout the season in both basins. Seasonal variations in the size structure of phytoplankton communities do not agree with the paradigm of dominance by small cells during summer stratification and dominance of larger cells during spring and fall mixing events. Nutrient control of productivity through mixing and stratification is unlikely to affect the structure of phytoplankton communities when nutrients (allochthonous) derived from the catchment basin or sediments are in short supply. In such environments, nutrients (autochthonous) are largely derived in the lake through heterotrophic food web processes such as grazing, excretion and decomposition. Maximum rates of production and losses in July and August in both basins are consistent with increased regeneration and may represent a response of larger-sized cells to higher nutrient availability resulting from enhanced grazing on picoplankton. The high correlation between the rates of loss and of potential growth for the phytoplankton community during all sampling periods, and the relative constancy of the picoplankton biomass, leads us to propose a long-term, steady-state equilibrium in the phytoplankton community under the control of grazing by herbivores and/or other loss processes.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				SEP	1994	16	9					1095	1115		10.1093/plankt/16.9.1095	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/16.9.1095													WOS:A1994PH48500002

On the basis of irradiance measurements above and below ice, spectral reflectance and transmittance were determined for the ice sheet; time evolution of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) transmittance was examined from irradiance recordings at several levels inside the ice sheet. Snow cover was the dominant factor for transmission of PAR into the lake water body. Reflectance was 0.74-0.92 in winter, going down to 0.18-0.22 in the melting season. The bulk attenuation coefficient of dry snow was 14-25 m(-1); the level decreased as the spring was coming. The reflectance and bulk attenuation coefficient of snow-free ice were 0.1-0.4 and 1-5 m(-1). Both were considerably smaller than those of snow cover. Seasonal evolution of light transmission was mainly due to snow melting. Snow and ice cover not only depress the PAR level in a lake but also influence the spectral and directional distribution of light.

Net nitrogen mineralization in both soils exhibited distinct seasonal patterns with maxima in summer and minimum rates in the winter. Nitrification accounted for only 5% of the total N mineralized in both soils.

The sequences at Pringle Falls contain a distinctive coarse pumice-lapilli tephra layer which we have dated as 218+/-10 ka by 40Ar/39Ar step-heating of plagioclase feldspar. Stratigraphically, this tephra is closely associated with a suite of several other tephra layers that bracket the interval studied paleomagnetically. Each tephra layer is distinguished by the unique chemical composition of its volcanic glass shards. The pumice layer dated at Pringle Falls is correlated with layers at three of the other localities. Using all the tephra layers, we can correlate the lake stratigraphic sequences and associated paleomagnetic records among the four distant localities. Additional age control is obtained from a fifth locality at Tulelake in northern California, where the stratigraphic interval of interest is bracketed between similar to 171+/-43 and approximately 140 ka. Characteristics of the paleomagnetic records indicate virtually identical paleofield variation, particularly the geometry of a normal to normal (N-N) geomagnetic polarity episode. The observed paleofield behavior resembles the Blake geomagnetic polarity episode, but is significantly older than the generally accepted age of the Blake episode. Either the age of the Blake episode is significantly underestimated, or the polarity episode documented here is older, perhaps the Jamaica episode, or is an as yet unreported episode. A corollary of the latter option is that paleomagnetic polarity episodes of different ages may have similar transition polar paths, a conclusion implying that a common mechanism is involved.

One hundred thirty-two (132) species of phytoplankton were identified. A prominent spring peak of cyanobacteria, green algae, and diatoms was followed by predominantly non-heterocystous cyanobacteria, Oscillatoria prolifica, Microcystis aeruginosa, and Gomphosphaeria lacustris. The dominance of cyanobacteria can be attributed to their ability to maintain buoyancy and to conditions favoring their growth - e.g. a turbid photic zone with high levels of phosphorus and ammonia probably derived from sanitary sewage inflows.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				JUN	1986	3	3					419	432		10.1080/02705060.1986.9665133	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1986.9665133													WOS:A1986C646700014

Attributes such as sweeping practices, anti-icing, shoulder improvement, pavement condition, trackout, and abrasive material from road segments were analyzed with a feature subset selection algorithm. Street sweeping was found to be an effective means of controlling dust emissions from roads. Road dust from dirty tertiary roads served as a continuous source of suspendable material for adjacent high-speed roads in the winter time. To be most effective, emission control strategies require that not only primary roads, but all roads be swept after snow storms to recover applied abrasive material. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

These lakes are shallow (< 3 m) ground-water sinks with no surface drainage. Rainfall and hence ground-water inflow to the lakes was highly seasonal and occurred mainly between May and October. Lakes Hayward, North Newnham and South Newnham were consistently hypersaline (e.g. Hayward 61-214 g L-1) and Hayward and North Newnham were stratified from autumn to early summer. The bottom layer of water in Hayward was usually supersaturated (to 430%) with respect to DO, because of the photosynthetic activity of the benthic microbial communities (BMC). South Newnham did not stratify in 1985, but did so briefly in 1987 after a BMC developed. The salinity of Lake Pollard varied from 19 to 51 g L-1 and the lake did not stratify at all. During spring, extensive growth of the charophyte Lamprothamnium papulosum across the sediments in Lake Pollard increased DO (from c. 100% to c. 140% saturation) and pH (from c. 8.5 to c. 10), but lowered specific TA (from 0.26 to 0.075 meq L-1 per unit salinity); later removal of the L. papulosum by swans reduced DO to 50% saturation and pH to 7.5, and increased specific TA to 0.15 meq L-1 per unit salinity. It is apparent that the processes controlling Hayward, North Newnham and South Newnham are similar and are based on the activities of the BMC. South Newnham is at an earlier stage of evolution. However, Pollard is controlled primarily by L. papulosum growth and its subsequent removal by swans; this indicates a different evolutionary path for this lake.																			0067-1940						1989	40	1					55	68																WOS:A1989U246300006

J	Antunes, SC; Abrantes, N; Gonçalves, F				Antunes, SC; Abrantes, N; Gonçalves, F			Seasonal variation of the abiotic parameters and the cladoceran assemblage of Lake Vela:: comparison with previous studies	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Lake Vela is a shallow lake facing eutrophication, like many other freshwater reservoirs. A reduction in biodiversity has been observed and cyanobacterial blooms are frequent, occasionally leading to large fish kills. An annual sampling cycle was carried out in the present study, with the aim of understanding the present seasonal variation of Lake Vela's physico-chemistry and cladoceran assemblage. The present results were compared with those obtained in previous studies. Presently, Lake Vela is facing higher nutrient and Chl a levels than in past years. The cladoceran assemblage is now dominated by small-bodied forms, such as Chydoridae and Bosmina longirostris, except in the spring peak of Daphnia longispina. Still, the seasonal pattern of the cladoceran community is more or less coherent with the general model observed in other temperate lakes. The results also suggest that this was a rather unusual year, with a Daphnia summer peak, probably because of a large fish kill that occurred in late spring.

In autumn, perch left the littoral and moved to deeper waters for overwintering. They Lived at temperatures below 6 degrees C for about six months. In January, perch were present between the 42 and 69 m depth contours. Their distribution then shifted to increasingly shallower depths by 0.25 m per day, and they returned to the littoral in early May where adults spawned in late May. During winter, perch performed diel vertical migrations, resting on the bottom during day and swimming up to 25 m off the bottom during night. Light was the proximate cause of this regular vertical migration. Perch did not gain an energetic advantage by migrating in a homothermal water column, but they may have gained access to copepods in addition to their main diet of benthic invertebrates. It is hypothesized that predator avoidance is the ultimate cause of diel migration in overwintering perch which avoid piscivorous birds by resting on the bottom during day and avoid burbot by swimming off the bottom during night.																			0003-455X						1996	33	3-4					679	686																WOS:A1996WB44500046

The distribution of 14C-labelled photosynthate by phytoplankton in Sombre Lake, Antarctica, was measured during the spring/summer period in 1987-88. 2. Protein was the principal product of low-light photosynthesis, with the proportion of polysaccharide and lipid increasing at higher radiation fluxes. Storage polysaccharides were mobilized during darkness to fuel continued protein synthesis. 3. Maximum rates of protein synthesis and total photosynthesis were attained immediately prior to loss of ice cover, when algal biomass (as chlorophyll-a) was decreasing. Minimum rate of protein synthesis was coincident with maximum biomass. 4. An increase in loss rates as the growing season progresses is postulated to explain the lack of coupling between biomass changes and photosynthesis.

Physicochemical Properties of Manzala Lake, Egypt	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY												PHYSICOCHEMICAL parameters such as temperature, total dissolved solid (TDS), pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen demand (BOD), permanganate index (PI), chloride and nutrient salts were measured in water samples, collected from 12 sites of Manzala Lake during winter and summer, 2015. A lot of fluctuations were observed in these parameters affected by the poor connection of water body of the lake and the diversity of the incoming flows. The pH values of water were alkaline throughout the lake and closely correlated with widely varied salinity and DO values. BOD increases in the south eastern-located sites affected mostly by Bahr El Baqur drain effluents especially during winter during the scheduled water block. PI was highly influenced by the agricultural and domestic waste effluents. Nutrients salts ranged between 5.47-249, 2.61-15.1, 0.64-24.5, and 3.47-22.9 mu mol L-1 for ammonia, nitrite, nitrate and phosphate, respectively. N/P ratios (2.28-12.8) in the present study indicated that nitrogen is the limiting factor for phytoplankton fluorination except for some sites in the south eastern region. The levels of total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were found affected by the seawater inflows during winter. It can be concluded from obtained data that the south eastern region showed worst water quality parameters.

J	Lathrop, RC; Carpenter, SR; Robertson, DM				Lathrop, RC; Carpenter, SR; Robertson, DM			Summer water clarity responses to phosphorus, Daphnia grazing, and internal mixing in Lake Mendota	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Linear models were developed for predicting mean Secchi disk depth readings as a measure of water clarity for the summer months in Lake Mendota, Wisconsin. The 20-yr (1976-1995) data set also included external phosphorus (P) loadings and in-lake April P concentrations as indices of lake nutrient status, and monthly (28 d) water column stabilities and Daphnia biomasses as indices of lake mixing and algal grazing potentials, respectively. June Secchi depths were mostly controlled by food web dynamics, which dictated whether the larger-bodied Daphnia pulicaria or the smaller-bodied D. galeata mendotae dominated during the spring clear-water phase. May Daphnia biomasses were significantly greater in D. pulicaria-dominated years than in D. galeata-dominated years; D. pulicaria-year biomasses were also greater during the summer months. The model for the midsummer (July-August) months indicated that Secchi depths were inversely related to April P concentrations and positively related to midsummer Daphnia biomasses and lake stabilities. Scenarios for midsummer Secchi depths were tested using the observed minimum and maximum values for each predictor variate. While holding two variates constant, April P, Daphnia biomass, and lake stability each resulted in relatively similar Secchi ranges (0.81, 0.81, and 1.17 m, respectively). Our results suggest that summer water clarity in eutrophic Lake Mendota is controlled by interacting ecosystem processes linked to land use activities, lake food web dynamics, and climate.

The most promising isolate (strain E18, Phormidium sp. from a high Arctic lake) grew well at low temperatures and formed aggregates (flocs) that could be readily harvested by sedimentation. We evaluated the growth and nutrient uptake abilities of E18 relative to a community of green algae (a Chlorococcalean assemblage, denoted Vc) sampled from a tertiary treatment system in Valcartier, Canada. E18 had superior growth rates below 15 degrees C (mu = 0.20 d(-1) at 10 degrees C under continuous irradiance of 225 mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1)) and higher phosphate uptake rates below 10 degrees C (k = 0.050 d(-1) at 5 OC) relative to Ve (mu=0.087 d(-1) at 10 degrees C and k=0.020 d(-1) at 5 degrees C, respectively). The green algal assemblage generally performed better than E18 at high temperatures (at 25 degrees C, mu=0.39 d(-1) and k=0.34 d(-1) for Vc; mu=0.28 d(-1) and k=0.33 d(-1) for E18). However, E18 removed nitrate more efficiently than Vc at most temperatures including 25 degrees C. Polar cyanobacteria such as strain E18 are appropriate species for waste-water treatment in cold climates during spring and autumn. Under warmer summer conditions, fast-growing green algae such as the Vc assemblage are likely to colonize and dominate, but warm-water Phormidium isolates could be used at that time.

J	Swatland, HJ				Swatland, Howard J.			Groundwater temperature and degassing in the Mad River subwatershed of Lake Huron	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Groundwater was measured 70 times in two years at 10 sites as it flowed 50 m over an accumulation of travertine (CaCO3) before reaching the Mad River. At source, the groundwater was relatively cool (6.77 +/- 2.89 degrees C), slightly acidic ( pH 6.86 +/- 0.22), and had a moderately high specific conductivity (606 +/- 51 mu S). Degassing was assessed from increases in pH, and CaCO3 deposition was assessed from decreasing conductivity. After flowing over the experimental site, degassing had increased pH to 8.04 +/- 0.16 (P<0.001), which was similar to river water (pH 8.07 +/- 0.30). Concurrently, CaCO3 deposition decreased conductivity to 577 +/- 43 mu S (P<0.001) but this was still higher (P<0.001) than river water (494 +/- 72). Seasonal changes in air temperature affected the rate of degassing. The pH was correlated with air temperature (r= 0.15, P<0.001) while conductivity was correlated with pH (r = -0.27, P<0.001), but no direct relationship of air temperature with conductivity was detected. Groundwater entering the river after atmospheric exposure had a fairly constant temperature (7.05 +/- 1.22 degrees C) despite seasonal changes in air temperature, thus warming the river in winter (up to day 100 and after day 300) and cooling it in summer (from days 140 to 260). Degassing and CaCO3 deposition in springs without travertine was similar to that observed in the study stream over travertine. These groundwater inflows provide favorable pH and temperature conditions for brook trout. (C) 2011 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Jepsen, N; Berg, S				Jepsen, N; Berg, S			The use of winter refuges by roach tagged with miniature radio transmitters	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Adult roach (Rutilus rutilus) (13-25 cm) from two shallow lakes, one turbid and one with high water transparency, were tagged with surgically implanted miniature radio transmitters and their habitat use was monitored. Repeated tracking series over the course of the year provided information on seasonal changes in behaviour of roach in the two lakes. The results showed that the roach generally used the lakes only as summer habitat, whereas they moved into specific sheltered, restricted areas during winter. This behaviour was most pronounced in the lake with clear water, where roach gathered in large numbers in the stream in- and outlets as well as in other sheltered habitats where they remained rather passively during the 48 h tracking periods. In the turbid lake, many of the tagged roach, were even found in underground channels during the tracking in November. We see this behaviour as a response to low food abundance, decreased food demand and high predation risk, especially from birds. The tracking data from the clear lake showed that some tagged roach undertook swift habitat shifts from one refuge to the other. The traditional perception of the roach as a 'lake fish' with an important structuring role in the lake ecosystem is undoubtedly true, but the present results suggest that roach are able to migrate between different habitat types and will do so if they can profit from this behaviour.					; Berg, Søren/AAJ-8104-2021; Jepsen, Niels/D-4225-2009	Berg, Soren/0000-0001-8772-0921; Jepsen, Niels/0000-0003-0927-6823; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2002	483	1-3					167	173		10.1023/A:1021379528719	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1021379528719													WOS:000179639600019

This study quantifies the DOD along with its monthly and year-to-year variability between 2003 and 2017 at global and regional levels based on the MIDAS (ModIs Dust AeroSol) dataset, which combines Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-Aqua retrievals and Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), reanalysis products. We also describe the annual and seasonal geographical distributions of DOD across the main dust source regions and transport pathways. MIDAS provides columnar mid-visible (550 nm) DOD at fine spatial resolution (0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees), expanding the current observational capabilities for monitoring the highly variable spatiotemporal features of the dust burden. We obtain a global DOD of 0.032 +/- 0.003 - approximately a quarter (23 .4% +/- 2.4%) of the global aerosol optical depth (AOD) - with about 1 order of magnitude more DOD in the Northern Hemisphere (0.056 +/- 0.004; 31.8% +/- 2 .7%) than in the Southern Hemisphere (0.008 +/- 0 .001; 8.2% +/- 1.1%) and about 3.5 times more DOD over land (0.070 +/- 0.005) than over ocean (0.019 +/- 0.002). The Northern Hemisphere monthly DOD is highly correlated with the corresponding monthly AOD (R-2 = 0.94) and contributes 20% to 48% of it, both indicating a dominant dust contribution. In contrast, the contribution of dust to the monthly AOD does not exceed 17% in the Southern Hemisphere, although the uncertainty in this region is larger. Among the major dust sources of the planet, the maximum DODs (similar to 1.2) are recorded in the Bodele Depression of the northern Lake Chad Basin, whereas moderate-to-high intensities are encountered in the Western Sahara (boreal summer), along the eastern parts of the Middle East (boreal summer) and in the Taklamakan Desert (spring). Over oceans, major long-range dust transport is observed primarily along the tropical Atlantic (intensified during boreal summer) and secondarily in the North Pacific (intensified during boreal spring). Our calculated global and regional averages and associated uncertainties are consistent with some but not all recent observation-based studies. Our work provides a simple yet flexible method to estimate consistent uncertainties across spatiotemporal scales, which will enhance the use of the MIDAS dataset in a variety of future studies.

Winter in water: differential responses and the maintenance of biodiversity	ECOLOGY LETTERS												The ecological consequences of winter in freshwater systems are an understudied but rapidly emerging research area. Here, we argue that winter periods of reduced temperature and light (and potentially oxygen and resources) could play an underappreciated role in mediating the coexistence of species. This may be especially true for temperate and subarctic lakes, where seasonal changes in the thermal environment might fundamentally structure species interactions. With climate change already shortening ice-covered periods on temperate and polar lakes, consideration of how winter conditions shape biotic interactions is urgently needed. Using freshwater fishes in northern temperate lakes as a case study, we demonstrate how physiological trait differences (e.g. thermal preference, light sensitivity) drive differential behavioural responses to winter among competing species. Specifically, some species have a higher capacity for winter activity than others. Existing and new theory is presented to argue that such differential responses to winter can promote species coexistence. Importantly, if winter is a driver of niche differences that weaken competition between, relative to within species, then shrinking winter periods could threaten coexistence by tipping the scales in favour of certain sets of species over others.					; Shuter, Brian/A-3991-2008; Bartley, Timothy/Q-7837-2016; Fernandes, Timothy/AAC-3661-2020	McMeans, Bailey/0000-0002-9793-6811; Fernandes, Timothy/0000-0001-6277-5619; Bieg, Carling/0000-0003-1552-2007; Blanchfield, Paul/0000-0003-0886-5642; McCann, Kevin/0000-0001-6031-7913; Rennie, Michael/0000-0001-7533-4759; Bartley, Timothy/0000-0002-5898-0588; Giacomini, Henrique/0000-0002-6932-464X													1461-023X	1461-0248				JUN	2020	23	6					922	938		10.1111/ele.13504	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.13504		APR 2020						32266766					WOS:000525286300001

A. Forbes 1882) in Pyramid Lake, Alberta, Canada, has only 1 main generation per year. A small summer generation probably does not survive. Adults may persist for 7-12 mo., and individual copepods may live for up to 17 mo. Retardation of the development of copepodid C 4 and C 5 seems to be food linked. The high percentage of survivors (up to 97%) from the 1st egg pulse of the main generation, and the low percentage of survivors (as low as 3%) from the 2nd egg pulse, is likely due to the absence of cyclopoid adults and copepodids in spring, and to both cyclopoid predation and a poor food regime in summer. Production estimates by several methods gave closely comparable results. Mean daily production by L. sicilis is 0.29 mg dry wt/m3, and the annual P/B [production/biomass] ratio is 2.63.																			0105-9327						1980	3	1					50	63																WOS:A1980JL79100007

Spring ice breakup, due to the freshet, are the most common and damaging. A coupled two-dimensional hydro and ice dynamics model was used to study the breakup and jamming processes on the 64 km reach of the Saint John River between Grand Falls and the Beechwood Generation Station. The model simulated the evolution of the 2012 ice breakup and jamming event, which caused record high flooding. The simulated results compared well with observed data and provided detailed information on the breakup processes. The study showed that both failure due to accumulation of ice at the cover leading edge and failure due to high rates of water level change from surges were important ice breakup processes. It was also found that one of the most significant factors in the flooding at Perth-Andover was the release of ice from above Grand Falls.

Dark roads aid movement but increase mortality of a generalist herbivore in the American Southwest	ECOSPHERE												Road networks pose many well-documented threats to wildlife, from fragmenting habitats and restricting movement to causing mortality through vehicle collisions. For large, wide-ranging mammals, home range requirements and seasonal migrations often necessitate road crossings, posing threats to human safety, property, and animal survival. Artificial nightlight, emanating from light posts and urban sky glow, is ubiquitous on and around road networks worldwide; however, its effects on road crossing behavior and the associated mortality risk for wildlife are not well understood. By integrating the latest NASA nightlight products with GPS collar data collected from 67 mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) over a 7-year period (2012-2018), we used a resource-selection framework to assess factors influencing seasonal crossing behavior and road mortality in Salt Lake City, Utah, an expanding metropolitan area in the United States. We found deer preferred to cross the road where surrounding artificial nightlight was lower in both summer and winter seasons, especially during crepuscular and nighttime periods. However, lower nightlight levels also increased the risk of road mortality. Areas with more shrub cover and lower speed limits increased the likelihood of crossing as well as lowered the risk of road mortality. There were five times as many mortality events in winter as in summer, likely because of the combination of deer preference for dark roads mixed with proximity to both higher speed roads and increased human activity. Better understanding how a pervasive and expanding environmental pollutant like artificial nightlight may attract or repel human-tolerant wildlife species from roadways presents an opportunity to mitigate collision risk while improving population management strategies for this abundant, generalist herbivore and many other economically and ecologically important species.

The residence time of soluble phosphate in lake water was measured by 32P-labeling experiments. Relatively long residence times of soluble phosphate were measured in winter and spring during the Peridinium bloom. Two metabolic inhibitors, DCMU [(3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethyl, urea)] and CCCP [m-chlorocarbonylcyanide phenylhydrazone], had similar effect on residence time during the Peridinium bloom and a significantly different effect after the bloom. During the spring bloom, most of the P cycles between the lake water and the alga P. cinctum f. westii, a dinoflagellate which causes heavy blooms and constitutes a nuisance to water users. The importance of the intracellular P pools for algal growth was discussed.

J	ELGMORK, K				ELGMORK, K			EXTRAORDINARY PROLONGATION OF THE LIFE-CYCLE IN A FRESH-WATER PLANKTONIC COPEPOD	HOLARCTIC ECOLOGY												The limnetic copepod C. scutifer Sars shows an extraordinarily prolonged life cycle in a temperate lake near Oslo, Norway. Developmental sequences become 1, 2 and 3 yr old, and circumstantial evidence exists of a 4 yr old fraction. Prolongation of the cycle is mainly caused by 2 consecutive periods of diapause, the 1st as small copepodids during the 2nd winter, and the other as large copepodids during the 3rd winter. There is a marked concentration of diapausing individuals in a small area of the bottom at the deepest part of the lake. This concentrations may be caused by a horizontal migration to areas with optimal O2 conditions. The adaptive value of a prolongation of the life cycle is assumed to be an increase in the reproductive potential caused by a spreading out of the reproductive period by 3 yr classes succeeding each other throughout the summer.																			0105-9327						1981	4	4					278	290																WOS:A1981NA18500007

A general response is described. The fish stock reduction led in general to a low fish stock, low chlorophyll-a, high Secchidisc transparency and high abundance of macrophytes. Large Daphnia became abundant, but their density decreased, due to food limitation and predation by fish. The total nitrogen concentration became low due to N-uptake by macrophytes and enhanced denitrification. In Lake Bleiswijkse Zoom the water transparency deteriorated and the clear water state was not stable. The fish stock increased and the production of young fish in summer was high. Clear water occurred only in spring. Large daphnids were absent in summer and the macrophytes decreased. In Lake Zwemlust, Lake Vaeng and Lake Noorddiep the water remained clear during the first five years. In summer of the sixth year (1992) transparency decreased in Lake Zwemlust (with high P-concentration of 1.0 mg P l-1). Also in Lake Vaeng (with a low nutrient concentration of 0.15 mg P l-1) a short term turbid stage (1.5 month) occurred in summer 1992 after a sudden collapse of the macrophytes. Deterioration of the water quality seems to start in summer and seems related to a collapse in macrophytes. At a low planktivorous fishstock (e.g. Lake Vaeng) the duration of the turbid state is shorter than in presence of a high planktivorous fish biomass (e.g. Lake Zwemlust, and later years of Lake Bleiswijkse Zoom).

Since in 1996 the duration of ice formation on the tidal flats in winter was much longer than in 1995 or 1997 (until late February), it is proposed that ice cover reduced resuspension of bed material by enhancing consolidation of the sediment and thus increasing the critical shear stress for erosion (tau (crit)), and also by preventing the occurrence of high waves. Both phenomena led to low suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations. After the ice cover vanished, the clear water phase was followed by a microalgal bloom both in the water column and on the sediment. During the algal bloom, SPM concentrations remained low. Floc size measurements indicated that low SPM concentrations during the benthic and pelagic algal blooms were not caused by increased flocculation. On the sediment bed however benthic microalgae produced large amounts of extracellular carbohydrates, which led to an increase in bed strength (tau (crit)) and a reduction of resuspension, and thus kept SPM concentrations low during the algal bloom.

G.			Disturbance of meromixis in saline Lake Shira (Siberia, Russia): Possible reasons and ecosystem response	LIMNOLOGICA												Saline Lake Shira (Southern Siberia, Russia) was meromictic through the observation period 2002-2015. During the under-ice periods of 2015 and 2016, complete mixing of the water column was recorded for the first time, and hydrogen sulphide temporarily disappeared from the water column of the lake; i.e. in those years the lake turned to holomixis. In the summer of 2015, a sharp increase in chlorophyll a, organic carbon, zooplankton, and phytoflagellates was observed in the lake, which was probably due to the release of nutrients from the monimolimnion. Purple sulfur bacteria completely disappeared from the lake after the first mixing in 2015, and did not reappear despite the restoration of meromixis in 2017. Thus, it was demonstrated that purple sulfur bacteria are sensitive to the weakening of the stratification of Lake Shira. Based on the data of the seasonal monitoring of temperature and salinity profiles over the period 2002-2017, it was presumed that the main cause of deep mixing in 2015 was the weakening of the salinity gradient due to strong wind impact and early ice retreat in the spring of 2014. In addition, it was shown that in previous years a significant contribution to the maintenance of meromixis was made by an additional influx of fresh water, which caused a rise in the lake level in the period 2002-2007. Thus, we identified a relationship between the stratification regime of the lake and the change in its level, which provides valuable information both for the forecast of Water quality and for reconstruction of the Holocene climate humidity in this region of Southern Siberia from the sediment cores of Lake Shira.					; Barkhatov, Yuri/T-6681-2017; Andrei, Degermendzhi/P-8042-2015; Zadereev, Egor/J-2200-2012; Rogozin, Denis/AAE-8113-2019; Drobotov, Anton/I-8428-2018; Kolmakova, Anzhelika/ABL-9266-2022; Tolomeev, Aleksandr/I-9601-2018	Zadereev, Egor/0000-0003-2366-8604; Tolomeev, Aleksandr/0000-0002-9124-4566; Belolipetskii, Victor/0000-0002-4909-7857; Barkhatov, Yuri/0000-0003-4547-0439; Drobotov, Anton/0009-0007-1722-4958; Andrei, Degermendzhi/0000-0001-8649-5419; 													0075-9511	1873-5851				SEP	2017	66						12	23		10.1016/j.limno.2017.06.004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2017.06.004													WOS:000413882800002

Effects of Changing Snow and Ice Cover Conditions on Phytoplankton Chlorophyll-a and Community Composition in a Mesotrophic Lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Ice and snow cover on lakes plays a fundamental role for under-ice ecology by reducing water column mixing and light availability. Previous studies have shown that such reductions can significantly influence the growth and reproduction of phytoplankton, primarily focusing on changes in ice-on and ice-off dates in a warming climate. This study goes beyond studying the effects of ice phenology on phytoplankton by addressing two fundamental questions: (1) how does a snow cover on ice influence below-ice phytoplankton chlorophyll-a and community composition and (2) how do variations in ice phenology influence spring phytoplankton chlorophyll-a and community composition after ice-off? To address these two questions, we assessed long-term monitoring data collected at least monthly on phytoplankton chlorophyll-a and community composition. We combined the phytoplankton data with annual ice phenology and nearby meteorological data on daily snow depth between 1997 and 2019 in a mesotrophic lake (Erken) in Sweden. Snow cover resulted in an exponential decrease of phytoplankton chlorophyll-a, with detectable effects during all 3 months studied (January-March). Deeper snow cover changed the community dominance from autotrophs to mixotrophs in two of the months studied (January and March), which we explain by reduced light availability caused by snow cover. In spring, phytoplankton chlorophyll-a increased with longer ice periods and delayed ice-off dates. A wide range of taxa in the spring community increased with delayed ice-off dates, while delayed ice-on dates mainly promoted diatoms. Convective mixing is important to keep non-motile taxa in the photic zone and could explain the increased phytoplankton growth with longer ice duration. Our results highlight seasonal ice and snow cover as key regulators for the timing of growth and reproduction of primary producers below ice, with effects of the ice cover period lasting after ice-off. Snow on ice causes light constraints, which commonly result in reduced under-ice primary production and a higher proportion of mixotrophs in the phytoplankton community. Losing high nutritional phytoplankton groups such as mixotrophs following changes in ice phenology and snow cover can have consequences for the trophic transfer and the biogeochemical cycling in lakes.

J	Schulz, M; Faber, E; Hollerbach, A; Schröder, HG; Güde, H				Schulz, M; Faber, E; Hollerbach, A; Schröder, HG; Güde, H			The methane cycle in the epilimnion of Lake Constance	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												During summer, methane concentrations measured in the surface water layers of Lake Constance were oversaturated by as much as forty times. Although methane concentrations were less than saturated in the upper water column during the winter of 1994/95, the concentrations increased to more than 2000 nl/l (90 nM) in July. The observed spatiotemporal distribution patterns strongly suggest biogenic production of methane in oxic epilimnetic water layers whereas advective transport from the littoral to the pelagic region or from allochthonous river inputs had apparently less impact on pelagic methane concentrations. Statistically significant correlations of methane concentrations with biomass parameters (e.g. phaeophytin, particulate phosphorus) hint at lake-snow as a potential site of epilimnetic in situ production of methane. In contrast, field data did not provide compelling evidence of methanogenesis in the intestinal tract of zooplankton. In diel cycles, high nocturnal methane concentrations alternate with low concentrations of C-13-enriched methane during the daytime. This happens due to the phenomenon of oscillating oxygen concentrations in littoral water and sediment, which is affected by the antagonism of photosynthetic and respiratory activity. Due to the observed oversaturation, epilimnetic methane levels in summer and methane concentrations below saturation in winter, Lake Constance provided a sink for methane from January to April, but for the rest of the year a considerable methane flux to the atmosphere was calculated.																			0003-9136					APR	2001	151	1					157	176																WOS:000168327200010

Riverine dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentration and composition are sensitive to both regional and global change processes. The comparative studies on riverine DOM among different rivers, especially when it comes to seasonal changes, were critical to better constrain the river carbon cycle. In this study, we analyzed organic carbon concentration, DOM sources and composition from the estuary locations of 48 Chinese rivers using the stable isotopic analysis and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. Both dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) concentrations, displayed significantly higher mean values in autumn than in summer (p 0.05). Most of the DOM in these rivers entering marginal seas in four seasons came from the terrigenous sources (60.6%-68.4%), followed by the autochthonous matters (18.6%-25.6%), and the contribution of the anthropogenic sewage ranged from 7.6% to 13.7%. The proportion contributions of terrigenous and anthropogenic sources to DOM were similar in all seasons, but the contribution of autochthonous inputs showed the highest value in autumn than other seasons (p 0.05). Although the highly unsaturated compounds are the most abundant molecular formulas detected in all riverine DOM, the molecular composition of riverine DOM shows a large difference among seven river basins. The human activity disturbance may be one of the major reasons for DOM composition differences. The contribution of sewage discharge on Chinese riverine DOM flux could be roughly estimated as 16.11-17.74 Gg C /yr. This work seeks to provide a foundation for ongoing research of regional and global riverine carbon cycling, and put forward the method for evaluating the potential impact of human disturbances on riverine organic carbon components in Chinese rivers.

Understanding and predicting the consequences of these changes is impeded by a shortage of winter-period studies on most aspects of Great Lake limnology. In this review, we summarize what is known about the Great Lakes during their 3-6 months of winter and identify key open questions about the physics, chemistry, and biology of the Laurentian Great Lakes and other large, seasonally frozen lakes. Existing studies show that winter conditions have important effects on physical, biogeochemical, and biological processes, not only during winter but in subsequent seasons as well. Ice cover, the extent of which fluctuates dramatically among years and the five lakes, emerges as a key variable that controls many aspects of the functioning of the Great Lakes ecosystem. Studies on the properties and formation of Great Lakes ice, its effect on vertical and horizontal mixing, light conditions, and biota, along with winter measurements of fundamental state and rate parameters in the lakes and their watersheds are needed to close the winter knowledge gap. Overcoming the formidable logistical challenges of winter research on these large and dynamic ecosystems may require investment in new, specialized research infrastructure. Perhaps more importantly, it will demand broader recognition of the value of such work and collaboration between physicists, geochemists, and biologists working on the world's seasonally freezing lakes and seas.

We monitored internal temperatures of egg masses at three heights aboveground level and at the four cardinal aspects on oak tree stems at two different locations in Michigan during the winter seasons of 1997/1998, 1998/1999 and 1999/2000. Effects of aspect were more strongly associated with observed egg mass temperatures than height above the ground surface. Instantaneous differences between egg mass temperatures on sunny days were as high as 30 degreesC greater on the southern aspect vs. eg mass temperatures on other aspects, resulting in substantial differences in pre-hatch growing degree accumulations for egg masses on a single tree. Egg masses on southern and western aspects, where solar loading and temperatures were greatest, experienced substantial mortality. Mean survival of eggs averaged across the three seasons was less than 25% on southern and western aspects, compared with averages of 53 and 73% on eastern and northern aspects, respectively. Linear regression of mean monthly egg mass-air temperature differences (between north and south aspects) and mean daily solar flux density resulted in slope coefficient estimates of 0.13 and 0.21 degreesC MJ m(-2), and correlation coefficients of 0.81 and 0.82 at the two field locations, respectively. Using a simple egg mass hatch phenological model, such dissimilarities in temperature and growing degree day accumulation resulted in differences in estimated egg hatch dates of up to 25 days. Snow cover moderated egg mass temperature, with extreme seasonal ininimum winter temperatures under snow cover as much as 7.1 degreesC warmer than those without snow cover.

Trapping success varied enormously between seasons, being always higher in November (9.8 and 6.8 harvest mice per 100 trap nights in the two November sessions) than in spring (1.3 and zero harvest mice per 100 trap nights in the two March sessions, respectively). Two age classes were distinguished in the autumn samples on basis of fur colour and body mass (ranges of 5.6-7.9 grams in juveniles and 7.9-12.0 grams for adults). Males outnumbered females, but the difference was not significant (chi(2) = 3.28, p = 0.07). Spatial distribution deviated significantly from random (chi(2) = 342.0, p < 0.000001) and the species was positively associated with reed stands (89.2% of all autumn captures). Densities varied between zero (March 2000) and 93 individuals ha(-1) (November 1999); estimates, adjusted for home range holders, gave values up to 52 ha(-1) (November 1998). An additional eight small mammal species (three shrews and five rodents) were trapped on the same plot, but M. minutus did not show a positive association in spatial distribution with any of them.

Scant information exists on the extent of the decline, as this bay was not investigated for water quality concerns before the die-offs and limited areas were sampled after the primary die-off. We use imagery from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) to examine water clarity in Florida Bay for the period 1985 to 1997. The AVHRR provides data on nominal water reflectance and estimated light attenuation, which are used here to describe turbidity conditions in the bay on a seasonal basis. in situ observations on changes in seagrass abundance within the bay, combined with the satellite data, provide additional insights into losses of seagrass. The imagery shows an extensive region to the west of Florida Bay having increased reflectance and light attenuation in both winter and summer begining in winter of 1988. These increases are consistent with a change from dense seagrass to sparse or negligible cover. Approximately 200 km(2) of these offshore seagrasses may have been lost during the primary die-off (1988 through 1991), significantly more than in the bay, The imagery shows the distribution and timing of increased turbidity that followed the die-offs in the northwestern regions of the bay, exemplified in Rankin Lake and Johnson Key Basin, and indicates that about 200 km2 of dense seagrass may have been lost or severely degraded within the bay from the start of the die-off. The decline in water clarity has continued in the northwestern bay since 1991, The area west of the Everglades National Park boundaries has shown decreases in both winter turbidity and summer reflectances, suggestive of partial seagrass recovery. Areas of low reflectance associated with a major Syringodium filiforme seagrass meadow north of Marathon (Vaca Key in the Florida Keys) appear to have expanded westward toward Big Pine Key indicating changes in the bottom cover from before the die-off. The southern and eastern sections of the Bay have not shown significant changes in water clarity or bottom albedo throughout the entire time period.

Monthly tests of vitamin B12 and thiamin were undertaken in Nantua, Leman and Annecy Lakes [France] in order to ascertain the ecological significance of these compounds. Test organisms were Euglena gracilis for vitamin B12 tests and Lactobacillus fermenti for thiamin tests. In Nantua and Leman lakes, a decrease in contents of vitamin B12 and macronutrients in the superficial waters was observed together with the springtime algal growth. Vertical distribution of vitamin B12 in Nantua lake during spring is the same as dissolved inorganic P distribution and inverse to Oscillatoria rubescens distribution. In summer, great growths of O. redekei and Aphanizomenon flos-aquae increase the vitamin content of epilimnion. O. redekei and A. flos-aquae may produce vitamin B12 while O. rubescens may consume it, at least in spring.																			0046-4937						1975	6	2					103	121																WOS:A1975BT99100002

Observed climate variability and change in Urmia Lake Basin, Iran	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												This paper analyzes climate variability and change in the Urmia Lake Basin, northwest of Iran. Annual average of the following data time series has been analyzed by statistical methods: dry bulb temperature, maximum and minimum temperature, precipitation, and number of rainy and snowy days. We have also used mean monthly temperature and precipitation data for analysis of drought spells for the period 1964-2005 to find out whether fluctuations in the lake level are attributable to natural drought. Our results indicate that mean precipitation has decreased by 9.2 % and the average maximum temperature has increased by 0.8A degrees C over these four decades. The seasonal changes are particularly visible in winter and spring. Results of the Palmer Drought Severity Index show that on average, drought episodes have hit the Urmia Lake Basin every 5 years and most of them reached severe levels, but recent droughts have become more intense and last longer.					; Piguet, Etienne/AAE-7426-2019	Rebetez, Martine/0000-0002-3337-2025; Delju, Amir Hooshang/0000-0001-9489-6204													0177-798X					JAN	2013	111	1-2					285	296		10.1007/s00704-012-0651-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-012-0651-9													WOS:000313128200023

This is also true for phytoplankton in seasonally ice-covered temperate lakes which are particularly vulnerable to the presence or absence of ice. We examined changes in pelagic phytoplankton winter community structure in a north temperate lake (Muggelsee, Germany), covering 18 winters between 1995 and 2013. We tested how phytoplankton taxa composition varied along a winter-severity gradient and to what extent winter severity shaped the functional trait composition of overwintering phytoplankton communities using multivariate statistical analyses and a functional trait-based approach. We hypothesized that overwintering phytoplankton communities are dominated by taxa with trait combinations corresponding to the prevailing winter water column conditions, using ice thickness measurements as a winter-severity indicator. Winter severity had little effect on univariate diversity indicators (taxon richness and evenness), but a strong relationship was found between the phytoplankton community structure and winter severity when taxon trait identity was taken into account. Species responses to winter severity were mediated by the key functional traits: motility, nutritional mode, and the ability to form resting stages. Accordingly, one or the other of two functional groups dominated the phytoplankton biomass during mild winters (i.e., thin or no ice cover; phototrophic taxa) or severe winters (i.e., thick ice cover; exclusively motile taxa). Based on predicted milder winters for temperate regions and a reduction in ice-cover durations, phytoplankton communities during winter can be expected to comprise taxa that have a relative advantage when the water column is well mixed (i.e., need not be motile) and light is less limiting (i.e., need not be mixotrophic). A potential implication of this result is that winter severity promotes different communities at the vernal equinox, which may have different nutritional quality for the next trophic level and ecosystem-scale effects.

J	Polacek, MC; Baldwin, CM; Knuttgen, K				Polacek, Matt C.; Baldwin, Casey M.; Knuttgen, Kamia			Status, distribution, diet, and growth of burbot in Lake Roosevelt, Washington	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												The status of burbot populations in Washington State is largely unknown and little biological information has been collected regarding them. This paper is an assimilation of distribution, catch, diet, and growth data for burbot collected via gill nets and electrofishing in Lake Roosevelt, Washington. Burbot distribution was not homogenous throughout Lake Roosevelt. Catch rates were: higher in tributaries compared to offshore zones and were low from 1988-1994 (< 0.01 fish/hr), peaked in 1995 and 1996 (0.18 fish/hr), and leveled off (0.04 fish/hr) between 1999 and 2001. Highest densities were in the Hawk Creek and San Poil River sections. Catch rates may have been higher in tributaries because of burbot seeking thermal refugia or food in the vicinity. Burbot diets were dominated by isopods (71%) in the offshore zones, whereas burbot sampled in the nearshore zones contained fish (28%), insects (46%), and crayfish (12%) in the spring and mostly fish in the summer (62%) and fall (78%). Burbot averaged six years in age, ranging between three and ten years old. Generally, relative weights were below the 75th percentile national average and condition factors were poor; however, relative weight and condition factors were stable from year to year indicating that conditions were not deteriorating in the reservoir. It is possible that the impact of reservoir operations on spawning and rearing habitats and low invertebrate and forage fish productivity, have led to the slow growth and condition of burbot in Lake Roosevelt.																			0029-344X	2161-9859				SUM	2006	80	3					153	164																WOS:000243033500001

All these microorganisms were found in smaller quantities in water, and in larger quantities in the bottom sediments in the Czarna Hancza River. Their number was generally higher than the number of faecal bacteria of Escherichia coli group both in water and bottom sediments in this river at site 1 (in Stary Brod above Suwalki) and at sites 7-10 (in Czerwony Folwark, Mackowa Ruda, Buda Ruska, Wysoki Most, to the east of Wigry Lake). Their number was close to or lower than the number of faecal bacteria of Escherichia coli group at the sites situated above and below the inflow of treated sewage from the Treatment Sewage Plant in Suwalki (2a and 2b sites), in Sobolewo (3 and 4 sites), in the region of the old river-bed of the Czarna Hancza River (5 site) and its mouth to Wigry Lake (6 site). There were fewer at the sites of sand deposits, more at the sites of clay-argillaceous deposits. In the research period they were more numerous in the second half of summer. The number of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophila and Staphylococcus sp. should be taken into account as well as the number of the indicators bacteria of a sanitary state (total coliforms, faecal coliforms and faecal streptococci) while estimating the usefulness of water in the Czarna Hancza River for recreation.																			1230-1485	2083-5906					2000	9	3					183	194																WOS:000087910400008

Data were analysed for viral and bacterial abundance and production, viral decay, frequency of lysogenic cells, the contribution of bacteriophages to prokaryotic mortality and their potential influence on nutrient dynamics. Analyses and experiments were conducted on samples from the epilimnion (2 m) and the hypolimnion (50 m), taken at the reference site of the lake. The abundance of virus-like particles (VLP) varied from 3.4 x 107 to 8.2 x 107 VLP ml-1; with the highest numbers and virus-to-bacterium ratio (VBR = 69) recorded in winter. Viral production varied from 3.2 x 104 VLP ml-1 h-1 (July) to 2 x 106 VLP ml-1 h-1 (February and April), and production was lower in the hypolimnion. Viral decay rate reached 0.12-0.15 day-1, and this parameter varied greatly with sampling date and methodology (i.e. KCN versus filtration). Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, viral lysis was responsible for 0% (January) to 71% (February) of bacterial mortality, while viral lysis varied between 0% (April) and 53% (January) per day when using a modified dilution approach. Calculated from viral production and burst size, the virus-induced bacterial mortality varied between 0% (January) and 68% (August). A weak relationship was found between the two first methods (TEM versus dilution approach). Interestingly, flow cytometry analysis performed on the dilution experiment samples revealed that the viral impact was mostly on high DNA content bacterial cells whereas grazing, varying between 8.3% (June) and 75.4% (April), was reflected in both HDNA and LDNA cells equally. The lysogenic fraction varied between 0% (spring/summer) and 62% (winter) of total bacterial abundance, and increased slightly with increasing amounts of mitomycin C added. High percentages of lysogenic cells were recorded when bacterial abundance and activity were the lowest. The calculated release of carbon and phosphorus from viral lysis reached up to 56.5 mu gC l-1 day-1 (assuming 20 fgC cell-1) and 1.4 mu gP l-1 day-1 (assuming 0.5 fgP cell-1), respectively, which may represent a significant fraction of bacterioplankton nutrient demand. This study provides new evidence of the quantitative and functional importance of the virioplankton in the functioning of microbial food webs in peri-alpine lakes. It also highlights methodologically dependent results.					; Jacquet, Stéphan/AAJ-7846-2021; Sime-Ngando, Télesphore/M-4134-2019	Sime-Ngando, Telesphore/0000-0002-7240-5803; JACQUET, Stephan/0000-0001-6017-3892; 													1462-2912	1462-2920				MAR	2011	13	3					616	630		10.1111/j.1462-2920.2010.02364.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2010.02364.x								21054737					WOS:000287852900006

Development of great cormorant population (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis) in North-East France - synthesis of long term monitoring (1997-2008)	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												Since 1997, the North-east inter-regional delegation of the French National Institute for Water and Aquatic Ecosystems (ONEMA) has been running annual networked monitoring of the great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis) population in three French administrative regions: Alsace, Lorraine and Champagne-Ardenne. Changes in the wintering population are assessed by means of four monthly counts. Over the period 1997/2001, the population increased at a steady rate (average annual increase of 16%). Taking the population in January as the reference, the year 2001 shows a peak population of 13 000 birds. Since 2002, gradual decreasing in numbers has taken place (average rate of -4.5%). In January 2008, less than 10 000 birds were recorded. At the same time, nesting of the great cormorant was observed for the first time in Lorraine region in 1986. Then, the bird has been nesting in Champagne-Ardenne region and, since 2003, in all three regions. In 2008, ten nesting colonies were identified, composed of 512 couples (annual increase in population of 30.2%) and 1500 births were recorded in Spring. Parallel to nesting, 4605 great cormorants were killed during the winter of 2007/2008 for a population of 10 000 birds. Climatic conditions may cause significant changes in wintering movements of the species, while operations to regulate cormorant numbers do not seem to have significant impact on the level of frequentation in winter. Finally, the using conditions of certain artificial lakes seem to be favourable for the bird during particularly difficult periods.																			1961-9502						2011		403							05	10.1051/kmae/2011061	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/kmae/2011061													WOS:000299310800002

CRUSTACEANA					Eurytemora International Conference	MAY 13-17, 2019	St Petersburg, RUSSIA					Epischura baikalensis Sars is a dominant pelagic species of the Lake Baikal zooplankton. We empirically determined the duration of the development of Epischura from field data, as it is not possible to determine this experimentally. Based on our data, we conclude that the central pelagic food web of metazoan species in Lake Baikal has not two, as was previously accepted, but three generations during a year and each lasts not 6 but instead 3 to 4 months. The life cycle of the species also possibly includes a 3-months long winter embryonic diapause, starting in November and ending in late February with the start of the under-ice algae bloom. The high nauplii density in spring is not the result of high adult density, suggesting the presence of resting eggs in the E. baikalensis life cycle. We also found a large morphological difference between the pelagic eggs of the species in the winter and in the summertime. The possible participation of diatom algal toxins in the regulation of the seasonal dynamics of their main consumer in Lake Baikal, similar to those known in marine ecosystems, is discussed. The population dynamics in a year with relatively low diatom algae density show four peaks of reproduction, i.e., in February, June, September, and December. In years with significant (more than 15 000 cells/l) diatom blooming we found mass mortality of E. baikalensis juveniles in the plankton, with only two clear peaks of nauplii density. A negative correlation was found between the number of population density peaks for E. baikalensis and the spring-blooming of diatom algae.					; alekseev, victor/C-7086-2014; Naumova, Elena/J-3518-2018	Alekseev, Victor/0000-0002-1968-2609; 													0011-216X	1568-5403				JUN	2020	93	3-5			SI		507	518		10.1163/15685403-00003981	http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/15685403-00003981													WOS:000540781400016

The structure of epiphytic fauna inhabiting water soldiers Stratiotes aloides L. and chemical composition of this macrophyte were determined. With the help of ordination technique (pCCA) we assessed the influence of chemical composition of plant substrate on macrofauna representatives. Altogether 27 taxa of epiphytic fauna were found and most of them were observed in summer, except for one of the melioration ditches. It turned out, that lead and copper had the most important influence on epiphytic fauna inhabiting water soldiers and those chemical elements limited the occurrence of mollusks. The accumulation of other heavy metals in leaves of the studied macrophyte also did not favour the presence of macrofauna representatives. In turn, the higher concentrations of calcium and magnesium were correlated with higher abundance of beetles, caddis-flies and mollusks. The influence of season on chemical interactions between water soldiers and inhabiting macrofauna was not observed.																			1898-617X						2009	3	1					101	+																WOS:000269126300017

While most species were consumed in proportion to their abundance in the environment, there was considerable selection against adnate and filamentous forms. The chloroplasts of most algae were readily broken down in the gut and the maximum length of an ingested cell was 120 .mu.m. All animals fed continuously during the summer but most ceased feeding in winter. Algae represented only 0.1-1.5% of the gut contents of P. affinis collected from 3 subarctic lakes. Most algae were ingested, except for colonial Cyanophyta and algae attached to sand grains. As with G. lacustris, few cells contained intact chloroplasts.

A total of 304 bird species (192 resident, 44 summer visitors, 62 winter visitors and 6 passage migrants) were recorded, including seven globally threatened birds and 40 Chinese National Key Protected Animals. Fourteen species and seven subspecies were recorded for the first time in the area. The fauna of south-west Guangxi is similar to that of south Yunnan and Indochina. We suggest that Nonggang Babbler Stachyris nonggangensis and Oriental Pied Hornbill Anthracoceros albirostris are the priority flagship bird species for the region. Nonggang National Nature Reserve is the most important site in south-west Guangxi for the conservation of endemic birds in limestone areas, while Quyang Lake is very important for wintering waterbirds.

To better interpret the sediment record it is necessary to understand the physical, chemical and biological factors that influence varve formation and preservation. We explored the link between the annual limnological cycle and current varve deposition in the oligotrophic hard water Lake Montcortes (Central Pyrenees). The varves of this lake consist of couplets of dark organic and light calcareous laminae. A two-year limnological monitoring (10/2013-10/2015) combined with a sediment trap study were conducted at monthly resolution. Limnological and sedimentological measurements were compared with meteorological data. Although the lake was considered meromictic in the first limnological studies, we documented total mixing of the water column both winters. In spite of this, long periods of stratification and hypolimnetic anoxia create suitable conditions for varve formation and preservation. Sediment deposition followed a clear seasonal pattern related to biological processes in the euphotic zone. During summer and fall, calcite precipitation was favored by high calcite saturation indices and enhanced primary production that promoted relatively high pH values as a result of CO2 uptaking. There was considerable variability in the amount of calcite deposition between years, which was linked to seasonal temperature differences. In addition, calcite crystal sizes and diatom fluxes showed seasonal patterns related to calcite saturation index and changes in water stratification, which in turn were also related to temperature variability. Seasonal sedimentation patterns were strongly linked to primary producers and especially sensitive to temperature shifts. It results in a clear seasonal signal and varve formation. We compared our results with previous sedimentological interpretations of the varved record of this lake. This study improves the interpretation of Lake Montcortes sediment record extending back several millennia.

Within-stream release-site fidelity of steelhead trout from Lake Erie hatchery stocks	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Straying of salmonids in Lake Erie is not well understood despite the economic importance of these recreational fisheries, which are sustained by stocking approximately 2 million steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) yearlings annually. The occurrence of straying in hatchery-reared salmonid populations can be influenced by stocking strategies, such as within-stream stocking location. Conneaut Creek provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the extent of release-site fidelity of adult steelhead trout from Lake Erie, because it is equally stocked by Ohio and Pennsylvania at different distances from the stream mouth. Adult steelhead trout were collected from two Conneaut Creek sites, Conneaut Ohio (2 km from Lake Erie) and Albion Pennsylvania (61 km from Lake Erie), in spring and fall of 2009. Elemental signatures of yearling otoliths measured by laser-ablation-inductively-coupled-plasma-mass-spectrometry were used to identify hatchery stocks. The state-specific hatchery stocks were identified with high confidence using discriminant analysis (Sr and Ba concentrations in nine otolith regions; Ohio 100.0%, Michigan 86.1%, New York 92.4%, and Pennsylvania 93.2% using jackknifed mean correct assignment). Adult steelhead trout (N = 174) collected in spring and fall at Conneaut Ohio included both Ohio and Pennsylvania-stocked fish, but no Ohio-stocked steelhead trout were collected at the Pennsylvania site in either season. Of the classified adult steelhead trout, 13.8% were identified as strays from other states (New York and Michigan). These results confirm strong release-site fidelity between Ohio and Pennsylvania stocked steelhead trout and provides fishery managers with sound scientific data to refine their stocking practices.

J	MORGAN, MD				MORGAN, MD			LIFE-HISTORY CHARACTERISTICS OF 2 INTRODUCED POPULATIONS OF MYSIS-RELICTA	ECOLOGY												Introduced populations of the opossum shrimp M. relicta take 4 y to reach reproductive age in Lake Tahoe, California-Nevada [USA] and 1-2 yr in Emerald Bay, an isolated (for Mysis) embayment of Lake Tahoe. Reproduction in both populations occurs in the winter and spring. The duration of embryonic stages in the Emerald Bay population based on field population statistics ranged from 50 d [day] for the egg stage to 6 d for the last embryonic stage. The number of eggs per egg-bearing female in Emerald Bay increased significantly with the total length of the female, Over the entire brooding period, the average number of embryos per female decreased from 13.89 eggs/gravid female to 10.33 stage 5 embryos/female. This decline in brood size with age of the brood was not due to size-related mortality, but probably resulted from embryos falling out of the marsupium. A similar decline in brood size with age of the brood was not observed in Lake Tahoe. The average number of eggs per brood in Lake Tahoe was 10.73 which was significantly less than that observed in Emerald Bay. There was no difference in the number of stage 5 embryos per brood in both systems. Differences in generation time and total reproductive output in the Lake Tahoe and Emerald Bay populations were most closely related to differences in the overall production and mean depth of the 2 systems. These traits and whether reproduction is seasonal or continuous among other mysid populations are strongly correlated with the total production of the environment. Differences in M. relicta life history traits among populations may represent a phenotypic and not an evolutionary life history adaptation.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1980	61	3					551	561		10.2307/1937421	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1937421													WOS:A1980KH16900017

J	Quinlan, A; Dale, MRT; Gates, CC				Quinlan, A; Dale, MRT; Gates, CC			Effects of prescribed burning on herbaceous and woody vegetation in northern lowland meadows	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Spring burning of sedge-grass meadows in the Slave River Lowlands (SRL), Northwest Territories, Canada was applied between 1992 and 1998 to reduce shrub encroachment and enhance Bison bison (bison) habitat, although the impact of fire on preferred bison forage was unknown before management. In the summer of 1998 we conducted a study in the Hook Lake area of the SRL to test the effect of burn frequency (unburned, burned once, or burned three times since 1992) on herbaceous plant community composition and Salix spp. L. (willow) shrub vigor. Plant species abundance, litter biomass, soil pH, and depth of the organic soil horizon were measured in 300 1-m(2) quadrats nested within 30 1,000-m(2) plots in both burned and unburned dry meadows. To test the relationship between frequency and willow vigor, all willow shrubs within the plots were assigned a vigor score from I (dead) to IV (flourishing). The spring burns appear to have reduced willow vigor; however, shrub survival remained high (76%) on the most frequently burned meadows. Ordination plots resulting from canonical correspondence analysis suggest that multiple spring burns influenced plant community composition in dry meadow areas and that less palatable bison forage species (e.g., Carex aenea Fern. and Juncus balticus L.) were correlated with a regime of three spring burns. Our results suggest that frequent spring fires in the Hook Lake area have only a small negative effect on willow cover but may reduce the abundance of primary bison forage plants compared with less frequently burned meadows.																			1061-2971					SEP	2003	11	3					343	350		10.1046/j.1526-100X.2003.00219.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1526-100X.2003.00219.x													WOS:000184575400010

It also serves as one of the most significant sources of phosphorus for primary productivity, serving as a possible source of soluble reactive phosphorus, and contributing a sizable amount of the total phosphorus (TP), so monitoring the spatial and temporal variability of PP is crucial for understanding eutrophication in water bodies. This study aims to propose an algorithm to accurately predict the PP concentration and to assess the performance of the model. Considering Chaohu Lake as a case study, we proposed a random forest algorithm based on the convolutional neural network (CNN-RF) to investigate the spatial and temporal patterns of PP concentration in the lake using HJ-2 hyperspectral satellite images. The applicability of backpropagation (BP) neural network, random forest (RF), convolutional neural network (CNN), and CNN-RF models for remote sensing inversion of PP concentration is assessed through model comparison. The results indicate that the CNN-RF model has the best prediction performance, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.91, a residual prediction deviation (RPD) of 3.42, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0155 mg/L, and a percentage bias (PBIAS) of 5.01%, which is better than the BP model by 42%, 106%, 51%, and 81%, the RF model by 25%, 77%, 44%, and 59%, and the CNN model by 9.6%, 42%, 30%, and 49%, respectively, and 59% better than the CNN model. The inversion findings suggest that the PP of Chaohu Lake is substantially high in summer and autumn but comparatively low in spring and winter. The spatial distribution demonstrates an arrangement of highest in the western part of the lake, second in the eastern region, and lowest in the central, with obvious spatial and temporal distribution characteristics, and the trend is closely related to the quarterly mean air temperature and mean precipitation. This indicates that based on the differences in phosphorescence scattering signals of different morphologies in water bodies, the use of hyperspectral remote sensing and the CNN-RF model can effectively extract PP spatiotemporal information, strengthen the learning capability of multiscale characteristics, and contribute to the improvement of the precision of estimating PP concentration, which could provide an innovative approach for determining the degree of eutrophication of lake water bodies.

Icing ablation continues to contribute to streamflow after the disappearance of the snowpack and constitutes an additional source of runoff. The temporal variability and significance of icing ablation to streamflow were examined with a combined water balance and isotope study in a tributary of Manners Creek, Northwest Territories. Icing accounted for 20% of the surface water available for melt. Over the spring study period, icing ablation accounted for 6% of total streamflow, while the total surface-water flux provided 8%. Shallow subsurface flow, which consisted of infiltrated snow meltwater and premelt groundwater, contributed the most to streamflow. At the end of the melt period, icing ablation was the only source of surface runoff to the stream and was similar in magnitude to the estimated evapotranspiration loss. Comparison with other studies revealed that on a regional scale, the hydrologic role of icing ablation is controlled by the interaction between the timing of melt, the magnitude of groundwater recharge, the spatial extent of permafrost, and the depth of seasonal frost.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				JAN	1995	32	1					13	20		10.1139/e95-002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/e95-002													WOS:A1995QM34400002

The analysis is done for an old growth hardwood stand within the Turkey Lakes watershed north of Lake Superior, Ontario. With ForSVA, any effects due to species interactions, competition, and resulting species shifts are not addressed explicitly. Instead, the calculations are based on functional relationships that primarily respond to soil and climate conditions in general, and to structural changes within the forest itself. The simulations cover a period of about 200 years, and suggest that a principal change in annual pattern of soil moisture is to be expected for the UKMO climate scenario, and that this scenario will likely induce a major change of vegetation covertype resulting from major changes in seasonal soil moisture conditions and a general lack of snow during winter. In contrast, the OSU, GISS and GFDL scenarios should not cause a principal change in forest type, but the soil will be somewhat drier than what is currently the case. However, increased precipitation rates and/or air temperatures during summer and spring should, in combination, increase actual evapotranspiration rates, and such increases should increase net primary production. For example, calculations with GFDL suggest that cumulative wood biomass at the Turkey Lakes site can be expected to increase by 25%. Foliage biomass and fine root production can be expected to increase by 70% from current conditions. It is assumed that within-tree allocation of photosynthate is not affected by climate.																			0165-0009					OCT	1996	34	2					239	251																WOS:A1996VR56500011
J	Johnson, JH				Johnson, James H.			Habitat use and diet composition of juvenile Atlantic salmon in a tributary of Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The habitat use and diet of juvenile Atlantic salmon Salmo solar was examined in the South Sandy Creek drainage that discharges into eastern Lake Ontario. Subyearling salmon were stocked in early May during two consecutive years, and habitat and diet evaluations were made in mid-July and mid-October in 2005 and 2006. Both subyearling and yearling Atlantic salmon occupied deeper and faster areas that had more cover and larger sized substrate materials than was present, on average, within the study reach. Differences in habitat use between subyearling and yearling salmon only occurred in summer. Principal component analysis showed that of the habitat variables examined, the amount of cover and size of substrate were more important to juvenile salmon in summer, whereas depth and velocity were more important in the fall. Trichopteran larvae (mainly hydropsychids) dominated the diet of juvenile Atlantic salmon, and parr were feeding most heavily from the substrate as compared to the drift. The juvenile ecology of this re-introduced population of Atlantic salmon is consistent with that reported in other studies throughout the species native range.

Bashinskiy, Ivan			ZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITIES OF SMALL FLOODPLAIN WATER BODIES IN LONGTIME LIMNOPHASE (KHOPER RIVER VALLEY, EUROPEAN RUSSIA)	NATURE CONSERVATION RESEARCH												Under conditions of low floods and disturbed water exchange with the river, small floodplain water bodies gradually dry up, which leads to a decrease in biodiversity of the entire floodplain area. The zooplankton is one of the main indicators of the ecosystem status in aquatic ecosystems. Hence, this study was aimed to investigate the structure of zooplankton communities, their seasonal and interannual dynamics in an oxbow system, which has been in the limnophase stage (in isolation from the river) for a long time. The study has been carried out in the upper reaches of the River Khoper in the buffer zone of the Privolzhskaya Lesostep State Nature Reserve (Penza Region, European Russia) at the forest-steppe natural zone. A part of the studied water bodies is located in the centre of the forested area (<< forest >> sites), while other water bodies are located along the forest edge (<< open >> sites). In 2016-2017, from April to September, 80 zooplankton samples were taken from eight water bodies near the water body shores by filtering 10 litres of water through an Apstein net. A total of 129 species and forms of planktonic invertebrates were found in the studied water bodies. A high proportion of species, which prefer plant thickets, was observed, especially in the forested sites. Based on the used structural parameters of zooplankton communities, the studied water bodies have a high similarity being located in various parts of the oxbow system. The zooplankton communities of forested water bodies are at later stages of the successional development. The temporal and spatial differences of the zooplankton communities are indirectly determined by water temperature, with which the number of species, abundance and biomass of the zooplankton are positively correlated. The zooplankton communities of open water bodies are more spatially variable, but they are more stable in dynamics than zooplankton communities of forested water bodies, which is probably determined by differences in the time of the water level drop. A sharp decrease in the area of open water bodies is being observed in spring, while it less affects zooplankton communities at summer. The drying of forested water bodies occurs gradually throughout the whole summer. Therefore, under conditions of the limnophase and absence of flooding, the zooplankton community dynamics are determined by the intensity of the water level drop at summer, but not the water level fluctuations at spring. The obtained data emphasise the necessity of the monitoring of the whole complex of various floodplain water bodies (pondscapes) but not individual oxbows. In turn, this will allow us to assess the consequences of the prolonged isolation of these ecosystems from a river.

Species- and community-level responses combine to drive phenology of lake phytoplankton	ECOLOGY												Global change is leading to shifts in the seasonal timing of growth and maturation for primary producers. Remote sensing is increasingly used to measure the timing of primary production in both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, but there is often a poor correlation between these results and direct observations of life-history responses of individual species. One explanation may be that, in addition to phenological shifts, global change is also causing shifts in community composition among species with different seasonal timing of growth and maturation. We quantified how shifts in species phenology and in community composition translated into phenological change in a diverse phytoplankton community from 1962 to 2000. During this time, the aggregate community spring-summer phytoplankton peak has shifted 63 days earlier. The mean taxon shift was only 3 days earlier, and shifts in taxa phenology explained only 40% of the observed community phenological shift. The remaining community shift was attributed to dominant early-season taxa increasing in abundance while a dominant late-season taxon decreased in abundance. In diverse producer communities experiencing multiple stressors, changes in species composition must be considered to fully understand and predict shifts in the seasonal timing of primary production.					; de los Angeles Gonzalez Sagrario, Maria/J-3052-2019	Walters, Annika/0000-0002-8638-6682; Gonzalez Sagrario, Maria de los Angeles/0000-0002-6882-8547													0012-9658	1939-9170				OCT	2013	94	10					2188	2194		10.1890/13-0445.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/13-0445.1								24358705					WOS:000325692900011

AN IMPORTANT ISSUE OF WATER CONSERVATION	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSERVATION SCIENCE												The Miletin catchment is situated in the central-eastern sector of the Jijia-Bahlui depression, a component of the Moldavian Plateau, which spans Eastern Romania. Climatic conditions feature average multi-annual precipitations of 500-550 mm/year, an average evapotranspiration of 650-700 mm/year, and temperatures often exceeding 30 degrees C during the summer and down to -30 degrees C during the winter. Due to these conditions, the local rivers (such as the Miletin) can only have a permanent discharge if strong underground waters feed them. This situation is only found in the case of large rivers, which never dry up. Data recording was performed for a period of 41 years. The lowest (minimum minimorum) discharge was 0 m(3)/s in the upper sector, and it was recorded in 1968, 1969, 1986, and 1987. The lowest discharge in the middle sector was of 0.001 m(3)/s, recorded only once in 1990. In the lower sector, downstream from the Halceni pound, the lowest discharge was of 0.002 m(3)/s, recorded in 2006 and 2008. These lowest discharge levels occurred during the summer and winter. Dry-spells and water collecting, increasingly more common during the last few years, means that the hydrostatic level of the groundwater regularly drops by 1-2 cm each year.

Heavy metal content in perch and rudd tissues and associated health risk assessment	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												Fish meat is recommended for consumption as a source of protein, essential unsaturated fatty acids, and fatsoluble vitamins, unfortunately it can also be a source of dangerous contaminants. The aim of the study was to assessment the level of Zn, Cu and Pb in water and bottom sediments collected in summer and autumn from the Koronowo Reservoir and the Wierzchucin<acute accent>skie Duz(center dot)e Lake and in the tissues of perch (Perca fluviatilis L.) and rudd (Scardinius erythrophtalmus L.) for health risk assessment of potential consumers. Metals accumulated in the tissues in the following order: meat, liver and gills: Zn>Cu>Pb. Of the four factors taken into account, such as: type of tissue, fish species, catching season and place of catching, the first one determined the degree of metal accumulation to the greatest extent. The high level of Pb in muscle tissue was determined by the content of this metal in tissue collected from rudd from Wierzchucin<acute accent>skie Duz(center dot)e Lake in the summer (0.383 mg kg(-1) ww). The bioconcentration factor (BCF) of Pb, Zn and Cu in all tissues of analysed fish was much higher from water than from sediments. The highest value of metal pollution index (MPI) in the meat (1.42), liver (12.97), and gills (8.49) was calculated for summer-caught fish. The research indicated that consumption of 100 g of fish meat could meet daily requirement for Zn up to 26.3 % and for Cu in 16.4 %. The potential risk of Pb consumption according to RDA is as much as 2.4 %.																			0147-6513	1090-2414				NOV 15	2024	287								117303	10.1016/j.ecoenv.2024.117303	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2024.117303		NOV 2024						39536560					WOS:001358416100001

Optimizing Sediment Diversion Operations: Working Group Recommendations for Integrating Complex Ecological and Social Landscape Interactions	WATER												Future conditions of coastal Louisiana are highly uncertain due to the dynamic nature of deltas, climate change, tropical storms, and human reliance on natural resources and ecosystem services. Managing a system in which natural and socio-economic components are highly integrated is inherently difficult. Sediment diversions are a unique restoration tool that would reconnect the Mississippi River to its deltaic plain to build and sustain land. Diversions are innately adaptable as operations can be modified over time. An expert working group was formed to explore how various operational strategies may affect the complex interactions of coastal Louisiana's ecological and social landscape and provide preliminary recommendations for further consideration and research. For example, initial operations should be gradually increased over 5 to 10 years to facilitate the development of a distributary channel network, reduce flood risk potential to communities, limit erosion of adjacent marshes and reduce stress to vegetation and fish and wildlife species. Diversions should operate over winter peaks to capture the highest sediment concentration, reduce vegetation loss while dormant, and reduce detrimental effects to fish and wildlife. Operations during the spring/summer should occur over shorter periods to capture the highest sediment load during the rising limb of the flood peak and minimize impacts to the ecosystem. Operational strategies should strive to build and sustain as much of the coastal landscape as possible while also balancing the ecosystem and community needs.					; White, John/A-7940-2008; Snider, Natalie/HNS-5011-2023; White, John R./A-7940-2008; Nyman, John/D-3903-2009	Twilley, Robert R./0000-0002-6173-6033; Justic, Dubravko/0000-0003-4843-437X; Nyman, John/0000-0002-9792-9072; Snider, Natalie L./0000-0003-3493-1770; Visser, Jenneke Maria/0000-0002-0770-4532; White, John R./0000-0002-9967-013X; 													2073-4441					JUN	2017	9	6							368	10.3390/w9060368	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w9060368													WOS:000404559900006

We examined how seasonal variation and plant community vegetation type affect litter decomposition and the associated invertebrate colonization by immersing litter bags of Trapa natans and Typha orientalis species under conspecific vegetation as well as under other species vegetation in autumn and summer in a eutrophic lake located in China for 50 days. A significant effect of seasonality on litter decay was observed under T. natans vegetation, with T. natans litter exhibiting the highest decomposition rate in summer under its own vegetation (0.104 day- 1). No home-field advantage (HFA, litter decomposes faster at home than away habitat) was observed in either season.Invertebrate biomass and microbial respiration were also found to be higher during summer under T. natans vegetation. The invertebrate assemblage composition shifted between seasons and vegetations, with most being collectors Chironomidae that may utilize litter material as a substrate or indirect food source. Conversely, the presence of scrapers Gastropoda had a noticeable impact on litter decomposition, particularly in the warmer season, indicating that scrapers can directly contribute to litter mass loss in eutrophic lakes. Our results provide evidence to suggest that aquatic macrophyte litter decomposition in eutrophic lakes is dependent upon litter type, vegetation type, seasonal variation and their interactions. Our research can help us better understand the characteristics of aquatic plant decomposition in eutrophic lakes as well as provide scientific support for the management and preservation strategies for lake ecosystems.

Samples were collected with modified orange-peel and Ekman dredges, and cores were used to delineate bottom types. Hexagenia nymphs have reached an abundance on the inundated flood plain comparable to populations in natural lakes with suitable habitat. Length frequencies of nymphs, plotted at monthly intervals throughout the summer, suggest a 2-yr life cycle for the major portion of the populations. Concentrations of the fall progeny (1-10 mm) indicate that the early distribution of nymphs is a function of imago activity during oviposition. Distribution of the overwintering nymphs differs considerably from that of the previous fall. Evidence of migration from densely populated shore areas was observed. An interaction of depth, wind, current, and bottom type is influential in redistributing the population.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1967	48	2					216	+		10.2307/1933103	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1933103													WOS:A19679315900005

The effect of pH on phosphorus sorbed from sediments in a river with a natural pH gradient	CHEMOSPHERE												Phosphorus (P) is an essential nutrient for algal growth and its increase in water bodies produces eutrophication. On the other hand, sediments play an essential role in the processes of transformation and accumulation of P in aquatic systems. pH became a major factor to control the availability of P bound sediment not only for algal utilization and the consequent eutrophication of lakes but also for P precipitation to sediment. Most studies focused on the effect of pH on P release from sediments were performed in laboratories where the pH gradient was simulated by adding hydrochloric acid solutions or sodium hydroxide. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the effect of pH on sediment P dynamics (release/uptake) in a river (River Agrio, Argentina) with a natural pH gradient (1.5-6.7) both in water and in sediments. The results obtained showed that: all chemical species analyzed in water decreased according to pH-gradient increase; pH affects sediment P retention capacity, demonstrating that P retention capacity is lower at high pH; P retention capacity is different dependent on the time of year: in fall, the average retention coefficient (R) was 41; in winter, the average R was 38; and in summer, the average R was 46. It was found that sediment P, in all the pH gradient, was controlled, mainly, by the oxyhydroxides of Fe and Al and, to a lesser extent, by the Organic Matter and not by Ca as would be expected in higher pH sediments.

To detect phases of enhanced hatching, growth and production of fresh egg capsules, SCUBA divers lifted stones from the littoral of the western shore of Lake Baikal and from River Angara monthly. All egg capsules and gastropods were recorded. Four different developmental phases of embryos were distinguished. In March the percentage of egg capsules with fully developed embryos is very high, but in April-June the percentage rapidly decreases due to enhanced hatching and a high production of newly laid capsules. From June to October the proportion of older developmental stages increases again. Freshly laid capsules were found at any time, but in March-April, the percentage is low while it is high from May to July. Embryogenesis does not take a few weeks as in most Palaearctic species but several months. Although embryos were found fully developed in autumn-winter, most hatching occurs in spring. In order to determine growth rate and time to maturity for different endemic gastropods, juveniles were kept in rearing cages in situ. The cages were lifted monthly and the snails measured. Results showed growth is very low from November to May and maximal in the period August to October. Thus, shell growth is not steady but cyclical. Compared with relatived species inhabiting smaller Palaearctic water bodies, the ontogeny of Baikalian gastropods is prolonged. It appears that in Lake Baikal Megalovalvata needs 2 years and Choanomphalus 2-3 years to become mature, while the Baicaliidae need at least 4 years to mature and 5 years to be fully grown. Growth rates are higher in the Angara River than in the Lake Baikal littoral.					; Sitnikova, Tatiana/JBR-8697-2023	Sitnikova, Tatiana/0000-0002-3278-6111; 													0018-8158					SEP 15	2006	568			1			115	127		10.1007/s10750-006-0323-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0323-9													WOS:000240688900020
J	Khan, MA				Khan, MA			Ecophysiological studies on size-fractionated phytoplankton populations by tracer technique in Wadi el Majanin Dam, Libya	ACTA HYDROCHIMICA ET HYDROBIOLOGICA												Wadi el Majanin, one of the largest hydraulic structures in Libya was studied for ecophysiological aspects in relation to ambient environment. The waterbody is alkaline (pH = 7.2) and characteristic of hydrogen-carbonate (144.8 mg L-1 CaCO3) system. Vertical extinction coefficients (> 4.8) indicate very high (biogenic) turbidity. Conspicuous variations of a quantitative kind in algal development (e. g., Pediastrum bloom) together with abundant diatom populations (chlorococcales-diatom assemblage), apart from very common occurrence of cyanobacteria and euglenoids show eutrophic water condition. Winter-summer alternation induced pronounced seasonal variability in the rates of in situ planktonic algal photosynthetic activities (285.7...1305 mg m(-3) d(-1) C). Dark fixation activity, attributed largely to bacterial production, oscillated by order of 2-fold magnitude, characterized by summer maxima (47.6 mg m(-3) d(-1) C). Size-fractional analysis established that smaller forms (<60 mu m), broadly regarded nannophytoplankton, frequently dominated (c. 70 %) overall algal productivity.																			0323-4320					JAN	1998	26	1					40	44																WOS:000072536700006

Annual weather patterns are cold in winter and mild in summer. Precipitation has high seasonal and interannual variation and may differ by an order of magnitude between geographically close locales, depending on slope, aspect and local climatic and orographic conditions. The region's hydrology is characterized by the accumulation of winter snow, spring snowmelt and autumnal baseflows. During the 2-3-month 'spring runoff period, rivers frequently discharge > 70% of their annual water budget and have instantaneous discharges 10-100 times mean low flow. Complex weather patterns characterized by high spatial and temporal variability make predictions of future conditions tenuous. However, general patterns are identifiable; northern and western portions of the region are dominated by maritime weather patterns from the North Pacific, central areas and eastern slopes are dominated by continental air masses and southern portions receive seasonally variable atmospheric circulation from the Pacific and the Gulf of Mexico. Significant interannual variations occur in these general patterns, possibly related to ENSO (El Nino-Southern Oscillation) forcing. Changes in precipitation and temperature regimes or patterns have significant potential effects on the distribution and abundance of plants and animals. For example, elevation of the timber-line is principally a function of temperature. Palaeolimnological investigations have shown significant shifts in phyto- and zoo-plankton populations as alpine lakes shift between being above or below the timber-line. Likewise, streamside vegetation has a significant effect on stream ecosystem structure and function. Changes in stream temperature regimes result in significant changes in community composition as a consequence of bioenergetic factors. Stenothermic species could be extirpated as appropriate thermal criteria disappear. Warming temperatures may geographically isolate cole water stream fishes in increasingly confined headwaters. The heat budgets of large lakes may be affected resulting in a change of state between dimictic and warm monomictic character. Uncertainties associated with prediction are increased by the planting of fish in historically fishless, high mountain lakes and the introduction of non-native species of fishes and invertebrates into often previously simple food-webs of large valley bottom lakes and streams. Many of the streams and rivers suffer from the anthropogenic effects of abstraction and regulation. Likewise, many of the large lakes receive nutrient loads from a growing human population. We concluded that: (1) regional climate models are required to resolve adequately the complexities of the high gradient landscapes; (2) extensive wilderness preserves and national park lands, so prevalent in the Rocky Mountain Region, provide sensitive areas for differentiation of anthropogenic effects from climate effects; and (3) future research should encompass both short-term intensive studies and long-term monitoring studies developed within comprehensive experimental arrays of streams and lakes specifically designed to address the issue of anthropogenic versus climatic effects.

Using alkaline phosphatase activity as a supplemental index to optimize predicting algal blooms in phosphorus-deficient lakes: A case study of Lake Taihu, China	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) could be transformed to dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) under phosphorus (P) deficient conditions by various enzymes, among which alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) is regarded as the most important one. To better understand the different response of phytoplankton to DOP and the role of alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) in phytoplankton growth in natural waters, the distribution of P, APA, and phytoplankton density were measured at 12 sites in Lake Taihu, China, in summer, autumn, and winter of 2016. In this study, 34.12% of DOP could be hydrolyzed, indicative of the high bioavailability of DOP in Lake Taihu, especially in Meiliang Bay. More than 70% of enzymatically hydrolyzed DOP came from alkaline phosphatase-hydrolyzed DOP, verifying that APA had a major role in hydrolyzing DOP to fulfill the DIP requirements of phytoplankton, and that phosphomonoesters were the main form of bioavailable DOP in Lake Taihu. Redundancy analysis implied a high capacity of DOP use may be important for species dominance under P-deficient conditions, but high APA expression is not equal to the high capacities of DOP utilization. In this study, phytoplankton density was significantly positive with bulk APA, algal APA and bacteria APA. APA, despite of its complex contributors, is able to increase the amount of bioavailable P for phytoplankton growth. Moreover, algal APA reflects the actual response of phytoplankton to available P under P-deficient conditions. Low algal APA means that other factors limit phytoplankton growth. Increased algal APA means that other limitations get alleviated and algae are in anxious demand for P. Therefore, this paper suggests that monitoring APA can be used as a supplementary indicator to reflect the actual demand for P of algal, thus to optimize the prediction of algal blooms.

Based on the differences in the level of insecticides in the tissues in the qualitative composition of these compounds in the prebreeding and autumn periods, it is possible to assess the degree of contamination of the bird food by chlorinated hydrocarbon remnants in wintering grounds and breeding grounds. The observed periodical fluctuations in level of the compounds in question in the adipose tissue of birds of the 20 spp. do not result from a cumulative process, but are a transitional state connected with the phenomenon of insecticide condensation as a result of a gradual depletion of fat during the breeding season and in the moulting period.																			0070-9557						1978	26	3					439	465																WOS:A1978GF21500007

Neoergasilus japonicus (Harada, 1930): A new non-indigenous copepod for the Italian fauna	ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Neoergasilus japonicus (Harada, 1930) (Copepoda Ergasilidae) is reported for the first time in Italy. Several specimens of this non-indigenous species were identified in the free-living zooplankton of 11 lakes out of 21 sampled seasonally during a period of 2 years in southern Italy. Adults of both sexes were found, females always without ovisacs. Morphological novelties, such as the bifid inner terminal seta of the furcal rami in females and the plumose terminal setae on either males or females, are reported. Neoergasilus japonicus has been observed only in summer and autumn samples. At present, the geographic distribution of the species is Holarctic, and it is expanding in Europe. Although this is the first record for Italy, the presence in about half of the investigated lakes and the abundance of the found populations suggests that the species distribution should be more extended than we presently know.

J	Huerta, MA; Whitlock, C; Yale, J				Huerta, Mariana A.; Whitlock, Cathy; Yale, Jason			Holocene vegetation-fire-climate linkages in northern Yellowstone National Park, USA	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Yellowstone National Park has been an important location for paleoecologic studies that focus on the use of charcoal data to reconstruct past fire activity and on the role of climate variations in shaping past vegetation and fire regimes. One hypothesis, which has been explored in other parts of the western U.S., is the idea that present-day summer-dry and summer-wet precipitation regimes were intensified during the early Holocene as a result of greater-than-present summer insolation and its effect on atmospheric circulation patterns. In Yellowstone, this hypothesis was previously examined at two sites, one in summer-wet and one in summer-dry precipitation regions. The records showed variation in both fire and vegetation history that supported the hypothesis. We present a fire and vegetation history from Blacktail Pond, located in Pseudotsuga parkland in the transitional region. The Blacktail Pond data indicate the following ecological history: prior to 12,000 cal yr BP, the site supported tundra vegetation and fire episodes were infrequent. Between 12,000 and 11,000 cal yr BP, Picea-Pinus parkland was established and fire activity increased; these changes are consistent with increasing temperature, as a result of rising summer insolation. From 11,000 to 7600 cal yr BP, the presence of a closed forest of Pinus and some Picea is attributed to high levels of winter moisture, but high fire activity indicates that summers were drier than at present. After 7600 cal yr BP, the presence of forest and steppe vegetation in combination with high fire activity suggest that middle-Holocene conditions were warm and dry. The decrease in Picea and Betula in the last 4000 cal yr indicates continued drying in the late Holocene, although fire-episode frequency was relatively high until 2000 cal yr BP. The pollen data at Blacktail Pond and other low-elevation sites in the northern Rocky Mountains suggest a widespread vegetation response in summer-wet regions to effectively wetter conditions in the early Holocene and decreased moisture in the middle and late Holocene. In contrast, the more-variable fire history among the three sites implies either that (1) summer moisture stress and fire conditions are related to year-round moisture balance and not well predicted by the hypothesis, (2) the transitional area between summer-wet and summer-dry precipitation regimes experienced complicated shifts in effective moisture through time, and/or (3) fire-episode data have a limited source area that makes it difficult to separate local influences from regional climate changes in understanding long-term variations in fire-episode frequency.

J	Behney, AC				Behney, Adam C.			The Influence of Water Depth on Energy Availability for Ducks	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Habitat management and planning strategies for nonbreeding ducks are focused on providing enough energy to support a desired number of individuals. Therefore, regional estimates of energy availability for nonbreeding ducks are required to determine if sufficient habitat exists for them. I used core sampling to estimate food and energy density in 6 types of water bodies (i.e., actively and passively managed emergent wetlands, playas, small and large reservoirs, and sloughs) in northeastern Colorado, USA, during 3 sampling occasions throughout 2 nonbreeding seasons, 2015-2016 and 2016-2017. Also, I used precise depth measurements to estimate the percentage of each site that was shallow enough to facilitate feeding by dabbling ducks as a way to correct overall energy density to reflect availability to ducks. Emergent wetlands contained the greatest food and energy density, followed by playas and sloughs, and reservoirs contained little food or energy. Fall depletion of food was greatest in actively managed emergent wetlands and spring depletion was greatest in sloughs and passively managed emergent wetlands. Mean percentage of passively managed emergent wetlands, actively managed emergent wetlands, small reservoirs, large reservoirs, and sloughs shallower than 50 cm was 37%, 77%, 10%, 4%, and 83%, respectively. Incorporating these estimates into the energetic carrying capacity model developed by the Playa Lakes Joint Venture for eastern Colorado resulted in a 54% decrease in overall duck energy day estimates, which is below what is needed to support population goals. This research identifies the need for additional wetland restoration in eastern Colorado to meet energy requirements of nonbreeding ducks and provides information to conservation planners to make more informed decisions about the extent and location of wetland restoration activities.

Measurements were collected using a combination of moored instruments and microstructure profiles. Observations during the stratified summer showed a shallow, wind-driven surface mixed layer (SML) with locally elevated dissipation rates in the thermocline (epsilon approximate to 10-7W/kg) potentially associated with internal wave shear. Below the thermocline, turbulence was weak (epsilon approximate to 10-9W/kg) and buoyancy-suppressed (Q=epsilon/nu N2 < 8.5), with low hypolimnetic mixing rates (Kz approximate to 10-7m2/s) limiting benthic particle delivery. During the convective winter period, a diurnal cycle of radiative convection was observed over each day of measurement, where temperature overturns were directly correlated with elevated turbulence levels throughout the water column (epsilon approximate to 10-7W/kg; Kz approximate to 10-1m2/s). A transitional mixing period was observed for spring conditions when surface temperatures were near the temperature of maximum density (T-MD approximate to 3.98 degrees C) and the water column began to stably stratify. While small temperature gradients allowed strong mixing over the transitional period (KZ approximate to 10-3m2/s), hypolimnetic velocity shear was overwhelmed by weakly stable stratification (N2 approximate to 10-6s-2; Ri approximate to 0.2), limiting the development of the SML. These results highlight the importance of radiative convection for breaking down weak hypolimnetic stratification and driving energetic, full water column mixing during a substantial portion of the year (>100 days at our sample site). Ongoing surface water warming in the Laurentian Great Lakes is significantly reducing the annual impact of convective mixing, with important consequences for nutrient cycling, primary production, and benthic-pelagic coupling.					; Liao, Qian/AAC-7866-2021	Troy, Cary/0000-0001-9115-6323; Cannon, David/0000-0001-5238-6863													2169-9275	2169-9291				NOV	2021	126	11							e2021JC017533	10.1029/2021JC017533	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JC017533													WOS:000723095600039
J	Nozzi, N; Stelzer, RS				Nozzi, Nathan; Stelzer, Robert S.			Responses of fish communities to longitudinal thermal gradients in coldwater, lake outflow streams	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Longitudinal water temperature gradients in streams are widespread and are associated with changes in fish community structure. A major cause of these changes is variation in the thermal tolerances and preferences of coldwater, coolwater, and warmwater fish species. Much less is known about water temperature gradients in lake outflow coldwater streams and associated variation in fish communities. Our main objective was to assess longitudinal temperature gradients in lake outflow streams and to measure the corresponding variation in fish community structure. We quantified temperature gradients and the fish communities in two lake outflow streams in central Wisconsin from June through October 2019. We measured longitudinal water temperature gradients spanning up to 6 degrees C or more during the summer but the gradients weakened in late summer and were not present in autumn. Warmwater and coolwater species such as rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), and creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus) were more common in reaches nearest to lake outflows in both streams. Coldwater species such as brown trout (Salmo trutta), brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), and mottled sculpin (Cottus bairdii) were more common in downstream reaches. Increasing water temperatures in lakes due to global climate change will likely increase the magnitude of longitudinal temperature gradients in coldwater streams that are fed by warmwater lakes, which will probably impact the distributions of coldwater fish species in these systems.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				OCT	2021	104	10					1235	1249		10.1007/s10641-021-01149-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-021-01149-w		SEP 2021											WOS:000698144600001

Diatom responses to limnological and climatic changes at Ribains maar (French Massif Central) during the Eemian and early Wurm	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												High-resolution diatom analysis was carried out to assess the limnological and climatic changes that took place at Ribains maar (French Massif Central) during the Late Pleistocene (similar to 131-similar to 105 ka BP), with a focus on the Eemian interglacial in particular. Numerical analyses were used to show that most of the variability in the fossil diatom assemblages was due to climate independently from the changes in the lake catchment vegetation (as represented by pollen data). Diatom-based quantitative reconstructions of the past limnological conditions, as well as a comprehensive literature review on the auto-ecological requirements for the principal diatom taxa, were used to interpret the record. An absolute time-scale for the sequence was derived by matching the major pollen shifts with the radiometrically dated changes in oxygen isotopes observed in Italian stalagmites. This study shows that at Ribains maar, the transition from the Riss (= Saalian) Glacial to the Eemian interglacial was marked by a gradual increase in the contribution of spring-blooming diatom species, indicating a longer growing season and milder winter/spring conditions Lit that time. A short cooling event interrupts this trend and may correspond to a stadial. At the start of the Eemian a peak in benthic taxa and the suppression of spring-blooming flora probably reflects the effects of deglaciation on the catchment. During the Eemian interglacial itself three main phases were distinguished within the diatom record. The first phase (similar to 8000 years in duration) was dominated by Stephanodiscus minutulus, which suggests that intense mixing in the water-column took place during spring. The pollen record was simultaneously dominated by Quercus and Corylus that typify this phase as the climatic optimum of the Eemian. The second phase, almost equal in duration to the first phase (similar to 7000 years), is generally dominated by Cyclotella taxa and suggests a less productive lake and much reduced period of spring mixing compared with the first phase. In the pollen diagram this corresponds to an interval dominated by Carpinus-Picea-Abies that indicates a cooler and wetter climate. The third and last phase of the Eemian, similar to 2000 year long, saw the return to Stephanodiscus-dominated assemblages, indicating a warming that may correspond to the Dansgaard-Oeschger event 25 identified in the Greenland ice-core record. In the early stage of the Wurm Glacial (= Weichselian), assemblages in the Melisey I stadial (similar to 3000 year long) were dominated by either Aulacoseira subarctica or Asterionella formosa, which Suggest colder spring conditions than during the late Eemian, but not as cold as the ones indicated by the pollen record. Stephanodiscus spp. again dominate during the Saint-Germain Ia interstadial (similar to 5000 year long) suggesting a return to the conditions that prevailed before the Melisey stadial, in agreement with the pollen record. The record ends with the Montaigu cold event, which is characterised by a. Pinus peak in the pollen record, and corresponds to a large abundance of A. subarctica in the diatom sequence. Throughout the Eemian the abundance of Stephanodiscus spp., which is thought to be driven by winter conditions, show cyclic fluctuations that most likely match the cooling events identified in a pollen record from Germany. Variation in insolation throughout the Eemian may have been the driving factor behind the species succession observed in the diatom sequence. While this study demonstrates that diatom analysis of lake sediment can provide very detailed information n long-term climate change, a review of the few other diatom investigations published on European Eemian deposits shows that this technique has been so far seldom used to its full potential in this context in central and southern Europe.

Fish were removed from the lake with fyke nets and seining. By spring 2001, the cumulative catches were 276 kg ha(-1) in the northern and 226 kg ha(-1) in the southern basin. Roach dominated the catches of both basins. From summer 1997 to 2001 the total biomass of phytoplankton decreased from 10-30 to 5-13 mg l(-1) in the more eutrophic northern basin and from 5-19 to 2-4 mg l(-1) in the southern basin, respectively. The occurrence of maximum biomass of blue-green algae moved from July to August towards autumn during the study period. The mean biomass of cladoceran crustaceans in July to August showed a slightly increasing trend from 100-150 to 150-200 mug C l(-1). The biomasses of Daphnia spp. and Bosmina coregoni were higher in 2000 and 2001 compared to earlier years. The annual mean total catches of multimesh gillnets, dominated by roach, were 3.9-5.1 kg net(-1) in the northern and 1.8-2.6 kg net(-1) in the southern basin. A slight decrease took place in the gillnet catches in the southern basin but not in the northern. The increased growth of young perch and roach in the last years of the study period was attributed to the thermal conditions rather than to the fish removal.

POPULATION PARAMETERS	AUSTRALIAN WILDLIFE RESEARCH												Removal and capture-mark-release trapping were carried out in mined and unmined open forest between 1972 and 1977 near Nelson Bay and Smiths Lake, New South Wales. Most commonly caught species were Pseudomys novaehollandiae, Antechinus stuartii and Mus musculus, with few captures of Rattus fuscipes, R. lutreolus, R. rattus, Isoodon macrourus and Petaurus breviceps. Abundance of Pseudomys novaehollandiae and A. stuartii was maximal in autumn and minimal in spring. Population increases were primarily the result of recruitment of first-year animals. A low-intensity autumn fire that burnt 66% of the study plot at Nelson Bay resulted in the loss of no nore than 13% of P. novaehollandiae and 26% of A. stuartii, but by 2 months postfire 26% of P. novaehollandiae and 52% of A. stuartii had disappeared from the grid. At 2 years postfire, P. novaehollandiae density had increased by 37% over the immediate prefire level, but A. stuartii had attained only 68% of the prefire density. Abundance of M. musculus was low until 1 year postfire. At 2 years, it was 32 times the prefire level. Sex ratios of the three major species were all not significantly different from 0.5. Female A. stuartii and male and female P. novaehollandiae lived up to 2 years of age.																			0310-7833						1990	17	2					195	206																WOS:A1990DE02100012

However, few studies have measured the effects of repeated annual winter drawdowns on freshwater mussel populations (Bivalvia: Unionida), and it is unknown whether drawdowns permanently constrain mussel populations to deeper depths or are resilient to the annual disturbance. We quantified mussel densities during normal water levels and their mortality after the initiation of drawdown in lakes with annual winter (December-March) water level drawdown regimes that have existed for several decades. We used systematic quadrat sampling and visual snorkel surveys to estimate the number of live mussels at the surface and buried, and shell length in six drawdown and three control lakes at exposed (0.5-m) and unexposed (1-m) depths during winter drawdown. We also estimated mortality of mussels along the exposed lakebed for nine drawdown lakes. Study lakes were dominated by Elliptio complanata and Pyganodon cataracta. During normal water levels, mussel densities were much lower in drawdown lakes than control lakes at 0.5-m depths. When mussels were present in drawdown lakes at 0.5-m depths, they were often burrowed in the substrate and smaller than buried mussels in control lakes. At unexposed 1-m depths, mussel densities were primarily explained by geographic region (western versus central Massachusetts), and found higher densities in drawdown lakes compared to control lakes. Mussel mortality after a single drawdown event in nine drawdown lakes was not correlated with drawdown magnitude or rate. Concordance of shell length-frequency distributions between dead and buried living mussels in drawdown lakes suggests annual mortality of colonising individuals, which are typically small and presumably of young cohorts. Annual winter drawdowns still limit densities of E. complanata and P. cataracta in shallow-water habitats in the following autumn (September-October) after 4-5 months of potential recovery, and hence constrain their distribution in lakes exposed to drawdowns. The development of sustainable water level management practices will be essential to minimise impacts to native mussel populations.					; Hazelton, Peter/JED-7423-2023	Hazelton, Peter/0000-0001-7500-3706; Carmignani, Jason/0000-0001-6305-4469													0046-5070	1365-2427				AUG	2019	64	8					1519	1533		10.1111/fwb.13324	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13324													WOS:000474661800013
J	Sahin, B; Barinova, S				Sahin, Bulent; Barinova, Sophia			Environmental Factors Structuring Diatom Diversity of the Protected High Mountain Lakes in the Kaçkar Mountains National Park (Rize, Turkey)	ECOLOGIES												The altitude of the habitat is one of the important regulators of species survival. Ka & ccedil;kar Mountains National Park is located in the Eastern Black Sea region of Turkey. This is the first study on the benthic diatom flora of the high mountain lakes in Ka & ccedil;kar Mountains National Park, which is situated between 2782 and 3075 m a.s.l. A total of 84 diatom species were identified from benthic communities of 15 habitats in summer (19 July, 28 August) and autumn (10 September) months of 2020. The genus Pinnularia (thirteen species) formed the basis of the taxonomic list, followed by Eunotia (five species), Navicula (five species), and Frustulia (four species) genera, respectively. The waters in all the studied lakes were fresh, low-saline, with low-alkaline or circumneutral pH and organically uncontaminated, as evidenced by prevailed bioindicator groups. Statistical methods and comparative floristic results confirm the role of the lake altitude for the diatom species distribution. The species richness of the studied lakes was higher in lakes with lower altitudes. The statistical approach also revealed the potential for an increase in the number of species in high mountain lakes if the study of the diatom flora of the Kachkar Mountains National Park is continued and the species composition of the lakes is replenished. Further studies will be needed to continue exploring this pattern. To protect studied high mountain lakes, their ecological conditions must be constantly monitored in the Ka & ccedil;kar Mountains National Park.

J	JACOBS, J				JACOBS, J			COEXISTENCE OF SIMILAR ZOOPLANKTON SPECIES BY DIFFERENTIAL ADAPTATION TO REPRODUCTION AND ESCAPE IN AN ENVIRONMENT WITH FLUCTUATING FOOD AND ENEMY DENSITIES .2. FIELD DATA-ANALYSIS OF DAPHNIA	OECOLOGIA												In the Klostersee in southern West Germany Daphnia hyalina (H) and D. cucullata (C) have coexisted for at least 50 yr. In 1971/72 they exhibited seasonal density fluctuations which are in accord with predictions from a model based on alternative adaptations of 2 competitors to natality (food utilization) and mortality (escape from enemies) in an environment that fluctuates with respect to food and intensity of predation. In general, both species fluctuate in a similar fashion. Birth (b), death (m) and growth rates (r) are correlated between both species. Furthermore, in either species birth and death rates are positively correlated. But the birth and death rates of H are about 1.7 times as large as those of C, resulting in stronger density fluctuations of H. This fact, in combination with the seasonal course of the b/m-ratio produces a marked seasonal segregation of the abundances of both species, with H dominating in early summer and C dominating in autumn and winter. In both species, the fluctuations of the growth rate are mainly determined by fluctuations of the death and not the birth rate. Birth and death rates are much higher in the warm season than in the cold season, but births dominate in the cold, deaths in the warm season. Evidence is presented that mortality is mainly due to predation by fish. The differences of natality and mortality which cause the seasonal segregation between the two species, exist independent of seasonal temperature fluctuations. But, there is an additional temperature effect accentuating the differences. A partial correlation analysis shows that by measuring the density of one species and lake temperature, the density difference between both species and, hence, the density of the 2nd species can be predicted with good precision. The importance of the observed temporal segregation and other factors for the stabilized coexistence of both species is discussed.																			0029-8549	1432-1939					1977	30	4					313	329		10.1007/BF00399764	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00399764								28309181					WOS:A1977EA50200003

Seasonal Succession Leads to Habitat-Dependent Differentiation in Ribosomal RNA:DNA Ratios among Freshwater Lake Bacteria	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Relative abundance profiles of bacterial populations measured by sequencing DNA or RNA of marker genes can widely differ. These differences, made apparent when calculating ribosomal RNA:DNA ratios, have been interpreted as variable activities of bacterial populations. However, inconsistent correlations between ribosomal RNA:DNA ratios and metabolic activity or growth rates have led to a more conservative interpretation of this metric as the cellular protein synthesis potential (PSP). Little is known, particularly in freshwater systems, about how PSP varies for specific taxa across temporal and spatial environmental gradients and how conserved PSP is across bacterial phylogeny. Here, we generated 16S rRNA gene sequencing data using simultaneously extracted DNA and RNA from fractionated (free-living and particulate) water samples taken seasonally along a eutrophic freshwater estuary to oligotrophic pelagic transect in Lake Michigan. In contrast to previous reports, we observed frequent clustering of DNA and RNA data from the same sample. Analysis of the overlap in taxa detected at the RNA and DNA level indicated that microbial dormancy may be more common in the estuary, the particulate fraction, and during the stratified period. Across spatiotemporal gradients, PSP was often conserved at the phylum and class levels. PSPs for specific taxa were more similar across habitats in spring than in summer and fall. This was most notable for PSPs of the same taxa when located in the free-living or particulate fractions, but also when contrasting surface to deep, and estuary to Lake Michigan communities. Our results show that community composition assessed by RNA and DNA measurements are more similar than previously assumed in freshwater systems. However, the similarity between RNA and DNA measurements and taxa-specific PSPs that drive community-level similarities are conditional on spatiotemporal factors.																				1664-302X				APR 29	2016	7								606	10.3389/fmicb.2076.00606	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2076.00606								27199936					WOS:000375387000001
J	Arterburn, HM; McMahon, RF				Arterburn, Heather M.; McMahon, Robert F.			Population and Reproductive Dynamics of Zebra Mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) in Warm, Low-Latitude North American Waters	BIOLOGICAL BULLETIN												Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha), first reported in Texas during 2009, have infested 28 Texas reservoirs over 11 years. This species has not previously invaded water bodies as warm as those in Texas, where temperatures approach or exceed its previously accepted incipient upper thermal limit of 30 degrees C, raising the question of how such temperatures impact its population dynamics. Over 3-5 years, monthly collections of mussels, sampling for planktonic mussel veligers, juvenile settlement data, and water quality parameters, were undertaken at Texas lakes Texoma, Ray Roberts, and Belton to estimate mussel shell length growth rates, life spans, reproductive periods, and settlement patterns. Biannual spawning periods occurred at water temperatures of 18 to 28 degrees C, resulting in distinct spring and fall juvenile settlement cohorts. Growth rates were rapid, with both cohorts attaining mean maximum shell lengths of 20-25 mm within 8-15 months of settlement, compared to European and northeastern US populations that attained similar sizes after 2-4 years. Shortened life spans were demarcated by adult mussel die-offs during summer months of elevated water temperature the year after initial settlement, leading to short-term cyclical fluctuations in population densities. Large-scale mussel die-offs were caused by flooding and hypoxia events. Elevated temperatures appeared to facilitate mussel invasiveness by increasing spawning frequency and elevating growth rates, thus reducing time to maturity and allowing population recovery within 1-2 years after environmentally induced severe population declines.																			0006-3185	1939-8697				JUN 1	2022	242	3					207	221		10.1086/720151	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720151		JUN 2022						35767412					WOS:000797250400001
J	Pawluczuk, J; Stepien, A				Pawluczuk, Jan; Stepien, Arkadiusz			Dynamics of Organic Nitrogen Compound Mineralization in Organic Soils under Grassland, and the Mineral N Concentration in Groundwater (A Case Study of the Mazurian Lake District, Poland)	SUSTAINABILITY												Peatlands serve numerous functions, with one of the main ones being the retention of nutrients, including mineral nitrogen. A field study in organic soils was carried out in the Mazurian Lake District situated in north-eastern Poland (53 degrees 37 ' 50 ' N, 20 degrees 28 ' 51 ' E). In the test peat soils, the rate of organic nitrogen compound mineralization varied significantly depending on the season. The dynamics of the organic matter mineralization process were most strongly influenced by the soil use and the season. The mineral N release was higher in organic soil under intensively used grassland. In this soil, much more mineral nitrogen was released during the summer and spring periods. The dominant form in the organic nitrogen compound mineralization processes was N-NO3. The highest dynamics of the organic nitrogen compound mineralization were noted at a soil moisture content ranging from 57% to 59%. The interdependence of the soil moisture content and the rate of organic nitrogen compound mineralization fluctuated over the study period, with an increase in spring and a decrease in summer. A correlation was demonstrated between the nitrate form content in the peat soils under intensive cultivation and the nitrate-nitrogen concentration in groundwater, while no correlation was demonstrated between the N-NO3 content in the soils under a forest and the N-NO3 concentration in the groundwater of these soils. The results provide the basis for the conclusion that the land use type (forest, grassland), which determines the morphological structure of organic soils, affects the intensity of the infiltration of different mineral nitrogen forms.

Of all the pond landscapes in Europe, many are managed by Humans for fish production and little is known today about their role as carbon sinks or sources. We monitored 20 fish ponds from the Dombes region (France) during a production season in 2022. We measured both sedimentation rates, the diffusion of CO2, CH4 and N2O and ebullition of CH4 over three different seasons (spring, summer and autumn) in order to provide an estimate of the carbon balance for each pond. Five were dried-out in 2023 as part of the management cycle, and were monitored for dry flux emissions during this period. On average, our measurements suggest that fish ponds were carbon sinks (6 fish ponds as sources and 14 as sinks). There was on average a net sequestration of 4.16 (+/- 10.00) tonnes of CO2e per hectare over 6 months. Measurements from the dry year, indicate that the ponds were carbon sources (mean value of 23.89 tonnes of CO2eq emitted). However, whilst the drying out phase directly increases emissions, it also encourages the development of macrophytes in the subsequent years which improves carbon storage through sedimentation, and appears to be an important driver of the observed balances. These data are consistent with the fact that fish ponds have the capacity to be either sources or sinks of carbon for the atmosphere. Moreover, by promoting good levels of primary productivity, the presence of aquatic plants and by improving carbon storage, management practices appear to have the capacity to turn fish ponds into carbon sinks. These agroecosystems could thus play an important role in the context of climate change mitigation.

However, the occurrences of blooming on larger spatial scale and longer time scale have rarely been studied. As the third largest freshwater lake in China, Lake Taihu has drawn increasing attention from both public and scientific communities concerning its degradation. Using available satellite images, we reconstructed the spatial and temporal patterns of algal blooms in Lake Taihu through the past two decades. The blooming characteristics over the past two decades were examined with the dynamic of initial blooming date being highlighted. The initial blooming dates were gradually becoming later and later from 1987 to 1997. Since 1998, however, the initial blooming date came earlier and earlier year by year, with approximately 11.42 days advancement per year. From 1987 to 2007, the annual duration of algal blooms lengthened year by year, in line with the substantial increases in the occurrences of algal blooms in spring and summer months. The algal blooms usually occur in northern bays and spread to center and south parts of Lake Taihu. The increases in previous winter's mean daily minimum temperature partially contributed to the earlier blooming onset. However, human activities, expressed as total gross domestic product (GDP) and population, outweighed the climatic contribution on the initial blooming date and blooming duration. This study may provide insights for the policy makers who try to curb the algal blooming and improve the water quality of inland freshwater lakes.

The study results indicated that the growth rates of HNF showed pronounced seasonal variation (-0.37-1.25 d(-1)), reaching the maximum during spring to early summer. When the water temperature was higher than 25.5 degreesC, HNF growth was inversely proportional to water temperature. There was an effect by bacterial abundance and autotrophic picoplankton on HNF growth that depended on location. HNF biomass was the highest in late spring, and the HNF production ranged from -2.25 to 35.45 mg l(-1) d(-1) with mean of 3.17 mg l(-1) d(-1). When considered in the context of biomass and production data for zooplankton in Lake Donghu, it was evident that HNF contributed significantly to the total zooplankton production in Lake Donghu. These in situ studies indicate that temperature and food supply are the major determinants of HNF abundance and productivity.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY	2003	498	1-3					85	95		10.1023/A:1026239306120	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1026239306120													WOS:000186041600002

These laminites offer a potential technique for dating recently deposited organic-rich muds, but their formation mechanisms have been inadequately understood. In this study, microfabric of the modern laminated sediments in the coastal Gulf of Finland and Archipelago Sea was investigated through X-radiography and scanning electron microscopy of samples embedded in epoxy resin. The sedimentary fabric comprises rhythmic biogenic and lithogenic lamina successions reflecting seasonal changes in the composition of accumulating material. The diatom-rich biogenic lamina succession is formed during the vernal phytoplankton bloom through rapid sedimentation of aggregates composed of intact diatom frustules and minor proportions of clay-rich lithic material that are enclosed in a sticky matrix of amorphous phytodetritus, analogous to the formation of the marine snow. Accumulation of the lithogenic lamina succession results from decline in.primary production towards late summer, enhanced recycling of organic carbon due to grazing by zooplankton and intensified resuspension of lithic-rich terrigenous material concomitantly with increased cyclonic activity towards late autumn and winter. The inclusion of silt grains and isolated diatoms and faecal pellets in the lithogenic laminae attests to lateral transport and deposition from near-bottom flows, contradicting the generally accepted view that laminated sediments accumulate by suspension settling under quiescent conditions only. Accumulation rates inferred from Cs-137 dating are consistent with the biogenic lithogenic lamina succession-couplet thickness, supporting the interpretation that the couplets reflect an annual cycle of deposition. The results indicate that these modern laminated sediments provide a high-resolution archive for assessing recent human-induced environmental changes as well as a robust tool for evaluating the lateral expansion of seafloor oxygen deficiency due to anthropogenic eutrophication in the area during the past decades.

J	Havens, KE; Sharfstein, B; Rodusky, AJ; East, TL				Havens, KE; Sharfstein, B; Rodusky, AJ; East, TL			Phosphorus accumulation in the littoral zone of a subtropical lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												In situ mesocosm experiments were performed under summer ( 1997) and winter ( 1999) conditions in the littoral zone of a subtropical lake in Florida, USA. The objective was to quantify phosphorus ( P) accumulation by various components of the community after adding pulsed doses of dissolved inorganic P. A short-term experiment also was done to quantify the rate of P loss from the water column, with simultaneous use of an inert tracer to confirm that P depletion was not due to leakage of the tanks. In the experiments, added P was rapidly removed from the water; samples collected 3-4 days after adding spikes of near 100 mug l(-1) P contained little or no soluble reactive P. In the short-term experiment, we documented that the half-life of added P was approximately 6-8 h in the water column, and that the tanks were not exchanging water with the surrounding lake. Little of the added P ended up in plankton, rooted vascular plants, or sediments. The main sink for P was periphyton, including surface algal mats, benthic algal mats and detritus, and epiphyton. In the summer 1997 experiment, the periphyton was intimately associated with a non-rooted plant (Utricularia), which also may have sequestered P from the water. Structure of the littoral community varied between summer and winter, and this influenced which periphyton component accounted for most of the P removal. In regard to P mass balances, we accounted for 54% of the added P in 1997, when coarse sampling was done. In 1999, when there was more detailed sampling of the community, 92% of the added P was located in various community components. Subtropical littoral periphyton can be a large sink for P, as long as depth and underwater irradiance conditions favor its growth.					east, t/KVY-8260-2024														0018-8158					APR	2004	517	1-3					15	24		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000027334.05589.29	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000027334.05589.29													WOS:000221338200002

Phosphorus release mainly occurred from April to October, net retention being close to zero during winter. Net internal phosphorus loading was 8 g p m-2 y-1 in 1983 and slowly decreased to 2 g P m-2 y-1 in 1990, mainly because of decreasing sediment phosphorus release during late summer and autumn. The high net release of phosphorus from Lake Sobygaard sediment is attributable to a very high phosphorus concentration and to a high transport rate in the sediment caused by bioturbation and gas ebullition. Sediment phosphorus concentration mainly decreased at a depth of 5 to 20 cm, involving sediment layers down to 23 cm. Maximum sediment phosphorus concentration, which was 11.3 mg P g-1 dw at a depth of 14-16 cm in 1985, decreased to 8.6 mg P g-1 dw at a depth of 16-18 cm in 1991. Phosphorus fractionation revealed that phosphorus release was accompanied by a decrease in NH4Cl-P + NaOH-P and organic phosphorus fractions. HCl-P increased at all sediment depths. The Fe:P ratio in the superficial layer stabilized at approximately 10. Net phosphorus release can be expected to continue for another decade at the present release rate, before an Fe:P ratio of 10 will be reached in the sediment layers from which phosphorus is now being released.

To address this question, we used data from surveys of four Great Lakes watersheds to compare rates of species accumulation among several watershed-level scenarios of sampling effort allocation (sampling strategies). To allow for quantitative comparisons among strategies, we (1) divided each sampling site into smaller sampling units and separately recorded fish capture data at the smallest unit; (2) stratified the allocation of sampling effort throughout each watershed by stream order; and (3) recorded all sampling and travel costs (i.e., time spent on different tasks). We used a Monte Carlo simulation program to resample the data from each of the four watershed surveys and calculated rates of species accumulation. This technique allowed us to quantitatively compare sampling strategies. Using this program, we determined the optimal values for (1) the length of stream to sample at each reach; (2) the allocation of sampling effort (time) among stream order strata; and (3) the allocation of effort between seasons (spring and summer) for each of the four watersheds. On average, sampling 15, 9, and 9 stream widths per reach in first-, second-, and third-order reaches, respectively, maximized the rates of species accumulation across watersheds. Allocating 50-70% of the sampling effort to third-order strata of each watershed yielded the highest rates of species accumulation without increasing the number of species systematically missed in either the lower or upper portions of the watershed. Focusing sampling effort in only one season, either spring or summer, did not consistently increase the rates of species accumulation. Our results provide useful guidance for the design of watershed-scale ichthyofaunal surveys in Great Lakes basin watersheds. We recommend similar assessments in other regions with contrasting patterns of fish diversity.																			0002-8487					SEP	2008	137	5					1500	1506		10.1577/T07-024.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T07-024.1													WOS:000260704300021

The two-basined Wuchang Lake is a typical small shallow lake within the Yangtze River floodplain. Expansion of the emergent macrophyte Zizania latifolia at Wuchang Lower Lake (to 49 km(2) in area, c. 87.0% of Lower Lake) has increasingly denied the local community open water for fishing since the 1980s. To better understand the causes of these changes and potential remediation, we used annual Landsat imagery from 1975 to 2012 to determine the patterns of expansion between years as well as the effects of water levels in different seasons and trophic status on the annual extent of macrophytes in the Lower Lake. These analyses showed that: (1) Z. latifolia progressively covered the Lower Lake, while remaining confined to one inlet in the Upper Lake; (2) despite the generally increasing trend, there were obvious annual variations in area of Z. latifolia; (3) variation of water level in spring contributed to between-year variation in area and was significantly negatively correlated with expansion in Z. latifolia. Based on these results, to reduce the expansion in Z. latifolia, we recommend maintaining spring Lower Lake water levels above at least at 11.6 m and better at 12 m, cutting shoots in June and July, with subsequent shoot removal in autumn.

Tap water isotope ratios reflect urban water system structure and dynamics across a semiarid metropolitan area	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Water extraction for anthropogenic use has become a major flux in the hydrological cycle. With increasing demand for water and challenges supplying it in the face of climate change, there is a pressing need to better understand connections between human populations, climate, water extraction, water use, and its impacts. To understand these connections, we collected and analyzed stable isotopic ratios of more than 800 urban tap water samples in a series of semiannual water surveys (spring and fall, 2013-2015) across the Salt Lake Valley (SLV) of northern Utah. Consistent with previous work, we found that mean tap water had a lower H-2 and O-18 concentration than local precipitation, highlighting the importance of nearby montane winter precipitation as source water for the region. However, we observed strong and structured spatiotemporal variation in tap water isotopic compositions across the region which we attribute to complex distribution systems, varying water management practices and multiple sources used across the valley. Water from different sources was not used uniformly throughout the area and we identified significant correlation between water source and demographic parameters including population and income. Isotopic mass balance indicated significant interannual and intra-annual variability in water losses within the distribution network due to evaporation from surface water resources supplying the SLV. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of isotopes as an indicator of water management strategies and climate impacts within regional urban water systems, with potential utility for monitoring, regulation, forensic, and a range of water resource research.					; Jameel, Yusuf/AAA-5382-2020; Good, Stephen/H-4432-2013; Bowen, Gabriel/C-1708-2008; Ehleringer, James/G-1780-2010	jameel, yusuf/0000-0001-8564-4611; Good, Stephen/0000-0003-4363-1577; Brewer, Simon/0000-0002-6810-1911; 													0043-1397	1944-7973				AUG	2016	52	8					5891	5910		10.1002/2016WR019104	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016WR019104													WOS:000383684400010

Italy)	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												We investigated the community structure of freshwater picocyanobacteria (Pcy) in the oligotrophic subalpine Lake Maggiore (Northern Italy) using the least conserved sequences of the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS-1) fragment. The aim was to characterize the succession of Pcy Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) during a seasonal cycle at two environmental niches with distinctive light, temperature and mixing characteristics. ITS fragment length outlined a succession of OTUs from spring to summed; even in the absence of a pronounced spring peak. The vertical partitioning of Pcy OTUs down the water column, more evident in summer, indicates different community composition at the two depths. Redundancy Data Analysis (RDA) was carried out using temperature, pH and depth of mixing layer (Z(m)), which passed the Monte Carlo test (p<0.05). A correlation between axis 1 and temperature, pH and Z(m) of respectively 0.85, 0.64 and 0.61 was found. Our results indicate that lake thermal structure, defined by temperature and Z(m) has a significant influence on the succession of Pcy OTUs and on their dynamics in colonizing different ecological niches in the vertical gradient.

Regional climate influences manure temperature and methane emissions - A pan-Canadian modelling assessment	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												This study explores the variation of liquidmanure temperature (T-m) and CH4 emissions associated with contrasting regional climates, inter-annual weather variation, and manure storage emptying. As a case-study, six regions across Canada were used, spanning 11 degrees 32' latitude and 58 degrees 30' longitude. Annual average air temperatures ranged from 3.9 degrees C (prairie climate) to 10.5 degrees C (maritime climate), with an overall average of 6.6 degrees C. A model predicted Tm over 30 years, using daily weather (1971-2000), and over one "normal" year (30-year average weather). Modelled T-m was then used in Manure-DNDC to model daily CH4 emissions. Twomanure storage emptying scenarios were simulated: (i) early spring and autumn, or (ii) late spring and autumn. Regional differences were evident as average Tm ranged from 8.9 degrees C to 14.6 degrees C across the six locations. Early removal of storedmanure led to warmer Tm in all regions, and the most warming occurred in colder regions. Regional climate had a large effect on CH4 emissions (e.g. 1.8x greater in the pacificmaritime and great lakes regions than the prairie region). Inter-annual weather variability led to substantial variation in inter-annual CH4 emissions, with coefficient of variation being as high as 20%. The large inter-annual range suggests that field measurements of CH4 emissions need to compare the weather during measurements to historical normals. Early manure storage emptying reduced CH4 emissions (vs late removal) in some regions but had little effect or the opposite effect in other regions. Overall, the results from this modelling study suggest: i) Tm differs substantially from air temperature at all locations, ii) accurate estimates of manure storage CH4 emissions require region-specific calculations using T-m (e.g. in emission inventories), iii) field measurements of CH4 emissions need to consider weather conditions relative to climate normal, and iv) emission mitigation practices will require region-specific measurements to determine impacts.

Physical and biological changes to a lengthening stream gradient following a decade of rapid glacial recession	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												In mountains, environmental gradients are steep in both terrestrial and aquatic systems, and climate change is causing upward shifts of physical and biological features of these gradients. Glacial streams are an interesting system to evaluate such shifts both because streams have a linear nature (for simplicity of analysis), and because the stream habitat will at least temporarily lengthen as it follows receding glaciers upward. The Tschierva Glacier, Swiss Alps, receded 482 m upstream from 1997 to 2008. We tested the null hypothesis that the physical and biological stream gradient below this glacier maintained the same structure between these time periods, but simply shifted upward following the glacial source. We compared longitudinal patterns of water temperature and zoobenthic community structure in 1997 and 2007-2008 during three seasons (spring, summer, fall) along the uppermost ca. 5 stream km. Upward shifts were evident, including colonization of the newly exposed stream reaches by cold-adapted taxa, and the appearance in 2007/2008 of four lower-altitude species that were previously absent. Overall, however, results rejected the null hypothesis, instead revealing significant changes in gradient structures. These included a more steeply increasing temperature profile downstream of the glacier and increased amplitude of seasonal community turnover in 2007/2008 vs. 1997. Long-term (1955-2007) flow records revealed increasing short-term and seasonal hydrologic variability, which might have influenced the increased intra-annual community variability. The steepening of the temperature gradient was likely caused by a warming lake-outlet tributary upon which glacial influence was diminished between 1997 and 2007/2008. These results suggest that upward-shifting gradients in glacial streams can involve complex interactions with other landscape elements and that local-scale climate response can progress even more rapidly than the rate of glacial recession.

The eutrophication was mainly driven by sediment phosphorus (P)-release. The external P-loading was in the range of the critical loading for phytoplankton blooms. Hence, the reduction of the internal P loading provided a promising way to reduce cyanobacterial blooms. To mitigate the cyanobacterial blooms, the combination of a low dose flocculant (iron(III)chloride; Flock) and a solid phase phosphate fixative (lanthanum modified bentonite; Lock) was applied in May 2009. This combined approach both removed cyanobacterial biomass from the water column and also intercepted P released from the bottom sediments. Immediately after treatment, the Secchi depth increased from 1.5 m up to 5 m. Sediment P release decreased from 5.2 mg P m(-2) d(-1) (2009) to 0.4 mg P m(-2) d(-1) (2010) but increased in later years. Mean summer concentrations of total P decreased from 0.05 mg L-1 (1992-2008) to 0.02 mg L-1 (2009 -2014) and chlorophyll-a from 16 mu g L-1 (1992-2008) to 6 mu g L-1 (2009-2014). Mean summer Secchi depth increased from 2.31 m (1992-2008) to 3.12 m (2009-2014). The coverage of macrophytes tripled from 2009 to 2011. In the winter of 2010/2011 Planktothrix rubescens bloomed, but cyanobacterial biomass decreased during the summers after the Flock and Lock treatment in comparison to prior years. After the Flock & Lock the bathing water requirements have been fulfilled for six consecutive summers. As the sediment P -release has gradually increased in recent years, there is a risk of a reversion from the present mesotrophic state to a eutrophic state. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

During the winter-spring transition, a low biomass (a parts per thousand 1 g wet weight m(-3)) of fish significantly reduced Daphnia biomass and zooplankton clearance rates and markedly increased the biomass of total phytoplankton, small phytoplankton (GALD < 30 mu m), and large phytoplankton (GALD a parts per thousand yen30 mu m). However, there was no significant effect of Leptodora and no interactive effect from fish and Leptodora on herbivorous zooplankton and phytoplankton. By contrast, exclusion of fish from the enclosures triggered the outbreak of Daphnia and thus resulted in higher zooplankton clearance rates. Algal biomass decreased to a low level in the absence of fish relative to in their presence, particularly during the last 10 days (mean biomass ratio, 1:7-1:36). Our results indicate that fish play a more important role in top-down effects than Leptodora. This study, together with previous research, suggests that fish may prey heavily on large-bodied herbivores, especially Daphnia, in southern China and reduce the chances for top-down control of phytoplankton.

Snow Cover and Spring Flood Flow in the Northern Part of Western Siberia (the Poluy, Nadym, Pur, and Taz Rivers)	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												The paper aims to quantitatively estimate the role of snowmelt in the spring flood flow and the redistribution of river runoff for the northern (Arctic) part of the western Siberian Plain (the rivers Poluy, Nadym, Pur, and Taz). In this region, the presence of wetlands and thermokarst lakes significantly influences the seasonal redistribution of river discharge. First the study region is described, and the snow regime from in situ observations at the Tarko-Sale meteorological station is analyzed. As Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) estimates of snow depth for this region are lower than in situ observations, a correction of the SSM/I snow depth estimates is done using snow parameters measured on the snow transect near the meteorological station Tarko-Sale for 1991-96. This reestimated snow depth is then used to assess the volume of water stored every winter on the watersheds for 1989-2006. This snow product is compared with the spring flood streamflow estimated from in situ observations, and the regional relationship between the snow water storage and flood flow is constructed. The proportion of meltwater that does not reach the main rivers and is thus evaporated or stored by the wetlands is estimated to be on average 30% (varying from 0% to 74%). We observe an increasing trend of this value from 20%-30% in the early 1990s to 50%-60% in the mid-2000s. This increase could be attributed to several factors such as increased air temperature (leading to increased evaporation, changes in vegetation cover, and active layer depth) and also to human activity.

J	Kirby, ME; Patterson, WP; Mullins, HT; Burnett, AW				Kirby, ME; Patterson, WP; Mullins, HT; Burnett, AW			Post-Younger Dryas climate interval linked to circumpolar vortex variability: isotopic evidence from Fayetteville Green Lake, New York	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												The late-Glacial/Holocene transition in the North Atlantic-European sectors has long been known to be a period of rapid climate change. There is, however, a continued need for acquiring and developing paleoclimate archives spanning this interval from continental settings. Here we report on a lacustrine (Fayetteville Green Lake) isotope record sampled at a 10-year resolution from the NE USA over the late-Glacial/Holocene interval (14,600-8000 cat year BP). Based on prior isotopic and hydrologic research from Green Lake, the delta(18)O((calcite)) values predominantly reflect winter moisture source and thus winter atmospheric patterns. Furthermore, we use historic (AD 1948-1980) winter circulation data and delta(18)O(calcite) values from varved sediments to examine the relationship between the circumpolar vortex latitude and isotopes which results in a strong (r = -0.79; r(2) = 0.63) negative relationship. Using the linear regression from the isotopevortex relationship, we model the winter vortex latitude for the late-Glacial/Holocene transition over the NE USA. In addition, we identify an interval from 11,600 to 10,300 cat year BP (the post-Younger Dryas climate interval) wherein the mean winter vortex over the NE USA was expanded by similar to6degrees latitude (similar to36.1degreesN; i.e., similar to630 km) from its mean historic position between AD 1948-1998 (similar to41.8degreesN). Renewal of more vigorous thermohaline circulation following the Younger Dryas cold event may have forced the post.-Younger Dryas climate interval. Increased poleward heat transport due to an active oceanic conveyor would have strengthened the thermal contrast between the NE USA and the North Atlantic thereby enhancing atmospheric pressure gradients and firmly establishing the semi-permanent winter trough over the NE USA. Consequently, storms tracked more frequently up the east coast of the United States from the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic regions delivering precipitation with relatively high delta(18)O values to the NE USA. Alternatively, the relative dominance of seasonal precipitation may have changed resulting in less total winter precipitation (low delta(18)O) causing, lake waters to become relatively enriched in high delta(18)O summer precipitation. Both hypotheses are good candidates for testing by global circulation modeling (GCM). The termination of the post-YD interval at 10,300 cat year BP and the beginning of the Holocene was likely forced by a gradual decrease in thermohaline circulation and poleward heat transport as freshwater input from melting of high-latitude ice sheets increased.

No significant difference was found in the relative capture efficiency between cage and leg-hold traps (P > 0.05). Overall capture efficiency was 1.3 cats per 100 trap-nights, although this varied seasonally, being higher in late autumn and early winter. Most cats were caught with rabbit as bait, and visual and olfactory lures added to baits did not appear to increase capture efficiency, although the power of the test was limited. Most captured cats were adult males weighing 4.37 +/- 0.14 kg; these were larger than the females (3.34 +/- 0.06 kg).

SALT-LAKE-CITY, UTAH AND ST-LOUIS, MISSOURI	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												The behavior of 24 h average concentrations of particulate sulfate was investigated in relation to other aerometric variables for St. Louis and Salt Lake City. These cities were chosen to contrast and compare with Los Angeles [California] and New York [New York], which were reported previously. The observations were examined statistically by a regression analysis of sulfate on principal components (PC) of the other aerometric variables. The PC were associated with implications of the independent effects of atmospheric chemistry and dispersion, pollutant emissions and seasonal variations. The analysis showed major distinctions between sulfate dependence on aerometric variables in the 4 cities. These were interpreted in terms of differences in the influence of air transport, dispersion and atmospheric chemical processes. Sulfate levels in St. Louis were highly correlated with a seasonal photochemical smog component which was similar to that found in Los Angeles and New York City. In the dry climate of Salt Lake City, sulfate formation was a maximum in the winter rather than in the summer and depended mainly on the relation between sources and synoptic meteorological conditions conducive to air stagnation and trapping of pollution beneath a low inversion. The lack of a moist and photochemically related contribution to sulfate variability and the winter sulfate maximum in Salt Lake City suggested that primary sulfate emissions were an influencing factor or the predominant SO2 oxidation process was a heterogeneous one most active in winter air.

Preharvest sprouting and α-amylase activity in soft winter wheat	JOURNAL OF CEREAL SCIENCE												The wheat value chain is vulnerable to reduced grain quality caused by preharvest sprouting. The Great Lakes region and the Pacific Northwest are particularly vulnerable to sprouting related quality issues because precipitation events near or at the time of harvest are common and are the leading cause of sprout related losses. Both visual preharvest sprouting (PHS) and alpha-amylase activity (alpha Amy) influence grain quality. In this study, standardized methods for phenotying PHS and alpha Amy have been implemented in soft winter wheat varieties and advanced breeding lines. The methods utilized here for rating visual PHS and alpha Amy using a scaled down Ceralpha method produce consistent and reliable results across years and can be implemented in screening large wheat breeding populations. The populations phenotyped for PHS and alpha Amy were also genotyped at grain color (R), photoperiod (Ppd), and reduced height (Rht) genes to determine their influence on PHS and alpha Amy. Phenotypic variation for PHS and alpha Amy is present in both soft red and soft white wheat market classes. Soft red winter wheat genotypes were identified that have PHS susceptibility and moderate levels of alpha Amy. Conversely, genotypes of soft white winter wheat were identified that have PHS resistance and low levels of alpha Amy. As variation exists for PHS and alpha Amy in soft wheat germplasm, progress can be made using phenotypic selection for these traits in breeding programs. Development of varieties with improved sprouting resistance will mitigate the risk of sprouting and increase the production of high quality wheat. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Persistence of submerged macrophytes in a drying world: Unravelling the timing and the environmental drivers to produce drought-resistant propagules	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												1. Under a warming scenario many permanent inland water bodies in the Mediterranean region have become temporary ones, so the persistence of submerged macrophytes depends on the timely production of drought- resistant propagules. Phenological research measures the timing of ecological processes and allows the consequences of disturbances such as climate change to be evaluated. 2. Among macrophytes, the charophytes are widely distributed benthic macroalgae and are particularly sensitive to environmental variations. The systems in which they live constitute valuable, threatened, and protected habitats ( European Habitats Directive code 3140). 3. This study established a methodological basis for determining which environmental drivers trigger the sexual reproductive phenology of charophytes. For the first time, circular statistics were applied to describe and compare seasonal patterns for submerged macrophytes. 4. Over a period of 2 years, three charophyte species growing in two Mediterranean brackish ponds were monitored. Most of the sexual reproduction occurred during spring and summer, including the production of drought- resistant propagules, before the harshest conditions arrived. Each species showed a distinctive phenological pattern, according to specific breeding systems, life cycles, and environmental tolerances and requirements. Deeper conditions and higher salinities delayed reproduction. Different rainfall intensities in autumn produced distinctions between years, as stronger rainfall reduced the salinity stress and stimulated the reproduction of plants. 5. Interacting factors act as cues for charophyte reproduction and cause antagonistic effects on propagule production. Among them, the heat required for each phenophase peak is essential for understanding the phenology of a population and for predicting its long- term persistence. 6. Charophytes appear to be good candidates for tracking climate change in shallow ecosystems. Further phenological studies should consider more species, populations, and long- term observations in order to predict climate- change effects on water bodies, and to develop effective plans for management and conservation. 7. Circular statistics is a potential tool for analysing phenology in the context of global warming, as well as for many other conservation issues.

Large-scale atmosphere circulation in the Pacific/ North America (PNA) region reflected a combined signal of La Nina and +NAO. Surface heat flux analysis shows that sensible heat flux contributed most to the net surface heat flux anomaly. Surface air temperature is the dominant factor governing the interannual variability of Great Lakes ice cover. Neither La Nina nor +NAO alone can be responsible for the extreme warmth; the typical mid-latitude response to La Nina events is a negative PNA pattern, which does not have a significant impact on Great Lakes winter climate; the positive phase of NAO is usually associated with moderate warming. When the two occurred simultaneously, the combined effects of La Nina and +NAO resulted in a negative East Pacific pattern with a negative center over Alaska/Western Canada, a positive center in the eastern North Pacific (north of Hawaii), and an enhanced positive center over the eastern and southern United States. The overall pattern prohibited the movement of the Arctic air mass into mid-latitudes and enhanced southerly flow and warm advection from the Gulf of Mexico over the eastern United States and Great Lakes region, leading to the record-breaking low ice cover. It is another climatic pattern that can induce extreme warming in the Great Lakes region in addition to strong El Nino events. A very similar event occurred in the winter of 1999/2000. This extreme warm winter and spring in 2012 had significant impacts on the physical environment, as well as counterintuitive effects on phytoplankton abundance.					; Bratton, John/AAB-3794-2021; Schwab, David/B-7498-2012	Austin, Jay/0000-0002-3580-1794; Lofgren, Brent/0000-0003-2189-0914; Wang, Jia/0000-0003-4154-9721; BRATTON, JOHN/0000-0003-0376-4981; Vanderploeg, Henry/0000-0003-1358-8475; Lenters, John/0000-0002-6895-7592; 													0930-7575	1432-0894				MAR	2015	44	5-6					1187	1213		10.1007/s00382-014-2225-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-014-2225-2													WOS:000350364500002

Gary			Long-term effects of temperature on growth, energy density, whole-body composition and aerobic scope of age-0 Lake sturgeon (A. fulvescens)	AQUACULTURE												Fish are known to show high intraspecific phenotypic variation during early life history. Specifically environmental temperature during early life can result in developmental plasticity, which will influence developmental trajectory and ultimately individual fitness. In the present study, we examined long-term effects of early rearing temperature on growth, energy density, body composition (i.e., whole body glucose, triglyceride and protein concentration) and aerobic scope of age-0 Lake Sturgeon (A. fulvescens) to determine if temperature manipulation after yolk absorption would have a long-term impact on these traits. At 58 days post hatch, fish were subjected to one of three temperature manipulations (16 degrees C; control, 18 degrees C and ambient river temperature in a range of 14.0-19.4 degrees C; Ambient) for 35 days after which all fish were raised in Ambient conditions until 360 days post hatch, including 4 months of natural winter temperatures. We hypothesized that temperature conditions experienced before the first winter of life would result in short-term effects of improved growth and energy reserves. Our results showed that temperature manipulation may result in a short-term, reversible effect of improved growth prior to overwintering without a longer-term effect on growth. Enhanced somatic growth of total length and body mass prior to winter did not translate into improved energy reserves, and observed differences in growth rate between treatments did not correlate with aerobic scope. Our data demonstrate that a subtle change in temperature during early life history in Lake Sturgeon may result in short term positive effects on growth rate. These data may enhance current conservation aquaculture operations to promote winter survival in fall released fingerlings without long-term implications on growth phenotypes.

The rather narrow range of delta(87)Sr from lake water (1.1 to 2.1) and groundwater (0.9 to 1.7) indicates that the groundwater is generally unradiogenic. Groundwater residence times and relatively unradiogenic volcanic ash within the dune sediments control the delta(87)Sr values. Based on the mutual variations of delta(18)O and delta D, the lakes can be divided into three groups. In Group 1, both delta(18)O and delta D values increase from spring to fall, The delta(18)O and 6D values in Group 2 decreased from spring to fall. Group 3 are ephemeral lakes that went dry some time during 1992. The data and isotopic modeling show that variations in the ratio of evaporation relative to groundwater inflow, local humidity conditions, and the delta(a) has substantial influence on the isotopic composition. In addition, isotopic behavior in ephemeral lakes can be rather unusual because of the changing activities of water and mineral precipitation and redissolution. The annual and interannual isotopic variability of these lakes which is reflected in the paleonvironmental indicators may be the rule rather than the exception in these types of systems.																			0921-2728					JAN	1997	17	1					51	65		10.1023/A:1007913010057	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1007913010057													WOS:A1997WK96500006

Whole-lake nitrate addition for control of methylmercury in mercury-contaminated Onondaga Lake, NY	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH					10th International Conference on Mercury as a Global Pollutant	JUL 24-28, 2011	Halifax, CANADA					Methylmercury (MeHg) strongly bioaccumulates in aquatic food webs resulting in exposure to humans and wildlife through consumption of fish. Production of MeHg is promoted by anaerobic conditions and the supply of inorganic Hg (Hg2+), sulfate (SO42-), and labile organic carbon. The anaerobic sediments of stratified lakes are particularly active zones for methylation of Hg2+ and can be an important source of MeHg to the water column during summer anoxia and fall turnover. Nitrate (NO3-) addition has recently been proposed as a novel approach for the control of MeHg accumulation in the hypolimnia of Hg-contaminated lakes. In 2011, a whole-lake NO3- addition pilot test was conducted in Hg-contaminated Onondaga Lake, NY with the objective of limiting release of MeHg from the pelagic sediments to the hypolimnion through maintenance of NO3--N concentrations >1 mg NIL A liquid calcium-nitrate solution was added to the hypolimnion as a neutrally buoyant plume approximately three times per week during the summer stratification interval. Maximum hypolimnetic concentrations of MeHg and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) decreased 94% and 95% from 2009 levels, suggesting increased sorption to Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides in surficial sediments as the regulating mechanism. Increased MeHg concentrations in the upper waters during fall turnover, which had been a generally recurring pattern, did not occur in 2011, resulting in decreased exposure of aquatic organisms to MeHg. Over the 1992-2011 interval, the hypolimnetic NO3- supply explained 85% and 95% of the interannual variations in hypolimnetic accumulations of SRP and MeHg, respectively. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Radar reflectivity measures serve as an index to bird density and have been used to quantitatively map landbird distributions during migratory stopover by sampling birds aloft at the onset of nocturnal migratory flights. Our objective was to further develop and validate a similar approach for mapping wintering waterfowl distributions using weather surveillance radar observations at the onset of evening flights. We evaluated data from the Sacramento, CA radar (KDAX) during winters 1998-1999 and 1999-2000. We determined an optimal sampling time by evaluating the accuracy and precision of radar observations at different times during the onset of evening flight relative to observed diurnal distributions of radio-marked birds on the ground. The mean time of evening flight initiation occurred 23 min after sunset with the strongest correlations between reflectivity and waterfowl density on the ground occurring almost immediately after flight initiation. Radar measures became more spatially homogeneous as evening flight progressed because birds dispersed from their departure locations. Radars effectively detected birds to a mean maximum range of 83 km during the first 20 min of evening flight. Using a sun elevation angle of -5 degrees (28 min after sunset) as our optimal sampling time, we validated our approach using KDAX data and additional data from the Beale Air Force Base, CA (KBBX) radar during winter 1998-1999. Bias-adjusted radar reflectivity of waterfowl aloft was positively related to the observed diurnal density of radio-marked waterfowl locations on the ground. Thus, weather radars provide accurate measures of relative wintering waterfowl density that can be used to comprehensively map their distributions over large spatial extents.					; Buler, Jeffrey/H-3207-2019	Buler, Jeffrey/0000-0002-2696-847X; Bogart, Tianna/0000-0003-0296-8798													1932-6203					JUL 23	2012	7	7							e41571	10.1371/journal.pone.0041571	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0041571								22911816					WOS:000306687700114

Estimation of the albedo becomes especially important in spring when the reflectivity of the ice-covered lakes differs markedly from the surrounding snow-free surface. The measurements of the snow and ice albedo in situ are necessary to ensure adequate analysis of remote sensing data and monitoring of the state of the land ice. A wide range of surface albedo of small boreal ice-covered Lake Vendyurskoe (North-Western Russia) is calculated from observational data of solar radiation obtained in 1995-2000 and 2002-2017. A noticeable variability of albedo due to spring melting and changes in weather conditions is described. Climatic variability (North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, the average monthly air temperature and sum of precipitation in December-March) is analyzed in the context of possible influence on the maximal thickness of snow and white ice, and, consequently, on the spring lake albedo dynamics. In current work to estimate the external heat flux that comes from the atmosphere to the surface of the lake and presumably determines the dynamics of albedo during spring melting, a simple parameter was used: the accumulated sum of positive temperatures, starting from March 1. The obtained prognostic equation of the cubic dependence of albedo on the named parameter demonstrates a different rate of albedo decrease in the melting of snow, white, and congelation ice.

Understanding the governing factors of cyanobacterial blooms is critical for taking timely and effective action during this key eutrophication-transition period. However, long-term records of cyanobacterial bloom and its key dominating factors remain unclear. It is, therefore, essential to understand the bloom dynamics and the driving forces before any control strategies can be determined. We investigated the cyanobacterial phycocyanin concentration variability based on satellite observations from 2003 to 2019, by using the empirical orthogonal function analysis. We observed a decrease in the coverage of the dominant mode of variability in phycocyanin magnitudes compared to the period 2003 to 2011, with variations primarily occurring in the northern bays. The largest variability was identified to be predominant in July, and an apparent timing shift in variability was observed in December 2016 and 2017. The 95% quantile regression model indicated a distinct upper boundary response in cyanobacteria proliferation to the joint Total Nitrogen (TN) and Total Phosphorus (TP) concentrations, which occurred in summer from 2003 to 2011. An apparent response of cyanobacterial bloom to TP was observed during the winters from 2016 to 2019. Additionally, water level and TN: TP ratio played a central role in summer from 2003 to 2011, while from 2016 to 2019, TN: TP ratio was found to dominate in the summer months. In winter, air temperature turned out to be a significant modulating factor compared to water level. Our results suggest that implementing a phosphorus reduction strategy, while controlling TN: TP ratio and suitable water level manipulation, should be considered to ensure the sustainability of Lake Erhai, especially under a consistent global warming scenario.

Past lake-level changes are assessed from sedimentological, pollen and macrofossil records from a single shallow-water core from Lac Hertel, which lies in the central part of the studied area. Three low lake-level phases are recognised: prior to 8000, 7600-6600 and 4800-3400 cal. BP. The modern analogue method is applied to pollen data from seven well-dated sites from the St. Lawrence lowlands and adjacent mountain areas, constrained and unconstrained by lake-level changes. The reconstructed climate changes are congruent with the pattern of climate changes known from eastern North America: a dry and cold late-glacial episode due to the presence of pro-glacial lakes and seas; a rapid warming between 12500 and 11 000 cal. BP possibly caused by increasing summer insolation; a dry period from 10 000 to 6500 cal. BP; a brief cooling between 9000 and 8000 cal. BP, possibly related to a summer cooling of Arctic airmasses; a temperature maximum around 8000 cal. BP; and finally, a progressive decrease in summer temperature and an increase in (winter?) precipitation over the 4500 last years. These results show that it is possible to reveal seasonal patterns in climate by combining pollen and lake-level data. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

According to the Flood Pulse Concept, the flood pulses are not considered to be a disturbance, while some recent studies have proven that floods can be a disturbance factor of phytoplankton development. In order to test whether flooding acts as a disturbance factor in the shallow Danubian floodplain lake (Lake Sakadas), phytoplankton dynamics was investigated during two different hydrological years-extremely dry (2003) without flooding and usually flooded (2004). A total of 18 phytoplankton functional groups were established. The sequence of phytoplankton seasonality can be summarized P/D -> E (W1, W2) -> C/P (only in potamophase) -> S2/H1/S-N/S1 -> W1/W2 -> P/D. The canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) demonstrated that the water level was a significant environmental variable in 2004. Due to the higher total biomass of Bacillariophyceae established under potamophase conditions, floodings in the early spring seem to be a stimulating factor for phytoplankton development. On the other hand, the flood pulses in May and June had dilution effects on nutrients, so that a significantly lower phytoplankton biomass was established indicating that flooding pulses can be regarded as a disturbance event. Such conditions supported diatom development (D, P, C species) and prolonged its dominance in the total phytoplankton biomass. A long-lasting Cyanoprokaryota bloom (various filamentous species-S1, S2, S-N and H1 representatives) with very high biomass characterized the limnophase (dry conditions) in summer and autumn of both years. In-lake variables (lake morphology, internal loadings of nutrients from sediments, light conditions) seem to be important for the appearance of Cyanoprokaryota bloom. The equilibrium phase was found during the Cyanoprokaryota bloom only in the extremely dry year. This study showed that depending on the time scale occurrence, flood pulses can be a stimulating or a disturbance factor for phytoplankton development in Lake Sakadas.

Runoff inputs, particularly from a glaciated catchment, and gas absorption were major sources of many OCs. Losses by volatilization, outflow, and sedimentation were also important transport pathways for most OCs. We observed a net deposition of hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) and DDT to Bow Lake by gas exchange, whereas hexachlorobenzene, chlordanes, and most polychlorinated biphenyls were seen to volatilize to the air. The insecticide lindane (gamma HCH), widely applied across Canada as a seed dressing in early spring, was absorbed by Bow Lake in early summer but gradually equilibrated with water as the summer progressed. This was the result of lower concentrations of gamma HCH in air and rising air temperatures in late summer. Results indicate that glacially derived tributary inputs are dominant sources of persistent organic pollutants to these glacier-fed mountain lakes and corroborates recent evidence of OC contamination in glacially derived aquatic systems.

Evaluating historical trends and influences of meteorological and seasonal climate conditions on lake chlorophyll a using remote sensing	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Hansen CH, Burian SJ, Dennison PE, Williams GP. 2019. Evaluating historical trends and influences of meteoorological and seasonal climate conditions on lake chlorophyll a using remote sensing. Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XX-XX. Evaluations of long-term water quality trends and patterns in lakes and reservoirs are often inhibited by irregular historical records. This study uses historical Landsat satellite imagery to construct a more complete historical record of algal biomass (measured via chlorophyll a [Chl-a]) and presents a framework for developing seasonal algal estimation models using open source tools for processing and model development. This approach is both physically based (using observed patterns of variability and algal succession in the lake) and data driven (relying on statistical methods for model development). We use a generalized linear regression modeling technique to develop lake-specific, seasonal models for each lake in the multilake Great Salt Lake system in Utah. The 32-yr constructed history of estimated Chl-a enables analysis of long-term trends within the lake system as well as evaluations of local climate influences on Chl-a concentrations. The estimated historical record exhibits a shift in seasonality (i.e., maximum Chl-a occurs earlier in the growing season), as well as increasing trends of extreme Chl-a concentrations. We also evaluated relationships between meteorological conditions and Chl-a using the enhanced historical record and found localized sensitivity to short-term weather events such as high wind, high temperatures, or precipitation events. Seasonal climate conditions including high winter precipitation, summer temperatures, and early spring snow water equivalent are consistent with higher Chl-a extremes in the historical record. Improved understanding of the trends and climate influences provides useful context and guidance for future monitoring efforts and management strategies.

One lake treated with hypolimnetic aeration was compared with an untreated lake. Abundances of heterotrophic flagellates ranged from 150 to 6370 ind./cm(3) and were significantly higher in the upper zone of the lake (0 - 4 in depth) than in the lower zone (7-14 m). Only minor variations were observed between the sampling dates in winter, spring and summer regarding both total abundance and structure of the benthic community. Bodonids and euglenids formed the major part of HF in numbers and biomass. Other groups such as chrysomonads, thaumatomastigids and other representatives of Protista incertae sedis were of minor importance. Diplomonads including anaerobic species were mainly observed in the proftindal. Among the abiotic parameters, we assume oxygen concentration as the driving factor in determining the total flagellate abundances, but strong interactions between other sediment parameters inhibit a clear analysis of single effects. In a short-term experiment with artificial aeration of profundal sediments, the flagellate densities strongly increased for 15 days subsequent to growing bacteria numbers, but returned to the initial values after three weeks.

Here, we study the impact of environmental stress on seasonal growth dynamics and productivity of yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britton) and sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) in the Great Lakes, St Lawrence forest region of Ontario. Specifically, we research the effects of a spring heat wave in 2010, and a summer drought in 2012 that occurred during the 2005-14 study period. We evaluated both growth phenology (onset, cessation, duration of radial growth, time of maximum daily growth rate) and productivity (monthly and seasonal average growth rates, maximum daily growth rate, tree-ring width) and tested for differences and interactions among species and years. Productivity of sugar maple was drastically compromised by a 3-day spring heat wave in 2010 as indicated by low growth rates, very early growth cessation and a lagged growth onset in the following year. Sugar maple also responded more sensitively than yellow birch to a prolonged drought period in July 2012, but final tree-ring width was not significantly reduced due to positive responses to above-average temperatures in the preceding spring. We conclude that sugar maple, a species that currently dominates northern hardwood forests, is vulnerable to heat wave disturbances during leaf expansion, which might occur more frequently under anticipated climate change.

Long term nutrient loads and chlorophyll dynamics in a large temperate Australian lagoon system affected by recurring blooms of cyanobacteria	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												While rare globally, blooms of the toxic cyanobacteria Nodularia spumigena are a recurring problem in a few estuaries, such as the Baltic Sea and several southern Australian estuaries. Here, we document recurring Nodularia spumigena Mertens blooms in the Gippsland Lakes, S.E. Australia; a temperate lagoon system with episodic, winter-spring dominated catchment inflows. Physico-chemical conditions exerted a strong influence over bloom development, with blooms consistently occurring at surface water salinities between 9 and 20 (average = 15), inorganic nitrogen concentrations < 0.4 mu M, and inorganic nitrogen to reactive phosphorus ratios < 5. There was a positive correlation between average annual chlorophyll a and total phosphorus (TP) load in years when there was no Nodularia bloom, but this relationship broke down in Nodularia bloom years, even though there was a strong correlation between in-lake TP and chlorophyll a during these years; this highlights the importance of internal sources of phosphorus to bloom development. Large catchment derived nitrate and nitrite (NOx) inputs following wildfires and floods in 2007, led to high concentrations of NOx within the surface waters of the Gippsland Lakes through the second half of 2007 and the start of 2008. We hypothesise that these high NOx concentrations were a key factor leading to an unprecedented Synechococcus sp. bloom that developed in the austral summer of 2007-2008, despite conditions that would otherwise favour a Nodularia bloom.

Controlling Cyanobacterial Blooms in Hypertrophic Lake Taihu, China: Will Nitrogen Reductions Cause Replacement of Non-N2 Fixing by N2 Fixing Taxa?	PLOS ONE												Excessive anthropogenic nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) inputs have caused an alarming increase in harmful cyanobacterial blooms, threatening sustainability of lakes and reservoirs worldwide. Hypertrophic Lake Taihu, China's third largest freshwater lake, typifies this predicament, with toxic blooms of the non-N-2 fixing cyanobacteria Microcystis spp. dominating from spring through fall. Previous studies indicate N and P reductions are needed to reduce bloom magnitude and duration. However, N reductions may encourage replacement of non-N-2 fixing with N-2 fixing cyanobacteria. This potentially counterproductive scenario was evaluated using replicate, large (1000 L), in-lake mesocosms during summer bloom periods. N+P additions led to maximum phytoplankton production. Phosphorus enrichment, which promoted N limitation, resulted in increases in N-2 fixing taxa (Anabaena spp.), but it did not lead to significant replacement of non-N-2 fixing with N-2 fixing cyanobacteria, and N-2 fixation rates remained ecologically insignificant. Furthermore, P enrichment failed to increase phytoplankton production relative to controls, indicating that N was the most limiting nutrient throughout this period. We propose that Microcystis spp. and other non-N-2 fixing genera can maintain dominance in this shallow, highly turbid, nutrient-enriched lake by outcompeting N-2 fixing taxa for existing sources of N and P stored and cycled in the lake. To bring Taihu and other hypertrophic systems below the bloom threshold, both N and P reductions will be needed until the legacy of high N and P loading and sediment nutrient storage in these systems is depleted. At that point, a more exclusive focus on P reductions may be feasible.

Effect of moisture and temperature variation on DOC release from a peatland: Conflicting results from laboratory, field and historical data analysis	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Peatlands are large repositories of atmospheric carbon and concern has been raised over the stability of this carbon store because increasing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations have been observed in peatland drainage waters. A number of potential causes have been proposed in the literature, and conflicting results among studies conducted at different spatial and temporal scales suggest that the methodological approach may be an important confounding factor. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of moisture and temperature on DOC release from a south-central Ontario peatland during the fall (a major export period) following three commonly used approaches: laboratory microcosms. an intensive field study and analysis of long-term data (1980-2008). The effect of variations in temperature and moisture differed among microcosm, field study and analysis of the long-term record. Water content was important at the microcosm scale as DOC concentration and aromaticity increased with peat water-saturation. Drought caused a decrease in DOC concentration and pH, and an increase in sulphate and base cation concentrations. In contrast, the field study indicated that DOC concentration was strongly associated with temperature, and weakly correlated (negatively) with stream discharge. Average fall DOC concentration (but not export) increased over the 29 year record, and was correlated with fall discharge and precipitation (negative) and summer precipitation and fall stream pH (positive). As no common strong predictor of fall DOC was found at three scales of investigation at a single, well-studied site, it may be unreasonable to expect to identify a universal driver behind the widespread increase in DOC concentration.

During late-glacial time, a perennial lake expanded at Maliq. It was surrounded by a complex vegetation association composed of steppe and mixed forest elements. The highly diverse forest flora suggest that late-glacial forest refugia were more developed here at middle altitude, rather than at higher altitude as previously suggested. The forest developed after 9800 yr B.P., while the water level remained high in the Korce basin until 5000 yr B.P. Different environmental conditions, characterized by lower available moisture and warmer winters, progressively took place after this date. Human activity in the Korce basin ca. 4500 yr B.P. was coeval with conditions characterized by an increase in winter temperatures and a decrease in summer moisture.

Vegetated sediments from the littoral zone (55 % of lake area) were compared to unvegetated sediments from the littoral and profundal zone. Clear effects of the isoetids were found on DIN in the porewater. At the vegetated station, NH4+ showed the highest concentrations just below the surface (< 40 muM) whereas NO3- was dominating below 5 cm depth with concentrations up to 100 muM during the spring. The unvegetated littoral sediment showed a distinct change between winter where NH4+ dominated and summer where NO3- was most abundant. NH4+ dominated in the profundal sediment and showed increasing concentration with depth. The Eh was high (> 400 mV) in the vegetated sediment, indicating isoetid release of O2 in the rhizosphere. A low DIN uptake was observed at the vegetated station while, based on porewater data, a diffusive release from the sediment was expected. This difference was due to plant assimilation. In general a release of NH4+ and an uptake of NO3- was seen in all sediments. The denitrification rate calculated from the mass balance for the entire lake was 0.4 mmol m-2 d-1 and accounted for removal of 77 % of the annual N-input to Lake Kvie.																			0018-8158					FEB 25	1994	275						255	265		10.1007/BF00026716	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00026716													WOS:A1994NB19800023

The vertical distribution and seasonal changes of DOM and its fractions were evaluated. The concentrations of DOM, HoA and Hi in surface water samples from Lake Biwa tended to be high in the summer and low in the winter. In the Summer, the concentrations of DOM, HoA and Hi varied greatly in the lake thermocline (depth 10 similar to 20 m). The increase in the concentrations of DOM, HoA and Hi in Lake Biwa during the warm season may be attributed to algal DOM. The trihalomethane (THM) formation potential of water samples collected from Lake Biwa was high at a depth of 10 m and 35 similar to 40 mu g L(-1) at depths lower than 20 m. The THM formation potential per organic carbon unit of algal DOM was larger than that of soil humic Substances, and its order was as follows : Microcystis aeruginosa > Cryptomonas ovata > Staurastrum dorcidentiferum.

For the Crater Lake samples, the data have been segregated using 10 day back isentropic trajectories to evaluate the role of transport. Our analysis of the segregated data indicates that the trajectories can successfully separate "locally influenced" from "marine background" aerosol, but are not able to identify a significant difference in the mean concentrations during marine vs Asian transport pathways. The background marine aerosol has an annual mean and median concentrations of 2.0 and 1.5 mug m(-3), respectively, for particles less than 2.5 mum diameter. There is a seasonal pattern in all components of the aerosol mass, with a summer maximum and winter minimum. This pattern is most likely due to the strong seasonal pattern in precipitation, which peaks in winter, combined with enhanced sources in summer. The Crater Lake marine aerosol composition is dominated by organics (similar to40% by mass), with smaller contributions from sulfates, mineral dust and elemental carbon. Analysis of the background marine aerosol found no apparent trend since 1988. This is in contrast to results reported by Prospero et al. (J. Geophys. Res. 108 (2003) 4019) for nss-SO42- samples from Midway Island in the North Pacific. Comparison of the mean concentrations for each site shows that the Midway samples are significantly more influenced by Asian industrial sources of sulfur, compared to Crater Lake, which implies a substantial loss of nss-SO42- from Asian sources that occurs during transit across the Pacific to Crater Lake due to precipitation scavenging.

Nevertheless, while the role of DMS and MeSH remains largely uncertain in inland regions, learning about dimethyl disulfide (DMDS, CH3 SSCH3 ) is also limited. In this study, we measured atmospheric DMS, MeSH and DMDS in winter, from 19 December 2022 to 30 January 2023, and spring, from 24 April to 2 June 2023 with a Vocus proton-transfer-reaction time-offlight mass spectrometer (Vocus PTR-TOF) at the Dianshan Lake (DSL) Air Quality Monitoring Supersite in a suburban area of Shanghai, China. The mixing ratios of DMS, MeSH and DMDS exhibited clear diurnal cycles, and were characterized by average and interquartile range values of 22.6 (10.1-29.7), 14.9 (6.5-19.4) and 9.8 (6.0-10.7) pptv, respectively, in the spring campaign, which are approximately twice as high as those in winter. MeSH and DMDS were found to be well correlated with DMS in the two campaigns. Wind analysis suggests that three reduced-sulfur compounds owned common sources from the DSL. Furthermore, the sulfur dioxide (SO2 ) production quantity from the three reduced-sulfur compounds over the DSL in May 2023 was estimated to be 1.42 +/- 0.74 t with 84.8 % originating from DMDS, which was comparable to the monthly SO2 emissions from ships over the DSL. Our results highlight the prominent role of atmospheric DMDS in SO2 production when compared to DMS and MeSH in the suburban area of Shanghai, soliciting further investigation and consideration of DMDS in the sulfur budget.

Two surveys, one in summer and another in winter, involving a total of eight sampling stations were conducted to study the seasonal variation of the remobilization characteristics of these trace metals in the mudflat sediment. The range of depth averaged concentration of these trace metals in the mudflat sediment was: 0.3-0.8 mug/g (Cd); 9.891.0 mug/g (Cr); 7.3-69.1 mug/g (Ph); and 39.5-192.0 mug/g (Zn), while that in the sediment porewater was: 0.3121.1 mug/l (Cd); 3.0-27041 mug/l (Cr); 2.6-105.6 mug/l (Pb); and 32.6-4238.3 mug/l (Zn). In general, levels of dissolved trace metals in the sediment porewater were much higher in the summer than in the winter while their concentrations in the sediment were more or less the same throughout the year. Enrichment of Cd, Pb and Zn in the sediment porewater of the upper oxic layer and that of Cr in the oxic-sub-oxic boundary was generally observed. Regions in the vicinity of the Mai Po mangroves and the river mouths of Shenzhen River and Shan Pui River were found to be hotspots of trace metal pollution. Benthic diffusive fluxes of trace metals from the mudflat sediment were also estimated. Of the four trace metals, cadmium showed the greatest tendency toward remobilization from the sediment phase to the more bio-available porewater phase. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Tyrell; Baer, Jan; Roesch, Roland; Brinker, Alexander			Turning summer into winter: nutrient dynamics, temperature, density dependence and invasive species drive bioenergetic processes and growth of a keystone coldwater fish	OIKOS												A combination of global changes such as species invasions, climate change and nutrient pollution have altered ecosystems, food webs and the bioenergetic processes that control growth. These changes are especially pronounced in freshwater ecosystems and often lead to rapid variation in fish growth and dependent ecosystems services such as fishery yield. Understanding the mechanisms driving growth responses to environmental change is important for interpreting past dynamics and sustainably managing ecosystems. This study uses integrated bioenergetics and growth modeling to understand how nutrient dynamics, species invasions and changing temperatures have altered growth of the keystone pelagic whitefish Coregonus wartmanni in Lake Constance, Germany from 1925 to 2020. Growth variation was modeled by allowing covariates to alter temperature-dependent consumption, while size-specific metabolism varied only with temperature. Consumption and growth increased strongly to a maximum with phosphorous, and this effect was stronger when intraspecific competition (measured as whitefish biomass) was low. Increasing whitefish biomass reduced growth under mesotrophic conditions, but had no effect under oligotrophic conditions. In contrast, increasing competition with invasive three-spined stickleback Gasteosteus aculeauts was predicted to reduce growth even under oligotrophic conditions. The invasion has effectively turned summer into winter for whitefish, with older fish ceasing to grow and younger fish losing up to 10% of their body weight during the normal growing season in subsequent years. Warming is predicted to further reduce whitefish growth due to competition with invasive stickleback, which would further alter zooplankton food availability and reduce already low fishery yields. These results demonstrate the importance of considering biotic interactions and synergistic effects in global change studies, as well as the value of mechanistic based models for understanding effects. Similar growth responses to ecosystem change are likely within and across ecosystems, and bioenergetic models can help understand effects to support informed ecosystem management.

In order to manage floods caused by short-term rainfall in the region, it is very important to study short-term precipitation. The spatial scale is the area of East Azerbaijan province in the east of Lake Urmia in Iran. The period of this study is spring and summer 2017 in the region (21/3/2017-9/22/2017). To compare precipitation products with recorded precipitation of synoptic stations, 6 statistical indices, 6 dichotomous indices, and diurnal cycles have been used. The results of this study showed that the TRMM_3B42 (V7) satellite precipitation product is underestimated and the GPM-IMERG (V06) satellite precipitation product is much overestimated. However, in terms of statistical and dichotomous indices, the satellite precipitation product TRMM_3B42 (V7), especially at the spatial scale of the whole area, is much better than the GPM-IMERG (V06) product in the study area. The results of this study will be useful for both developers and users of satellite precipitation products.					; mahdavi, taghi/AAR-3352-2021	Mahdavi, Taghi/0000-0002-3003-0142; 													0255-660X	0974-3006				JAN	2023	51	1					43	60		10.1007/s12524-022-01620-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-022-01620-w		NOV 2022											WOS:000882347000002

We collected Pectinatella magnifica during the summer at Kahokugata Lake and Makiyama agricultural reservoir pond in June and July 2016. However, scientific data for the statoblasts of Pectinatella magnifica are limited. Our results for scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analyses of Pectinatella magnifica indicated immobilization of the chemical elements that were involved in the mass during the summer. We also reported the characterization of an invasive species of bryozoan (Pectinatella magnifica) in lakes and ponds in Ishikawa, Japan, based on field observations in 2016. We studied the microstructure, mineralogy, chemical composition, and radioactivity associated with these organisms, using a combination of micro-techniques, SEM-EDS, associated with ICP-MS, and XRD. This study aims to illustrate the capability of Pectinatella magnifica to produce minerals within statoblasts and gelatinous material. Obtained results may indicate forming quartz, palygorskite, dolomite, bischofite, pyrolusite, and pyrite, associated with native sulfur and copper in the statoblast. The mass of gelatinous material contains talc and vermiculite as well as non-crystalline phase. The mechanism of biomineral formation has important implications for water-mineral-organism or microorganism interactions both in lower drainage basin systems, such as Kahokugata Lake, and upper water areas, such as Makiyama agricultural reservoir pond. Many types with variety of sizes and shapes of bryozoan (Pectinatella magnifica) were found in lakes and ponds in Japan. The biomineralization systems will be made available for use not only in researching bryozoans (Pectinatella magnifica), but also for environmental change systems from upstream to downstream of the lake. To date, there have been no reports on related electron microscopy observations, including the real-life occurrence of bioremediation. These observations could lead to simple methods of removing statoblasts of the invasive alien species Pectinatella magnifica from agricultural and reservoir environments, because there was limited microbial immobilization of the ions during the winter.																			2075-163X					JUN	2018	8	6							242	10.3390/min8060242	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/min8060242													WOS:000436503200022

The efficiency of the active substance in the spray solutions could be affected by the quality of the used water, whose composition is related to its source (e.g., rain, river, stream, lake, tap and ground water) and sampling season (spring-autumn). Temperature and pH, as well as other water quality parameters, could significantly affect the pesticide stability in spray by promoting the pesticide degradation rate. This review aims to summarize and discuss degradation data of three widely used organophosphorus insecticides (malathion, diazinon and chlorpyrifos) in different types of water in order to emphasize the influence of different water types on their degradation. This review also reveals a lack of studies that can confirm the effect of other water quality parameters, except temperature and pH, on the stability of pesticides susceptible to hydrolysis.

Surface DOC ranged between 1.56 and 3.10 mg l 1, being 2.5 times higher than the long-term (1989-2017) average for the same area. Such enlarged concentration of DOC, typical for eutrophic lagoons or lakes and not for open waters, was most probably a consequence of an intensive bloom of Mnemiopsis leidyi, which was recorded with an exceptionally high population density (up to 76 ind. m 3) in the same waters. The number of jelly combs showed a decrease from the east (SJ107) to the west (SJ101) of the transect (Graphical abstract). Abundance in the central part of the transect was also quite low. Maximum of DOC corresponded with the abundance of the M. leidyi smallest specimens (<3 cm). At the western station of the same profile (SJ101), M. leidyi abundance was insignificant, and DOC concentration appeared to be controlled by seasonal changes in primary production and grazing activities. In contrast, at the eastern station (SJ107), changes in the complex food web interaction shaped the DOC quantity and quality. A large fraction of DOC at both stations was found to be reactive, significantly contributing to the organic matter pool represented by surface-active substances (SAS). A large anticyclonic gyre which developed from April to November in 2017 in the area of SJ107, supported calm water column conditions and abundant resources of zooplankton, which could support the residence and accumulation of the invasive ctenophore M. leidyi. For the first time, the presence of a long-lasting gyre (duration of at least 4 months) is documented both with hydrographic measurements and by numerical modelling. Such a situation characterised by the production of highly reactive DOC leads to an extreme eutrophic episode. A dispersion model indicated a high probability of M. leidyi spreading by the end of winter from the Venice Lagoon, its hypothetical winter residing area, to the Istrian coast (Croatia).					ciglenecki, irena/N-8792-2013; Čanković, Milan/AAE-8702-2020; Njire, Jakica/KEH-9001-2024; Paliaga, Paolo/AAW-6830-2021; Maric Pfannkuchen, Daniela/AAE-3298-2022; Kraus, Romina/AAS-7754-2021	Paliaga, Paolo/0000-0003-2189-3154; Ciglenecki, Irena/0000-0002-1873-6193; Cankovic, Milan/0000-0002-1679-8147													0924-7963	1879-1573				OCT	2021	222									10.1016/j.jmarsys.2021.103599	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmarsys.2021.103599													WOS:000944885500001

Spring-time humus water reduced the bioconcentration factors for both the 2,4,6-trichlorophenol and lindane about 18 percent compared to lake water. No reduction in the bioconcentration factor was observed for tetrachloroguaiacol. Autumn humus water reduced the bioconcentration factor of 2,4'',5-trichlorobiphenyl 30 percent compared to lake water, while no reduction was observed for lindane. The results have shown that natural humus water can reduce the bioavailability of organic micropollutants towards fish.

Geographic range and cold hardiness of the earthworm Drawida ghilarovi (Oligochaeta, Moniligastridae)	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												The earthworm Drawida ghilarovi Gates 1969 is a typical representative of the Amur fauna and the only species of the tropic family Moniligastridae on the territory of Russia. The northern boundary of its range passes from the Khingan (Hinggan) River on the west, along the mountain framing of the Amur plains, to Evoron Lake (or, probably, to the Amgun River valley) on the east. Drawida ghilarovi is widespread in the Sikhote Alin, but the northern boundary of its distribution in the northern part of this mountain range has not been delimited; the same applies to the left bank of the Amur downstream of Komsomolsk-on-Amur and its lower reaches. These earthworms lay cocoons in summer in the surface soil horizon (0-20 cm) and overwinter also at a depth of only 15-20 cm, although D. ghilarovi is classified as an anecic (deep burrower) species (Vsevolodova-Perel, 1997). The median lethal temperature (LT(50%)) is about -15A degrees C for cocoons and -12A degrees C for worms; the minimum tolerable temperature, about -20 and -16A degrees C, respectively. The mechanism of protection against freezing in cocoons involves a decrease in water content from an average of 71.1 +/- 0.8% to a minimum of 39.8%; this decrease in worms is less significant: from 85.5 +/- 0.8% (feeding worms) to 75.3 +/- 0.7% (wintering worms). Since the development of juveniles in cocoons is completed by autumn, the critical factor is the minimum temperature to which the worms are exposed. In woodless areas near Khabarovsk, the average soil temperature at a depth of 40 cm during the coldest month is only 2-3A degrees C higher than LT(50%) (the difference is greater in forest habitats), and the minimal temperature should be still lower. Under current climatic conditions, D. ghilarovi could have inhabited the area extending over the Zeya River basin and, in the north, to the sources of left-bank tributaries of the middle and lower reaches of the Amur (not everywhere, but in the warmest habitats). The present-day boundaries of the D. ghilarovi appear to reflect past changes in climatic and soil conditions.																			1062-3590					DEC	2010	37	9					895	904		10.1134/S1062359010090049	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1062359010090049													WOS:000286202900004

The genetic structure of an Antarctic lake viral community revealed unexpected genetic richness distributed across the highest number of viral families that have been found to date in aquatic viral metagenomes. In contrast to other known aquatic viromes, which are dominated by bacteriophage sequences, this Antarctic virus assemblage had a large proportion of sequences related to eukaryotic viruses, including phycodnaviruses and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses not previously identified in aquatic environments. We also observed that the transition from an ice-covered lake in spring to an open-water lake in summer led to a change from a ssDNA- to a double-stranded DNA-virus-dominated assemblage, possibly reflecting a seasonal shift in host organisms.

J	Hutchinson, GE				Hutchinson, GE			Limnological studies in Connecticut. VII. A critical examination of the supposed relationship between phytoplankton periodicity and chemical changes in lake waters	ECOLOGY												The appearance of Dinobryon divergens in the spring in Linsley Pond is correlated with a rise in the ratio of nitrate to phosphate, but is independent of variations in soluble silicate. In the English lakes, Pearsall found correlations with both an increase in the ratio of nitrate to phosphate and with low silicate. Evidence has been published from other lakes indicating a correlation with falling silicate but not with variation in the ratio of nitrate to phosphate. In all cases the Dinobryon population appears to increase after the major components of the spring maximum have declined. Both the supposed chemical determinants of Dinobryon are probably symptoms of nutrient depletion by the dominant species of the main spring maximum. It is suggested that the major factor determining the incidence of Dinobryon maxima is the variation in the total population of other species, but the mechanism of this relation is obscure. There is no evidence in Linsley Pond that the appearance of Asterionella formosa depends on the inorganic nutrient level. The appearance of Anabaena circinalis in Linsley Pond confirms Pearsall''s contention that blue-green blooms, developing in late summer, arise when the inorganic nutrients are practically exhausted. The conditions for the rise of Fragilaria crotonensis appear to be almost identical with those determining the rise of Anabaena. It is suggested that the relative numbers of these 2 spp. may be interpreted as due to competition for phosphate favoring Fragilaria when nitrate is relatively abundant, Anabaena when nitrate is scarce. It is, however, probable that although the 2 spp. are initially competitors, N fixation by Anabaena results in a more favorable environment for Fragilaria after the Anabaena has declined. Evidence is presented that in small eutrophic lakes all inorganic nutrient substances, except P and combined N, are normally present in great excess. In the case of Fe, only particulate ferric iron is likely to be of importance; it is suggested that such iron is present as [gamma]-ferric hydrated oxide. The gallium content of the unfiltered surface water of Linsley Pond appears to be 0.01-0.1 7 [gamma] per liter. The analysis of the observations presented, consid-ered in relation to the known properties of planktonic algae, suggests that, in general, clear-cut correlations between chemical conditions and the qualitative composition of the phytoplankton are not to be expected, and that the physiol. condition of a population and its relation to populations of other spp. are likely to explain many of the apparent inconsistencies observed when different seasons and different lakes are compared.																			0012-9658	1939-9170				JAN	1944	25	1					3	26		10.2307/1930759	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1930759													WOS:000200151700001

Since lakes represent some of the most important wetlands, providing a wide variety of ecosystem services, they have become a very popular destination. The present study aimed to assess the water quality of the largest artificial lake in Hungary (Kiskore Reservoir-Lake Tisza), and the role of ecological status in tourism development. Monthly water sampling from the basins of the lake (Tiszavalk, Poroszlo, Sarud and Abadszalok basins) took place from April-November 2021 and in 2022. The majority of samples from the river section and from the lake are classified as Ca2+-HCO3- type or mixed Ca2+-Na+-HCO3- type. According to the results, the water quality of each basin is considered excellent or good. Rapid warming of the shallow water of the basins was detected during the summer months, resulting in different hydrochemical characteristics (pH, NH4-N, NO2-N, NO3-N, PO4-P, CODcr BOI5) compared to the river section. Differences in the plant nutrient and oxygen balance component groups have been revealed with hierarchical and two-step cluster analysis as well. The results demonstrated that the hydrochemical properties of the lake's water are substantially influenced by the filling of the lake in spring from the River Tisza and the significant lowering (1.2 m) of the water level in the autumn each year, allowing the drainage of stagnant water, the removal of accumulated sediments and the oxidation of organic matter. The number of tourists on Lake Tisza has increased rapidly over the last decade, confirming that a wide range of ecosystem services have a significant attractive impact on waterfront activities and ecotourism.					; Balla, Dániel/AEF-8630-2022; Vasvári, Mária/AAD-4570-2022; Benkhard, Borbála/AAE-2510-2022	Benkhard, Borbala/0000-0003-2595-1526; Kiss, Emoke/0000-0003-4976-1241; Szabo, Gyorgy/0000-0003-2201-2099; Balla, Daniel/0000-0002-8051-1518; Mester, Tamas/0000-0001-7484-7560; Barkat, Ayoub/0000-0002-8651-1252														2073-4441				APR	2023	15	8							1514	10.3390/w15081514	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15081514													WOS:000983100300001

In this study we collected and analyzed seasonal samples of phytoplankton and assessed environmental variables in Nansi Lake from 2011 to 2015, in order to identify the seasonal dynamics of the phytoplankton community and the main drivers in each phylum. The results showed that phytoplankton diversity in Nansi Lake followed annual cycles, which were interrupted by a water diversion in 2013. The disruption of equilibrium was clearly demonstrated by the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, Pielou's evenness index, and Simpson's dominance index, whereas the species richness and abundance showed resilience, maintaining regular annual cycles. The dominant species were frequently Synedra acus Kutz (Bacillariophyta), Closterium gracile Breb (Chlorophyta), and Scenedesmus quadricauda Breb (Chlorophyta) in summer and autumn. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis suggested that the phytoplankton was most widely distributed in summer, when conditions were more conducive to phytoplankton growth and reproduction. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that the main drivers for the phytoplankton community varied in different taxonomic units. Specifically, the NP ratio and permanganate index (CODMn) had significant effects on Chlorophyta, whereas pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and transparency significantly influenced Bacillariophyta. This study highlights the importance of seasonal phytoplankton succession and the need for identification of the main drivers in each phylum in order to achieve more effective control of phytoplankton blooms in freshwater lakes.

The effects of Bythotrephes longimanus invasion on diets and growth of age-0 yellow perch in Oneida Lake, New York	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Bythotrephes longimanus is a predatory zooplankton native to Eurasia known for its large caudal spine. This species can decrease Daphnia abundance and may decrease growth rates of native planktivorous fish including yellow perch (Perca flavescens). Bythotrephes was first documented in Oneida Lake, USA in 2019 and reached high densities in 2020 and 2021. This recent invasion created an opportunity to investigate at what length yellow perch feed on Bythotrephes, if age-0 yellow perch select for Bythotrephes, and if yellow perch first-year growth decreased. We found Bythotrephes in the stomachs of 23% (2020) and 35% (2021) of age-1 and older yellow perch caught from June through September and 54% of the age-0 yellow perch caught from June through October (2021). Age-0 yellow perch started feeding on Bythotrephes at 27 mm and selected for Bythotrephes from June 24 through the autumn of 2021. Bythotrephes accounted for 54% of age-0 diets by dry weight over the summer and fall. We used the extensive water quality and biological monitoring data from Oneida Lake to develop a multivariate linear regression model for age-0 yellow perch October length from 1993 to 2021. Significant variables included were age-0 yellow perch abundance (negative effect) and temperature, Daphnia biomass, and Bythotrephes presence, all positive effects. Contrary to our expectations, Bythotrephes were selected by age-0 yellow perch from end of June through October, and contributed a substantial proportion of ingested mass by age-0 perch, without negatively affecting age-0 yellow perch growth.					; Jordan, Peter/HDO-4721-2022	Figary, Stephanie/0000-0002-4876-9850; Rudstam, Lars/0000-0002-3732-6368													0906-6691	1600-0633				OCT	2023	32	4					712	723		10.1111/eff.12717	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12717		MAR 2023											WOS:000961325200001

In pristine natural springs with permanent flow, water mites are nearly always present and usually display high diversity. This study aimed to determine whether significant differences in water mite assemblages between rheocrene (river-forming springs with dominant riffle habitats) and limnocrene (lake-forming springs with dominant pool habitats) karst springs could be detected in terms of species richness, diversity and abundance, but also in different ratios of specific synecological groups: crenobiont (exclusively found in springs), crenophilous (associated with springs) and stygophilous (associated with groundwater) water mite taxa. Our research was carried out on four limnocrenes and four rheocrenes in the Dinaric karst region of Croatia. Seasonal samples (20 sub-samples per sampling) were taken at each spring with a 200-mu m net, taking into consideration all microhabitat types with coverage of at least 5%. Water mite abundance was found not to differ between morphological spring types. Significantly higher values of species richness and diversity indices were found in rheocrenes compared to limnocrenes, like those usually reported for this type of springs. However, unlike the studies previously reported, in this case, the higher shares of crenophilous and crenobiont water mite individuals were found in limnocrenes. The differences between stygophilous water mite taxa ratios among spring morphotypes were not statistically significant, indicating that the degree of the groundwater/surface water interaction (and water mite interaction therein) does not seem to be directly influenced by spring morphotype. Within this research, 40% of identified water mite species (eight out of twenty) were recorded for the first time in Croatia, thus highlighting again a huge gap in water mite knowledge of karst springs.					; Pesic, Vladimir/AFP-7820-2022; Gottstein, Sanja/K-3822-2014	Gottstein, Sanja/0000-0002-1424-2911; 														1424-2818				SEP	2020	12	9							316	10.3390/d12090316	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d12090316													WOS:000580313800001

Phytoplankton and Bacterioplankton in Three Reservoirs (Northeastern Bulgaria) Recommended as Potential Reference Sites According to the Water Framework Directive of EU	ACTA ZOOLOGICA BULGARICA												Some trophic characteristics as chlorophyll-a, Secchi-disk transparency, turbidity, phytoplankton and bacterioplabkton abundances were investigated during spring and summer of 2005 in three reservoirs in northeastern Bulgaria, suggested by the experts of the Ministry of Environment and Waters (MEW) as potential reference sites. Different characteristics show differences in the assessment of the reservoir trophic status as only Tsonevo seems to be appropriate to reference site on the basis of the most of characteristics studied. Secchi-disk transparency seems to be inappropriate for assessment of the ecological status of the studied water bodies without considering its different components especially at the time of spring high waters. It is necessary to separate clearly different zones (water bodies) of reservoirs, which strongly depend on the morphometry, seasons, retention time and development of their shoreline. Phytoplankton (both abundance and composition) seems to be a good indicator for the differentiation of reservoir zones. Bacterial contribution to some of investigated variables (e.g. turbidity) and bacteria-algae relationships were also studied. Indication for top-down control of mixotrophic algae on bacteria was obtained under conditions of P-limitation.

J	Lee, BK; Lee, CB				Lee, BK; Lee, CB			Development of an improved dry and wet deposition collector and the atmospheric deposition of PAHs onto Ulsan Bay, Korea	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												An improved dry and wet deposition collector was built to monitor the atmospheric deposition of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) onto water in lakes or seas. In the improved collector the evaporated solution is replenished from a water supply reservoir by a tubing pump. Water vapor produced by a mini-space heater is sent up to the wet funnel by the vacuum pump (outlet) pressure and the water vapor pressure produced at a given temperature. The condensed water vapor is supplied into the wet funnel with a constant flow rate to prevent the channel formation in the wet adsorption cartridge. In a performance test of the developed deposition collector, the average recovery rate of 16 standard PAHs was 86% when using 30 ml of CH2Cl2 as an eluent for 10g of ENVI-18 packed in the adsorption cartridge. The drawbacks, such as evaporation of surrogate solution for dry deposition, channel formation inside wet adsorption cartridge during dry periods and expensive cost for system building, which are commonly faced with measurement of atmospheric deposition of PAHs onto water surfaces have been substantially solved in this improved collector system. The total (dry and wet) atmospheric deposition of PAHs onto Ulsan Bay during the winter was much greater than that during the summer. This was mainly due to a difference in the amounts of fossil fuel used and the prevailing wind characteristics during each season. Dry deposition of PAHs was predominant during the winter, however, wet deposition was the major deposition during the summer. Most of the PAHs deposited onto Ulsan Bay had less than or equal to 4 aromatic rings. The atmospheric deposition of the PAHs with 2, 3 and 4 aromatic rings was 38.0%, 27.8% and 24.1%, respectively.

The model was calibrated and validated for a baseline time-period of 1995-2005. Downscaled ensemble projected temperature and precipitation data from three general circulation models (GCMs) was then used to assess future flow, sediment, and nutrient loading in the watershed for mid-century (2045-2055) and late-century (2089-2099) time periods. Compared to the baseline, a 2.9 degrees C rise in the annual average temperature along with a 3.2% fall in the annual precipitation in the mid-century time-period is projected to reduce annual flow volumes, and suspended solids (SS), total phosphorus (TP), nitrate (NO3) loads by 8.5, 10.4, 8.5, and 9.9%, respectively. Similarly, for the late-century a 4.3 degrees C rise in the annual average temperature along with a 5.6% rise in the annual precipitation is projected to increase annual flow volumes, and SS, TP, NO3 loads by 9.7, 19.6, 3.5, and 6.8%, respectively. Temporal shifts in climatic conditions were also projected for both the future time-periods with higher temperatures throughout the year along with wetter winters and drier summers. Implications of these changes would include the need for an increased focus on pollutant loadings for total maximum daily load guidelines and possible lengthening of crop growing cycles.

The analyses were based on water samples collected from 22 stations in FNWP between 2014 and 2016. Results initially reveal that total nitrogen (TN) concentrations are above class V levels (2 mg/L), total phosphorus (TP) concentrations are below class III levels (0.2 mg/L), and that all other parameters fall within standard ranges. Highest values for TN, pH, and Chlorophyll-a were recorded in 2016, while the levels of chemical oxygen demand (CODMn) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) were lowest during this year. Similarly, TN values were highest between 2014 and 2016 while dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations were lowest in the summer and TP concentrations were highest in the autumn. Significant variations were also found in Secchi depth (SD), TN, CODMn (P < 0.01), TP, and DO levels (P < 0.05) between the inlet and outlet of the park. High-to-low levels of TN, TP, and TDS were found in cattails, reeds, and open water (the opposite trend was seen in SD levels). Tested wetland water had a light eutrophication status in most cases and TN and TP removal rates were between 7.54%-84.36% and 37.50%-70.83%, respectively. Data also show no significant annual changes in water quality within this wetland, although obvious affects from surrounding agricultural drainage were nevertheless recorded. Results reveal a high major nutrient removal efficiency (N and P). The upper limits of these phenomena should be addressed in future research alongside a more efficient and scientific agricultural layout for the regions in and around the FNWP.

So far, the mechanism of how magnetic properties of the HGY lake sediments respond to climate changes has not been well determined. In this study, we performed a detailed mineral-magnetic analysis on the highresolution HGY sediments. Results revealed that finer-grained magnetite (superparamagnetic and single domain magnetite mixed with a small amount of goethite and hematite) is the dominant magnetic mineral, which is consistent with the magnetic properties of the red weathered soils collected from the catchments, but differs greatly from that of the aeolian inputs. Therefore, magnetic minerals of the HGY sediments were originated mainly from the lake catchment, rather than the wind-blown dust inputs. Considering the high tephra wall (relative elevation of 10-20 m) and great precipitation, surface runoff by rainfall is interpreted as the main process to transport red soils into the lake. The magnetic records of HGY sediments revealed that the summer monsoon was enhanced at the early Holocene and then declined abruptly at the mid-late Holocene (similar to 5.5 kyr cal. BP). This pattern strongly mimics the evolution pattern of ISM, but is inconsistent with the EASM. Thus, we suggest that the magnetic records from HGY have the great potential to investigate the evolution of ISM. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Caulobacter spp. were the most numerous type encountered. They were present in the highest concentrations (exceeding 1000/ml) in the mesotrophic lake during the summer.

From 17-330/ml Caulobacter spp. were counted in the eutrophic habitats where their proportion to total viable numbers was less than 1.0%. In the oligotrophic lakes they varied from 5-23/ml and comprised greater than 5% of the total viable count. Hyphomicrobium-like bacteria were also numerous in the mesotrophic lake and in one oligotrophic lake during the summer sampling period. Ancalomicrobium spp. occurred in high concentrations (130 ml) in the mesotrophic lake.

Nonetheless, potential hazards from heavy metal presence in milk, due to environmental exposure and intake through feed, have gained global attention. Given paucity of data we investigated the seasonal variation in the quantitative intake of heavy metals (cadmium: Cd, chromium: Cr, lead: Pb) by dairy cows in the South Indian megacity of Bengaluru, and the resulting heavy metal concentrations in milk and feces. The research involved 39 dairy farms across urban and peri-urban areas, where 281 feed, 329 milk, and 183 feces samples were collected along with management data during monsoon (July 2020 - August 2020), winter (November 2020 - February 2021) and summer (March 2022 - June 2022) seasons. During the summer season, Cd concentration in lake fodder averaged 1.6 mg/kg DM, which was higher than the 0.6 mg/kg DM during winter and 0.9 mg/kg DM during the monsoon season. The higher concentration resulted in an increased daily Cd intake of 13.7 mg/cow/day. Similarly, Cr and Pb intake were also highest in summer (Cr: 46.3 mg/cow/day, Pb: 11.7 mg/cow/day), whereby for both elements the concentrations were higher in non-lake feed than in lake fodder. With the exception of a few milk samples, Cr and Pb concentrations were below threshold levels and did not compromise milk safety, and Cd levels never raised concerns. Nevertheless, elevated Cr and Pb concentrations (Cr: 9.8-16.9 mg/kg DM, Pb: 4.1-10.6 mg/kg DM) were determined in feces across seasons, potentially endangering the environment and reintroducing these elements into the food chain through manure application on agricultural land. Rather than uniformly discouraging the use of lake fodder in Bengaluru, authorities on the one hand should caution fodder usage in pollution-prone areas, and on the other hand take measures to reduce contamination levels at those sites. Furthermore, it appears necessary to implement more stringent control measures for other types of feedstuffs. Raising farmers' awareness of the problem of heavy metals in the food chain could promote their compliance with regulations without the need for complete feed bans, which are difficult to enforce in a highly contested urban environment.

The delta O-18(diatom) records reveal common responses to precipitation forcing over the past millennium. Relatively wet summers are inferred from delta O-18(diatom) between 1000 and 1080 AD, 1300 and 1440 AD, and during the early 19th century, coincided with periods of high cloud cover inferred from tree-ring carbon isotopes, and other data for high Arctic Oscillation index. While relatively dry summers with increasing influence of winter snow are indicated between 1600 and 1750 AD. The co-response between carbon isotopes in trees and oxygen isotopes in diatoms strengthens the relationship between cloud cover and precipitation and the hypothesis that these changes were the result of significant regional shifts in atmospheric circulation.

Decadal post-fire succession of soil invertebrate communities is dependent on the soil surface properties in a northern temperate forest	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Although fires are common disturbances in North American forests, the extent to which soil invertebrate assemblages recover from burning remains unclear. Here, we examine long-term (14- to 101-yr) recoveries of soil invertebrate communities from common cut and burn treatments conducted at 6 to 26-yr intervals since 1911 in a deciduous forest in the upper Great Lakes region (USA). We characterize soil surface macro-invertebrate communities during both fall and spring across a long-term, experimental fire chronosequence to characterize invertebrate community recovery at decadal time-scales and community changes between seasons. We posited that changes in invertebrate community structure might, in turn, impact decomposition process. We sampled active organisms at the soil surface using pitfall traps. We described understory vegetation, measured soil properties, and conducted a 4-year litter bag study with big-toothed aspen leaves (Populus grandidentata). Invertebrate community responses followed a habitat accommodation model of succession showing that invertebrate succession is dependent on the soil surface properties. The fall and spring measures revealed that the densities of active invertebrates were highest 101 years after fire. For a given pair of stands, a pattern of sharing higher percentage of taxa was denoted when stands were of similar age. Some species such as the beetle Stelidota octomaculata appeared to be indicator of the chronosequence succession stage because it tracks the successional increase of Quercus and acorn production at the study site. We also found a significant positive correlation between leaf decomposition of soil macrofaunal accessible leaves and millipedes density across the chronosequence. We show that vegetation cover changes and related shifts in habitat structure occurring during post-fire succession are important in shaping communities assemblages. This finding highlights the importance of simultaneously considering abiotic-biotic factors together with above- and belowground measurements to better characterize controls on successional community dynamics after disturbance.

J	ALEYA, L				ALEYA, L			THE SEASONAL SUCCESSION OF PHYTOPLANKTON IN AN EUTROPHIC LAKE THROUGH THE COUPLING OF BIOCHEMICAL-COMPOSITION OF PARTICULATES, METABOLIC PARAMETERS AND ENVIRONMENTAL-CONDITIONS	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The seasonal variations of biochemical algal parameters together with metabolic indicators and population as well as. environmental variables were examined in a eutrophic temperate lake (Lake Aydat, France). At early spring, the diatom Melosira italica subsp. subarctica developed. However, the increase in temperature and irradiance provoqued the sedimentation of Melosira as reflected by the high levels of Protein/Carbohydrate ratios and their increase with depth. During summer when nitrogen was exhausted, the cells accumulated reserve products (carbohydrates and lipids). The increase of Protein/ Carbohydrate ratio with depth and the simultaneous stability of the energy charge indicate that the cells actively switch to "active survival" when leaving the euphotic zone by choosing catabolic over anabolic pathways. Despite of the summer-nitrogen shortage, phytoplankton biomass was high. The use of atmospheric nitrogen by cyanobacteria, that of low concentrations of nitrates in the water not detected by our technique and the high levels of nitrate reductase activity potential were proposed to explain this paradox.																			0003-9136					MAR	1992	124	1					69	88																WOS:A1992HY59600005

Inter- and size-specific patterns of fish seasonal migration between a shallow lake and its streams	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												This study used passive telemetry (passive integrated transponders) to evaluate winter migration in three species of cyprinids (roach (Rutilus rutilus (L.)), white bream (Blicca bjoerkna (L.)) and rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus (L.))) and their potential predators (pike (Esox lucius (L.)) and perch (Perca fluviatilis (L.))) between a shallow lake and its streams. Migration patterns were investigated from October to June, and a substantial part of the roach (40%) and white bream (55%) populations tagged in the lake during autumn migrated during winter into the streams, whereas only very few piscivores (< 2%) migrated. In contrast to roach and white bream, only few rudd (< 6%) migrated, which is likely a consequence of different overwintering strategies, e.g., rudd overwintering in shallow highly structured habitats. Small rudd migrated more than larger rudd, whereas there were no size-differentiated migration patterns for roach or white bream. Migration of the cyprinid fishes was generally initiated in late October and ended in May, and specific synchronised bursts of migration were observed in December, January and April, suggesting that migration is triggered by one or more proximate environmental cues. The cyprinid fishes generally entered the streams in late afternoon or in the morning, depending on season, but overall migration patterns varied between the three streams. We suggest and discuss that our results have great implications for lake management as well as for the interpretation of seasonal trophic dynamics in shallow lakes.					; Skov, Christian/X-6511-2019; Hansson, Lars-Anders/HCI-2735-2022; Nilsson, Anders/H-6836-2014	Skov, Christian/0000-0002-8547-6520; Hansson, Lars-Anders/0000-0002-3035-1317; Nilsson, Anders/0000-0002-3541-9835													0906-6691	1600-0633				SEP	2008	17	3					406	415		10.1111/j.1600-0633.2008.00291.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.2008.00291.x													WOS:000258378300005
J	Clarke, LR; Bennett, DH				Clarke, LR; Bennett, DH			Zooplankton community changes at Pend Oreille Lake, Idaho: Testing implications for age-0 kokanee prey selection, digestion, and growth	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We used laboratory and field experiments to investigate how spring and autumn zooplankton community changes at Pend Oreille Lake, Idaho, characterized by reduced cladoceran abundance, have affected the prey selection, growth, and digestion of age-0 kokanee Oncorhynchus nerka. In prey selection trials using newly emerged kokanee alevins (mean total length [TL]-25 mm) with varied levels of stomach fullness and that were fed different ratios of cladocerans to copepods, cladocerans were selected except when their relative abundance was the lowest. Alevins ate more zooplankton when cladocerans were relatively more abundant and when their stomachs were empty, but stomach fullness did not influence the prey type selected. Alevins ingested prey that were larger than available prey at each level of stomach fullness, the greatest size selectivity occurring on empty stomachs. Underyearling kokanee (48-57 mm TL) that were fed cladoceran zooplankton ingested more biomass in 1 h than did those fed copepod zooplankton and digested their meal more quickly over time, though the differences were not statistically significant. Kokanee growth was not associated with prey selection, as a cladoceran diet did not produce the greater growth either for alevin kokanee in spring or for underyearlings in autumn (mean TL = 66 mm). Our work shows that changes in zooplankton species composition, relative densities, and size structure may interact to influence age-0 kokanee feeding both directly (by reducing prey numbers and biomass ingested) and indirectly (due to potentially important qualitative differences such as prey digestibility) in ways that were not apparent to us from earlier published Pend Oreille Lake studies, in which we hypothesized that total zooplankton densities would be most important for kokanee survival and growth.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				SEP	2004	133	5					1221	1234		10.1577/T03-184.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T03-184.1													WOS:000224548400014

Phosphorus inactivation of incoming storm water to reduce algal blooms and improve water clarity in an urban lake	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Wagner KJ. 2017. Phosphorus inactivation of incoming storm water to reduce algal blooms and improve water clarity in an urban lake. Lake Reserv Manage. 33:187-197.A phosphorus (P) inactivation system was installed at Morses Pond in Wellesley, Massachusetts, in 2008, to treat storm inflows from 2 tributaries draining an urban watershed during late spring and early summer to minimize P loading and algal blooms. Modification and simplification of that system over 9years has resulted in an efficient system for reducing P concentrations in the lake, decreasing algal blooms and increasing water clarity. Secchi transparency in the last 3 summers has been the highest on record, although precipitation has been below average in those years. On the basis of dollars per kilogram of P removed, total system cost has been well below that expected of watershed best management practices and near the low end of the cost range for P inactivation systems installed elsewhere.																			1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	2			SI		187	197		10.1080/10402381.2017.1288669	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2017.1288669													WOS:000403102200009

Collaborative Planning in Adaptive Flood Risk Management under Climate Change	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Flood risk management (FRM) is moving towards more proactive and collaborative direction to enable adaptation to changing conditions. We present a case study on collaborative planning process, which contributed to the development of adaptive FRM in one of the largest river basins in Finland. The focus was on the possibility and acceptability of using large regulated lakes as storage for flood water in an extreme flood event to decrease flood damage at the downstream riverside towns. We defined an extreme flood event that would cause dramatic flood damage and developed tools for simulating the event with alternative regulation strategies using Watershed Simulation and Forecasting System (WSFS). We organized a stakeholder event to demonstrate the alternative lake regulation strategies, their socio-economic consequences, and to discuss their acceptability. We found that storing flood water in the lakes above the regulation limits and preparing for winter floods in advance by lowering the lakes in the autumn can minimize the total damage in the target area. The majority of stakeholders considered these actions acceptable in an extreme flood event, regardless of deliberately induced flooding of areas where no floods have occurred for over 50 years. However, lowering the lakes in the autumn on annual basis gained less support. We emphasize the importance of deliberations on the FRM procedures and responsibilities in extreme flood events with the stakeholders in advance to increase adaptive capacity and legitimacy of decisions.					; Veijalainen, Noora/AAN-4826-2020; Marttunen, Mika/G-3134-2019	Veijalainen, Noora/0000-0003-4665-933X; Marttunen, Mika/0000-0001-9494-4181; Pihlajamaki, Mia/0000-0003-1322-0558													0920-4741	1573-1650				MAR	2018	32	4					1383	1397		10.1007/s11269-017-1875-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-017-1875-3													WOS:000424266800012

The study indicates that the sea ice condition of the Barents Sea from May to July may be interrelated with the atmospheric circulation of June. When there is more than average sea ice in the Barents Sea, the local geopotential height of the 500-hPa level will decrease, and the same height in the Lake Baikal and Okhotsk regions will increase and decrease respectively to form a wave-chain structure over North Eurasia. This kind of anomalous height pattern is beneficial to more precipitation in the south part of East China and less in the north.																			0256-1530	1861-9533				JUL	2004	21	4					662	674		10.1007/BF02915733	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02915733													WOS:000223047300015

Hulun Lake, the fifth largest lake in China, has faced severe water quality challenges in the past few decades, e.g., high levels of phosphorus and nitrogen, leading to lake eutrophication. However, under such a serious context, the temporal and spatial dynamics of SDD in Hulun Lake are still unclear. In this paper, we obtained the best model input parameters by using stepwise linear regression models to test field measurements against remote sensing band information, and then developed the SDD satellite algorithm suitable for Hulun Lake by comparing six models (i.e., linear, quadratic, cubic, exponential, power, and logarithmic). The results showed that (1) B3/(B1 + B4) [red/(blue-near-infrared)] was the most sensitive parameter for transparency (R = 0.84) and the exponential model was the most suitable transparency inversion model for Hulun Lake (RMSE = 0.055 m, MAE = 0.003 m), (2) The annual mean SDD of Hulun Lake was higher in summer than in autumn, the summer SDD decreased from 2010 (0.23 m) to 2020 (0.17 m), and the autumn SDD increased from 2010 (0.06 m) to 2020 (0.16 m). The SDD in the littoral zones of Hulun Lake was less than that in the central part; (3) meteorological conditions (i.e., precipitation and wind speed) were highly correlated with the variation of SDD. Cropland expansion was the possible reason for the low SDD at the entrance of Hulun Lake flow. The findings of this study have important implications for the development and implementation of ecological protection and restoration strategies in the Hulun Lake basin.					; Baqa, Muhammad/AAT-8212-2021; Zhao, Chuanwu/JPE-6053-2023	Guo, Wei/0000-0002-3615-7128; Zhao, Chuanwu Zhao/0000-0002-9058-7073; Fahad Baqa, Muhammad/0000-0002-4165-6802														2073-4441				APR	2022	14	8							1189	10.3390/w14081189	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14081189													WOS:000785665500001

However, phytoplankton development in the epilimnion has often been P-limited (<5 mug.l-1 of soluble reactive phosphorus) during spring and summer when algal maxima are observed. Alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) was measured in the epilimnion (0-2 m) using a fluorimetric method. The seasonal course of APA (range 6.7-726.7 nmol.l-1.h-1) roughly followed that of chlorophyll a (r2 = 0.45) in 1990. During algal blooms, a significant percentage of total APA was found in the 2.5-100 mum fraction containing most of the algae. Very similar relationships were found by a longitudinal sampling of the reservoir epilimnion during the spring phytoplankton bloom in 1991, despite high P concentrations in the reservoir's tributary. Hence, phytoplankton can be P-limited in the epilimnion, even in a eutrophic reservoir with a high input of P. This study shows that the phytoplankton community might adapt to phosphorus depletion by changing species composition and/or by increasing APA.

J	Maier, G				Maier, G			Copepod communities in fakes of varying trophic degree	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Copepod communities in the pelagic of 22 lakes of varying trophic degree were studied during the summer months of the years 1989 to 1991. In total 6 species were monitored, one calanoid copepod (Eudiaptomus gracilis), and 5 species of cyclopoid copepods (Acanthocyclops robustus, Cyclops abyssorum, Cyclops vicinus, Mesocyclops leuckarti, Thermocyclops crassus). The calanoid copepod predominated in the oligo-mesotrophic lakes. Among cyclopoid copepods M. leuckarti and Cyclops abyssorum preferred oligo-mesotrophic conditions while the other species predominated in the eutrophic lakes. C. vicinus, generally regarded as a winter species which should undergo a diapause during summer, formed summer generations in the eutrophic lakes. This particular deviation from the normal life cycle is interpreted as a strategy to optimize the reproductive output. It implies that even during summer when competition with cladocerans is intense eutrophic conditions can provide sufficient food for the development of the nauplii and for the reproduction of the adults. Calculation of the association coefficients revealed that among cyclopoid copepods generally a large species (C. vicinus) and a small species (T. crassus or M. leuckarti) co-exist. However, frequent associations of M. leuckarti and T. crassus suggest that these species use different food sources. The decline of the calanoid copepod in the eutrophic lakes is probably a result of a higher predation pressure on this group; possibly cyclopoid copepods benefit from their distinct mating behaviours.																			0003-9136					JUN	1996	136	4					455	465																WOS:A1996UU08400002

High-resolution imaging of supraglacial hydrological features on the Greenland Ice Sheet with NASA's Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) instrument suite	CRYOSPHERE												Seasonal meltwater pools on the surface of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) during late spring and summer in lakes on the surface and transforms the ice sheet's surface into a wet environment in the ablation zone below the equilibrium line. These supraglacial lakes in topographic lows on the ice surface are connected by a dendritic pattern of meandering streams and channels that together form a hydrological system consisting of supra-, en-, and subglacial components. Here, we use lidar data from NASA's Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) instrument suite and high-resolution optical imagery collected as part of Operation IceBridge (OIB) in spring 2019 over the GrIS to develop methods for the study of supraglacial hydrological features. While airborne surveys have a limited temporal and spatial coverage compared to imaging spaceborne sensors, their high footprint density and high-resolution imagery reveal a level of detail that is currently not obtainable from spaceborne measurements. The accuracy and resolution of airborne measurements complement spaceborne measurements, can support calibration and validation of spaceborne methods, and provide information necessary for high-resolution process studies of the supraglacial hydrological system on the GrIS that currently cannot be achieved from spaceborne observations alone.

The pond froze over in late November. Ice thickness varied from 0.2 to 0.5 m, and initially, was well described by Stefan's formula. The measured and modelled velocity field indicated a fast flow region, a small dead zone and a large recirculating zone. During a snowmelt event, near-bottom velocities reached 0.05 m(.)s(-1), but were not sufficient to scour the bottom sediment. Pond water temperature increased with depth, from 0.5degreesC to 3.5degreesC. The dissolved oxygen (DO) levels observed in the pond (6-13 mg(.)L(-1)) indicated stable aerobic conditions at the sediment-water interface. In one brief episode, DO fell to zero after a long cold spell. Reduction in DO readings from inlet to outlet indicated an oxygen consumption of about 1.7 kg(.)day(-1). pH ranged from 7.1 to 8.9. Conductivity readings indicated large quantities of total dissolved solids, representing mostly chloride from de-icing agents. During baseflow, conductivity increased with depth (total dissolved solids concentrations up to 1,200 mg(.)L(-1) near the bottom), indicating density stratification. Average trace metal concentrations were mostly below detection limits.																			0273-1223	1996-9732					2003	48	9					133	143		10.2166/wst.2003.0510	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2003.0510								14703147					WOS:000187915400014

Resetting the Clock: How a Reconnection Event Reshaped Cove Fish Assemblages in a Nebraska Reservoir	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Coves are part of the mosaic of fish habitats in many U.S. reservoirs, but over time these coves may be disconnected from the main reservoir for varying durations due to the buildup of sediment berms at the mouth that are higher than reservoir elevations. Our 4-year study (2017-2020) of five coves in Harlan County Reservoir, Nebraska, across three seasons (spring, summer, and fall) provided an opportunity to compare fish communities between coves that have remained connected to the main body of the reservoir and coves that have been intermittently connected to or disconnected from the reservoir over the past 10 years. Further, we were able to evaluate fish community changes in coves following substantial flood events in 2019 that reconnected all disconnected coves to the main body of the reservoir. Taxonomic richness and diversity were lower in the intermittently connected and disconnected coves compared to the connected coves in 2017 and 2018. Only Common Carp Cyprinus carpio were found in the disconnected cove, and Black Bullheads Ameiurus melas were only found in intermittent coves. However, fish communities notably shifted in intermittently connected and disconnected coves after the reconnection event in 2019 and became more similar to those in connected coves. Most notably, species richness in the disconnected cove increased from 1 species preconnection to 18 species postconnection, and two new species (Flathead Catfish Pylodictis olivaris and Golden Shiner Notemigonus crysoleucas) were found in at least one cove type during the postflood period that had not been present in any coves prior to the connection. Results from this study underscore the importance of coves as habitats for some species and provide insights as to how fish communities may change when coves are reconnected, whether by human intervention or variations in reservoir elevation.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				APR	2023	43	2					327	338		10.1002/nafm.10797	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10797		OCT 2022											WOS:000876320100001
J	SORSA, K				SORSA, K			PRIMARY PRODUCTION OF EPIPELIC ALGAE IN LAKE SUOMUNJARVI, FINNISH NORTH KARELIA	ANNALES BOTANICI FENNICI												The variation of light intensity and water temperature were the foremost factors controlling productivity among epipelic algae and littoral plankton algae observed by in situ studies in Lake Suomunjarvi (East Finland). Their productivity curves followed the fluctuations of incident light seasonally and with depth, simultaneous crests of both algal assemblages occurring during warm months. Strong correlations were recorded between primary production and penetrated radiation (wave length 385-650 nm), the contribution of radiation to the variation of the epipelic production being 64.2% in 1975 and 51.4% in 1975. The respective values for littoral plankton were 54.3% in 1975 and 76.5% in 1976. Temperature exerted a smaller impact on production. The effect of photodepression on epipelic production was minimal, whereas it influenced phytoplankton and littoral algal production considerably. The estimated average epipelic algal production of 0.2 g Cm-2yr-1 accounted 1.4% for the phytoplankton production. The greatest productivity efficiencies were observed on the shoal early in the summer and in the autumn. The mean contents of acetone extracted epipelic algal chlorophyll (chl) a, analyzed parallel to the productivity measurements, ranged from 70.6 .+-. 11.4 to 157.8 .+-. 17.6 mg chl a m-2. Highest chlorophyll values occurred in light summer conditions; therefore, epipelic algae are more tolerant and adjust differently to strong light than their planktonic counterparts.																			0003-3847	1797-2442					1979	16	4					351	366																WOS:A1979JB35900006

Space/Time Analysis of Fecal Pollution and Rainfall in an Eastern North Carolina Estuary	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The Newport River Estuary (NPRE) is a high-priority shellfish harvesting area in eastern North Carolina that is impaired due to fecal contamination, specifically exceeding recommended levels for fecal coliforms. A hydrologic-driven mean trend model was developed, as a function of antecedent rainfall, in the NPRE to predict levels of Escherichia coli (EC, measured as a proxy for fecal coliforms). This mean trend model was integrated in a Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME) framework to produce informative space/time (S/T) maps depicting fecal contamination across the NPRE during winter and summer months. These maps showed that during dry winter months, corresponding to the oyster harvesting season in North Carolina (October 1-March 30), predicted EC concentrations were below the shellfish harvesting standard (14 MPN/100 mL). However, after substantial rainfall of 3.81 cm (1.5 in.), the NPRE did not appear to meet this requirement. Warmer months resulted in the predicted EC concentrations exceeding the threshold for the NPRE. Predicted ENT concentrations were generally below the recreational water quality threshold (104 MPN/100 mL), except for warmer months after substantial rainfall.

Regionalization, seasonality, and trends of streamflow in the US Great Lakes Basin	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Analysis of historical streamflow trends and their relationship to landscape characteristics is essential for understanding geographic differences in runoff within the Great Lakes basin and for distinguishing temporal trends from temporal variance. Factor analysis of streamflow records (1956-1988) from 32 US Geological Survey gauging stations within the Great Lakes basin revealed distinct spatio-temporal patterns of stream runoff within five different regions of the basin. Streams represented by the first annual factor occurred in southern Wisconsin and the lower peninsula of Michigan, and exhibited a linear increase in mean annual streamflow over the 33 year period caused by increased autumn and winter runoff. The second annual factor represented streams in New York and eastern Ohio, which exhibited sharply increased autumn discharge during the 1970s and 1980s. The remaining three annual, factors distinguished groups of streams in western Ohio, Minnesota, and the upper peninsula of Michigan with differing annual and seasonal flow patterns but no consistent trends in annual flow. Factor analysis of monthly flow expressed as a proportion of annual flow identified three seasonal proportion factors that were temporally distinct but geographically dispersed. Annual yield (annual streamflow per unit watershed area) was greatest from watersheds with greater topographic relief and forest cover, and February yield was greatest from small, tower elevation watersheds having a small proportion of wetland area. Understanding past spatio-temporal patterns of streamflow variability within the US Great Lakes basin and their relationship to landscape properties provides a basis for evaluating future change.

Coilia nasus, an anadromous fish, resides in offshore waters of the Pacific Northwest and reproduces in connected rivers and lakes, including the middle-lower Yangtze River. Populations of C. nasus have differentiated into two ecotypes: migratory and landlocked.Methods This study examined the spatiotemporal distributions of these ecotypes and the environmental conditions of their habitats by analyzing environmental DNA collected from Poyang Lake and Tai Lake during 2020-2021.Results A total of 157 eDNA samples were obtained, with 62 yielding positive results, including 23 from Poyang Lake and 39 from Tai Lake. The migratory population exhibited seasonal movements in Poyang Lake, entering the Yangtze River-Poyang Lake channel in spring, migrating southward during summer, and returning to the channel in autumn. In contrast, the spatial distribution of the landlocked population remained relatively stable throughout the seasons. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) analysis indicated that the distribution patterns of the migratory population were not significantly associated with environmental factors. In contrast, the distribution of the landlocked population was significantly affected by lower water turbidity and reduced conductivity.Discussion The findings suggest that temporal variations in the spatial distribution of C. nasus in Poyang Lake primarily reflect its migratory reproductive life history. Conversely, the distribution of the landlocked C. nasus population resembles that of resident fish populations and is mainly influenced by a preference for higher water quality. The results imply that differences in life histories and adaptation to local environmental conditions may have contributed to the formation of the two ecotypes. This study also shows the effectiveness of eDNA technology in assessing fish population distribution and dynamics.

J	KRUEGER, CC; MAY, B				KRUEGER, CC; MAY, B			GENETIC COMPARISON OF NATURALIZED RAINBOW-TROUT POPULATIONS AMONG LAKE-SUPERIOR TRIBUTARIES - DIFFERENTIATION BASED ON ALLOZYME DATA	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Allelic frequencies at 27 polymorphic allozyme loci were compared among 15 collections of naturalized migratory rainbow trout Salmo gairdneri sampled from 10 stream drainages leading to Lake Superior. Multiple collections were made within the Brule River drainage in Wisconsin: one of spring-run spawning adults, one of fall-rum adults, and four from Brule River tributaries. Significant allele frequency differences were observed among the 15 collections for 13 out or 21 loci examined (P < 0.05). Statistically significant differences occurred among rainbow trout from different drainages and among the four site-specific samples from Brule River tributaries. No significant differences in allelic frequencies occurred between fall-run and spring-run adult fish. Genetic fixation values Fst indicated that about 2.6% of the total genetic variation occurred among the 10 drainages and that about 2.1% occurred among the six Brule River samples. Groups of collections identified by cluster analysis of genetic distances usually contained samples that were geographically proximate, except where the number of adult spawners was believed to be less than 50. The level of population differentiation reported here for Lake Superior was less than that previously reported for native rainbow trout populations from Pacific coastal drainages or that observed for introduced brown trout resident along the south shore of Lake Superior. The spatial units of focus for management of rainbow trout in Lake Superior should be groups of geographically proximate small streams, and possibly individual large drainage systems.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				NOV	1987	116	6					795	806		10.1577/1548-8659(1987)116<795:GCONRT>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1987)116<795:GCONRT>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1987U679600002

The Yangtze floodplain is globally unique for its extensive ephemeral wetlands, recharged by summer monsoon precipitation. The annual cycle of inundation and water table recession favours submerged macrophytes, including Vallisneria that overwinters in desiccated substrates as tubers, which provide high-energy winter food for tuber-feeding waterbirds that were formerly abundant in the region. 2. Large declines among the tuber-feeding waterbirds swan goose Anser cygnoides (L.), tundra swan Cygnus columbianus (Ord) and hooded crane Grus monacha Temminck between 2004/2005 and 2009/2010 at Shengjin Lake, Anhui Province, suggest that major changes in food availability have occurred there. 3. Based on observations of feeding behaviour and energy budgets of these species, it was calculated that at least 5.0 and 8.9 km(2) of Vallisneria beds in 2004 and 2005, respectively, would be needed to support observed numbers of these species, compared with less than 1.5 km(2) found in 2009 and 2010. 4. An incomplete macrophyte survey in summer 2000 located at least 7.7 km(2) of Vallisneria beds in the Upper Lake, where none was present during resurveys in 2008 and 2009. Declines in tuber-feeding waterbirds at Shengjin Lake coincide with the disappearance of their submerged macrophyte food plants, possibly as a result of eutrophication since the mid-2000s. 5. Widespread declines and concentration of tuber-eating wintering waterbirds at other sites elsewhere in the Yangtze floodplain may also reflect the local collapse of submerged macrophytes and of ecosystem services that these wetlands provide to the human communities.

Habitat and body condition influence American Redstart foraging behavior during the non-breeding season	JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY												Insectivorous birds may adjust their foraging strategies to exploit changes in resource distributions. Arthropod prey strongly influence habitat-specific persistence of long-distance migrant passerines in their wintering areas, and arthropods are strongly affected by rainfall. However, the effect of drought on the dynamics of avian foraging ecology as resources shift is not well understood. We captured female American Redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla) and studied their foraging behavior in high-quality (evergreen black mangrove) and low-quality (deciduous scrub) habitat in Jamaica during the winter of 1995-1996. As is typical in southwestern Jamaica, conditions became drier as spring approached and many trees in scrub lost most of their leaves; mangrove trees maintained most of their leaf cover. Birds in scrub lost more mass than those in mangrove, and scrub birds shifted to using more aerial (and fewer near-perch) maneuvers. In scrub, but not in mangrove, the proportion of wing-powered movements and aerial foraging maneuvers was positively correlated with mass corrected by body size. In both habitats, attack rate was negatively correlated with body condition. Therefore, redstarts in scrub that maintained body condition were likely better able to use energetically expensive aerial maneuvers and wing-powered search movements to exploit large, calorie-rich flying arthropods. As the scrub dried over the course of the winter, the shift in foraging tactic may have allowed some birds to forage more efficiently (i.e., lower attack rate), likely facilitating maintenance of good body condition.

Using untapped telemetry data to explore the winter biology of freshwater fish	REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES												Winter is a challenging period for aquatic research-weather is uncomfortable, ice is hazardous, equipment fails, and daylength is short. Consequently, until recently relatively little research on freshwater fishes has included winter. Telemetry methods for tracking fish and observing movement behavior are an obvious solution to working in harsh conditions because much of the data can be collected remotely, and passive methods collect data year-round without winter maintenance. Yet, many telemetry studies do not collect data during winter or, if they do, only report data from the ice-free seasons while the remaining data are unused. Here, we briefly summarize the advantages and limitations of using telemetry methods in winter, including acoustic and radio telemetry and passive integrated transponder technology, then review the range of questions related to fish ecology, behavior, bioenergetics, and habitat use that can be addressed in winter using telemetry. Our goals are to highlight the untapped potential of winter fish biology and to motivate scientists to revisit their four-season telemetry data and incorporate objectives specific to winter biology in future study plans.

C with photosynthetically active radiation (400-700 nm) of 60 .mu.E m-2 s-1. Growth was measured by 2 independent methods, optical density at 750 nm and mean filament length .times. mean filament number, and was analyzed by fitting logistic curves to the data for comparisons of yields, lag phases and growth rates. Anabaena A-133-9q2 grew best in spring and fall, poorest in summer and the growth was always much lower than the controls in ASM-1-TR minus nitrogen (NO3) medium. The results support the hypothesis that nutrient variability in the water column contributes to the selection and growth of dominant species and strains and is one of the factors (along with buoyancy and other concentrating mechanisms) which cause observed successional changes and localized differences in composition of bloom-forming populations and scums. Inhibitors along with nutrient deficiencies may have caused the low biomass densities supported by the lake water. Buoyancy can best account for the 10-fold higher biomass densities observed for heavy bloom-forming populations collected from the top 0.25 m of the water column of Hastings Lake.																			0008-4026						1979	57	21					2443	2451		10.1139/b79-288	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b79-288													WOS:A1979JG64200013

The main objective of this study was to investigate the transport time scale in a large floodplain lake, Poyang Lake (China). A 2D hydrodynamic model (MIKE 21) was combined with dye tracer simulations to determine residence and travel times of the lake for various water level variation periods. The results indicate that Poyang Lake exhibits strong but spatially heterogeneous residence times that vary with its highly seasonal water level dynamics. Generally, the average residence times are less than 10 days along the lake's main flow channels due to the prevailing northward flow pattern; whereas approximately 30 days were estimated during high water level conditions in the summer. The local topographically controlled flow patterns substantially increase the residence time in some bays with high spatial values of six months to one year during all water level variation periods. Depending on changes in the water level regime, the travel times from the pollution sources to the lake outlet during the high and falling water level periods (up to 32 days) are four times greater than those under the rising and low water level periods (approximately seven days).

These measurements were done with a Linke-Feussner actinometer equipped with broad band Schott filters (OG1, RG2, RG8). These filters were chosen, as they have demonstrated a good stability with time. The lowest values of turbidity were found in winter, which is the rainy season for this area. In spring (April) the largest number of sand storms were observed, but the turbidity remained high for the whole summer. A mean Linke turbidity factor of 5.39 was derived, which is a value otherwise generally found only in industrial areas. Mean values of .ANG. coefficients were .beta. = 0.34 and .alpha. = 1.20. Aerosol particles were also sampled with nucleopore membrane filters. The chemical analyses of the particles with an X-ray spectrometer showed that most of the smaller ones had a chemical composition similar to sand. Other, larger ones showed high amounts of Ca and Cl; these are believed to have originated in Chott Djerid, the largest dried-out salt lake in Tunisia, which is located 20 km southeast of Tozeur. Model calculations of the radiative transfer for the solar spectrum were carried out, taking the turbidity measurements and ground truth measurements of albedo into account. A perturbation experiment was carried out, changing turbidity and surface reflectivity. An increased surface reflectivity had a cooling effect at the surface, and a warming effect on the lowest kilometer of the atmosphere. Further, increases in turbidity resulted again in cooling at the surface, but with additional warming of the atmosphere. The combined increases of surface reflectivity and turbidity had a somewhat balancing effect as far as planetary albedo was concerned.																			0066-6424						1984	35	3					203	220		10.1007/BF02263346	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02263346													WOS:A1984ADL7600003

Numan; Akinci, Gorkem			Influences of urban wastewaters on the stream water quality: a case study from Gumushane Province, Turkey	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Urban wastewater in Turkey is primarily discharged without treatment to marine environments, streams and rivers, and natural and artificial lakes. Since it has been well established that untreated effluent in multi-use waters can have acute and chronic impacts to both the environment and human health, it is important to evaluate the consequences of organic enrichment relative to the structure and function of aquatic environment. We investigated the impacts of untreated municipal wastewater discharge from the city of Gumushane in the Eastern Black Sea Region of Turkey on the surface water quality of the stream Harsit. Several key water-quality indicators were measured: chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonium nitrogen (NH (4) (+) -N), nitrite nitrogen (NO (2) (-) -N), nitrate nitrogen (NO (3) (-) -N), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), total nitrogen (TN), orthophosphate phosphorus (PO (4) (3-) -P), methylene blue active substances (MBAS), water temperature (t), pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and electrical conductivity (EC). The monitoring and sampling studies were conducted every 15 days from March 2009 to February 2010 at three longitudinally distributed stations. While t, pH, DO, and EC demonstrated relatively little variability over the course of the study, other parameters showed substantial temporal and spatial variations. The most dramatic differences were noted in COD, NH (4) (+) -N, NO (2) (-) -N, TKN, TN, PO (4) (3-) P, and MBAS immediately downstream of the wastewater discharge. Concentration increases of 309 and 418 % for COD, 5,635 and 2,162 % for NH (4) (+) -N, 2,225 and 674 % for NO (2) (-) -N, 283 and 478 % for TKN, 208 and 213 % for PO (4) (3-) -P, and 535 and 1,260 % for MBAS were observed in the summer and autumn, respectively. These changes were associated with greatly diminished seasonal stream flows. Based on NO (2) (-) -N, TKN, PO (4) (3-) P, and MBAS concentrations, it was concluded that Harsit stream water was correctly classified as polluted. The most telling parameter, however, was NH (4) (+) -N, which indicated highly polluted waters in both the summer and autumn. The elevated concentrations of both P and N in the downstream segment of the stream triggered aggressive growth of submerged algae. This eutrophication of river systems is highly representative of many urban corridors and is symptomatic of ongoing organic enrichment that must be addressed through improved water treatment facilities.

Contrary to a range of 0-28 degrees C of temperate freshwaters, the water temperature of Lake H & eacute;v & iacute;z (Hungary, Central Europe), the largest natural bathable thermal lake in the world, varies between 26 and 35 degrees C seasonally. The specific environmental conditions (continuously warm water and its individual chemical composition, special nutrient base, lack of natural lakeside spawning substrate compared to usual spawning grounds, continuous high human disturbance, etc.) suggest that the carp population here may also differ in reproductive characteristics from their counterparts in surrounding waters. Our findings suggest that the self-sustaining dwarf common carp population of Lake H & eacute;v & iacute;z matures 2 to 4 years earlier (at the age of one) and spawns 1 to 3 months before (between February and April, at 27-30 degrees C water temperature) than carp typically do in the temperate zone (16-20 degrees C). Successful winter spawning was verified by rearing larvae from the collected eggs and in situ induced propagation.

The evaluation is aimed at determining how well the RCMs reproduce monthly, seasonal, and annual cycles of rainfall and quantify the uncertainty between the RCMs in downscaling the same global climate model outputs. Root mean square, bias, and correlation coefficient are used to evaluate the ability of the RCM output. The multicriteria decision method of compromise programming was used to choose the best climate models for the climate condition of the Central Rift Valley Lakes subbasin. The Rossby Center Regional Atmospheric Model (RCA4) has downscaled ten global climate models (GCMs) and reproduces the monthly rainfall with a complex spatial distribution of bias and root mean square errors. The monthly bias varies in the range of - 35.8 to 189%. The summer (wet), spring, winter (dry), and annual rainfall varied within the range of 1.44 to 23.66%, - 7.08 to 20.04%, - 7.35 to 57%, and - 3.11 to 16.5%, respectively. To find the source of uncertainty, the same GCMs but downscaled by different RCMs were analyzed. The test results showed that each RCM differently downscaled the same GCM, and there was no single RCM model that consistently simulated the climate conditions over the stations in the study regions. However, the evaluation finds reasonable model skill in representing the temporal cycles of rainfall and suggests the use of RCMs where climate data is scarce after bias correction.

The biological assessment of these sites was also evaluated using 9 different river and lake diatom indices. Based on the total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), electrical conductivity (EC), salinity (SAL) values, and dominant diatom species, three lentic systems in Akarcay Basin (Lake Eber, 26 Agustos Pond, and Lake Karamik) were more eutrophic and under the pressure of anthropogenic and climatic (precipitation) stressors. Trophic diatom index for lakes (TDIL) showed a higher correlation with TN and TP and was the most effective index in explaining ecological quality in 15 lentic systems. The species richness of diatoms was also negatively affected by EC and SAL values. The lentic systems of the two basins were separated from each other based on the species composition and the distribution of the dominant species with the effect of altitude (ALT). Considering the distribution of diatom assemblage of the lentic systems in these two basins, anthropogenic, climatic, and geographical factors have become prominent to shape the diatom community structure.

J	Rao, YR; Murthy, RC; Chiocchio, F; Skafel, MG; Charlton, MN				Rao, YR; Murthy, RC; Chiocchio, F; Skafel, MG; Charlton, MN			Impact of proposed Burlington and Hamilton sewage discharges in western Lake Ontario	WATER QUALITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF CANADA												The alternate strategy of open-lake discharge may alleviate the need for unusually stringent treatment needed to meet water quality goals of the Hamilton Harbour Remedial Action Plan (RAP). The latest update of the RAP recommended a study of the possibility of offshore discharges. A study conducted for the City of Burlington has proposed a location for outfall in Lake Ontario. This paper utilizes a combination of physical limnological data and mathematical models to predict the waste plume characteristics for the proposed outfall in the lake. Near-field dilutions obtained from a mixing zone model show that, for treated effluents with a discharge condition of 2 m(3)/s at the proposed outfall site at Burlington, the dilution ratios are in the range of 13:1 to 28:1. for weak to moderate currents during summer stratification. Winter dilution ratios increased to 21:1 to 96:1 for moderate currents. The recommended site for open-lake outfall provides acceptable near-field dilutions for treated effluents under typical lake currents and density structure. The extension of outfall to a location farther offshore is only marginally beneficial. With the proposed Burlington outfall location and discharge conditions, no far-field contamination is observed near the beaches or nearby water intakes for typical summer and winter conditions. Thus, this study indicates that by discharging the treated sewage from an outfall in Lake Ontario it is possible to achieve the Hamilton Harbour RAP goals.																			1201-3080						2003	38	4					627	645		10.2166/wqrj.2003.040	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wqrj.2003.040													WOS:000187176100004
J	Robertson, HA; Funnell, EP				Robertson, Hugh A.; Funnell, Emily P.			Aquatic plant dynamics of Waituna Lagoon, New Zealand: trade-offs in managing opening events of a Ramsar site	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Coastal lagoons are at risk internationally due to impacts associated with human-induced land use change. The resilience of aquatic macrophytes in these systems is threatened by altered hydrological regimes, elevated nutrient loading, and increased dominance of nuisance species. We describe the aquatic plant dynamics of the Waituna Lagoon Ramsar Site, a 1,350 ha lagoon frequently opened to the sea for flood mitigation which is characterised by fluctuating water levels and salinity. The shallow lagoon supports a macrophyte community dominated by Ruppia megacarpa and R. polycarpa. Repeated survey of 48 sites across the lagoon during late summer in 2009, 2010 and 2011 were applied to describe aquatic plant composition and abundance. This period coincided with three opening events (winter 2008; winter 2009; spring 2010) when the lagoon switched from a predominantly fresh-brackish system to being influenced by tidal exchange and lower water levels. The lagoon experienced a period of 43 days open to the sea in 2008-2009, 67 days in 2009-2010 and 181 days in 2010-2011, during which macrophytes were subject to saline conditions in excess of 10 ppt. We observed a decline in the occurrence of Ruppia from 2009 (69 % sites) to 2011 (23 % sites). The shift in productivity was associated with the duration of the open phase and the period plants were subject to saline conditions > 20 ppt and low water levels. The resilience of the system is also at risk from increased algal-dominance due to the intensification of agricultural land use occurring in the Waituna Lagoon catchment. While lagoon opening events cause extreme changes in water depth and salinity that can limit macrophyte growth, they also provide a mechanism to reduce the effects of eutrophication. Understanding these trade-offs is pivotal in management decisions regarding the likely impact of opening events on the ecological character of coastal lagoons.																			0923-4861	1572-9834				OCT	2012	20	5					433	445		10.1007/s11273-012-9267-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11273-012-9267-1													WOS:000309681600006

OCCURRENCE OF NORTHERN SAW-WHET OWLS (AEGOLIUS ACADICUS) IN ALABAMA DETERMINED FROM TARGETED BANDING EFFORTS	JOURNAL OF RAPTOR RESEARCH												Enticed by the migratory irruption of 2007, we established three banding stations in northeastern Alabama, USA, to determine the prevalence of Northern Saw-whet Owls (Aegolius acadicus) in the state and subsequently examine the broader extent of migration patterns and demographics at latitudes <= 35 degrees N. We captured 202 Northern Saw-whet Owls between 2007 and 2016, with annual totals ranging from 3 in 2014 to 64 in 2012. The proportion of hatch-year owls captured was 38.1% overall, which was considerably lower than levels reported at more northern stations. Morphometric estimates and a sex-specific discriminant function analysis table indicated 63.9% of all Northern Saw-whet Owls captured were female and 11.9% were males, with the remaining 24.2% of undetermined sex. Peakmigration occurred duringmid-November. We locally recaptured 44 individuals and determined that recaptures were bimodally distributed, withmost owls recaptured 1 wk after initial banding and a second peak 10-13 wk afterward. We estimated 50% of owls emigrated from stations within 3 wk of initial banding. We encountered seven owls initially banded at northern stations; one of these had flown 1518 km from Whitefish Point Bird Observatory, Michigan to Hollins, Alabama. Of these encounters, three were intra-seasonal and represented owls that had migrated at an average rate of 36.2 km/night. Four owls banded in Alabama were encountered during subsequent seasons in the northern United States. Although limited, these data suggest owls follow the Appalachian Mountains and western Great Lakes migration routes into Alabama. Our findings indicate Northern Saw-whet Owls regularly overwinter in northeastern Alabama, although abundances probably vary annually with migration dispersion cycles. We recommend additional Northern Saw-whet Owl banding stations be established across the southeastern United States to further study this secretive species within the southern periphery of its winter range.

J	McKeown, PE; Mooradian, SR				McKeown, PE; Mooradian, SR			Factors influencing recruitment of crappies in Chautauqua Lake, New York	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Black crappies Pomoxis nigromaculatus and white crappies P. annularis were introduced to Chautauqua Lake from Sodus Bay of Lake Ontario (New York) in the late 1920s to establish a recreational fishery. The abundance of both species rapidly increased, and an intensive recreational fishery developed. Anecdotal accounts from the recreational fishery and catches in pound nets indicate that both species remained at high levels of abundance until the 1970s. However, the catch of age-2 crappies in gill-net samples has declined since 1978. Index trawling from 1978 to 1999 indicated that the year-class strength of black and white crappies was synchronized and fixed between fall of age 0 and fall of age 1. Age-0 crappie abundance was positively associated with the biomass of walleye prey (yellow perch Perca flavescens, sunfish Lepomis spp., and white perch Morone americana) and negatively associated with that of walleye Stizostedion vitreum, showing that availability of alternative prey affects walleye predation on crappies. The mortality of crappies from fall of age 0 to fall of age I was not related to winter severity, predation, or prey abundance. Low abundance of age-2 crappies and the lack of any significant relation between the adult stock and age-0 abundance showed that the recreational fishery or transfers of adult crappies from Chautauqua Lake were unlikely causes for poor recruitment to the crappie populations.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				NOV	2002	22	4					1385	1392		10.1577/1548-8675(2002)022<1385:FIROCI>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8675(2002)022<1385:FIROCI>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000179651100038

Ice cover, winter circulation, and exchange in Saginaw Bay and Lake Huron	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Winter circulation exerts a strong control on the release and timing of nutrients and contaminants from bays into the adjoining lakes. To estimate winter residence times of solutes in the presence of ice cover, we used an ice model coupled to hydrodynamic, thermal and solute transport models of Saginaw Bay and Lake Huron for two low (2010 and 2013) and two high (2009 and 2014) ice years. The models were tested using temperature data from thermistor chains and current data from ADCP moorings deployed during the wintertime. Simulated water temperatures compared favorably to lake-wide average surface temperatures derived from NOAA's AVHRR satellite imagery. Simulated results of ice cover are in agreement with observed data from the Great Lakes Ice Atlas. Our results indicate that ice cover significantly dampens water movement producing almost stagnant conditions around February. Estimates of residence times for Saginaw Bay (defined as the e-folding flushing time based on vertically integrated dye concentrations) show that the mean residence times in a low ice year (2013) are 2.2 months for the inner bay, and 3.5 months for the entire bay. The corresponding numbers for a high ice year (2014) are 4.9 and 5.3 months, respectively. Considering the entire bay, solutes stored in the bay can be expected to be released into the lake between March (low ice year) and April (high ice year). These results are expected to aid in understanding the behavior of contaminants in the Great Lakes during the winter months and in early spring.					; Phanikumar, Mantha/A-2523-2008; Nguyen, Tuan Anh/T-2374-2019	Nguyen, Tuan/0009-0006-3975-1321; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2017	62	1					376	393		10.1002/lno.10431	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10431													WOS:000393804600026
J	Livingstone, DM; Padisák, J				Livingstone, David M.; Padisak, Judit			Large-scale coherence in the response of lake surface-water temperatures to synoptic-scale climate forcing during summer	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Daily mean lake surface-water temperatures (LSWTs) measured in Swiss Alpine lakes in summer and early autumn 2000 were compared with LSWTs measured simultaneously in Lake Balaton, Hungary, 750 kin to the cast. The Swiss lakes are small (0.0043-0.46 km(2)), predominantly oligotrophic, and are located in a mountainous environment, some at altitudes > 2,000 m above sea level, whereas Lake Balaton is a large (593 km(2)), shallow, mesotrophic lake situated in the much lower-lying Carpathian Basin. Despite the large distance separating the two regions and the extreme differences in character between the lakes, the LSWTs in Switzerland and Hungary exhibited a coherent response to synoptic-scale meteorological forcing, expressed in terms of exponentially smoothed air temperature, which can be viewed as a causal forcing variable in its own right and as a proxy for other forcing variables with which it is correlated. The coherent response of LSWT in very dissimilar lakes in two different geographical regions of Europe demonstrates that large-scale climatic forcing on synoptic timescales is much more important for lakes than previously thought. This appears to be particularly true for low-altitude lakes, whereas lakes at higher altitudes exhibit more heterogeneity in their response.

J	GELLER, A				GELLER, A			COMPARISON OF MECHANISMS ENHANCING BIODEGRADABILITY OF REFRACTORY LAKE WATER CONSTITUENTS	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Bacterial degradation of macromolecular DOM, aged under weakly photolytic conditions (daylight > 300 nm), was compared to that of the original compounds before and after provision of a cosubstrate, Bacteria, Pseudomonas sp., Flavobacterium sp., and Erwinia sp., and macromolecules (apparent mol wet .gtoreq. 1,500) were isolated from the same lake water samples, one taken in winter and one in summer. Decomposition was determined by DOC measurements, since UV absorbance A200-300 nm did not give an accurate indication of loss rates. Both aging and the pulse dose of nutrients enhanced the accessibility of the refractory DOM to Pseudomonas sp. and Erwinia sp., while Flavobacterium sp. utilized the original substances most effectively. The original macromolecules were decomposed 12-22%, aging increased the available portions by a further 5-10%, and provision of the cosubstrate, glutamic acid, enhanced degradation by 3-8% and by 20% (Erwinia sp. and DOM fraction, both isolated in summer). The constituents of the macromolecules in the winter sample rendered accessible by photolysis were energetically advantageous to Pseudomonas sp. and Erwinia sp. the degradable portions of the original and aged macromolecules were consumed within the first week of incubation, and the remainder was persistent. Provision of a nutrient pulse did not result in the production of enzymes that might have enabled the bacteria to assimilate the refractory remainder. Both mechanisms are thought to reduce the longevity of the refractory DOM in a stepwise manner in natural waters.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	1986	31	4					755	764		10.4319/lo.1986.31.4.0755	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1986.31.4.0755													WOS:A1986D538600006
J	Wurtsbaugh, WA; Maciej Gliwicz, Z				Wurtsbaugh, WA; Maciej Gliwicz, Z			Limnological control of brine shrimp population dynamics and cyst production in the Great Salt Lake, Utah	HYDROBIOLOGIA												In the Great Salt Lake of Utah, the brine shrimp Artemia franciscana Kellogg is an important food resource for birds and they produce dormant cysts that are harvested and used extensively in the aquaculture industry. We analyzed the limnological factors controlling Artemia growth and cyst production over 12 months in 1994 and 1995. Laboratory experiments showed that inter-brood intervals were highly dependent on temperature and slightly on food level. At optimal temperatures and nutritious food, juveniles reached reproductive size within 7 d in the laboratory. In winter when temperatures were less than 3 degreesC, Artemia were absent from the lake, phytoplankton abundance was high (greater than or equal to13 Chl a mug l(-1)), and the dominant grazers were ciliated protozoans. In the spring, cysts hatched when phytoplankton was abundant (15-30 mug Chl a l(-1)), and the Artemia grew and produced large clutches of ovoviviparous eggs. Estimated naupliar production from these eggs was 80 l(-1) from April to May. Despite the high production of nauplii, Artemia densities declined to 8 l(-1)by June and the growing shrimp population grazed down the phytoplankton resource to <1 mug Chl a l(-1). With the depleted phytoplankton food resource during the summer, Artemia growth slowed, lipid indices decreased, clutch sizes declined, and females switched primarily to oviparous cyst production. During the summer, there was limited production of ovoviviparous eggs, and limited recruitment of juveniles, probably due to low food. Although oviparous reproduction began in June, more than 90% of the cysts were produced after July when female densities had declined to 1.5 l(-1), but nearly all of them were producing cysts. Estimated cyst production was 650 000 m(-2), or 4.54 x 10(6) kg dry weight for the entire lake. The reported commercial harvest took 21% of the 1994 cyst production. That harvest had little impact on the subsequent year's population, as Artemia densities were ultimately controlled by algal production in the lake.

J	Mast, MA; Alvarez, DA; Zaugg, SD				Mast, M. Alisa; Alvarez, David A.; Zaugg, Steven D.			Deposition and accumulation of airborne organic contaminants in Yosemite National Park, California	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Deposition and accumulation of airborne organic contaminants in Yosemite National Park were examined by sampling atmospheric deposition, lichen, zooplankton, and lake sediment at different elevations. Passive samplers were deployed in high-elevation lakes to estimate surface-water concentrations. Detected compounds included current-use pesticides chlorpyrifos, dacthal, and endosulfans and legacy compounds chlordane, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane-related compounds, dieldrin, hexachlorobenzene, and polychlorinated biphenyls. Concentrations in snow were similar among sites and showed little variation with elevation. Endosulfan concentrations in summer rain appeared to coincide with application rates in the San Joaquin Valley. More than 70% of annual pesticide inputs from atmospheric deposition occurred during the winter, largely because most precipitation falls as snow. Endosulfan and chlordane concentrations in lichen increased with elevation, indicating that mountain cold-trapping might be an important control on accumulation of these compounds. By contrast, chlorpyrifos concentrations were inversely correlated with elevation, indicating that distance from source areas was the dominant control. Sediment concentrations were inversely correlated with elevation, possibly because of the organic carbon content of sediments but also perhaps the greater mobility of organic contaminants at lower elevations. Surface-water concentrations inferred from passive samplers were at subparts-per-trillion concentrations, indicating minimal exposure to aquatic organisms from the water column. Concentrations in sediment generally were low, except for dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane in Tenaya Lake, which exceeded sediment guidelines for protection of benthic organisms. Environ. Toxicol.

Annual accumulation of catchment-derived mineral matter peaks a number of times and there are changes in the deposition rate of organic matter. Based on evidence from the Lake Nautajarvi sediment record, the climate was characterised by a millennial-scale colder period that terminated at one or several cooling events around 8000 cal. yr BP. During one of these events, diatom composition undergoes a change from planktonic species dominance to more littoral species dominance at 8160 cal. yr BP, and a recovery around 8010 cal. yr BP. The timing of this 150-year-long diatom anomaly is convergent with increased catchment erosion and decreased organic matter accumulation. We interpret that during such a period, the environment was characterised by colder winter temperatures, prolonged duration of ice cover, higher than normal spring discharge and rapid development of thermal stratification in the spring, coupled with reduced water circulation and shorter growing seasons.

J	TULONEN, T				TULONEN, T			BACTERIAL PRODUCTION IN A MESOHUMIC LAKE ESTIMATED FROM [C-14] LEUCINE INCORPORATION RATE	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Incorporation of [C-14] leucine into proteins of bacteria was studied in a temperate mesohumic lake. The maximum incorporation of [C-14] leucine was reached at a concentration of 30 nm determined in dilution cultures. Growth experiments were used to estimate factors for converting leucine incorporation to bacterial cell numbers or biomass. The initially high conversion factors calculated by the derivative method decreased to lower values after the bacteria started to grow. Average conversion factors were 7.09 x 10(16) cells mol-1 and 7.71 x 10(15) mum3 mol-1, if the high initial values were excluded. Using the cumulative method, the average conversion factor was 5.38 x 10(15) mum3 mol-1. The empirically measured factor converting bacterial biomass to carbon was 0.36 pg C mum-3 or 33.1 fg C cell-1. Bacterial production was highest during the growing season, ranging between 1.8 and 13.2 mug C liter-1 day-1, and lowest in winter, at 0.2-2.9 mug C liter-1 day-1. Bacterial production showed clear response to changes in the phytoplankton production, which indicates that photosynthetically produced dissolved compounds were used by bacteria. In the epilimnion bacterial production was, on average, 19-33% of primary production. Assuming <50% growth efficiency for bacteria, the allochthonous organic carbon could have also been an additional energy and carbon source for bacteria, especially in autumn and winter. In winter, a strong relationship was found between temperature and bacterial production. The measuring of [C-14] leucine incorporation proved to be a simple and useful method for estimating bacterial production in humic water. However, an appropriate amount of [C-14]leucine has to be used to ensure the maximum uptake of label and to minimize isotope dilution.																			0095-3628					NOV-DEC	1993	26	3					201	217											24190090					WOS:A1993MP10300002

Reconstructing Holocene climate can provide critical insight into its forcing and future variability. However, quantitative reconstructions of Holocene summer precipitation are lacking for tropical and subtropical China, which is the core region of the EASM influence. Here we present high-resolution annual and summer rainfall reconstructions covering the whole Holocene based on the pollen record at Xinjie site from the lower Yangtze region. Summer rainfall was less seasonal and similar to 30% higher than modern values at similar to 10-6calkyr BP and gradually declined thereafter, which broadly followed the Northern Hemisphere summer insolation. Over the last two millennia, however, the summer rainfall has deviated from the downward trend of summer insolation. We argue that greenhouse gas forcing might have offset summer insolation forcing and contributed to the late Holocene rainfall anomaly, which is supported by the TraCE-21ka transient simulation. Besides, tropical sea-surface temperatures could modulate summer rainfall by affecting evaporation of seawater. The rainfall pattern concurs with stalagmite and other proxy records from southern China but differs from mid-Holocene rainfall maximum recorded in arid/semiarid northern China. Summer rainfall in northern China was strongly suppressed by high-northern-latitude ice volume forcing during the early Holocene in spite of high summer insolation. In addition, the El Nino/Southern Oscillation might be responsible for droughts of northern China and floods of southern China during the late Holocene. Furthermore, quantitative rainfall reconstructions indicate that the Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project (PMIP) simulations underestimate the magnitude of Holocene precipitation changes. Our results highlight the spatial and temporal variability of the Holocene EASM precipitation and potential forcing mechanisms, which are very helpful for calibration of paleoclimate models and prediction of future precipitation changes in East Asia in the scenario of global warming.

Impact of climate change on the Hii River basin and salinity in Lake Shinji: a case study using the SWAT model and a regression curve	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The impacts of climate change oil water resources were analysed for the Hii River basin and downstream Lake Shinji. The variation between saline and fresh water within these systems means that they encompass diverse ecosystems. Changes in evapotranspiration (ET), snow water equivalent, discharge into the basin, and lake salinity were determined for different climate scenarios. The impact of climate change on a brackish water clam found in the lake was then examined using simulated monthly variations of lake salinity and information from prior Studies of the clam. ET increased and snow water equivalent decreased for all scenarios incorporating temperature rise, particularly during the winter season. Furthermore, ET and snow water equivalent were not as sensitive to variations in precipitation and thus temperature rise was considered to be a major factor for these variables. Nevertheless, monthly discharge Volume was more influenced by variation in precipitation than variations in temperature. Discharge increased during both the summer and winter season, since precipitation contributed to river discharge instead of being stored as snow pack during the winter season. The magnitudes of salinity dilutions and concentrations predicted under the climate change scenarios Would not be lethal for adult clams. However, the egg-laying season of the clam would coincide with periods of strong salinity dilution in the lake. Since juveniles are less tolerant to changes in salinity, future generations of the clam may be affected and reproduction of the clam may be reduced by increasing precipitation in the future.

Such variations can affect the ecosystem services provided by mountain lakes, like freshwater supply for local population and regulation of nutrient cycling that supports biodiversity, impacting on a vital resource which serves as essential habitat for a wide range of plant and animal species as well. This study aims to examine the impacts of climate variability on Lake Azzurro, a small lake located in the municipality of Campodolcino in the Central Italian Alps. The lake follows a natural seasonal cycle, typically characterized by a reduction of water level from late summer to mid-autumn, followed by reappearance in late spring. However, since the early 2000s, it has experienced prolonged dry periods, specifically in 2005-2006, 2018, and 2022-2023. To investigate the relationship between lake's existence and climatological variables, weather data from a nearby meteorological station were analyzed. This was followed by an impact assessment based on high-resolution climate projections (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios) derived from Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC) models, with horizontal resolutions of 2.2 and 8 km, extending through the end of the century. The results suggest an increasing frequency of drying events that could lead to a progressive loss of this ecologically and culturally significant lake. Such a decline would have substantial implications for the ecosystem services it provides to both the local community and the broader region. The findings underscore an urgency for raising public awareness of the lake's vulnerability, a call for the development of comprehensive mitigation strategies, such as improved water resource management, biodiversity conservation, and the promotion of sustainable land-use practices within the lake's catchment area.																				2296-6463				OCT 2	2025	13								1656970	10.3389/feart.2025.1656970	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2025.1656970													WOS:001594296700001

Diet and relative weight in migratory walleye (Sander vitreus) of the Bay of Quinte and eastern Lake Ontario, 1992-2015	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Diet and relative weight were examined for Bay of Quinte-eastern Lake Ontario walleye (Sander vitreum) from 1992 to 2015. After spawning in the Bay of Quinte, mature walleye migrate to eastern Lake Ontario to spend the late-spring and summer; immature walleye remain in the Bay of Quinte year-round. Summer walleye diet was dominated by alewife which made up one-half the diet in the Bay of Quinte and nearly the entire diet in eastern Lake Ontario. The Bay of Quinte walleye diet was more diverse than that for Lake Ontario, particularly in the post-goby (round goby, Neogobius melanostomus) time-period. In addition to alewife, the Bay of Quinte walleye diet included yellow perch (Perca flavescens), white perch (Morone americana), gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum), and johnny darter (Etheostoma nigrum). Goby appeared in the walleye diet in 2003, and thereafter made up an average frequency of occurrence (FO) of 18%. Focusing on the large, migratory walleye and their alewife prey in eastern Lake Ontario, we found significant positive relationships among walleye relative weight (Wr), the size of alewife in the walleye diet, various measures of alewife prey availability, and spring water temperature. Based on the high prevalence of alewife in the walleye diet, we concluded that walleye migration to Lake Ontario and the availability of alewife present there is key to maintaining a large and productive Bay of Quinte walleye population.

Plasma NEFA profiles were also compared up- and downstream of the stations for differences in utilization of individual NEFA species as substrates for lipid oxidation. Significantly higher levels of total plasma NEFA were found in lake sturgeon upstream (2355 +/- 395.9 nmol/mL) compared with those downstream (798 +/- 133.5 nmol/mL) of the generating stations during the spring. The NEFA profiles for several key fatty acid species differed significantly among seasons up- and downstream of the facilities. In particular, during spring and summer, the levels of oleic acid (18:1n9) were highest upstream of the stations and levels of a polyunsaturated fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n3), were higher below rather than above the stations. The differences in plasma NEFA concentration may be attributed to altered nutritional Status due to the varying flow regime located downstream of the hydroelectric stations.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				NOV	1993	50	11					2440	2447		10.1139/f93-268	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f93-268													WOS:A1993MZ45600016

Exploring the fate, transport and risk of Perfluorooctane Sulfonate (PFOS) in a coastal region of China using a multimedia model	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL												Perfluorooctane Sulfonate (PFOS) and related substances have been widely applied in both industrial processes and domestic products in China. Exploring the environmental fate and transport of PFOS using modeling methods provides an important link between emission and multimedia diffusion which forms a vital part in the human health risk assessment and chemical management for these substances. In this study, the gridded fugacity based BETR model was modified to make it more suitable to model transfer processes of PFOS in a coastal region, including changes to PFOS partition coefficients to reflect the influence of water salinity on its sorption behavior. The fate and transport of PFOS in the Bohai coastal region of China were simulated under steady state with the modified version of the model. Spatially distributed emissions of PFOS and related substances in 2010 were estimated and used in these simulations. Four different emission scenarios were investigated, in which a range of half-lives for PFOS related substances were considered. Concentrations of PFOS in air, vegetation, soil, fresh water, fresh water sediment and coastal water were derived from the model under the steady-state assumption. The median modeled PFOS concentrations in fresh water, fresh water sediment and soil were 7.20 ng/L, 039 ng/g and 0.21 ng/g, respectively, under Emission Scenario 2 (which assumed all PFOS related substances immediately degrade to PFOS) for the whole region, while the maximum concentrations were 47.10 ng/L, 4.98 ng/g and 2.49 ng/g, respectively. Measured concentration data for PFOS in the Bohai coastal region around the year of 2010 were collected from the literature. The reliability of the model results was evaluated by comparing the range of modeled concentrations with the measured data, which generally matched well for the main compartments. Fate and transfer fluxes were derived from the model based on the calculated inventory within the compartments, transfer fluxes between compartments and advection fluxes between sub-regions. It showed that soil and costal water were likely to be the most important sinks of PFOS in the Bohai costal region, in which more than 90% of PFOS was stored. Flows of fresh water were the driving force for spatial transport of PFOS in this region. Influences of the seasonal change of fresh water fluxes on the model results were also analyzed. When only seasonal changes of the fresh water flow rates were considered, concentrations of PFOS in winter and spring were predicted to be higher than that under annual average conditions, while the concentrations in summer and autumn were lower. For PFOS fluxes entering the sea, opposite conclusions were drawn compared to the concentrations. Environmental risks from the presence of PFOS in fresh water were assessed for this region through comparison with available water quality criteria values. The predicted concentrations of PFOS in the Bohai coastal region provided by the model were lower than the water quality criteria published by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and Chinese researchers, while the concentrations in more than 80% of the sampling locations exceeded the European Union Water Framework Directive Environmental Quality Standards values. Seasonal variations of flow rate might cause a significant increase in environmental risks. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Bythotrephes drift density upstream and downstream of the station was highly variable with maximum densities of 23.3 individuals/100 m(3) (9 samples) in June 2010 and 9.4 individuals/100 m(3) in June 2012 (60 samples). In August and October of 2011, Bythotrephes were identified from the stomachs of eight cisco (Coregonus artedi) collected from the South basin of Lake Winnipeg near the mouth of the Winnipeg River, indicating that the invader had become part of the local food web. Subsequent targeted sampling for Bythotrephes with ship-based vertical plankton net (76 mu m mesh) tows at 65 offshore/pelagic sites in Lake Winnipeg during summer and fall of 2012 indicated that the invader had colonized the South basin by early August and had expanded its distribution into most of the North basin by early October. No individuals were captured at a site just past the lake outlet in the Nelson River. Densities of Bythotrephes in Lake Winnipeg ranged from 0 to 93.1 and 0 to 39.2 individuals/m(3) among sites for the summer and fall sampling, respectively. The highest mean density (9.2 individuals/m(3)) was observed for the South basin in the summer of 2012. Non-targeted kick-net sampling at Playgreen Lake, located on the Nelson River approximately 27 km north of the Lake Winnipeg outlet in August of 2012, confirmed the rapid northward expansion of Bythotrephes through Lake Winnipeg. This represents the first evidence for further downstream dispersal. However, as of August 2015, multiple kicknet and Ekman/Ponar grab samples from Cross and Sipiwesk lakes further downstream on the Nelson River have not captured any Bythotrephes.																			1798-6540	1818-5487				SEP	2017	12	3			SI		287	297		10.3391/ai.2017.12.3.03	http://dx.doi.org/10.3391/ai.2017.12.3.03													WOS:000413823900003

A field-based watershed-scale study was completed to investigate nutrient dynamics and hydrologic processes in an agriculturally-dominant clay plain system within the Great Lakes Basin. Spatial and temporal variations of nitrogen and phosphorus were examined by sampling groundwater and surface water regularly over a period of one year (June 2017 to July 2018) for nutrients including nitrate, soluble reactive phosphorus, total dissolved phosphorus and total reactive phosphorus. Nitrate transport from surrounding agricultural land to surface water was intensified with an increase in precipitation events in spring and early winter and phosphorus transport to surface water was increased during freeze-thaw cydes in the winter. The results are pertinent to the improvement of current nutrient and water management policies in clay plain systems where nutrient imbalances in surface water are a concern. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The strong vendace year-classes of the 1980s were followed by weak ones until 2000, when a stronger year-class emerged. Data on the vendace catch-at-age were collected from 1987 to 2001 and the year-class strengths (YCS) were estimated by the virtual population analysis (VPA). The YCS was estimated directly by survey trawling conducted annually in early fall aimed at 0+ fish and by seine netting in the following winter. Direct estimates were compared with VPA estimates. The trawl survey and winter seine data show that the YCS of vendace is discernible during the first year of their lifespan. As a practical application in fisheries management, these data can be used in adjusting of e.g. stocking of predatory salmonids.																			0003-455X					FEB 26	2004	41	1					249	254																WOS:000220364300028
J	Hamilton, R; Penny, D; Hua, Q				Hamilton, R.; Penny, D.; Hua, Q.			A 4700-year record of hydroclimate variability over the Asian monsoon intersection zone inferred from multi-proxy analysis of lake sediments	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												The sedimentology, geochemistry, and plant microfossils of volcanic lake sediments from Cambodia were analysed to reconstruct a 4700 year record of change in moisture availability. This site sits at the heart of the intersection zone of the East Asian and Indian summer monsoons - a climatic system that is socio-ecologically important but poorly understood. Proxies for lake deepening and shallowing indicate a stepwise weakening of the summer monsoon from c. 4700 to 1700 cal. years BP, after which it appears to gradually strengthen. This trend is punctuated by seven dry events between 4300 and 1540 cal. years BP. The results present one of the longest, continuous records of palaeo-hydrological change in the Asian monsoon intersection zone. In doing so, they suggest that the climate of the region was broadly comparable to the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) province to approximately 2240 cal. years BP, and the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) province between 2240 and 1700 cal. years BP. The subsequent, late Holocene hydroclimate appears to reflect a combination of both subsystems. These findings highlight dynamism in EASM and ISM dominance over mainland southeast Asia over the past five thousand years, but overall demonstrate regional vs. local scale influence on the hydroclimate of the region. The multi-decadal periods of strong drying that punctuate longer-term monsoon patterns demonstrate the natural variability of the mid- to late- Holocene climate of the intersection zone. This is of consequence given that apparently less severe drought events of the last millennium have had dramatic socio-economic consequences. Resultantly, planning for the resilience of socio-ecological systems within the region needs to account for the real potential of similar scale events occurring in the future, particularly given the increased extremes predicted for Asian summer monsoon region over the 21st century.

J	WILLIAMS, RM				WILLIAMS, RM			THE USE OF SCENT IN LIVE-TRAPPING MUSKRATS	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												At Gray''s Lake, Idaho, during the summer and early fall of 1949, 170 muskrats were live-trapped in 522 trap nights. With carrots as bait, trapping success averaged 23.6% in 279 trap nights. Following the addition of a commercially made muskrat scent to the usual bait, trapping success increased abruptly, averaging 42.8% in 243 trap nights. Other factors were apparently constant. The scent used is a thick, pasty liquid, and can be purchased from any of the trappers'' supply houses for $1.00 per ounce.																			0022-541X	1937-2817					1951	15	1					117	118		10.2307/3796787	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3796787													WOS:A1951YB65200025

Median enrichment factors for the heavy metals, relative to upper crustal abundances, are all much greater than 10 indicative of an anthropogenic origin. The Pb-206/Pb-207 values exhibit a large variation at both stations, with values of 1.170-1.190 and 1.130-1.150 recorded during the winter and summer seasons, respectively. The Pb isotope systematics defined by most of the samples from both stations may be explained by mixing of anthropogenic emissions from U.S. and Canadian sources. Comparison of Pb isotope ratios and heavy metal abundances between the same, individual precipitation events from both stations, however, do not systematically yield similar values and may be attributable to significant, local anthropogenic sources, The Sr-87/Sr-86 values for precipitations also exhibit a seasonal variation at both stations with the least radiogenic values being recorded, in general, during the winter months (<0.7085). These are possibly related to increased atmospheric emissions during the winter season from coal-fired power plants located in North America. For the remaining months the Sr-87/Sr-86 values are either variable (0.7085-0.7100) at St. Anicet or constant (0.7085-0.7088) at L'Assomption. The latter possibly reflect Sr anthropogenic emissions from urban activity associated with Montreal.

The properties and concentration of DOM in lakes are closely related to anthropogenic activities, terrigenous input, and phytoplankton growth. Thus, the lake's trophic state, along with the above factors, has an important effect on DOM. We determined the DOM sources and molecular composition in six lakes along a trophic gradient during and after phytoplankton bloom by combining optical techniques and the Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). CDOM pools in eutrophic lakes may be more biologically refractory than in oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes. Molecular formulas of DOM were positively correlated with the TSI (trophic state index) value (R-2 = 0.73), with the nitrogen-containing compounds (CHON) being the most abundant formulas in all studied lakes. Eutrophication modified the molecular formulas of DOM to have less CHO% and more heteroatom S-containing compounds (CHOS% and CHNOS%), and this was the synactic result of the anthropogenic perturbation and phytoplankton proliferation. In eutrophic lakes, summer DOM showed higher molecular lability than in autumn, which was related to the seasonal phytoplankton community succession. Although the phytoplankton-derived DOM is highly bioavailable, we detected a simpler and more fragile phytoplankton community ecosystem in autumn, which may be accompanied by a lower phytoplankton production and metabolic activity. Therefore, we concluded that the lake eutrophication increased the allochthonous DOM accumulation along with sewage and nutrient input, and subsequently increased its release with phytoplankton bloom. Eutrophication and phytoplankton growth are accompanied by more highly unsaturated compounds, O3S+O5S compounds, and carboxylic-rich alicyclic compounds (CRAMs), which are the biotransformation product of phytoplankton-derived DOM. Eutrophication may be a potential source of refractory DOM compounds for biodegradation and photodegradation. Our results can clarify the potential role of water organic matter in the future global carbon cycle processes, considering the increasing worldwide eutrophication of inland waters.

A spatio-temporal reconstruction of Holocene temperature change in southern Scandinavia	HOLOCENE												Holocene mean July (T-Jul) and mean January (T-Jan) temperatures were reconstructed at Lake Trehorningen in southwest Sweden using pollen-climate calibration functions and converted into anomalies relative to modern temperatures. The anomalies were applied to 28 meteorological stations in Denmark, with each station adjusted to account for spatial variability in both T-Jul and T-Jan. The resulting reconstructions were merged to create composite T-Jul and T-Jan records. The individual reconstructions were also used to establish the parameterization of the T-Jul and T-Jan values, resulting in Holocene temperature maps for all of Denmark. Low T-Jul values characterised southern Sweden and Denmark at the start of the Holocene, followed by an increase during the early Holocene. Likewise, TJan was initially low at the start of the Holocene, followed by an increase between 10 500 and 9900 cal. BP. Thereafter, T-Jan was relatively stable between 9900 and 8000 cal. BP. The general increase in temperature during the early Holocene was accompanied by a decrease in the amplitude of the mean monthly temperature record, indicating that a maritime climate was established at this time. Maximum T-Jul and T-Jan are recorded during the mid-Holocene interval from 8000 to 4500 cal. BP, with consistently high July temperatures (> 18 degrees C) between 6700 and 5400 cal. BP. During the late Holocene, both T-Jul and T-Jan gradually decreased. The Holocene temperature maps of Denmark reveal spatial patterns in both summer and winter temperature. In the summer, an east-west decreasing temperature gradient, related to a maritime effect, has persisted in Denmark throughout the Holocene. In contrast, the temperature in winter has varied spatially along subtle coastal-inland and topographical gradients. Various mechanisms have been invoked to explain the Holocene trends in temperature, including the melting of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet, changes in insolation, and changes in the dominant type of atmospheric circulation affecting northern Europe.

J	Koutaniemi, L; Kuusela, K				Koutaniemi, Leo; Kuusela, Kalevi			Water chemistry in Lake Paanajarvi and inflowing rivers, NW Russian Karelia	FENNIA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY												The purpose of this research project was to study the annual cycle of basic water properties in a lake covered by ice for about half the year close to the Arctic Circle. Samples were collected from the water column of the lake and the outlets of inflowing rivers with a Ruttner sampler from twelve locations during six visits in 1996-1997, a total of 31 samples each time. The analyses were made in accordance with the Finnish standards and included determinations of organic solids, alkalinity, colour, conductivity, total phosphorus (totP), total nitrogen (totN), ammonia (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-). Lake Paanajarvi is an east-west oriented tectonic lake (width 0.6-1.3 km, length 24.5 km, max. depth 128 m) surrounded by carbonate rich rocks and taiga forests. With over nine-tenths of the lake inflow into the western end and the outlet at the opposite eastern end of the lake, the topmost water layers of the lake behave much like a through-flow river. Most of these waters come from Finland and have been affected by human activity while all other inflowing waters drain from natural conditions. Seasonally, the winter time is characterized by the lowest of all colour values, the highest of all alkalinity contents, and by settling of phosphorus. All these features are mainly due to minimal discharges, high proportion of groundwater flow in relation to surface flow and calm conditions thanks to the ice-cover. Spring-time starts with violent nival floods in May associated with the maximal colour values, minimal alkalinity contents, and the rise of the spring turnover, temperature stratification and biotic activity which proceed in a wave-like fashion through the lake controlled by the through-flow and warming of river waters entering into the western inlet end of the lake. The uptake of nutrients is best seen in a rapid decrease of nitrate in the epilimnion in association with the increase of ammonia as a result of metabolism of organisms. The autumn turnover in late September and early October is associated with close to equal values of all parameters in the whole water column of the lake. The exhaustion of nitrate in the epilimnion suggests that nitrate may be a limiting factor for the biotic life. Other typical features of the lake are the lower temperatures and nutrient levels in the outlet deep compared to the inlet deep of the lake, and this may have led to adaptation and specialization among the biota within this "mini-Baikal" by Fennoscandian standards.																			0015-0010	1798-5617					2006	184	2					121	132																WOS:000216635700003

Calcium concentrations were around 20 mu eq 1(-1), less than the suggested critical value of 50 mu eq 1(-1), with hydrogen concentrations around 70 mu eq 1(-1), greater than the critical value of about 30 mu eq 1(-1). Limestone was applied by aerial application to the source areas of selected streams in 1990 with around 5% (15 ha) of the total catchment area of 270 ha treated at 10 tonnes ha(-1). Stream monitoring, carried out over the period 1989-1995, showed an immediate response to liming followed by a progressive decline. Calcium values were elevated to > 150 mu eq 1(-1) and hydrogen concentrations reduced to 20 mu eq 1(-1), reverting in time towards pre-liming values. Although salmonid survival was improved during low flow conditions in summer, only a few fry survived to the autumn as acid episodes increased and these were subsequently lost from the system during the winter period Budget calculations indicated losses of around 30% of the applied calcium during the first four years. Studies on the vegetation and soils revealed a greater than expected penetration of calcium to depth (10-20 cm) in the soil profile. Results suggest that source area liming at this rate has had minimal effects on the vegetation and by increasing the proportion of the catchment limed to 15% could have a much greater success in reducing the frequency of biologically damaging episodes.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				DEC	1995	85	2					1015	1020		10.1007/BF00476963	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00476963													WOS:A1995UB05300121

Comparisons between the structure of muscles in mid-winter and just before spring migration, after increase in muscle mass, revealed that fibre diameters had increased but the proportion of myofibrils decreased alongside a compensatory increase in mitochondria. The proportion of sarcoplasm did not change. Comparisons between the ultrastructures of muscles of C. canutus on arrival and just before departure from a spring migratory staging post, however, revealed no change in percentage composition accompanying hypertrophy. The functions of flight muscle hypertrophy in shorebirds are only incidentally related to breeding, as no differences between the sexes were noted and other proteinaceous tissues and organs contributed more to the overall increase in lean mass. Hypertrophy does not appear to occur in response to increased body mass; the control systems are probably complex.																			0030-5693					JUL-SEP	1992	23	3					238	243		10.2307/3676644	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3676644													WOS:A1992JP98300006

In three natural shallow lakes located in the southwest of France, several planktonic species typically encountered in tropical areas were observed during 2006 and 2007. The most representative taxa were Planktolyngbya microspira Kom. & Cronb. P. circumcreta (G. S. West) Anagn. & Kom., Cyanodictyon tropicale Senna, Delazari & Sant'Anna and Staurastrum excavatum var. planctonicum Krieg. These species had so far only been reported from African lakes and other tropical areas, but in this study they accounted for up to 58 and 12% of the total abundance and biomass, respectively, during spring and summer. Some of these lakes were studied in the 1970s and only exotic desmids were reported; but at that time, the three cited cyanobacteria were not described yet. Waterfowl are considered as the main dispersers because they migrate over long distances, transporting algae on the feet and feathers or in the digestive tract. In fact, the Aquitaine Region is one of the main bird migration corridors in Europe. Survival of cyanobacteria, diatoms and desmids carried by birds could be possible due to resting stages, sheaths investments or vegetative cells. In addition, global warming may have contributed to the success of these tropical species in temperate lakes. Indeed, minimal temperatures have increased significantly in the Aquitaine region over the last 30 years and could have played a key role in algal survival through winter.					, AGROCAMPUS OUEST/O-6651-2016	, AGROCAMPUS OUEST/0000-0002-1800-4558													0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2010	639	1					129	145		10.1007/s10750-009-0029-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-009-0029-x													WOS:000273447500012

Viral abundance ranged from 0.16 to 1.56 x 10(9) particles L-1 and bacterial abundances ranged from 0.10 to 0.24 x 10(9) cells L-1; with the lowest bacterial abundances noted in the winter months. Virus-to-bacteria ratios (VBR) were consistently low in both lakes throughout the season, ranging from 1.2 to 8.4. lysogenic bacteria, determined by induction with mitomycin C, were detected on three sampling occasions out of 10 in both lakes. In Lake Druzhby and Crooked Lake, lysogenic bacteria made up between 18% and 73% of the total bacteria population during the lysogenic events. Bacterial production ranged from 8.2 to 304.9 x 10(6) cells L-1 day(-1) and lytic viral production ranged from 47.5 to 718.4 x 10(6) viruslike particles L-1 day(-1). When only considering primary production, heterotrophic nanoflagellate (HNF) grazing and viral lysis as the major contributors to the DOC pool (i.e., autochthonous sources), we estimated a high contribution from viruses during the winter months when > 60% of the carbon supplied to the DOC pool originated from viral lysis. In contrast, during the summer < 20% originated from viral lysis. Our study shows that viral process in ultraoligotrophic Antarctic lakes may be of quantitative significance with respect to carbon flow especially during the dark winter period.

Urban, semi-rural, rural and forested sites were chosen on a transverse from West to East at the Paris latitude. Seasonal variations are described, with winter time concentrations 2-3 times higher than summer ones due to an increase in fossil fuel consumption in winter. When temperature did not exceed 12degreesC, mean PAH concentrations varied from 221 ng l(-1) in Paris to 25 ng l(-1) at a rural site. About 50 km far from Paris, PAH concentrations decreased by two-thirds. Urban emissions have a local impact on the fallout contamination. Fluxes at the Paris site (from 157-1294 ng m(-2) d(-1)) were from 2.5-6 times higher than in the rural and forested sites. In the latter sites, mean daily fluxes (50 ng m(-2) d(-1)) were close to those of high European mountains, considered as background levels. In rural sites, without treatment plant sludge spreading, atmospheric deposition is the major source of PAH inputs to soils. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

During the last 20 years, the quality and general usability of water in Pyhajarvi have shown considerable variation driven by both a variety of human activities and climate-related factors such as wet and dry years. The lake has been thoroughly studied for decades and has been the object of comprehensive restoration activities both in the catchment and in the lake since the 1990s. Large variety of water protection measures like wetlands, sedimentation ponds and filtering systems have been implemented in the catchment area to reduce external nutrient load. Another important tool for Pyhajarvi restoration is biomanipulation, done by local commercial fishermen in winter. Twenty-five percent of the annual phosphorus input is removed with fish catch. Currently, restoration work is facing new challenges: short or even nearly missing ice cover period and increased winter time nutrient load from the catchment. In the 2000s, there were 3 years with exceptionally short ice period, allowing only brief winter seining periods. Consequently, the biomanipulation catch was very low in 2007 and 2008 leading to observable food web effects. Phosphorus load was especially high in winters 2006/2007 and 2008/2009. On the basis of the data of 1987-2008, we have tested the hypothesis if climate-related winter time variables like phosphorus load, air temperature and precipitation would affect the water quality of the lake in following summer, here measured as chlorophyll a concentration in the lake water. A linear model has been used and a validation procedure has been performed to select the best variables. Our results indicate some of the linkages between climate-related catchment processes and the ecological status of the lake.					; Sarvala, Jouko/J-8962-2019; Helminen, Harri/HZJ-8267-2023	Lendasse, Amaury/0000-0001-5410-4751; Tarvainen, Marko/0000-0003-2894-3572; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2011	660	1					49	58		10.1007/s10750-010-0415-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0415-4													WOS:000285064600006
J	Momen, B; Eichler, LW; Boylen, CW; Zehr, JP				Momen, B; Eichler, LW; Boylen, CW; Zehr, JP			Are recent watershed disturbances associated with temporal and spatial changes in water quality of Lake George, New York, USA?	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Lake George, a mesooligotrophic lake, is a historically important recreational site in northeastern New York, USA. A preliminary analysis of the data, collected during 1980-1990, suggested that the indicators of primary productivity have increased, particularly in the southern basin of the lake. This change was attributed to the recent increases in the urbanization and development of the southern shorelines. The suggestion of temporal and spatial degradation in lakewater quality has caused substantial concerns among the decision makers and the public alike. The main objective of this study is to evaluate possible eutrophication of the lake by quantification of temporal and spatial trends in concentrations of total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll a (Chl a), silica (Si), and chloride (Cl) through the use oi proper statistical techniques. Results indicate no statistically significant changes in the concentrations of TP, Chl a, or Si in the spring or summer from 1981 to 1993. A significant temporal trend of increase in Cl concentration is, however, detected. This is perhaps the strongest evidence that the development of the Lake George watershed has affected lakewater chemistry in spring, the concentrations of TP, Chl a, Si, and Cl, averaged over all 13 years, were higher in the south basin, but differences are not statistically significant (i.e., P > 0.05). In summer, Si was slightly but significantly lower, and Cl was nonsignificantly higher in the south basin. Significant interactions between temporal and spatial changes are detected based only on summer values of TP and Chl a, indicating differential trends of change for these two variables in the south and north basins during the last 13 years.

Average concentrations of particulate mercury (PHg, in pg/m(3)) were 16.6 for PM2.5 and 24.2 for TSP. Particulate mercury was mainly present in the fine mode, with 68.5% of the total PHg being present in PM2.5. Obvious seasonal variations were observed for both PM2.5 and TSP. The dry deposition flux of PHg over the ECS was estimated to be 1.69 mu g m(-2) yr(-1). Three episodes of high PHg concentrations were observed during the sampling period. An episode in fall (84.1 pg/m(3) in TSP) was induced by biomass burning in East China, and PHg was more concentrated in the fine mode (PM2.5/TSP = 0.91). An episode in winter was triggered by serious anthropogenic emissions in northern China, with PHg levels reaching 132.7 pg/m(3) in TSP. An episode in spring was attributed to the long-range transport of Asian dust mixed with anthropogenic aerosols, with increased levels of PHg in the coarse mode (PM2.5/TSP = 0.61). Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning from the Asian mainland were the two major sources of atmospheric PHg over the ECS.

Seasonal differences in ecological processes correspond to the two major stratification patterns and result in seasonal differences in pelagic community structure. The winter mixed period (November-March) provides light and temperatures suitable for active nutrient regeneration and uptake, population growth of edible phytoplankton and crustacean zooplankton, and low bacterial abundance and production. Monthly estimates of daily primary productivity are in the mesoeutrophic range (40-1,420 mg C m(-2) d(-1)); however, mean annual primary productivity is in the eutrophic range (500 mg C m(-2) yr(-1)) because of greater activity in winter and an extended ''growing season.'' The stratified period (April-October) is characterized by rapid development of hypolimnetic anoxia, high bacterial production, cyanobacteria and large algae, heterotrophic flagellates, ciliates, rotifers, small cyclopoid copepods, and Chaoborus. Heterotrophic activity, HPLC chlorophyll a, and grazer activity were highest at the epilimnetio-metalimnetic boundary. Bacterial abundances (1.5-32 x 10(6) cells ml(-1)) increased in the hypolimnion during the stratified period. Long-term (1978-1994) warming within the water column (0.061-0.10 degrees C yr(-1)) follows midwinter (January) air temperature trends. Using Lake Oglethorpe as an analog, we predict as consequences of climatic warming in northern dimictic lakes: increases in nutrient cycling rates, winter primary and secondary productivity, summer heterotrophic production, and microbial components of the food web.																			0024-3590					JUL	1996	41	5					1041	1051		10.4319/lo.1996.41.5.1041	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1996.41.5.1041													WOS:A1996VN45800027

Photomirex to mirex ratios (P/M) increased in the stratified surface layer of the lake from spring to autumn and in water from Oswego harbor.

The ratios in the St. Lawrence sediment and water were greater than 0.30. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that photomirex in Lake Ontario is produced by the photolysis of mirex present in the surface waters.

Cockshoot Broad (mean depth 1 m, area of open water 3.3 ha) was isolated from the sewage-effluent contaminated River Bure in 1982. About 70 cm of sediment were pumped out at the same time and settled in a remote lagoon. The total phosphorus and phytoplankton chlorophyll a concentrations rapidly fell and large numbers of large-bodied Daphnia were present. The zooplanktivorous fish stock was probably then very low. Submerged macrophytes colonized one area (the Dyke) heavily but more slowly over the main basin. 2. These conditions lasted until 1985 by which time the fish stocks had increased, the Daphnia declined, and plants disappeared from the main basin. Plant communities remained stable in the Dyke. Chlorophyll a increased in the main basin and remained at a high value until 1988. 3. In early 1989, virtually all of the fish community was manually removed. Daphnia numbers recovered, chlorophyll a concentrations fell and plants began to recolonize the main basin. Recolonizing fish were removed in successive winters and chlorophyll has remained low and Daphnia high except in 1992. In that year, an estuarine mysid, Neomysis integer, colonized the Broad when the dams separating it from the river were overtopped. This was a consequence of low fluvial flows in a drought period and was apparently only a temporary set-back. There was also a loss of macrophytes from the dyke in 1991/92. This is thought to have resulted from bird damage to the overwintering inocula in a cold spring. 4. In 'low Daphnia-high fish' years, there was a significant positive correlation between total P and chlorophyll, but not in 'high Daphnia-low fish' years. Overall, however, there was no correlation between chlorophyll and nutrients but a strong inverse correlation with Daphnia numbers. The nutrient conditions supporting phytoplankton and macrophyte dominance overlapped and the two conditions are seen as alternative stable states. The results are discussed in the context of a general hypothesis of change with eutrophication in shallow lakes.

Karla, Greece)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The reconstructed Lake Karla, Greece, has been undergoing its water-filling period since November 2009. In this paper, we aimed at investigating whether the unicellular eukaryotes, including the toxic/parasitic ones, that have been found during mass fish kills in the lake (March-April 2010), persist during the first warm period of the lake (May, August, November 2010). Given that microscopic characterization of some of these eukaryotes is not adequate for their identification, we analysed the 18S rRNA gene diversity of plankton samples. All the found phylotypes belonged to the phyla of Mesomycetazoa, Chlorophyta, Fungi, Alveolata, Cercozoa, Cryptophyta and Stramenopiles. Some members of these groups seem to persist in Lake Karla as they have been found in early spring as well. These microscopic eukaryotes are either ichthyotoxic/parasitic (e.g. Pfiesteria sp./Pseudopfiesteria shumwayae, some Fungi, Mesomycetazoa, Lagenidium sp., Cercozoa) or indicative of hyper-eutrophic conditions (e.g. Oocystis sp., Scenedesmus spp.) and were rather abundant during the first spring-autumn period of the lake's refilling process. These complex microscopic communities are expected to shape highly dynamic and variable food webs with the risk of repeated fish kills.					; Karayanni, Hera/AFH-8735-2022; Nikouli, Eleni/ADV-0565-2022; Kormas, Konstantinos (Kostas)/V-9336-2017; Berillis, Panagiotis/H-4826-2019	Moustaka-Gouni, Maria/0000-0002-0845-1928; Karayanni, Hera/0000-0001-7099-5611; Kormas, Konstantinos (Kostas)/0000-0002-8214-0175; Berillis, Panagiotis/0000-0001-5072-2245; Nikouli, Eleni/0000-0002-2941-5053													0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2013	718	1					73	83		10.1007/s10750-013-1604-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-013-1604-8													WOS:000324636600006

In this study, we attempt to reveal possible delayed effects of meteorological changes on mixed populations of water frogs living in small water bodies located in the Tiber River basin, by using a time-lagged correlation analysis. The analysis shows that the temperature-precipitation pattern induces definite delayed effects, which suggest two potential, possibly co-occurring, explanatory effects: (I) a cumulative and symmetric effect on mortality and (II) a point and asymmetric effect on recruitment. Our data suggest that the water availability in late summer-early autumn affects the survival of tadpoles and migrating frogs, with no differential effect on the parental species Pelophylax bergeri and the hybrid Pelophylax kl. hispanicus, whereas autumn precipitation has a greater impact on the fecundity and/or reproductive success of the parental species. The best time-lagged regression equations between population data and the annual de Martonne aridity index (I (DMa)) indicate that I (DMa) < 20 mm A degrees C-1 is critical for the persistence of the water frogs, and predict that the studied populations will experience a significant decline within the current scenario of climate change.

Effects of structure and volcanic stratigraphy on groundwater and surface water flow: Hat Creek basin, California, USA	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Hydrogeologic systems in the southern Cascade Range in California (USA) develop in volcanic rocks where morphology, stratigraphy, extensional structures, and attendant basin geometry play a central role in groundwater flow paths, groundwater/surface-water interactions, and spring discharge locations. High-volume springs (greater than 3 m(3)/s) flow from basin-filling (< 800 ka) volcanic rocks in the Hat Creek and Fall River tributaries and contribute approximately half of the average annual flow of the Pit River, the largest tributary to Shasta Lake. A hydrogeologic conceptual framework is constructed for the Hat Creek basin combining new geologic mapping, water-well lithologic logs, a database of active faults, LiDAR mapping of faults and volcanic landforms, streamflow measurements and airborne thermal infrared remote sensing of stream temperature. These data are used to integrate the geologic structure and the volcanic and volcaniclastic stratigraphy to create a three-dimensional interpretation of the hydrogeology in the basin. Two large streamflow gains from focused groundwater discharge near Big Spring and north of Sugarloaf Peak result from geologic barriers that restrict lateral groundwater flow and force water into Hat Creek. The inferred groundwater-flow barriers divide the aquifer system into at least three leaky compartments. The two downstream compartments lose streamflow in the upstream reaches (immediately downstream of the groundwater-flow barriers) and gain in downstream reaches with the greatest inflows immediately upstream of the barriers.

Aquatic systems are significant CH4 sources but uncertainty surrounds their estimated source strengths. There is limited understanding of CH4 concentrations variability in both space and time (dynamics) and the responsible drivers. Water column CH4 dynamics were investigated in three subtropical freshwater reservoirs in Southeast Queensland, Australia, during four seasons in 2011-2012. The reservoirs (Little Nerang Dam-LND, Lake Baroon-LB and Lake Wivenhoe-LW) are of different sizes and characteristics. Overall, CH4 concentrations were significantly higher in the strongly stratified LND (0.03-361 A mu M) with a more forested catchment and sheltered landscape, intermediate in LB (0.05-220 A mu M) and lowest in the relatively well-mixed LW (0.04-150 A mu M) in a more open grassland landscape. CH4 concentrations were highest in summer and spring when the reservoirs were strongly stratified and lowest in winter when the reservoirs were more mixed with deeper dissolved oxygen penetration. Concentrations were also highest in the anoxic water column and often had minima at the oxycline when stratification occurred. Highest CH4 concentrations were predominantly at the sediment-water interface but there were indications of high CH4 production within the anoxic water column in both LB and LND. Moderate CH4 peaks were consistently observed in the oxic subsurface water in all reservoirs likely increasing diffusive CH4 fluxes. DO was a strong proxy for methanotrophy while methanogenesis was best indicated by the oxidation-reduction potential of the water column. Microbial community analysis revealed methanotrophs throughout the water column but methanogenic Archaea mainly proliferated below the oxycline. This is the first comprehensive field-based study towards understanding of CH4 dynamics in subtropical freshwater systems.					; Fan, Lu/J-7706-2017; yuan, zhiguo/C-4980-2013; Yuan, Zhiguo/C-4980-2013	Grinham, Alistair/0000-0001-8313-2276; yuan, zhiguo/0000-0002-7566-1482; 													0168-2563	1573-515X				MAR	2016	128	1-2					233	255		10.1007/s10533-016-0206-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-016-0206-8													WOS:000374557300015

Ice-marginal lake hydrology and the seasonal dynamical evolution of Kennicott Glacier, Alaska	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												Glacier basal motion is responsible for the majority of ice flux on fast-flowing glaciers, enables rapid changes in glacier motion and provides the means by which glaciers shape alpine landscapes. In an effort to enhance our understanding of basal motion, we investigate the evolution of glacier velocity and ice-marginal lake stage on Kennicott Glacier, Alaska, during the spring-summer transition, a time when subglacial drainage is undergoing rapid change. A complicated record of > 50 m fill-and-drain sequences on a hydraulically-connected ice-marginal lake likely reflects the punctuated establishment of efficient subglacial drainage as the melt season begins. The rate of change of lake stage generally correlates with diurnal velocity maxima, both in timing and magnitude. At the seasonal scale, the up-glacier progression of enhanced summer basal motion promotes uniformity of daily glacier velocity fluctuations throughout the 10 km study reach, and results in diurnal velocity patterns suggesting increasingly efficient meltwater delivery to and drainage from the subglacial channel system. Our findings suggest the potential of using an ice-marginal lake as a proxy for subglacial water pressure, and show how widespread basal motion affects bulk glacier behavior.					; Armstrong, William/JFS-3710-2023	Anderson, Robert/0000-0003-2759-4833; Armstrong, William/0000-0002-5581-6109													0022-1430	1727-5652				OCT	2020	66	259					699	713	PII S0022143020000416	10.1017/jog.2020.41	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jog.2020.41													WOS:000573265700001
J	GOLDMAN, CR; LUBNOW, FS				GOLDMAN, CR; LUBNOW, FS			SEASONAL INFLUENCE OF CALCIUM MAGNESIUM ACETATE ON MICROBIAL PROCESSES IN 10 NORTHERN CALIFORNIAN LAKES	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING												Conventional road salt has long been responsible for corrosive effects on cars and highway structures, as well as some undesirable impacts on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. This has resulted in investigations of a variety of alternative deicing compounds. Early studies in northern California demonstrated the formation of a salt-stabilized chemocline in Putt's Lake along Interstate 80 in the Sierra Nevada. Current studies on natural populations of algae and bacteria indicate that calcium magnesium acetate (CMA) appears to be a good alternative to sodium chloride. Bioassays of 10 northern Californian lakes were conducted in situ with various concentrations of CMA. During the summer, eight out of the 10 lakes showed no significant response in algal biomass with the CMA concentrations. Bioassays done during the late spring and early winter showed only slight deviations from these results. Temperature, prevailing weather conditions, and standing stock of microbial populations appear to be the dominant factors in determining whether or not an algal response was evident in these seasonal CMA bioassays. In a series of laboratory bioassays with natural microbial communities from Castle Lake, CMA had no significant effects on primary production or the uptake of acetate by bacteria. A significant increase in phosphorus uptake by the "algal" fraction ( > 3 mum) in lakewater occurred at CMA concentrations of 10 ppm. This increase in P-uptake was attributed to bacteria that were associated with detrital particles in the water. At the same time we observed a significant decrease in algal biomass. Within the scope of this investigation, CMA appeared to have minimal effects on phytoplankton biomass other than the observed stimulation of P-uptake which may be due to competition between the natural bacterial and algal populations.																			0921-3449					OCT	1992	7	1-3					51	67		10.1016/0921-3449(92)90006-N	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0921-3449(92)90006-N													WOS:A1992JW53100005

However, modern calibrations of this proxy have primarily relied on air rather than in situ soil temperatures, which can differ by more than 10 C-o. Furthermore, the influence of other parameters such as temperature seasonality and soil chemistry on brGDGT lipids is not fully understood. We measured brGDGT distributions, in situ soil temperatures, pH, soil water content, and electrical conductivity on soils from the Eastern Canadian Arctic and Iceland. We compiled our results with those of published soil brGDGT studies that also provide in situ soil temperatures and ancilliary measurements and generated global temperature and pH calibrations from the resulting dataset. Soil temperatures outperformed air temperatures in these calibrations, with mean summer soil temperature providing the highest-performing fit among the 10 tested soil temperature parameters. When applied to a loess/paleosol sequence from the Chinese Loess Plateau, these new calibrations produced paleotemperature and paleo-pH histories consistent with the results of previous studies, encouraging the application of our new calibrations on a broader scale. We also detected 7-methyl and IIIa" brGDGT isomers in our Eastern Canadian Arctic and Iceland soils, which have been shown in lakes to relate to salinity and anoxia, respectively. While neither correlated with bulk soil properties such as conductivity, soil water content, or pH, these brGDGT isomers did correlate with seasonality and winter soil temperature. We hypothesize that these compounds are generated in winter by bacteria in habitable niches of more saline, sometimes anoxic liquid water in the otherwise frozen soil matrix. Finally, we report the presence of overly branched GDGTs with m/z = 1064 and suggest that these heptamethylated tetraethers should be investigated as a potential tool for improving brGDGT calibrations. Overall, our results expand our understanding of the seasonality of brGDGT production, especially at high latitudes, and provide in situ soil temperature and pH calibrations for global use.

Human-caused alterations to this system threaten to compromise the long-term viability of these bird populations due to the role of water in driving habitat suitability. Little is known, however, about the patch-scale habitat selection strategies of waterbirds within Poyang. Consequently, there is potential for spatial incongruence between protected area boundaries and key habitats given the system's high variability. This study used scan and focal sampling techniques to investigate patch selection by a wintering population of the Eurasian Spoonbill (Platalea leucorodia) within the Sha Hu sub-lake basin of Poyang Lake. Eurasian Spoonbills averaged higher foraging success rates in areas with water depth of 28.1-36.6 cm compared to other areas and preferred to forage in this depth class, as indicated by usage disproportionate to availability (Manly's standardized selection index = 0.817). Defining the patch-scale habitat selection of this indicator species both quantifies the impact of hydrological changes on resource availability and spatially predicts suitable areas for wintering birdlife within a dynamic environment.

J	Qiao, L; Mayer, C; Liu, SY				Qiao, Liu; Mayer, Christoph; Liu, Shiyin			Distribution and interannual variability of supraglacial lakes on debris-covered glaciers in the Khan Tengri-Tumor Mountains, Central Asia	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Supraglacial lakes are widely formed on debris-covered glaciers in the Khan Tengri-Tumor Mountains (KTTM), Tianshan, Central Asia. Study of their distribution characters based on regional-wide remote sensing investigations is still lacking, but it can promote our understanding about the influence of supraglacial lakes on the surface melting, hydrology and dynamics of debris-covered glaciers in this region. This study presents results of the supraglacial lake inventory in the KTTM region, based on multi-year Landsat images. We focus on the glacio-geomorphological characters of the supraglacial lakes and their late summer conditions, since all suitable Landsat images were acquired between August and September during 1990-2011. With a minimum threshold extent of 3600 m(2) for conservative mapping results, we totally mapped 775 supraglacial lakes and 38 marginal glacial lakes on eight huge debris-covered glaciers. Supraglacial lakes are concentrated on the Tumor Glacier and the South Inylchek Glacier, two biggest glaciers in this region. Although most supraglacial lakes are short-lived, a number of lakes can be repeatedly identified between different Landsat images. Detailed investigation of these 'perennial' lakes on the Tumor Glacier indicates that their filling frequency and area contributions have increased since 2005. Analysis of the area-elevation distributions for all mapped supraglacial lakes shows that they predominantly occur close to the altitude of 3250 ma. s. l., as high as the lowest reach of clean ice where surface debris begins to appear, and can further develop upglacier to a limit of about 3950 ma. s. l.. Total and mean area of supraglacial lakes in the KTTM region during the late summer seasons show great variability between years. Correlation analysis between the annual lake area and the observed nearby meteorological conditions suggests that warmer springs seem related to the draining of some supraglacial lakes during the following seasons, due to the evolution of glacial drainage from unconnected to connected systems by enhanced ablation during the springs.

J	Seifert, LI; Scheu, S				Seifert, Linda I.; Scheu, Stefan			Linking aquatic and terrestrial food webs - Odonata in boreal systems	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. It is increasingly realised that aquatic and terrestrial systems are closely linked. We investigated stable isotope variations in Odonata species, putative prey and basal resources of aquatic and terrestrial systems of northern Mongolia during summer. 2. In permanent ponds, delta 13C values of Odonata larvae were distinctly lower than those of putative prey, suggesting that body tissue comprised largely of carbon originating from isotopically light carbon sources. Presumably, prey consumed during autumn and winter when carbon is internally recycled and/or methanotrophic bacteria form an important basal resource of the food web. In contrast, in a temporary pond, delta 13C values of Odonata larvae were similar to those of putative prey, indicating that their body carbon originated mainly from prey species present. 3. Changes in delta 15N and delta 13C values between larvae and adults were species specific and reflected differential replacement of the larval isotopic signature by the terrestrial diet of adult Odonata. The replacement was more pronounced in Odonata species of permanent ponds than in those of the temporary pond, where larvae hatched later in the year. Replacement of larval carbon varied between tissues, with wings representing the larval isotopic signature whereas thoracic muscles and eggs reflected the delta 15N and delta 13C values of the terrestrial diet of adults. 4. The results suggest that because of their long larval development, Odonata species of permanent ponds carry the larval signature, which is partly replaced during their terrestrial life. Terrestrial prey forms the basis for egg production and thus the next generation of aquatic larvae. In temporary ponds, in contrast, Odonata species rely on prey from a single season, engage in a prolonged aquatic phase and hatch later, leaving less time to acquire terrestrial prey resources for offspring production. Stable isotope analysis provided important insights into the food webs of the waterbodies and their relationship to the terrestrial system.

The applicability of coliforms and coliphages as indicators for RVA was evaluated in this study. The abundance of RVA, 'SUSP2', a novel 'superspreader' somatic coliphage, MS2, a male-specific coliphage, and coliforms were monitored in two lakes located in the neighboring cities of Mumbai and Thane, India. RVA was detected in 71% and 60% of the composite samples collected from Powai lake in Mumbai and Masunda lake in Thane, respectively. MS2 was detected in 81% and 79%, while SUSP2 was detected in 75% and 81% of the composite samples from Powai lake and Masunda lake, respectively. The maximum RVA, MS2, and SUSP2 concentrations in the composite samples from Powai lake were 5.47 x 10(5), 6.75 x 10(2), and 3.47 x 10(3) copies per 100 mL, respectively, while, the corresponding values for Masunda lake were 2.13 x 10(4), 2.61 x 10(4), and 2.21 x 10(4) copies per 100 mL, respectively. The viral counts were found to be lowest during the monsoon and highest during winter. For samples collected from these lakes, the seasonal correlation between RVA and the indicators was analyzed using Spearman's rank correlation. The coliphages showed a moderate to strong positive correlation with RVA particularly in winter and demonstrated a Spearman correlation coefficient (rho) in the range of 0.59-0.87 (p < 0.05). However, in the summer and monsoon, a significant correlation between the coliphage, MS2, and RVA was observed only in Powai lake. Thus, coliphages are good indicators of RVA, especially in the winter months, when the occurrence of RVA in the lakes is highest. In the summer and monsoon, both coliphages and coliforms need to be monitored to predict the presence of RVA with a higher degree of confidence. Principal component analysis (PCA) and binary logistic regression (BLR) also confirmed MS2 as a better indicator of RVA. Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) ranged between 0.46-0.74 (p < 0.05). This is the first study reporting the viral load in surface water bodies in India across seasons and the correlation between RVA and coliphages.					; Mukherji, Suparna/I-6018-2018; Pisharody, Lakshmi/AAY-7592-2021	PISHARODY, LAKSHMI/0000-0001-8966-6308; Mukherji, Suparna/0000-0001-5722-3369; 													2053-1400	2053-1419				JAN 1	2022	8	1					139	150		10.1039/d1ew00604e	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ew00604e		NOV 2021											WOS:000721884300001

Rapid decline in river icings detected in Arctic Alaska: Implications for a changing hydrologic cycle and river ecosystems	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Arctic river icings are surface ice accumulations that can be >10km(2) in area and >10m thick. They commonly impact the hydrology, geomorphology, and ecology of Arctic river environments. Previous examination of icing dynamics in Arctic Alaska found no substantial changes in extent through 2005. However, here we use daily time series of satellite imagery for 2000-2015 to demonstrate that the temporal persistence and minimum summertime extent of large icings in part of Arctic Alaska and Canada have declined rapidly. We identified 122 large ephemeral icings, and 70 are disappearing significantly earlier in the summer, with a mean trend of -1.60.9day(-1) for fully ephemeral features. Additionally, 14 of 25 icings that usually persist through the summer have significantly smaller minimum extents (-2.61.6%yr(-1)). These declines are remarkably rapid and suggest that Arctic hydroclimatic systems generating icings, and their associated ecosystems, are changing rapidly. Plain Language Summary Liquid water emerging from groundwater and flowing through Arctic rivers during the winter often freezes into large ice features, which are called river icings. These icings, which are found in nearly all parts of the Arctic, create wide, gravelly river channels that can be important habitat for animals. When icings melt during the summer, they help keep rivers flowing when other water sources are limited. Up until now, no study has systematically looked at whether these features are changing in response to warming temperatures. We use daily satellite imagery available over northern Alaska from 2000 to 2015 in order to test whether icings are becoming smaller or disappearing earlier in the summer. Of 147 features examined, we found that 84 are either becoming smaller (for those that persist throughout the summer) or are disappearing earlier (for those that fully melt each summer). None are becoming larger or disappearing later. These changes may be directly related to warming temperatures, but they may also be happening because climate change is altering how rivers and groundwater interact. If these trends continue, we may see changes in the form of many Arctic rivers and impacts on the habitat of animals like fish and caribou.

The hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in precipitation falling in the Lake Hulun Basin were compared with those in water samples from the lake and from the local river, well and spring water during both freezing and non-freezing periods in 2017. The results showed that the local meteoric water line equation in the Lake Hulun area is D = 6.68 O-18 - 5.89 parts per thousand (R-2 = 0.96) and the main source of water supply in the study area is precipitation. Long-term groundwater monitoring data revealed that the groundwater is effectively recharged by precipitation through the aeration zone. Exchanges between the various compounds during the strong evaporative fractionation process in groundwater are responsible for the gradual depletion of O-18. The lake is recharged by groundwater during the non-freezing period, as shown in the map constructed to show the recharge and discharge relationships between the lake and groundwater. The steadily rising lake water levels in the summer mean that the water level before the freeze is high and consequently the water in the lake drains into the surrounding groundwater via faults along both sides of the lake during the frozen period. The groundwater is discharged into the lake in the west and into the Urson River in the east due to the Cuogang uplift.

The ponds were comprised of an upper mixed layer overlying a salt-stabilized density gradient in which planktonic communities were primarily embedded. Plankton comprised all components of the "microbial loop", though carnivorous protists were rare. As the ponds froze and light became increasingly limited, it was expected conditions would induce physiological changes altering the functional role of autotrophic and heterotrophic microplankton within the ponds. The results showed that microbial groups responded to the onset of winter by declining in abundance, though an exception was the appearance of filamentous cyanobacteria in the water column in March. As freezing progressed, autotrophs declined more rapidly than heterotrophs and grazing rates and abundances of mixotrophic and heterotrophic organisms increased. Grazing pressure on bacteria and picophytoplankton also increased, in part explaining their decline over time. The results indicate that stressors imposed during freezing select for increasing heterotrophy within the remaining microbial communities, although all components of the food web eventually decline as the final freeze approaches.					; Sorrell, Brian/L-1351-2013	Safi, Karl/0000-0002-7785-1909; Hawes, Ian/0000-0003-2471-6903; Sorrell, Brian/0000-0002-2460-8438													0954-1020	1365-2079				DEC	2012	24	6					571	588		10.1017/S0954102012000636	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954102012000636													WOS:000311918400005

By measuring carbon and nitrogen isotopic signatures, food sources and organism trophic levels can be tracked, providing quantitative estimates of bi-dimensional niches. In order to describe some general patterns of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope signatures in lakes, we applied SIA to zooplankton community in five subalpine lakes sampled in spring and summer along a trophic gradient (from oligotrophy to hypereutrophy). Within zooplankton taxa, temporal variation in food sources and trophic levels were compared to find out taxon-specific patterns. Carbon and nitrogen isotopic signatures differed among the five lakes, reflecting depth, topography, and trophic status of the lakes. Carbon isotopic signatures varied more considerably in deeper and larger lakes (Mergozzo and Pusiano) than in a shallower and smaller lake (Lake Endine). Nitrogen isotopic signatures were generally more enriched in lakes Pusiano and Moro than in Lake Mergozzo, whereas in summer, they were depleted in all lakes. These observations indicate that zooplankton taxa specific trophic roles differed among lakes and in time.

Phytomass and nutrient value of Potamogeton crispus L. in the water courses of Nile Delta, Egypt	RENDICONTI LINCEI-SCIENZE FISICHE E NATURALI												The present study aims to assess the phenology, biomass, chemical composition and nutritional value of Potamogeton crispus L. in the water courses of Nile Delta, Egypt. The sampling process was carried out seasonally using 60 quadrats each of 1 x 1 m distributed along 13 irrigation and two drainage canals in 5 locations of the area under study. Growth of P. crispus was markedly seasonal, starting in autumn and reaching the maximum phytomass yield in spring (400 g DM m(-2)). The mean biomass of the drainage canals (238 g DM m(-2)) was significantly lower than that of the irrigation canals (399 g DM m(-2)). The concentrations of P, Ca, Mg and Na in P. crispus were highest at the beginning of the growing season (autumn) and decreased throughout the population growth, while Mn and Cu showed the opposite trend. In addition, the concentrations of Mg, Pb and Zn in this plant in the drainage canals were significantly higher than those in the irrigation canals. The nutritive values of P. crispus are within the range of feed nutritive value for sheep, goat, dairy and beef cattle. P. crispus could be considered as a nutrients and heavy metals remover for wastewater treatment if it is harvested during its peak of biomass production. As feed supplement for animals and waterfowl, this plant could be considered excellent because of its high levels of total carbohydrate, total protein, digestible crude protein, total digestible nutrients and the lower crude fibre contents, provided that the concentration of heavy metals is not above the nutritional thresholds.

A bathymetric map was made revealing a maximum depth of 317 m and volume of 30.2 km3. The lake lies in an area of cold steppe climate with strong winds. No thermal stratification was detected possibly due to the strong summer winds. The lake is transparent during autumn, when winds diminish, but during summer transparency is very low due to an increase of glacier sediments. The euphotic layer varies between 17 m (January 1989) and 34 m (May 1989) of depth. Some chemical conditions are within the ranges of oligotrophic lakes. In phytoplankton, Chlorophyceae - with the species Monoraphidium saxatile and Gomphosphaeria lacustris - are predominant. Chlorophyll a concentrations are low, but primary productivity is relatively high. According to the informations obtained during the present work, Lake del Toro can be considered as oligotrophic, temperate, deep and of glacier origin with influence of glacier sediment. Due to wind force it is a polymictic lake without stratification.																			0003-9136					JAN	1994		1-2		99			199	215																WOS:A1994PB25500007

Snowpack Distribution Using Topographical, Climatological and Winter Season Index Inputs	ATMOSPHERE												A majority of the annual precipitation in many mountains falls as snow, and obtaining accurate estimates of the amount of water stored within the snowpack is important for water supply forecasting. Mountain topography can produce complex patterns of snow distribution, accumulation, and ablation, yet the interaction of topography and meteorological patterns tends to generate similar inter-annual snow depth distribution patterns. Here, we question whether snow depth patterns at or near peak accumulation are repeatable for a 10-year time frame and whether years with limited snow depth measurement can still be used to accurately represent snow depth and mean snow depth. We used snow depth measurements from the West Glacier Lake watershed, Wyoming, USA, to investigate the distribution of snow depth. West Glacier Lake is a small (0.61 km(2)) windswept (mean of 8 m/s) watershed that ranges between 3277 m and 3493 m. Three interpolation methods were compared: (1) a binary regression tree, (2) multiple linear regression, and (3) generalized additive models. Generalized additive models using topographic parameters with measured snow depth presented the best estimates of the snow depth distribution and the basin mean amounts. The snow depth patterns near peak accumulation were found to be consistent inter-annually with an average annual correlation coefficient (r(2)) of 0.83, and scalable based on a winter season accumulation index (r(2) = 0.75) based on the correlation between mean snow depth measurements to Brooklyn Lake snow telemetry (SNOTEL) snow depth data.					; Fassnacht, Steven/A-7742-2014	Hiemstra, Christopher/0000-0003-3038-0430; Hultstrand, Douglas/0000-0003-4820-3715; Fassnacht, Steven/0000-0002-5270-8049														2073-4433				JAN	2022	13	1							3	10.3390/atmos13010003	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos13010003													WOS:000760291600001

However, highly resolved quantitative terrestrial temperature reconstructions of the Asian monsoon domain are scarce. Here we present the results of analyses of 5-methyl and 6-methyl branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) in lacustrine sediments from Lake Chenghai in southwest China, spanning the period 15.6-7.0 cal ka BP, to test the potential of this microbial paleothermometer. The distribution of brGDGTs changed abruptly at the end of the Heinrich 1 drought event, indicating that change in water level could overprint the temperature signal. Our reconstructed mean annual atmospheric temperature was 1-4 degrees C cooler than present and displayed a long-term warming trend from 14.4 to 7.0 cal ka BP. Superimposed on this overall trend, cooling events corresponding to the Older Dryas and Younger Dryas in the North Atlantic were recorded. The temperature reconstruction was in good agreement with previous brGDGT-based reconstructions and climate simulations, revealing a winter-biased and elevationdependent mean annual atmospheric temperature change in southwest China. We suggest that the winter and summer monsoons could have played an important role in the amplification of temperature changes in highaltitude mountains and that there is a need for additional quantitative temperature records from low latitudes to help reconcile the diverging Holocene temperature trends between the different reconstructions and model data in the Asian monsoon region.					sun, weiwei/GQA-5041-2022; qf, Jiang/AGY-9132-2022														0921-8181	1872-6364				OCT	2023	229								104238	10.1016/j.gloplacha.2023.104238	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2023.104238		SEP 2023											WOS:001143367600001

Specific objectives were to (1) document seasonal patterns in abundance of E. coli over a 3-year period, (2) identify environmental factors, including effects of migratory geese and artificial aeration devices that may influence E. coli abundance, and (3) determine if E. coli abundance over time was similar for individual lakes. Water samples were collected monthly for 36 months from six lakes, three of which contained artificial aeration devices (fountains). Regression models were constructed to determine which environmental variables most influence E. coli abundance in summer and winter seasons. Escherichia coli is present in the lakes of Lubbock, Texas year-round and typically exceeds established bacterial thresholds for recreational waters. Models most frequently contained pH and dissolved oxygen as predictor variables and explained from 17.4% to 92.4% of total variation in E. coli. Lakes with fountains had a higher oxygen concentration during summer and contained consistently less E. coli. We conclude that solar irradiation in synergy with pH and dissolved oxygen is the primary control mechanism for E. coli in study lakes, and that fountains help control abundance of fecal bacteria within these systems.																			1477-8920					DEC	2016	14	6					929	941		10.2166/wh.2016.020	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wh.2016.020								27959871					WOS:000391300800005
J	Bell, EM; Laybourn-Parry, J				Bell, EM; Laybourn-Parry, J			Annual plankton dynamics in an Antarctic saline lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The plankton dynamics of Ace Lake, a saline, meromictic basin in the Vestfold Hills, eastern Antarctica was studied between December 1995 and February 1997. 2. The lake supported two distinct plankton communities; an aerobic microbial community in the upper oxygenated mixolimnion and an anaerobic microbial community in the lower anoxic monimolimnion. 3. Phytoplankton development was limited by nitrogen availability. Soluble reactive phosphorus was never limiting. Chlorophyll a concentrations in the mixolimnion ranged between 0.3 and 4.4 mu g L-1 during the study period and a deep chlorophyll maximum persisted throughout the year below the chemo/oxycline. 4. Bacterioplankton abundance showed considerable seasonal variation related to light and substrate availability. Autotrophic bacterial abundance ranged between 0.02 and 8.94 x 10(8) L-1 and heterotrophic bacterial abundance between 1.26 and 72.8 x 10(8) L-1 throughout the water column. 5. The mixolimnion phytoplankton was dominated by phytoflagellates, in particular Pyramimonas gelidicola. P. gelidicola remained active for most of the year by virtue of its mixotrophic behaviour. Photosynthetic dinoflagellates occurred during the austral summer, but the entire population encysted for the winter. 6. Two communities of heterotrophic flagellates were apparent; a community living in the upper monimolimnion and a community living in the aerobic mixolimnion. Both exhibited different seasonal dynamics. 7. The ciliate community was dominated by the autotroph Mesodinium rubrum. The abundance of M. rubrum peaked in summer. A proportion of the population encysted during winter. Only one other ciliate, Euplotes sp., occurred regularly. 8. Two species of Metazoa occurred in the mixolimnion; a calanoid copepod (Paralabidocera antarctica) and a rotifer (Notholca sp.). However, there was no evidence of grazing pressure on the microbial community. In common with most other Antarctic lakes, Ace Lake appears to be driven by 'bottom-up' forces.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				MAY	1999	41	3					507	519		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1999.00396.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1999.00396.x													WOS:000081362000003

The largest of thee lakes, the oligotrophic Desolation Lake, was studied to determine the cause of the mortality phenomenon. The recurrent annual mass mortality involved both breeding adults and young-of-the-year. Rate kinetics suggest that mortality rate doubles with a fivefold increase in the number of aquatic young salamanders. The proximate cause of the mass mortality was identified as a bacterium, Acinetobacter sp. Desolation Lake and a seepage lake that did not experience the mass mortality were studied for the presence of Acinetobacter. Both lakes experienced two bacteria cycles: the first in early summer involved gram-positive bacteria, and the second in late summer involved gram-negative bacteria (mostly coliform bacteria and Acinetobacter). The mass mortalities were associated with the late-summer gram-negative bacterial bloom, and Acinetobacter was found in large numbers in Desolation Lake. Algae, as well as other photosynthetic plants, were not present in large numbers. Since these lakes are growth-limited with respect to nitrogen and not with respect to phosphate, and since Desolation Lake had extensive lowering of the lake level during the summer, the biological cycle of the lake is proposed to be due to atmospheric and sheep-produced nitrogen products within the watershed. In this unstable lake system, bacteria are primarily responsible for incorporation of nitrogen in the food chain. The timing of the cyclical events depends on total winter precipitation.																			0017-3614					JUL 31	1989	49	3					364	372		10.5962/bhl.part.22646	http://dx.doi.org/10.5962/bhl.part.22646													WOS:A1989CL02100002

The sequence in which freeze-up (FU; day of 100% ice cover) and break-up (BU; day of zero ice cover) occurred at the 11 ponds showed moderately high to very high coherence each season. This was probably due to FU and BU being poorly correlated with pond morphometry (area, depth). BU is strongly correlated with April mean air temperature; a +/- 1 degrees C change in mean April air temperature is equivalent to a +/- 1.86day change in BU. FU and air-temperature relationships are inconclusive, primarily because post-FU warm intervals in two autumns cause an anticorrelation between mean September air temperature and FU. Mean ice duration varies between 205 and 225 days, and is strongly correlated with maximum ice thickness through its effect on BU. A +/- 10 mm change in maximum ice thickness will cause a 0.6 day change in ice duration. Maximum ice thickness and ice composition (snow ice, congelation ice) also have a strong influence on break-up when all data from all ponds and all years are considered. The predictability of FU and BU sequence, the minor role of morphometry in FU and BU, the strong role of April mean air temperature in BU, and the role of maximum ice thickness in duration suggests that these ponds would be good sites for continued long-term observation of phenology and the influence of weather/climate variation and change, and for freeze-up/break-up process studies, particularly the role of ice composition and albedo.																			0260-3055		978-0-946417-41-4				2007	46						397	+		10.3189/172756407782871576	http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/172756407782871576													WOS:000250954200058

White Sands Dune Field, New Mexico: Age, dune dynamics and recent accumulations	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												The White Sands Dune Field, situated within the Tularosa Basin in southern New Mexico, is thought to have been largely derived by a stepwise, progressive deflation of Pleistocene Lake Otero strata with the onset of regional aridity. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of samples from a core that penetrated the gypsum accumulation of the dune field confirm a time of origin at similar to 7000 yr. Dune sediment is characterized as lagged influx from previously stored Lake Otero sediment and contemporaneous influx derived from subsequent playas. Sediment became available for aeolian transport and dune-field construction because of a falling water table driven by the regional aridity. The current dune field is primarily a wet aeolian system in which the behavior of the accumulation surface over time is a function of the water table, although surface cementation by gypsum also imparts aspects of a stabilizing system. Dune crests are oriented borderline transverse to the annual transport resultant, and a monitored dune and its cross-strata show that transverse winds from the SW during the late winter and spring account for most of the crest-normal migration, but a significant along-crest component of migration of dune sinuosity occurs with fall and winter winds from the NW and N that strike the crests obliquely. Trenches across three interdune areas show dune sets and interdune strata climbing at about 0.1 degrees. Depth of interdune scour increases with interdune streamwise length, which acts to enhance the probability of dune cross-strata deflation during and years, but also increases the probability of interdune accumulation because the water table shows a net rise over time. Within the trenches, dune sets show a bundling of foresets between reactivation surfaces, interpreted as annual cycles that reveal lee-face reworking by the oblique NW and N winds and slipface progradation fostered by transverse winds from the SW. A progression from grainflow-dominated to wind-ripple-dominated cross-strata within a single set revealed in the longest trench is consistent with along-crest migration of dune sinuosity. Interdune laminations show light/dark couplets interpreted as annual varves reflecting dry/wet portions of the year. The number of laminations preserved in vertical sections across an interdune area shows that the record is incomplete, and endorses the interpretation of periods of interdune deflation. A calculation of the current accumulation rate as based upon the climbing strata within the trenches is significantly greater than the long-term accumulation rate determined by OSL dates taken from the core. In addition to compaction and possible dissolution of gypsum as partial explanations, the long-term accumulation rate may reflect significant variation in the accumulation rate over time, short-term deflation of accumulations on a regular basis, and/or the presence of unconformities within the gypsum body.

The paper presents the results in the context of the Zdworskie Lake, Poland, which belongs to this river system and has an eutrophication problems. In the Wielka Struga River catchment and in the Zdworskie Lake hydrological conditions were variable, largely dependent on the amount of rainfall. During the study period 2008-2013 the amount of annual rainfall was much higher than the average in multi-year period 1961-2000, nevertheless intense outflow of water from the Wielka Struga River catchment occurred only in the years 2010-2011 when the total annual rainfall exceeded the long-period average of about 100 mm. This is evidenced by the half-yearly and annual average unit outflow q(SQ) of the Wielka Struga River catchment, which were 3.63 and 4.44 dm(-3)s(-1)km(2), respectively in 2010 and 2011. However, in the years 2008 and 2009 the outflow from the Wielka Struga River catchment was very small - annual q(SQ) values were 1.3-1.4 dm(-3)s(-1)km(2). In 2012 q(SQ) reached extremely low values of only 0.9 dm(-3)s(-1)km(2). In the winter half-year the outflow from the Wielka Struga River catchment is always significantly higher than in the summer half-year. The most balanced outflow occurred in 2013. However, in the remaining hydrological years the annual uneven distribution of the outflow is much higher. The outflow from the catchment in the winter half-year of 2008, 2009 and 2012 was approximately 4-5 times larger than in the summer half-year, while in 2011 nearly 10 times larger. Annual load total nitrogen and total phosphorus is also very uneven during the observation. 74-98% of total nitrogen and 35-80% of total phosphorus is delivered to the lake by the river during winter season. There is a strong relationship between the runoff and the load of nitrogen in both the semi-annual and annual period because of the dominant form are easily washed nitrates. It may cause 3-40 times higher load of nitrogen during winter season. The relationship between the runoff and the load of phosphorus is not so high than for nitrogen. It is caused by different way of the phosphorus transport as an adsorbed form by fine particles of sediment moved during rainfall-runoff events.

Episodic total mercury accumulation events occurred during the rainy season as turbidity increased, indicating that the TM concentration was not controlled by direct atmospheric deposition. The DGM concentration in surface water ranged from 3.6 to 160 pg/L, having a maximum in summer and minimum in winter. While in most previous studies DGM was controlled primarily by a photo-reduction process, DGM concentrations tracked the amount of solar radiation only in winter when the water temperature was fairly low in this study. During the other seasons microbial transformation seemed to play an important role in reducing Hg(II) to Hg(0). DGM increased as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration increased (p-value < 0.01) while it increased with a decrease of pH (p-value < 0.01). (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

These sites included the major cities of London, Manchester, and Cardiff and the light industrial town of Stevenage, located similar to 60 km north of London. Eight major congeners were measured at ail of the sites with a further 22 included at the Manchester and Cardiff sites. Atmospheric Sigma PCB (eight congeners) concentrations ranged from 112 to 3850 pg m(-3) at the four sites, with the mean in London the highest. Clear seasonal cycling was observed in the urban atmospheres with summer concentrations being higher than winter for all congeners. The relative amplitude change in this cycling pattern was greatest for the higher chlorinated congeners; summer:winter ratios were 2.0, 1.7, 3.2, and 5.0 for congeners 28, 52, 153, and 180, respectively. A simple box model developed by Pankow (1) was applied to the surface area of Manchester to predict the vapor-phase concentration of the tetra-CB, congener 52. Desorption from various compartments such as vegetation, soil, and urban dust were considered. The release from building air was also estimated. The predicted gas-phase concentrations show the seasonal cycling observed in the ambient air concentrations. The model fit for the three considered compartments (veg/soil/dust) was lower than the observed city air concentrations. The model data reflect background rural concentrations more accurately, perhaps suggesting that elevated concentrations of the vapor-phase component in city air are derived from building air and/or a series of point sources. Even today, many years after restrictions of PCB manufacture and use were introduced in the U.K., cities continue to act as sources of airborne PCBs to surrounding areas.

Accumulation factor ratios of plant parts were calculated for all metals, and the two species were compared in terms of accumulation properties. The highest concentrations were measured in the root systems while relatively low concentrations were found in the rhizome and above-ground parts of the plants. The accumulation ratios of root for P. australis were usually higher than the ratios for S. lacustris. While the accumulation ratios of root were higher in winter than in the other seasons for P. australis, for S. lacustris the highest accumulation ratios were found in the autumn.

This phenomenon occurs predominantly during the coldest months at well-defined patches, often located in sand pit regions. A case study in a sand pit in the early spring of 1982 revealed that Cormorants from Oostvaardersplassen took advantage of the fish located at their winter refuges inside the pit by specifically diving along the pit's steepest slopes. Thus, they were able to achieve a more than average daily ration of about 475 g of fish within a mere 15 minutes of foraging in the second half of March. Later on, the site became less profitable and the birds gradually left. The importance of high intake rates in early spring is stressed, in view of time consuming activities like nest site occupation, pair formation and accumulation of body reserves for egg-laying, incubation and chick feeding. It is suggested that only the 'higher quality' birds may have the experience and skill required to use solitary fishing techniques as a profitable alternative to social fishing in early spring.																			0373-2266						1995	83	1					213	222																WOS:A1995RM43100023

Extracellular phosphatases in a Mediterranean reservoir:: seasonal, spatial and kinetic heterogeneity	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Epilimnetic alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) was measured in longitudinal profiles of the canyon-shaped, eutrophic Sau Reservoir (Catalonia, Spain) during the autumn, winter and spring periods of 1997-2000. 2. The spatial pattern of APA depended on lake circulation. During periods of stable stratification, when the ratio of mixed to euphotic depth (z(mix)/z(eu) < 1.7) was low and the Chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration high, APA was also comparatively high (0.5-3.4 mu mol L-1 h(-1)) and located mostly in the > 2-mu m size-fraction. APA increased towards the dam at the same time as the concentration of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) decreased. In periods of unstable stratification, deep mixing (z(mix)/z(eu) > 2.4) and low Chl a concentration, APA was low (< 0.1 mu mol L-1 h(-1)) and without longitudinal changes, consistent with a high and stable SRP concentration. 3. A high input of mostly dissolved (in the < 0.2-mu m size-fraction) phosphatases from the river Ter was found in 1997-98. At the river inflow, independently of season and despite a continuously high SRP concentration, APA was approximately 0.7 mu mol L-1 h(-1) and decreased towards the dam within the inflowing, canyon-like part of the reservoir. 4. Analysis of saturation kinetics revealed the kinetic heterogeneity of APA. Low-affinity APA was localised in the > 2-mu m (algal) size-fraction while, in the < 2-mu m (picoplankton, mainly bacteria + dissolved) size-fraction, high-affinity APA, or a mixture of both, was found. The presence of two kinetic components, whose substrate affinities (i.e. in Michaelis constants, K-m) differed, was confirmed statistically in 13 of 18 cases analysed. The range of K-mH values of the high-affinity component was 0.15-2.4 mu mol L-1, K-mL values of the low-affinity component ranged from 18 to 275 mu mol L-1.

Ice Freeze-Up and Break-Up in Arctic Rivers Observed With Satellite L-Band Passive Microwave Data From 2010 to 2020	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The timing of ice freeze-up and break-up in the Arctic may be responding to climate change. Passive microwave remote sensing is a powerful technique for monitoring this timing. We processed low-frequency microwave time series from the European Space Agency Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission for a set of 31 satellite gauging reaches (SGRs) above 65 degrees N between 2010 and 2020 to determine timing of freeze-up and break-up and annual river ice durations. We found indication of progressive ice cover reduction over more than half of the monitored river reaches, with possibly the fastest rate occurring over northeast Russia. Some rivers in high-latitude North America experienced a slight increase in ice cover. Across the data set, we observed an average 2.2 days shift toward later ice freeze-up in autumn and an average 0.6 days shift toward earlier ice break-up in spring, resulting in an average decrease of 3.4 days in ice duration between 2010 and 2020. River reaches with the longest duration of ice cover appeared to have experienced the fastest rate of decrease. A possible reduction of the time lag between air temperature rise or fall and corresponding river ice break-up and freeze-up was also observed. Yet results on variability are carefuly interpreted given the short length of the time series (2010-2020) and the low statistical confidence rates calculated for the decadal tendency. Still outcomes are consistent with increases in global and Arctic surface air temperature. Following these time series over the next decade using passive microwave satellite sensors can monitor ice cover duration in the Arctic and will further determine temporal and regional trends.					; Brakenridge, G./R-7646-2019; Podkowa, Anna/R-7313-2018	Kugler, Zsofia/0000-0001-9044-653X; BRAKENRIDGE, G./0000-0002-3217-4852													0043-1397	1944-7973				JUN	2023	59	6							e2022WR031939	10.1029/2022WR031939	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022WR031939													WOS:001004427100001

However, it is little known the way in which the two cyanobacteria adjust their own morphological and physiological characteristics to maintain their biomass. In the study, the phytoplankton community in Lake Chaohu was investigated monthly from June 2017 to May 2018, and the morphological and physiological characteristics of dominant species were also determined. The results showed that Microcystis aeruginosa and Dolichospermum flos-aquae were the two dominant cyanobacteria species in Lake Chaohu. The ranges of the cell diameter and colony size of M. aeruginosa were small throughout the whole year, but those of D. flos-aquae changed significantly over time and in different regions of the lake. There were significant negative relationship between cell diameter and colony size of D. flos-aquae, which indicated that D. flos-aquae was more dependent on morphological adjustment to adapt environmental changes than M. aeruginosa. The biomass of the two algae increased with increasing cell diameter and colony size, indicating that the two algae might maintain their biomass by regulating their morphology. The photosynthetic activity in the cyanobacteria peaked in summer, late winter and early spring. The consistency of the trends in the photochemical activity and biomass of the two algae indicated that the two algae can adapt to environmental changes by changing their photosynthetic characteristics. These findings will be helpful in improving our understanding of the population dynamics of M. aeruginosa and D. flos-aquae and their environmental adaptation mechanisms in Lake Chaohu.					zhang, min/IYI-9869-2023	Shi, Xiaoli/0000-0002-2904-1784; , Min/0000-0002-8130-5214													1470-160X	1872-7034				APR	2020	111								106052	10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.106052	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.106052													WOS:000512603300085

Spatio-temporal evolution of a thermokarst in Interior Alaska	COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Landscape modifications in Arctic and subarctic regions due to warming climate conditions have been reported in recent years. This work describes the rapid development of a thermokarst in Interior Alaska over a two-year period. The research was conducted in the Caribou-Poker Creeks Research Watershed, the only research watershed in the United States underlain by discontinuous permafrost. The basin's coordinates are 65 degrees 10' N latitude and 147 degrees 30' W longitude. Within the short span of two warm summers, a portion of the study area progressed from a hummocky terrain to a well-defined channel configuration. Suspended sediment concentration and discharge measurements indicated high sediment loads following rainfall events, which play a major role in the study area's sediment transport process. Fluvio-thermal erosion detected in late spring of 2004 triggered block failures on the thermokarst's sides. The spatio-temporal evolution of a cryogenic pipe was documented during the second summer. Water flow inside the pipe caused high erosion in the soil matrix. Eroded soil sediment was transported and deposited downstream, creating a fairly smooth bed slope. Topographical surveys conducted during the two field seasons revealed an average erosion rate of 3.5 m/year. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It has been demonstrated that AV can increase land productivity and contribute to the expansion of renewable energy production. Its utilization is expected to affect crop production by altering microclimatic conditions but has so far hardly been investigated. The present study aimed to determine for the first time how changes in microclimatic conditions through AV affect selected agricultural crops within an organic crop rotation. For this purpose, an AV research plant was installed near Lake Constance in south-west Germany in 2016. A field experiment was established with four crops (celeriac, winter wheat, potato and grass-clover) cultivated both underneath the AV system and on an adjacent reference site without solar panels. Microclimatic parameters, crop development and harvestable yields were monitored in 2017 and 2018. Overall, an alteration in microclimatic conditions and crop production under AV was confirmed. Photosynthetic active radiation was on average reduced by about 30% under AV. During summertime, soil temperature was decreased under AV in both years. Furthermore, reduced soil moisture and air temperatures as well as an altered rain distribution have been found under AV. In both years, plant height of all crops was increased under AV. In 2017 and 2018, yield ranges of the crops cultivated under AV compared to the reference site were -19 to +3% for winter wheat, -20 to +11% for potato and -8 to -5% for grass-clover. In the hot, dry summer 2018, crop yields of winter wheat and potato were increased by AV by 2.7% and 11%, respectively. These findings show that yield reductions under AV are likely, but under hot and dry weather conditions, growing conditions can become favorable.

Using automated telemetry to identify population connectivity and migration phenology of Snowy Plovers breeding in the Southern Great Plains	JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY												Within-breeding season movements have not been quantified for Snowy Plovers (Charadrius nivosus) breeding on the Southern Great Plains (SGP), where suitable breeding habitat can range from less than 10 km to more than 600 km apart. This mosaic distribution of discrete patches of breeding habitat, combined with weather stochasticity and low densities of Snowy Plovers in Texas and New Mexico, increases the risk of local and regional extirpation. Further, little is known about SGP Snowy Plover migration phenology or winter habitat. We used the Motus Wildlife Tracking System to examine population connectivity, migration phenology, and winter habitat locations of adult Snowy Plovers in the SGP. Movements of Snowy Plovers during the 2017 and 2018 breeding seasons suggest little to no connectivity between the Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge population in Oklahoma and populations in Texas and New Mexico. However, several Snowy Plovers in Texas moved to a lake formed by freshwater springs that may have provided higher-quality breeding and foraging habitat. Migrating primarily at night, we found that Snowy Plovers from a breeding area in Oklahoma made migratory movements to Texas and the Louisiana Gulf Coast. These data may be important to long-term conservation and planning efforts relative to understanding regional persistence and connectivity among breeding populations of Snowy Plovers in the SGP. Our results also highlight the need for future studies of wintering habitats used by SGP Snowy Plovers.					; Heath, Kristen/HDM-4162-2022	Collins, Dan/0000-0003-1113-4736; Boal, Clint/0000-0001-6008-8911; Heath-Acre, Kristen/0000-0001-6999-9607; Johnson, William P/0000-0002-5251-6610													0273-8570	1557-9263				DEC	2021	92	4					461	474		10.1111/jofo.12393	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jofo.12393		JAN 2022											WOS:000744578600001

The studied lake is situated near the eastern shoreline of Lake Baikal, in a climatically sensitive zone that hosts boreal taiga and cold deciduous forests, cold steppe associations typical for northern Mongolia, and mountain tundra vegetation. The results provide a detailed picture of the period in focus, indicating (i) a driest phase (c. 24.0-23.4cal. ka BP) with low precipitation, high summer evaporation, and low lake levels, (ii) a transitional interval of unstable conditions (c. 23.4-22.6cal. ka BP), and (iii) a phase (c. 22.6-22.0cal. ka BP) of relatively high precipitation (and moisture availability) and relatively high lake levels. One hotly debated issue in late Quaternary research is regional summer thermal conditions during the LGM. Our chironomid-based reconstruction suggests at least 3.5 degrees C higher than present summer temperatures between c. 22.6 and 22.0cal. ka BP, which are well in line with warmer and wetter conditions in the North Atlantic region inferred from Greenland ice-cores. Overall, it appears that environments in central Eurasia during the LGM were affected by much colder than present winter temperatures and higher than present summer temperatures, although the effects of temperature oscillations were strongly influenced by changes in humidity.					; Kostrova, Svetlana/AAF-7889-2021; Meyer, Hanno/E-2870-2016; Hoelzmann, Philipp/H-7008-2019; Tarasov, Pavel/ABG-3993-2020; Ilyashuk, Boris/AAZ-7301-2020	Schroder, Birgit/0000-0003-4807-6357; Ilyashuk, Boris/0000-0003-3846-7178; Meyer, Hanno/0000-0003-4129-4706; Hoelzmann, Philipp/0000-0001-8709-8474; /0000-0002-7219-5009; Kostrova, Svetlana/0000-0003-1124-5559; 													0300-9483	1502-3885				APR	2019	48	2			SI		488	506		10.1111/bor.12330	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bor.12330													WOS:000463748900016

Water samples were collected in Lake Hiruga periodically between April 2014 and March 2016 at appropriate depths with simultaneous in situ measurements of physicochemical parameters such as temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration. Sulphide started accumulating in the hypolimnion in September 2014, whilst that did in June 2015. The sulphide concentrations increased toward the end of December in both 2014 and 2015. Then the sulphide disappeared from the hypolimnion in April 2015 and February 2016. The difference in starting season of the sulphide accumulation was closely connected with DO concentrations in the hypolimnion in circulation periods of winter season. The DO concentrations were regulated by water column stability before thermal stratification periods. Our analysis of the sulphide distribution for the 2 years of the study suggested that accumulation of sulphide in the hypolimnion during stratified periods appears to be associated with strength of water column stability in the winter-spring seasons before stagnant periods in Lake Hiruga.																			1439-8621	1439-863X				AUG	2018	19	3					277	283		10.1007/s10201-018-0541-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-018-0541-7													WOS:000439148900002

The primacy of multidecadal to centennial variability over late-Holocene forced change of the Asian Monsoon on the southern Tibetan Plateau	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												The nature of multidecadal to centennial variability of the Asian monsoon is largely unknown, hindering our understanding of how the modern precipitation regime compares to preindustrial variability, as well as how the Asian monsoon may change in coming decades. Here we use the sediment record from a closed-basin lake in southern Tibet, Ngamring Tso, along with other published paleoclimatic records, to assess summer monsoon precipitation variability over the 20th century and during the late Holocene (4100 cal yr BP to present). The first principal component of the Ngamring Tso grain size record, which is highly correlated with median grain size, correlates significantly with observed summer (June-September) precipitation. From CE 1940 to 2007, grain size decreased with increasing summer precipitation and increased with decreasing summer precipitation. Satellite images of Ngamring Tso reveal larger lake area in the 1970s and 2000s and smaller lake area in the 1980s and 1990s, suggesting monsoon precipitation-induced changes in lake depth or area likely govern grain size variability. In the context of the last 4100 yr, prolonged periods of relatively weak summer monsoon precipitation occurred from 2800-2600 cal yr BP, 2500-2300 cal yr BP, and 1600-400 cal yr BR A trend toward increased summer precipitation began around 1000 cal yr BP, with above-average summer precipitation from 400 cal yr BP to present, peaking between 200-100 cal yr BP (CE 1750-1850). Dry and wet periods are coincident with dry and wet periods in other south-central Tibetan lake sediment records that reflect precipitation or moisture balance, and with regional proxies of the ISM and EASM, indicating south-central Tibet is influenced by both monsoon subsystems. However, western Tibet lake sediment records do not covary with the Ngamring Tso record, suggesting the spatial variability in Tibet precipitation that occurs on interannual timescales today may also characterize precipitation on multidecadal and centennial timescales during the late Holocene. 20th century precipitation variability in southern Tibet falls within the range of natural variability in the last 4100 yr, and does not show a clear trend of increasing precipitation as projected by models. Instead, it appears that poorly understood multidecadal to centennial internal modes of monsoon variability remained influential throughout the last 4100 yr. Thus, substantial multidecadal to centennial-scale hydroclimatic variability will complicate our ability to project and prepare for anthropogenic changes in the region's monsoon precipitation.

The population reproduced once a year, with breeding commencing in June and continuing until August. Population density was highest in June. The mortality rate of the adult population increased with the onset of reproduction, and remained high until the end of winter. The population density was lowest during winter and early spring (January to May). Biomass (B) fluctuated in a similar manner to population density, but the peak biomass occurred in August and September. Annual production (P) was 23.12 g . m 2 (dry weight), estimated by the size-frequency method. The corresponding annual turnover ratio (P/B) was 5.68. The unusually high annual production and turnover ratio are attributed to the high density and large adult size of this population.																			0008-4301					JUL	1992	70	7					1417	1424																WOS:A1992JL31100022
J	Zhang, SH; Wang, WL; Chang, JJ				Zhang, Shenghua; Wang, Weilu; Chang, Junjun			The Contribution of Cyanobacteria Bloom Decline to Phosphorus in Water Column of Dianchi Lake, China	POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES												Bloom-Cyanobacteria can release phosphorus (P) into overlying water during their decline period, thus inevitably providing available P for the next round of bloom. In order to quantitatively evaluate the contribution of cyanobacterial bloom decline to P amounts in Caohai, a typical cyanobacteria-dominated sub-lake in northern Dianchi Lake, the P concentrations in algae during the peak and bottom of cyanobacterial bloom were measured and calculated. Remote sensing monitoring analysis and monthly monitoring data showed that the cyanobacterial bloom in Caohai developed from June, reached its peak in July to August and then declined to its bottom from December to February. The concentrations of different phosphorus forms contained in algal cells were different between the peak and bottom of the cyanobacterial bloom. Total phosphorus (TP) concentration in algae (TP-A) were higher in summer than in winter, while the TP content per unit Chl-a in winter was much larger than in summer. The annual released TP was approximately 24.12 tons in 2016, and its potential contribution to TP and Ortho-P in water body of Caohai was around 0.958 and 0.647 mg.L-1, respectively. The P release amount was 303.30 and 20.57 tons in 2011 and 2014, respectively. For Caohai of Dianchi Lake, the P released from bloom-cyanobacteria could provide adequate P for the next year's bloom recovery.

Temporary waters have been relatively neglected in British nature conservation, due in part to paucity of survey and comparative assessment. Such water bodies hold distinctive and specialized biological communities, and the need for conservation measures at key localities is increasingly recognized in Europe. 2. An account of the vegetation and invertebrate fauna in Pant-y-llyn, a small temporary lake on Carboniferous Limestone in South Wales, is presented. Water levels in the basin reflect seasonal variation in the height of the local groundwater, and it fills to a depth of ca 3-4 m in winter but is almost completely dry in summer. 3. There is a clearly displayed sequence of bryophyte, herbaceous swamp and woody plant communities which occupy different depth zones in the basin. 4. The invertebrate community is dominated by microcrustaceans and a range of insect groups; adaptations for survival over the summer dry phase are considered. 5. It is concluded that the ecological characteristics and distinctive hydrological features of Pant-y-llyn closely resemble those of the Irish turloughs. Pant-y-llyn thus represents an important site for conservation as the only known example of this form of seasonal water body in Britain.																			1052-7613					SEP	1993	3	3					253	268		10.1002/aqc.3270030309	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.3270030309													WOS:A1993MD98600007

Max			Thule Fishing Revisited: The Economic Importance of Fish at the Pembroke and Bell Sites, Victoria Island, Nunavut	GEOGRAFISK TIDSSKRIFT-DANISH JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY					International Polar Year GeoArk Workshop on Climate, Environment and the Thule Culture in the Holocene Arctic	MAY 18-20, 2009	Copenhagen, DENMARK					In a comprehensive overview of evidence for fishing in the Thule period of the eastern North American Arctic, Whitridge (2001) noted that fish bones are either extremely rare or absent in archaeofaunal samples, despite the fact that artifact assemblages typically contain a variety of fishing implements. In this paper, we present new faunal data from two sites on southeastern Victoria Island, Nunavut, which offer a marked contrast to this pattern. The Pembroke site, located just north of Cambridge Bay, is a small Thule site probably occupied during an early migration into the region. The Bell site, located on the Ekalluk River, is a more substantial site, occupied for a much longer duration during the Thule period. These sites are located in areas devoid of many taxa preferred by Thule peoples, which led the sites' occupants to rely on caribou and fish for much of their winter subsistence. At the Bell site, storage of caribou and fish was critical for winter survival. However, the occupants of the Pembroke site appear to have been unable to acquire sufficient stores during the fall, and therefore relied on fishing through the ice during winter to supplement their inadequate stores. Although both sites indicate a more important economic role for fish than has been recorded on any other eastern Arctic Thule winter site, the use of fish at the two sites differs markedly, adding nuance to archaeologically known Thule subsistence patterns.

DOC concentrations ranged from about 1 to 2.5 mmol l(-1) with humic DOC contributing between 40% during the winter and 55% during the summer. Phytoplankton production was highest in the pond within the reed belt, where the attenuation was lowest, reaching 110 mg C m(-2) d(-1) during a distinct phytoplankton bloom in August. Bacterial abundance ranged from 2 x 10(6) cells ml(-1) during winter to about 10 x 10(6) cells ml(-1) during summer. Bacterial production calculated by thymidine (TdR) and leucine (leu) incorporation, respectively, were in good agreement at the stations in the reed belt, but bacterial production based on leu incorporation was significantly lower than bacterial production based on TdR incorporation at the open water station. Based on a bacterial growth yield of 16% determined in an earlier study, bacterioplankton carbon demand was always at least 1 order of magnitude higher than carbon production of phytoplankton, indicating that bacterioplankton metabolism in Lake Neusiedl is heavily dependent on non-phytoplankton sources of DOG. The bacterial carbon demand (ranging from 225 to 870 mg C m(-2) d(-1) depending on the sampling site and substrate used) could be matched by the production of the reed P. australis amounting to 750 to 4510 mg C m(-2) d(-1). Since there is no major allochthonous organic matter input from other sources, this macrophyte production is obviously channeled to the pelagic food web via the baclerioplankton.					; Herndl, Gerhard/B-1513-2013	Herndl, Gerhard J./0000-0002-2223-2852; 													0948-3055					OCT 27	1999	19	3					245	254		10.3354/ame019245	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame019245													WOS:000083765200004

This may stimulate serious soil nitrogen (N) losses due to large fertilizer inputs (about 1-2 times of that in regular rice-wheat rotation). Therefore, we investigated the soil N2O fluxes and leachate NO3--N concentrations and their responses to multiple factors on a tea garden (TG) hillslope and an adjacent bamboo forest (BF) hillslope. Soil N2O fluxes and leachate NO3--N concentrations on the TG hillslope were 3.28 and 4.24 times of those on the BF hillslope, respectively. Soil N2O fluxes measured in spring were the greatest while those measured in winter were the lowest. However, the measured leachate NO3--N concentrations were the greatest in winter but the lowest in summer. On both hillslopes, soil temperature (ST) and precipitation during the previous seven days (API7) were positively related to soil N2O fluxes but negatively related to leachate NO3--N concentrations, while the ground water table depth was opposite. Soil water content (SWC) and the ratio of SWC/field capacity (SWC/FC) negatively influenced leachate NO3--N concentrations on both hillslopes. Positive influences of SWC and SWC/FC on soil N2O fluxes were observed on the TG hillslope, while quadratic relationships were observed on the BF hillslope. Thresholds of ST and API7 were existed in the controlling the spatial variations of soil N 2 O fluxes and leachate NO3--N concentrations on both hillslopes. When ST was > 9.5 degrees C, spatial variations in soil N2O fluxes were controlled by topography, soil properties and soil hydrological parameters on both hillslopes. Similarly, when API7 were < 58.0 mm, the spatial variations in leachate NO3--N concentrations were also influenced by these factors on both hillslopes. Finding of this study will supplement the knowledge of soil N2O emissions and NO3--N leaching from the tea planation and bamboo forest.					; Lai, Xiaoming/KIC-7701-2024; Zhu, Qing/LSK-1739-2024	Zhu, Qing/0000-0002-5798-3883; Zhou, Zhiwen/0000-0002-8559-5909; 													0341-8162	1872-6887				MAY	2020	188								104463	10.1016/j.catena.2020.104463	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2020.104463													WOS:000518488500030
J	Kassal, BY				Kassal, Boris Yu.			ZOOGEOGRAPHICAL RESULTS OF THE BICENTENNIAL STUDY OF THE NORTHERN PART OF THE ASIAN POPULATION OF PHOENICOPTERUS ROSEUS	NATURE CONSERVATION RESEARCH												Over a period of 205 years, there have been carried out dozens of censuses of nests and nesting bird individuals, summerings and non-nesting bird individuals, winterings and wintering bird individuals, the determinations of migration routes in the Caspian region and across the Caspian Sea, in Central and Southern Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and Russia. Until the early XXI century, the main flamingo nesting sites were located in the Caspian region and along the Caspian Sea within the Russian Empire / USSR / Commonwealth of Independent States. It was found that such a geographical distribution of flamingo nesting sites was established until 1930 by the relative stability of the global climate conditions in northern Eurasia that have caused the stand of water level in the Caspian Sea. During this period, in the northern part of the Asian population the monitoring of the flamingo had the form of collecting mainly qualitative information. Amongst these are the determination of the locations of breeding sites, summerings and winterings; the bird's abundance was characterised mainly using the epithets. The next period (from 1931 to 1977) was caused by the development of anthropogenic influences and by changes of global climatic conditions in northern Eurasia, which have caused a decrease in the water level in the Caspian Sea. Environmental effects of the hydrological regime changes were the most significant in the shallow northeastern part of the Caspian Sea. The breeding sites and the summerings (that were located there) had changed dislocation. Sometimes such a dislocation was observed over a wide area, up to the complete loss of breeding sites and summerings. During this period, the observations had the character of quantative information collecting and clarification of qualitative data: determination of new locations of breeding sites, duration of their existence, location of summerings and winterings, sizes of flocks and groupings, and disappearance reasons of the flamingo from former habitats. The persistent reduction of the Caspian Sea area, as well as the drying up of several sea gulfs, had caused the emergence of permanent breeding colonies on the lakes of Central Kazakhstan (Lake Shalkartenize, Lake Tengiz). The decrease in the level of continental waterbodies in Central Kazakhstan had caused an increase of their nesting and feeding properties: formed shoals became the sites of feeding and breeding of flamingos. Significant annual and long-term fluctuations of the water level in the lakes had become the reason of the periodic disappearance of flamingo colonies on certain lakes and their emergence of those on other lakes. During 1978-2015 the monitoring of flamingos in the northern part of the range of the Asian population were aimed at obtaining qualitative and quantitative indicators of nesting sites, summerings and winterings in conditions of increasing of the Caspian Sea level, the fluctuations of the water content in Central Kazakhstan, the refinement of migration dates, the spring and autumn migration routes. The placement of the major part of flamingos on the water bodies of Central Kazakhstan by the end of the XX century has contributed to the final formation of the flight route, which had connected these habitats with areas previously populated along the Caspian Sea. In the early XXI century the permanent reproductive centre in the northern part of the Asian flamingo population remained the breeding colony on Lake Tengiz. Available data have formed the necessary information base for further quantitative and qualitative assessment of the northern part of the Asian population over three time periods caused by the state of the Caspian Sea, waterbodies of the Caspian region and Central Kazakhstan, each of which had specific characteristics that determine the placement of nesting colonies, summerings, winterings, routes of seasonal and inter-seasonal migrations in the northern part of the range of flamingos and beyond.																			2500-008X						2017	2	1					2	32																WOS:000431424000002

J	Maberly, SC				Maberly, SC			Diel, episodic and seasonal changes in pH and concentrations of inorganic carbon in a productive lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Two pH electrodes and a thermistor were used to record conditions in the surface of Esthwaite Water every 15 min over a 12-month period. Combined with approximately weekly measurements of alkalinity they allowed inorganic carbon speciation to be calculated. 2. Large changes in pH from 7.1 to nearly 10.3, and hence in concentrations of inorganic carbon species, were measured over a year. Carbon speciation and pH varied on a diel, episodic and seasonal basis. Diel variation of up to pH 1.8 was recorded, although typical daily variation was between 0.03 and 1.06 (5 and 95 percentiles). Daily change in concentration of inorganic carbon varied between 4 and 63 mmol m(-3) (5 and 95 percentiles). 3. During lake stratification, episodes of high pH, typically of 1-2 weeks' duration were interspersed with episodes of lower pH. These changes appeared to relate to the weather: e.g. low wind velocity, high pressure, low rainfall and high sunshine hours correlated with periods of high pH. 4. Seasonal progression of carbon depletion generally followed stratification and the development of high phytoplankton biomass. When the lake was isothermal, the phytoplankton biomass caused relatively small amounts of carbon depletion. 5. During autumn, winter and spring, the lake had concentrations of CO2* (free CO2) up to 0.12 mol m(-3) which is nearly seven times the calculated atmospheric equilibrium concentration so the lake will accordingly be losing carbon to the atmosphere. In contrast, during periods of elevated pH the concentration of CO2* was reduced close to zero and the lake will take up atmospheric CO2. The rates of transfer between water and the atmosphere were estimated using a chemical equilibrium model with three boundary layer thicknesses. The calculations show that over a year the lake loses CO2 to the atmosphere with the current mean atmospheric level of 360 mu mol mol(-1), at between 0.28 and 2.80 mol m(-2) yr(-1). During elevated pH, rates of CO2-influx increased up to nearly tenfold as a result of chemical-enhancement by parallel flux of HCO3-. Input of CO2* to the lake from the catchment is suggested to be the main source of the carbon lost to the atmosphere. 6. The turnover time for CO2 between the air and water was calculated to be 1 year for the gross influx and 3.3 years for the net flux. These values are less than the average water residence time of 0.25 years, which indicates that over a year inflow from streams is a more important source of inorganic carbon than the atmosphere. 7. Influx of CO2 from the atmosphere was calculated to be roughly equivalent to between 1 and 4% of the rates of production in the water during mid-summer indicating that this source of inorganic carbon is not a major one in this lake.

B	Naselli-Flores, L		Ansari, AA; Gill, SS; Lanza, GR; Rast, W		Naselli-Flores, Luigi			Mediterranean Climate and Eutrophication of Reservoirs: Limnological Skills to Improve Management	EUTROPHICATION: CAUSES, CONSEQUENCES AND CONTROL												Sicily is the largest Mediterranean island and one of the most densely populated areas in the region. To counteract the periodic oscillation in water availability and to fulfill drinking and agriculture needs, about 30 dam-reservoirs, impounding in total 750 x 10(6) m(3), were built in the last 60 years. However, the inherent features of the Mediterranean climate and the total lack of awareness from local authorities have contributed to a progressive increase in the trophic state of these human-made lakes. In particular, the water is stored during the winter rainy season and then it is intensively used in the dry summer. These operational procedures, in particular the time separation between filling and emptying phases, contribute to increase the internal loadings. Under this hydrological regime, reservoirs act as a sink for nutrients. Moreover, the wide water-level fluctuations which characterize these environments further contribute to enhance eutrophication processes by promoting the instability of the thermal stratification and by establishing a state of atelomixis during the summer. Consequently, most Sicilian reservoirs are affected by intense cyanobacterial blooms, which impair their water quality and cause concern due to their toxicity. Since a reduction in external loadings, which involves economic and political decisions, is far from being achieved, some procedures based on the management of the hydrological patterns of these reservoirs have been proposed. These procedures are aimed at avoiding excessive dewatering and at maintaining summer stratification. A reduction in phytoplankton biomass and a structural change in phytoplankton composition with a reduction of toxic cyanobacterial blooms have been observed as a result of the implementation of the above-mentioned procedures.

Comparison of the first principal component (PC1) from eight structural measurements indicated that adult male Oldsquaws were structurally larger than females; however, organ weights did not differ between sexes when PC1 was included as a covariate (ANCOVA, P > 0.05 in all cases). Carcass composition was similar to that reported for spring migrants. Ash-free lean dry weight (AFLDW) and ash were positively related to structural size, but did not differ between sexes when PC1 was included as a covariate. Lipids comprised 17.5% of whole body mass of females and 14.1% of males and were sufficient to fuel migration at least to the next likely staging area in the Great Lakes, Fall migrant Oldsquaws must have stored substantial lipid and protein reserves after breeding, suggesting that offshore feeding areas in James and Hudson Bay are critical.					; Thompson, Jonathan/D-1023-2009	Leafloor, James/0000-0002-3513-3976; Leafloor, Jim/0000-0001-6289-2989													0043-5643					SEP	1996	108	3					567	572																WOS:A1996VM53700015

While these interactions have been studied at dune field or transect scales over weekly, annual, and decadal timescales, the coupling of individual dunes across several types at seasonal scales remains poorly understood. We selected nine coastal dunes of three types along Tannan Bay on Pingtan Island, China. Seasonal investigations combining unmanned aerial vehicle-based LiDAR monitoring and vegetation surveys were conducted to evaluate vegetation and dune morphology dynamics and analyze their interactions. The results revealed that (1) sediment accumulation increased from the beach to the windward slope but decreased near the dune crest and leeward slope. This accumulation was significant in winter and was controlled by spatiotemporal vegetation dynamics, typhoons, and topographic variations. (2) Coastal dune morphology influenced vegetation distribution, with vegetation on incipient foredunes and nebkhas concentrated on windward slopes and in interdunal areas. Blowouts are primarily found near the inlet and depositional zones. (3) Vegetation and dune elevation were significantly correlated along the across-shore gradient. Results indicate that a 1 % increase in coverage leads to a rise in dune elevation of 0.029-0.067 m, most pronounced in spring and weakest in summer. Additionally, vegetation cover was significantly associated with erosion-deposition in most dunes. Our findings demonstrate the impact of vegetation on dune morphological dynamics and their responses. These results enhance our understanding of eco-geomorphic feedback in coastal dune evolution, facilitating more effective coastal management and restoration.

(Pisces: Cyprinidae) in a large South-Alpine lake: Lago Maggiore	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Very recently, a common cyprinid fish species at northern latitude, the roach (Rutilus rutilus L.) has been observed in the large south-alpine Lago Maggiore for the first time. The colonization of the lake has the characteristics of an invasion. In order to investigate this new fish population, benthic multi-mesh and commercial gill nets were used to sample fish in a wide gulf in the central part of the lake (Golfo Borromeo) from February to October 2006. In total 779 roach (TL: 5.5 - 38.8 cm) were caught, aged, sexed and stomach analyzed. Fecundity was assessed by counting the eggs in ripe gonads of females of age 3 and 4. The roach have become clearly the dominant species in the catches, constituting over 70% of the biomass and 70% of the numbers caught. None of the roach exceeded 8 years in age. They grow very fast (Phi' = 2.55) and have high fecundity (F-abs - 13740 +/- 4700 S' D. at age 3 and F-abs = 14768 + 5642 S.D. at age 4). The diet spectrum is wide and characterized by a strong seasonality. In early spring algae (benthic and planktonic algae), benthos and detritus prevail, whereas in summer zooplankton is the most frequent food item. In autumn roach switch back to benthos and detritus. Algae occur more frequently in young specimens while zooplankton, benthos and detritus in adults. The roach population is practically unimpacted by fishing. The minimum legal mesh size (25 mm) of gillnets, used by commercial fishermen, selects roach at the mean L-T of 21.2 cm, which is over its length at maturity The results suggest that roach established a viable population in Lago Maggiore less than a decade ago and rapidly became one of the dominant (if not the dominant) fish species. The possible consequence for the fish fauna in general and for the ecological status of the whole lake is briefly discussed					; Jepsen, Niels/D-4225-2009	Jepsen, Niels/0000-0003-0927-6823; VOLTA, Pietro/0000-0003-3177-0473													1129-5767	1723-8633					2008	67	2					163	170		10.4081/jlimnol.2008.163	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2008.163													WOS:000261475800010

Diel bank migration of Burbot (Lota lota)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Determining the habitat use and movements by fish is critical to our understanding of aquatic ecosystem function. The objective of this study was to assess the diel movements of Burbot (Lota lota) over the open water season. We employed a high-resolution acoustic telemetry positioning system to track the movements and activity of four Burbot during the ice-free season (between June and September) in a sub-Arctic lake. Burbot underwent diel bank migration (DBM), a benthic form of diel vertical migration, where depths are transitioned in close association with the bottom rather than through the water column. During daytime, Burbot occupied deeper water, at the transition of soft, low complexity substrates and ascended along the rocky bottom lake banks to shallower water habitats at night. Increased activity rates during shallow water forays suggest active feeding events. DBM was low at the start of summer with nearly 24 h of daylight, but increased towards the mid-summer with a more pronounced night cycle, coalescing towards the fall. The DBM of Burbot is dynamic, with proximate triggers of light and temperature, and ultimate causes likely being foraging opportunities, bioenergetics gain and predator avoidance.

Rapid post-glacial ecological divergence has resulted in numerous endemic species or ecologically distinct populations in lakes of the temperate zones. Here, we focus on the Baltic cisco (Coregonus albula) complex, to study the genetic similarity among two pairs of sympatric autumn- and spring-spawning populations from post-glacial German Lakes Stechlin and Breiter Luzin. For comparison, we included a similar pair of sympatric populations from the Swedish Lake Fegen. We wanted to explore potential genetic similarities between the three sympatric cisco population pairs in the three lakes, to evaluate whether the pairs may have emerged independently in the three lakes, or whether two different species may have colonized all three lakes independently. Furthermore, we considered allopatric C. albula populations from three Polish, three Finnish, and four Swedish locations, added one Siberian population of the sister species C. sardinella and a Swedish C. maraena (whitefish) population. By genotyping nine microsatellite markers in 655 individuals from these 18 populations, we wanted to elucidate how strongly the cisco populations differ across a larger geographical area within Europe. Finally, we compared the genetic differences between the spring- and autumn-spawning populations of ciscoes in the two German lakes to infer the potentially deteriorating effect of strong anthropogenic pressure on the lakes. Results Dendrogram, Principal Coordinate Analysis and admixture analysis all indicated strong correspondence between population differentiation and geographical location for most cisco populations in Europe, including the Siberian population of C. sardinella. However, populations from some Swedish lakes deviated from this general pattern, by showing a distinct genetic structure. We found evidence for independent evolution of the three sympatric population pairs, because the populations co-occurring in the same lake were always most closely related. However, genetic differentiation was weak in the two German population pairs, but strong in the Swedish Lake Fegen, indicating that the weak differentiation in the German pairs reported earlier has eroded further. Conclusions Our results suggest that the genetic differentiation at neutral genetic markers among populations of the Baltic cisco complex has evolved (and is maintained) by random genetic drift in isolated populations. However, earlier studies on the Swedish populations combining mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite data indicate that also post-glacial immigration from separate glacial refugia has shaped the present genetic population structure. The low neutral differentiation of the German sympatric pairs in contrast to the Swedish pair suggests that recent anthropogenic effects on the lakes in Germany may put the endemic spring-spawners at risk to extinction.

Winter swarming behavior by the exotic cladoceran Daphnia lumholtzi Sars, 1885 in a Kentucky (USA) reservoir	BIOINVASIONS RECORDS												We describe swarming behavior in the invasive cladoceran Daphnia lumholtzi Sars, 1885 in a Kentucky, USA, reservoir during winter 2017. The taxon is a highly successful tropical invader and has spread throughout the lower latitude systems in the USA since its discovery in 1991. Other than a few isolated reports, the abundance of D. lumholtzi is often <1 organism L-1. Previous studies indicate that D. lumholtzi is a largely thermophilic species often peaking in abundance in late summer after native daphnids are gone from the water column of lakes and reservoirs. Prior to our study, there have been no published reports of swarming behavior by this species.

DO IT YOURSELF: EVALUATING COMMERCIAL CO2 REGULATORS FOR SURVEILLANCE NETWORKS USING PRESSURIZED CYLINDERS	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION												Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a universal attractant for monitoring blood-feeding insects, such as mosquitoes. Although dry ice has been the historical benchmark, compressed gas cylinders can be used in tandem with a gas regulator to control CO2 flow rate more precisely. The literature is sparse on best practices regarding how to choose or test regulators. We evaluated four commercially available regulator types from beverage and welding suppliers and compared them to a previously tested regulator used at the Salt Lake City Mosquito Abatement District (SLCMAD). Using environmental chambers, we simulated both the temperature drop of spring/fall or summer nights down to 9 degrees C, as well as daytime highs within the seasonal expectations of the central ranges of Utah, up to 42 degrees C. Two regulators failed to maintain calibrations in these screenings. The remainder were vetted by acquiring duplicates and rerunning the simulations with inverted temperature exposures, starting low and heating up, instead of starting warm and cooling down in the first tests. The remaining regulators were tested in the field for validation. After 56 trap cycles with 15 duplicates of three regulator models, general failure rates in real applications all decreased below 5% of total uses. The preexisting regulator used by SLCMAD performed well in simulations, but had double the failure rate of the other screened models. We use this study to highlight the scarcity and importance of conducting evaluations on the existing protocols or equipment for public health vector control programs and provide recommendations for addressing operational usage.																			8756-971X	1943-6270				SEP	2025	41	3					143	150											40675570					WOS:001566689900005

In recent years, the productivity and dynamics of its phytoplankton have been particularly sensitive to the interaction between light income and thermal stability. Analysis reveals that interannual differences in the size and duration of phytoplankton crops, as well as in the predominating species, are not random but that there is a reproducible coherence with weather-generated external forcing. Severe light-limitation restricts phytoplankton development outside the stratified period, though delayed stratification in spring may promote relatively large diatom crops. In summer, Microcystis will usually dominate provided its recruitment period coincides with high water clarity. Otherwise Ceratium generally dominates. Examples of extremely stable stratification leading to Scenedesmus dominance and of persistent episodes of summer mixing favouring Oscillatoria dominance are found to agree well with previous matrix models.																			1015-1621						1992	54	1					10	36		10.1007/BF00877262	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00877262													WOS:A1992HR19300002

This study examines spatiotemporal variations and drivers of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes in the Liujiaxia (LJX) Reservoir (1735 m a.s.l.), a high-altitude hydropower system in the upper Yellow River, through multi-season field campaigns (2021-2023). High-frequency flux measurements, stable isotope analyses (S13C-CH4 and S13C-CO2), and statistical modeling identified contrasting emission patterns between central and nearshore zones. Ebullition dominated CH4 emissions (54-86 % of total fluxes), with summer total fluxes surpassing spring and winter levels by factors of 2.8-5.7. Isotopic evidence revealed hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis as the principal pathway in the central zone (alpha c= 1.053 f 0.01; S13C-CH4 =-50.19 f 4.09 %o), contrasting with acetoclastic dominance in nearshore regions (alpha c= 1.028 f 0.01; S13C-CH4 =-65.04 f 6.38 %o), implicating sediment-driven methane production. CO2 fluxes exhibited pronounced seasonality, linked to organic carbon mineralization in nearshore sediments. Hydrological regulation amplified upstream GHG emissions, where CH4 and CO2 fluxes exceeded downstream values by 3.7-and 1.8-fold, respectively. A random forest model, informed by high-resolution spatiotemporal flux data, estimated annual emissions of 0.23 Gg CH4 and 20.18 Gg CO2. These findings underscore the significant influence of hydrologic management and biogeochemical processes on GHG budgets in alpine reservoirs, providing essential data to improve global models of inland water emissions.

Because of its hydrological behaviour, this playa complex can be subdivided into a closed system "sensu-stricto" and an "open-like system" due to the presence of a seasonal outflow. Geomorphological and sedimentological features enable the separation of the Ambargasta playa into well-defined western, eastern and northern zones, where aeolian processes, groundwater supply and surface inflow, respectively, define distinctive sedimentary environments and typical processes of deposition. The following depositional settings were recognized: (1) alluvial fan; (2) sandflat; (3) springs; (4) dunes and palaeo-dune field; (5) dry mudflat; (6) capillary mudflat; (7) ephemeral saline lake (includes saline mudflat and salt pan). The dry mudflat is present at the highest topographical zone, where the groundwater influence is less important and only intermittent ponds are present. In the capillary mudflat, evaporite sedimentation is limited to the development of efflorescence by evaporative pumping. The ephemeral saline lake, placed in the lowermost topographical region, alternates cycles of lake expansion and contraction responding to inter-annual hydrological variability as well as to seasonal variability. Lake expansion takes place during early austral summer (December March), while continuous evaporation of brine leads to the growth of halite crystals during late summer. Sodium chloride-type brines result from both chemical fractionation as evaporation increases and salt dissolution. The isotopic compositions of surficial and underground waters (delta O-18 and delta H-2) indicate that lake waters become isotopically enriched during summer when evaporation plays a significant role in the playa complex.

Diatoms were an important part of the phytoplankton assemblage and, with cryptophytes and chrysophytes, made up 50-80% of the phytoplankton biomass. In mid-winter, chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass were uniformly distributed over the whole water column down to a depth of 90 m. Thus, most of the phytoplankton was in virtual darkness and there was negligible growth. Only motile cryptophytes were concentrated in the layers below the ice and were rare in deep water. After the disappearance of snow, convection developed, but at first cryptophytes were able to resist mixing. When convection turned from penetrative to predominantly horizontal, all phytoplankton were generally uniformly distributed in the water column. In spite of the full under-ice overturn with low average availability of light, the phytoplankton biomass doubled in April. The growth of cryptophytes was higher than that of diatoms, suggesting that motile species gained an advantage by being able to maintain themselves in the upper, illuminated layers. The results show that knowledge of the basic physical framework is essential for interpretation of under-ice phytoplankton results.																			1386-2588	1573-5125				SEP	2009	43	3					707	713		10.1007/s10452-009-9262-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-009-9262-7													WOS:000269837500011

Non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risk assessment of selected metals in soil around a natural water reservoir, Pakistan	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												Contaminants in surface soil can directly pose significant human health risks through oral ingestion, dermal contact and particle inhalation, especially for children. Both non-cancer and cancer risks associated with selected metal levels (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb and Zn) were evaluated in surface soil around Mangla Lake during summer and winter. The results based on average pseudo-total metal concentrations followed the decreasing order: Fe (4038 mg/kg) > Mn (394 mg/kg) > Zn (40 mg/kg) > Pb (17 mg/kg) > Cr (21 mg/kg)> Cu (15 mg/kg) > Cd (1.3 mg/kg) during summer and Fe (3673 mg/kg) > Mn (407 mg/kg) > Zn (30 mg/kg) > Cr (26 mg/kg) > Pb (26 mg/kg)> Cu (14 mg/kg) > Cd (1.8 mg/kg) during winter. Present metal levels in the soil were also compared with other studies and guideline values which showed significant increase in the metal concentrations in this study. The metal levels also showed considerable spatial variations around the lake. The correlation study and multivariate principal component analysis revealed significant anthropogenic contributions of the metals in soils. Aqua-regia extractable (pseudo-total) contents were used as the reference to establish the percentage of bioavailability. After considering the bioavailability (Cd > Pb > Cr > Zn > Cu > Fe > Mn during both seasons), the non-cancer and cancer risks posed by Cd, Pb and Cr was relatively higher than rest of the metals, though the overall hazard index (HI) and cancer risk levels were within the safe limits (1.0 and 1.0E-06, respectively). The overall cancer risk to the adults based on pseudo-total metal concentrations exceeded the target value (1.0E-06), mainly contributed by Cr. A method considering bioavailability is suggested to produce a more realistic estimation for human health risks of trace metals contamination in soil. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Nowlin, WH; Davies, JM; Nordin, RN; Mazumder, A				Nowlin, WH; Davies, JM; Nordin, RN; Mazumder, A			Effects of water level fluctuation and short-term climate variation on thermal and stratification regimes of a British Columbia Reservoir and Lake	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Stratification and thermal regimes of a reservoir with fluctuating water levels were compared to a natural lake of similar morphometry and trophic status over a two-year period (2000-2001) in coastal British Columbia, Canada. We compared the timing and duration of stratification, summer heat budgets and heat fluxes in two morphometrically contrasting basins of Sooke Lake Reservoir and Shawnigan Lake (one shallow and one deep basin per water body). In the second year of the study, a 100-year drought allowed us to compare responses of a reservoir and a take to contrasting years of climatic conditions. Loss of volume from the reservoir during summer and fall caused stratification and thermal regimes to differ from Shawnigan Lake, but the magnitude of these differences was mediated by basin morphometry. Duration of summer stratification, timing of heat content, and the relative importance of seasonal heat fluxes in the shallow basin of Sooke Lake Reservoir were most different from Shawnigan Lake. While there were no major differences between years for Shawnigan Lake, contrasting years in precipitation and hydrology caused Sooke Lake Reservoir stratification and thermal regimes to differ between years. The magnitude of differences between years was mediated by basin size, with the shallower reservoir basin having greater differences between years. Our results indicate that reservoir physical processes are sensitive to short-term changes in hydrology, and that the combined impacts of shortterm climate variation and anthropogenic manipulation of hydrology may be greater in shallow reservoir ecosystems.

In recent years, it has experienced a period of prolonged drought. Using appropriate drought indices to describe the drought characteristics of the Poyang Lake Basin (PLB) is of great practical significance in the face of severe drought situations. This article explores the applicability of four drought indices (including the precipitation anomaly index (PJP), standardized precipitation index (SPI), China Z-index (CPZI), and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI)) based on historical facts. A systematic study was conducted on the spatiotemporal evolution patterns of meteorological drought in the PLB based on the optimal drought index. The results show that SPI is more suitable for the description of drought characteristics in the PLB. Meteorological droughts occur frequently in the summer and autumn in the PLB, with the frequency of mild drought being 17.29% and 16.88%, respectively. The impact range of severe drought or worse reached 22.19% and 28.33% of the entire basin, respectively. The probability of drought occurrence in the PLB shows an increasing trend in spring, while in most areas, it shows a decreasing trend in other seasons, with only a slight increase in the upper reaches of the Ganjiang River (UGR). One of the important factors influencing drought in the PLB is atmospheric circulation. The abnormal variation of the Western Pacific Subtropical High was one of the key factors contributing to the severe drought in the PLB in 2022. This study is based on a long-term series of meteorological data and selects the drought index for the PLB. It describes the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics and evolution patterns of drought and investigates the developmental path and influencing factors of drought in typical years. This study provides a reliable scientific basis for similar watershed water resource management.					; Gui, Zihan/KGQ-7947-2024	Qi, Heshuai/0000-0002-7747-1834; 														2073-4441				MAR	2024	16	5							766	10.3390/w16050766	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16050766													WOS:001182914100001

The chrysophyte flora, along with basic physical and chemical lake water properties from 33 lakes in Finnish Lapland was studied in autumn 2000. The total phytoplankton biomass was dominated by chrysophytes in 15 lakes. Altogether 47 chrysophyte taxa were found, most common taxa being Pseudopedinella sp., Bitrichia chodatii, Dinobryon crenulatum and Uroglena sp. The role of environmental factors in controlling the chrysophyte species distribution was studied using canonical correspondence analysis. SiO2, pH and altitude were shown to be statistically the most significant environmental variables in explaining the distributional patterns.																			0029-5035						2005				128			179	187																WOS:000235193900011
J	Harrad, S; Mao, HJ				Harrad, S; Mao, HJ			Atmospheric PCBs and organochlorine pesticides in Birmingham, UK: concentrations, sources, temporal and seasonal trends	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Concentrations of individual PCBs and DDT, DDE, alpha- and gamma-HCH were recorded in 62 air samples of 24 h duration taken every 1-2 weeks at an urban location in Birmingham, UK between April 1999 and July 2000. Concentrations of PCBs 31/28, 52, 49, 47, 105, 149, 153, 138/164, 174, and 180 were significantly lower (p<0.05) than those recorded at the same site in 1997-1998. While DDT concentrations and DDT:DDE ratios were much lower than those recorded in southern England in 1992-1993; no such decline was observed in concentrations of α- and γ-HCH, or the α:γ-HCH ratio. These data are consistent with declining European usage of DDT, but continuing UK use of γ-HCH, and overseas use and subsequent atmospheric transport of "technical" HCH. γ-HCH concentrations displayed two non-temperature dependent peaks in spring and late summer/early autumn, consistent with agricultural use patterns. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to elucidate the relative influence of temperature, wind direction and a variety of other meteorological variables on atmospheric concentrations of PCBs. When all samples were considered, concentrations of most PCB congeners were influenced by a combination of reciprocal temperature, wind direction, and wind speed. Plotting the ratio of the Beta weightings for the regression coefficients for reciprocal temperature and sine (or cosine) of wind direction against chlorine number, revealed a general increase in the relative influence of temperature compared to wind direction with increasing chlorine number. However, when the 31 samples for which the wind speed <4.4 m s(-1) were analysed; only temperature and atmospheric relative humidity were influential for most congeners. This absence of influence of wind direction under relatively calm atmospheric conditions, suggests that it is medium-to-long range transport rather than local sources that exerts the greatest influence on PCB concentrations at our site.

It is common for 2 layers to flow through the mouth of the bay in opposite directions during the stratified season. Cold hypolimnetic lake water entering through the mouth and extending far into the bay maintains stratification and promotes flushing.

Alongside plowing, arguably the greatest tool in combating snow and ice is salt. The most commonly used salt for winter maintenance is Sodium Chloride (NaCl), the same salt used in food and water softeners, is applied to roads, sidewalks, and parking lots as it is an effective deicer when temperatures are between 0 degrees C and -12 degrees C. Studies have shown that deicing with salt reduces accidents by 88% and injuries by 85% (Salt Institute 2017). The effectiveness of road salt, as well as its relative affordability, means that as much as four million tonnes may be applied annually in Canada for deicing (Environment Canada 2012). However, while salt is relatively inexpensive to purchase, there are a number of external costs that are becoming increasingly apparent. These include corrosion of vehicles and infrastructure like concrete, bridges, and water mains; damage and staining to the interior and exterior of buildings; impacts to roadside vegetation and soils; and the contamination of fresh water. In fact, the environmental impacts are such that it prompted Environment Canada to propose that winter salt be considered a toxic substance primarily due to the quantity that is applied annually (Environment Canada 2001). The Lake Simcoe watershed, approximately 3,400km(2) in size, is situated just 20km north of Toronto, Ontario, with the southern portion of the watershed being considered part of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), the most populous metropolitan area in Canada. As part of the GTA, the Lake Simcoe watershed has experienced and continues to experience considerable growth, and with this growth comes an increase in the amount of impervious surfaces requiring winter salting. Indeed, chloride has been showing a strong increasing trend in the urban creeks and in Lake Simcoe itself over the last 30 years. Even rural creeks are showing an increasing trend, albeit not as severe, nor are the concentrations of chloride reaching the same levels (LSRCA 2015). The highest chloride level recorded in a Lake Simcoe tributary was 6,120mg/l in the winter of 2013. Chloride guidelines for the protection of aquatic ecosystems utilize a guideline of 120mg/L for chronic exposure and 640mg/L for acute exposure (CCME 2011). While the high value recorded in the Lake Simcoe tributary greatly exceeds these guidelines, it is still drastically lower than values being recorded in larger, intensively urbanized catchments such as Cooksville Creek in Mississauga, Ontario, which sees concentrations in excess of 20,000 mg/L, the concentration of sea water, nearly every winter (Credit Valley Conservation personal comm). Similarly, in July of 2011 a small population of Atlantic blue crabs, a marine species, was found surviving in Mimico Creek in Toronto (Toronto Star: May 26, 2012). That a marine species was able to survive in this fresh water creek in summer demonstrates that the impacts of winter salt are not just limited to winter but are impacting shallow groundwater and thus summer baseflow, maintaining high chloride concentrations year round. The same is being seen in some urban creeks in the Lake Simcoe watershed, with summer baseflow concentrations exceeding the chronic guideline and trending upwards (LSRCA unpublished). While not yet as extreme as rivers in the more densely urbanized parts of the GTA, these examples foreshadow what is in store for Lake Simcoe rivers if current winter salt practices continue along with the projected urban growth. During the winter of 2012 an estimated 99,300 tonnes of salt was applied in the Lake Simcoe watershed, an amount that equals nearly 250kg of salt per capita, or similar to 3 times the average person's body weight in salt. This estimate was generated through a survey of local road agencies along with the total area of commercial/institutional parking lots within the watershed. The exercise served to highlight a knowledge gap around application practices and rates in commercial/institutional parking lots. The majority of road agencies were found to record annual volumes, application dates and rates whereas literature values range from 10-40% of the salt applied in a catchment come from commercial/institutional parking lots (Perera et al, 2009; Trowbridge et al, 2010; Lake Simcoe Region Conservation Authority, 2015), and a survey of winter maintenance contractors cite an average value of approximately 58g/m(2)/application (Fu et al, 2013) (Figure 1). [GRAPHICS] While these values were used in the estimation as they were the best available, observational data suggested these may be on the conservative side (Figure 2). Therefore, monitoring of a 14 ha commercial lot was undertaken for the winters of 2014/15, 2015/16, and 2016/17 to better quantify the amount of salt coming from this type of land use. The winters of 2014/15 and 2016/17 saw similar applications of 1,067 and 1,010 tonnes applied respectively, while the mild winter of 2015/16 saw 556 tonnes applied. While the amounts varied somewhat each winter, the impacts downstream were consistent. Maximum concentrations recorded in the melt water reached 3.5 to 4 times the salt concentration of sea water every winter, equating to chloride concentrations of 70,000mg/L to 85,000mg/L; two orders of magnitude above the water quality guideline. [GRAPHICS] As with most parking lots constructed in the last two decades, the runoff from this parking lot is captured in a stormwater pond prior to entering the receiving watercourse. Interestingly, the winter salt also caused persistent chemical stratification in the permanent pool of the pond. The pond was monitored with continuous monitors for the ice free period of 2015 and 2016 (April to December) during which the bottom water chloride concentration remained distinct from the surface chloride concentration, indicating stratification (Figure 3). This has two significant implications; first of which is that this pond, and therefore many other ponds like it, may not be functioning as designed which is leading to diminished performance (McEnroe 2012, Marsalek 2003). Second is that ponds are acting as salt reservoirs, slowly releasing salt year round and contributing to river chloride concentrations that continually exceed the chronic exposure guideline and thereby exposing aquatic life to harmful concentrations during sensitive life cycle stages. To determine the extent to which the catchment land use type impacts stormwater ponds, chemical profiles were measured on three ponds in February 2017. The catchments included the 24.6 ha commercial catchment with 14 ha of salt application surface, an institutional catchment (14.3 ha) with 6 ha of salt application area that includes parking lots and roads, and a 16.4 ha residential catchment with 3 ha of salt application area comprised of tertiary municipal roads. Interestingly, all three ponds showed chemical stratification, with the severity of the stratification and highest chloride concentrations relating to the amount of salt application area in the catchment. The residential pond yielded a maximum chloride concentration of 3,115mg/L in the bottom waters, the institutional yielded 16,144mg/L, and the commercial yielded 25,530 mg/L with chloride concentrations in the bottom 0.5m of the pond exceeding that of sea water. The maximum chloride concentration recorded in the receiving watercourse downstream of the commercial lot was measured at 5,406 mg/L, well in excess of the acute guideline of 640 mg/L. These results highlight that commercial parking lots are not only receiving a significant volume of salt but are also having the most dramatic impacts on receiving stormwater infrastructure and watercourses.																			1552-6100	1943-4618				SPR	2017	12	2					1	12		10.3992/1943-4618.12.2.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.3992/1943-4618.12.2.1													WOS:000406009400001

Dynamic carbon budget of a large shallow lake assessed by a mass balance approach	HYDROBIOLOGIA					3rd European Large Lakes Symposium	SEP, 2012	Lake Constance, GERMANY					To study the role of large and shallow hemiboreal lakes in carbon processing, we calculated a 3-year carbon mass balance for Lake Vrtsjarv (Estonia) based on in situ measurements. This balance took into account hydrological and biogeochemical processes affecting dissolved inorganic (DIC), dissolved organic (DOC) and particulate organic (POC) carbon species. Accumulation varied greatly on a seasonal and yearly basis. The lake exported carbon during most of the year except during spring floods and in late autumn. In-lake processes were responsible for exporting POC and storing DOC while DIC switched between storage and export. The carbon cycle was alternatively dominated in 2009 by biogeochemical processes and in 2011 by riverine fluxes, whereas in 2010 the two process types were of the same magnitude. These results suggest that the role of large shallow lakes like Vrtsjarv in the global C cycle is equally driven by hydrological factors, in particular seasonal water level changes, and by biogeochemical in-lake reactions.

The incidence of infection among adult female copepods exceeded 12% throughout winter (May-October) and was highest in autumn (46%) when population birth rates were depressed by 48.8%. During most of the study, parasitism lowered the rates of population recruitment and growth by more than 10%. These effects on the B. hamata population exceeded those of Aphanomyces on Boeckella dilata Sars in another study. It is hypothesized that the high incidence of parasitism by Aphanomyces and its importance at times in regulating populations of Boeckella in New Zealand lakes may be an ecological consequence of life in predator-poor ecosystems.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				JUN	1989	21	3					421	426		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1989.tb01374.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1989.tb01374.x													WOS:A1989AB75500006
J	Huszar, V; Kruk, C; Caraco, N				Huszar, V; Kruk, C; Caraco, N			Steady-state assemblages of phytoplankton in four temperate lakes (NE USA)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												For four temperate lakes (Northeast U.S.A.) we identify periods of persistent phytoplankton assemblages and investigate the ecological conditions that correlate to these persistent assemblages. Periods of persistent assemblages, here considered as steady-state phases, were defined according to equilibrium criteria (two or three coexisting species, contributing to 80% of the standing biomass, for at least 2 weeks) defined by Sommer et al. (1993, Hydrobiologia 249: 1-7). For all four lakes, samples were taken weekly during the ice-free season and phytoplankton attributes (biomass, assemblages, diversity, species richness, change rates) and abiotic variables (temperature, I*-as light mean in the mixing zone-z(mix), and nutrients) were analysed. Chodikee (CH), an eutrophic and rapidly flushed lake, did not show any persistent phase. The remaining three lakes showed single steady-state phases that occurred at varying times during the ice-free season. Steady-state phases occurred during early stratification in late spring in the stably stratified oligotrophic Mohonk Lake (MO), in the late summer stratification in the mesoeutrophic Stissing Lake (ST), and during spring mixing in Wononscopomuc Lake (WO). MO showed a 3-week period with dominance of F assemblage (Botryococcus braunii, Willea wilhelmii and Eutetramorus planctonicus), characteristic for clear epilimnia, tolerant to low nutrient and sensitive to high turbidity. For three weeks, ST had a stable assemblage with dominance of Lo (Woronichinia sp.), common assemblage in summer epilimnion of mesotrophic lakes and sensitive to prolonged or deep mixing; and P, assemblage able to live in eutrophic epilimnia with mild light and sensitive to stratification and silica depletion. In contrast, the mesotrophic Wononscopomuc Lake (WO) showed persistent assemblages during a 4-week period of spring circulation, when a dinoflagellate (Lo) was co-dominant with Nitzschia acicularis (C). The latter species is characteristic for mesotrophic lakes, tolerant to low light and sensitive to stratification and silica depletion. Both Lo and P assemblages, among seven others, had before been quoted, in literature, as dominant in maturing stages. We could not find consistent statistical differences between the periods classified as steady-state and non-steady-state. However, the data demonstrated that prolonged period of both mixing and stratification can maintain dominant assemblages. Although, historically sensed as opposite mechanisms, both mixing and stratification, if persistent, were observed maintaining dominant assemblages because both scenarios are characterized by environmental constancy.					; Huszar, Vera/J-7126-2012	Huszar, Vera/0000-0002-8096-1404; Kruk, Carla/0000-0003-0760-1186													0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL	2003	502	1-3					97	109		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000004273.40488.00	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000004273.40488.00													WOS:000186636900008

This partitioning between channelized and distributed drainage systems is difficult to quantify yet it plays an important role in bulk meltwater chemistry and glacial velocity, and thus subglacial erosion. Radon-222, which is continuously produced via the decay of Ra-226, accumulates in meltwater that has interacted with rock and sediment. Hence, elevated concentrations of Rn-222 should be indicative of meltwater that has flowed through a distributed drainage system network. In the spring and summer of 2011 and 2012, we made hourly Rn-222 measurements in the proglacial river of a large outlet glacier of the GrIS (Leverett Glacier, SW Greenland). Radon 222 activities were highest in the early melt season (10-15 dpm L-1), decreasing by a factor of 2-5 (3-5 dpm L-1) following the onset of widespread surface melt. Using a Rn-222 mass balance model, we estimate that, on average, greater than 90% of the river Rn-222 was sourced from distributed system meltwater. The distributed system Rn-222 flux varied on diurnal, weekly, and seasonal time scales with highest fluxes generally occurring on the falling limb of the hydrograph and during expansion of the channelized drainage system. Using laboratory based estimates of distributed system Rn-222, the distributed system water flux generally ranged between 1-5% of the total proglacial river discharge for both seasons. This study provides a promising new method for hydrograph separation in glacial watersheds and for estimating the timing and magnitude of distributed system fluxes expelled at ice sheet margins.

J	Matsuoka, N				Matsuoka, Norikazu			Frost weathering and rockwall erosion in the southeastern Swiss Alps: Long-term (1994-2006) observations	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Rates and processes of frost weathering in the Alps were investigated by visual observations of intensively shattered rocks, continuous monitoring of frost wedging and rock temperatures in bedrock and measurements of rockfall activity. Rapid frost weathering of hard-intact rocks occurs along lakes and streams where seasonal freezing promotes ice segregation in the rock. Otherwise, rocks require pre-existing weakness or a long exposure period for intensively shattered. Automated monitoring shows that crack opening occurs at three scales, including small opening accompanying short-term frost cycles, slightly larger movements during seasonal freezing and occasional large opening originating from refreezing of snow-melt water during seasonal thawing. The opening events require at least partial water saturation in the crack. The repetition of crack opening (frost wedging) results in permanent opening and finally debris dislocation. Debris collections below fractured rockwalls show that pebble falls occur at an average rate of about 0.1 mm a(-1) with significant spatial and inter-annual variations. Occasional large boulder falls significantly raise the rockwall erosion rates, controlled by such factors as the joint distribution in the bedrock, repetition of annual freeze-thaw cycles and extraordinary summer thaw.

J	Tymowski, RG; Duthie, HC				Tymowski, RG; Duthie, HC			Life strategy and phosphorus relations of the cyanobacterium Gloeotrichia echinulata in an oligotrophic Precambrian Shield lake	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Experiments to measure phosphorus uptake by the cyanobacterium Gloeotrichia echinulata (J. E. SMITH) RICHTER from lake sediments and from epilimnetic water show that phosphorus accumulated from the sediments by benthic colonies plays an important role in the development of planktonic populations, whereas uptake from epilimnetic water by vegetative colonies is insignificant. During the spring and summer of 1996, the cellular phosphorus quota of both benthic and epilimnetic Gloeotrichia colonies was monitored in the oligotrophic Peninsula Lake, central Ontario, Canada, in order to detect signs of luxury uptake and subsequent utilisation during growth. Assays were also used to measure the rate of phosphorus uptake from the sediment and from lake water. G. echinulata, which overwinters in the form of the benthic akinete packets, is capable of obtaining phosphorus directly from the sediments following germination in early summer, and subsequent growth in the epilimnion is based almost entirely on accumulated reserves.																			0003-9136					JUN	2000	148	3					321	332																WOS:000087780800001
J	SHANKS, WC; CALLENDER, E				SHANKS, WC; CALLENDER, E			THERMAL SPRINGS IN LAKE BAIKAL	GEOLOGY												Pore waters extracted from sediment cores were analyzed for their oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions and major ion chemistry to determine the source of water from a vent area for diffuse lake-bottom thermal springs or seeps in Frolikha Bay, northeastern Lake Baikal. The delta-O-18 values of pore waters range from -15.2 parts per thousand to -16.7 parts per thousand and delta-D values range from -119 parts per thousand to -126 parts per thousand (both isotopes determined relative to standard mean ocean water [SMOW]). Bottom water in Lake Baikal has a delta-O-18 value of -5.6 parts per thousand and a delta-D value of -120 parts per thousand. Pore waters in the vent area are significantly enriched in Mg, K, Ca, and especially Na and have the lowest delta-D and delta-O-18 values; these pore waters are isotopically and chemically distinct from pore waters in other, more typical parts of the lake. The pore-water isotopic data fall on a local meteoric water line, and covariations in water isotopes and chemistry are not consistent with evaporation or hydrothermal water-rock interaction. The thermal springs represent discharging meteoric waters that have been gently heated during subsurface circulation and are largely unaltered isotopically. Chemical variations are most likely due to dissolution of subsurface evaporites.																			0091-7613					JUN	1992	20	6					495	497		10.1130/0091-7613(1992)020<0495:TSILB>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0091-7613(1992)020<0495:TSILB>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1992HW49500004

Relation of Changes in CO2 Concentration over Large Water Areas of the Boreal and Subarctic Zones of the Northern Hemisphere with Their Phenological Phases Determined from SMOS Satellite Data	IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS												This article presents the results of a comparison of atmospheric carbon dioxide reanalysis data and phenological phases of large freshwater areas located in the boreal and subarctic zones for 2012-2020. The paper uses the CAMS global greenhouse gas reanalysis data, which are three-dimensional fields of aerosol and chemical component content in the atmosphere, with full coverage of the globe. This study used data on the average CO2 content in the air column above the water areas. Phenological phases of freshwater bodies (water surface, ice cover, and ice destruction) were determined based on data from the MIRAS microwave radiometer on the SMOS satellite. Comparison and analysis showed that the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere above the studied water areas has a seasonal cyclical nature. The minimum concentration corresponds to the summer period due to strong photosynthesis in the water areas, as a result of which carbon dioxide is absorbed in the water column. The maximum concentration of CO(2 )over water areas corresponds to the period of ice cover destruction, leading to the release of carbon dioxide accumulated during the winter period, which is "sealed" in the ice and in the water column under the ice. In addition to the stable spring maximum of CO2, freezing lakes located in the boreal zone sometimes experience a strong short-term emission of carbon dioxide, also corresponding to the stage of ice cover destruction. This emission is explained by the higher bioproductivity of water bodies in the boreal zone compared to water areas of subarctic zone.

During summer 2019, specimens of Cottus gobio were sampled in 15 watercourses of Friuli Venezia-Giulia Region (Italy) to verify if hepatic steatosis is or not normally present in the species. To do this, hepatic vacuolization was assessed by histology using a semiquantitative score. Furthermore, C. gobio were also captured during the ice-free season at Dimon Lake (1872 m a.s.l.) and But Stream (520 m a.s.l.) to compare the trend in lipid accumulation: water temperature, hepatosomatic index (HSI), gonadosomatic index (GSI), Fulton's condition factor (K), and lipid area percentage (lipid %) were measured monthly. Findings revealed that liver steatosis is rather common in C. gobio. However, the trend in lipid accumulation of this species differed between Dimon Lake and But Stream. Based on the HSI and the GSI, the reproductive cycles differed in fish from the two environments (April-May in But Stream; May-June in Dimon Lake). While K values remained unchanged in the But Stream specimens, significant changes were recorded for Dimon specimens. The increase in lipid % from July to August in the Dimon Lake specimens coincided with greater food availability. With the rapid drop in lake water temperature in October, the lipid % decreased due to slower metabolic rate and lipid utilization from liver stores. There was a slight decrease in lipid % in the But Stream specimens, indicating that lipids were not being accumulated. Introduced years ago, the Dimon Lake bullhead population has since adapted to the winter conditions at high elevation.					; menconi, Vasco/ABH-1632-2020; Prearo, Marino/AAF-3369-2021; Pastorino, Paolo/T-5288-2019	Bertoli, Marco/0000-0001-8345-6107; menconi, Vasco/0000-0003-1176-6995; PIZZUL, ELISABETTA/0000-0001-9916-5005; Giulianini, Piero Giulio/0000-0001-5356-7754; Pastorino, Paolo/0000-0002-0585-1168; Prearo, Marino/0000-0002-2847-6006														1424-2818				DEC	2020	12	12							442	10.3390/d12120442	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d12120442													WOS:000602185700001

Structure of snow-ice dams of the outburst lakes in the Broknes Peninsula (Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica) based on ground-penetrating radar data	LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW												During the summer field season of the 65th Russian Antarctic Expedition a research aimed at studying the structure of the snow-ice dams of the Lakes Progress and Discussion (Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica), which are characterized with annual outburst floods, was carried out. Survey was performed using ground-penetrating radar sounding complemented with non-core drilling and analysis of the aerial photo data acquired with unmanned aerial vehicle during the last field seasons. The results show that location of the waterways, which occur during the outbursts of the both lakes, does not change significantly year in year out and fits a linear depression in basement topography under the dam and a following flexure of the ice layer. During the winter period, the opened channels are being filled with snow, and thereby a natural softened zone is being formed. Further outburst flood propagates mainly within this zone. Monitoring survey of the snow-ice dam of the Progress Lake during the summer period showed that destruction of the dam does not happen rapidly when the outburst takes place, but begins a few weeks before it with gradual filtration within the snow layer.

Sediment proved to be enzymatically active to 30-35 cm down in the hypertrophic Keszthely Bay and to 15-20 cm down in the meso-eutrophic Siofok Basin. Sediment ETS-activity exceeded planktonic activity 15 to 24 fold. The total activity m-2 Showed one or two order of magnitude higher respiratory potential in Lake Balaton than needed for complete oxidation of the planktonic primary production; most of this potential was detected in the upper 3-5 cm sediment layer in springs. Incubations of cell-free homogenates of sediment bacteria showed that ETS remains active days after death of organisms at low temperature. Accumulated postmortem ETS-activity derived from the benthic diatoms, bacteria, plankton deposit and dead summer macrophytes seems to be responsible for the high ETS-activity of the sediment in the warming periods in springs. These enzyme fractions may contribute to the rapid oxidation of the alkaline, well-aerated lake.

J	Lucas, CH; Lawes, S				Lucas, CH; Lawes, S			Sexual reproduction of the scyphomedusa Aurelia aurita in relation to temperature and variable food supply	MARINE BIOLOGY												The effects of food availability and temperature on sexual maturation and female reproductive output of the scyphomedusa Aurelia aurita was examined in two populations from the contrasting environments of Southampton Water and Horsea Lake, England. Trends in oogenesis and subsequent reproductive output differed markedly between the two populations. In Southampton Water, the onset of sexual maturation occurred earliest in the larger medusae, but eventually all females became ripe, the smallest being 45 mm bell diameter (BD). The decrease in minimum size at maturity was correlated with increasing temperature. In A. aurita from Horsea Lake, size at maturity varied on a seasonal basis, with the smallest ripe female being only 19 to 20 mm ED. There were spring and autumn periods of sexual maturation in this population. During the autumn period, it is likely that food limitation was playing a more critical role in determining medusa size, with decreasing temperature indirectly affecting A. aurita by limiting primary and secondary production. In similar-sized ripe medusae, fecundity was greater in Southampton Water, but the planula larvae produced were significantly smaller than those in Horsea Lake. It is suggested that in Horsea Lake, the quality of the larvae are greater in terms of biochemical content to ensure survival of the few gametes produced (i.e. K-strategy). Comparison of the reproductive effort of the two A. aurita populations revealed that medusae from Southampton Water, which experience greater food availability, are able to direct more energy to reproduction than Horsea Lake medusae. Tn the latter, A. aurita medusae appear to partition the available food resources into either somatic growth (and therefore increased future fecundity) when food is abundant, or reproductive growth when food is scarce.

This study is aimed at predicting the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall in the Lake Tana sub-basin from 1990 to 2020. A satellite-based rainfall estimate of Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) was used with the same spanning period (1990-2020). The validation process employs point-to-pixel analysis, comparing CHIRPS estimates with observed data at specific gauge stations. The findings showed that CHIRPS had well-estimated rainfall incidence in the highland areas and significantly overestimated it in the lowland areas. The Mann-Kendall trends for January, June, and August indicate decreasing trends, while the Bega and spring seasons show notable declines. Regression analysis reveals a non-significant decrease in annual rainfall with the highest rainfall in the summer and relatively dry winters. In addition, the coefficient of variation value of 26.37% suggests a moderate level of variability around the mean annual rainfall. In conclusion, the CHIRPS satellite exhibited varied performance across the Tana Sub-basin, with site-specific discrepancies and notable inaccuracies at certain stations. The study underscores the importance of considering local factors and topography in satellite-based rainfall assessments, providing valuable insights for agricultural planning in the region. HIGHLIGHTS center dot The variability of rainfall was investigated using the standardized anomaly index, coefficient of variation, and precipitation concentration index. center dot The percentage of daily rainfall events with high intensity was overestimated while the number of daily rainfall events with light precipitation was underestimated by Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Station data.

A study on the seasonal changes of Microcystis and Anabaena was carried out over a period of 12 months from March 2021 to February 2022 in two rural fish ponds to see the effect of environmental factors on the seasonal dynamics of these two species. Cyanobacterial community comprised of seven genera and 15 species of which Microcystis was found to be the most dominant genus. Overabundance of Microcyctis may suppress the growth of Anabaena and other microalgal species. In both ponds, Microcyctis was found to be the dominant during the summer and the spring, whereas Anabaena was only characterized in summer. Moderately higher temperature, nitrate-nitrogen, and phosphate-phosphorus enrichment increased the biomass of both Microcystis and Anabaena. Microcystin was found in all the seasons with the highest quantity in summer in the cyanobacteria samples collected from both of the ponds. The highest concentrations of MCs were 22 and 65 mu g/L of the sampled water during the peak bloom period of blue-green algae in pond 1 and pond 2, respectively. The high concentration of microcystin in water seems to be a pernicious warning for aquatic organisms as well as human health. Further studies in detail on the relationship between microcystin and cyanobacterial growth under different environmental factors seem to be necessary.

However, during 1999-2001, the lake was dominated by dinophytes and diatoms and had a relatively low phytoplankton biomass and a very turbid state.. Increased stocking of silver carp and bighead carp during the interim years eliminated cyanobacterial blooms and large-bodied daphnids from the lake, creating favorable conditions for growth of the small-sized algae.

Current and Retrospective Numbers of Anseriform Birds in Autumn Migration in the Selenga River Delta (Republic of Buryatia, Lake Baikal)	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												After the results of autumn counts of waterfowl in the Selenga delta in 2018-2020, their recent numbers during the autumn migration are estimated and compared with the results of analogous intensive censuses in 1989-1995. A decrease in the numbers and percentages in some duck species is found (northern pintail, Eurasian wigeon, northern shoveler, and pochard); these parameters are rather stable in the mallard. Recent data on stopover longevity obtained in other regions of the world let us give more precise retrospective estimates for numbers of waterfowl having visited the Selenga delta during autumn migrations in the second half of the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s. More adequate numbers of stopping birds in the period mentioned above are 0.5-1.1 million individuals per season (at least, no less) instead of the 2-5 million proposed earlier. At present, the lower number limit for ducks having visited the delta per autumn season appears to be 0.3 million individuals; intensive counts during all autumn migration are necessary to set the upper limit. Numbers of waterfowl are approximately twice as low now as 30-35 years ago. The reasons for their decrease need to be sought outside the Selenga delta, probably in the general situation in regional and transregional geographical populations. The delta continues supporting more than 1% of the East Asian geographical population of the pochard, which has recently been labeled Vulnerable in the Red List of the IUCN. The Kabansky Nature Sanctuary plays a very important role as a no-take zone for waterbirds during autumn hunting seasons.

The Role of Nitrogen Fixation in Cyanobacterial Bloom Toxicity in a Temperate, Eutrophic Lake	PLOS ONE												Toxic cyanobacterial blooms threaten freshwaters worldwide but have proven difficult to predict because the mechanisms of bloom formation and toxin production are unknown, especially on weekly time scales. Water quality management continues to focus on aggregated metrics, such as chlorophyll and total nutrients, which may not be sufficient to explain complex community changes and functions such as toxin production. For example, nitrogen (N) speciation and cycling play an important role, on daily time scales, in shaping cyanobacterial communities because declining N has been shown to select for N fixers. In addition, subsequent N pulses from N-2 fixation may stimulate and sustain toxic cyanobacterial growth. Herein, we describe how rapid early summer declines in N followed by bursts of N fixation have shaped cyanobacterial communities in a eutrophic lake (Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, USA), possibly driving toxic Microcystis blooms throughout the growing season. On weekly time scales in 2010 and 2011, we monitored the cyanobacterial community in a eutrophic lake using the phycocyanin intergenic spacer (PC-IGS) region to determine population dynamics. In parallel, we measured microcystin concentrations, N-2 fixation rates, and potential environmental drivers that contribute to structuring the community. In both years, cyanobacterial community change was strongly correlated with dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations, and Aphanizomenon and Microcystis alternated dominance throughout the pre-toxic, toxic, and post-toxic phases of the lake. Microcystin concentrations increased a few days after the first significant N-2 fixation rates were observed. Then, following large early summer N-2 fixation events, Microcystis increased and became most abundant. Maximum microcystin concentrations coincided with Microcystis dominance. In both years, DIN concentrations dropped again in late summer, and N-2 fixation rates and Aphanizomenon abundance increased before the lake mixed in the fall. Estimated N inputs from N-2 fixation were large enough to supplement, or even support, the toxic Microcystis blooms.					; Miller, Todd/Y-3612-2019; McMahon, Katherine/JXY-0145-2024	McMahon, Katherine D./0000-0002-7038-026X; Miller, Todd/0000-0002-2113-1662; 													1932-6203					FEB 6	2013	8	2							e56103	10.1371/journal.pone.0056103	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0056103								23405255					WOS:000315153400201

Modern and early-middle Holocene shells of the freshwater mollusc Unio, from Catalhoyuk in the Konya Basin, Turkey: preliminary palaeoclimatic implications from molluscan isotope data	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE												Carbon and oxygen isotope ratios in the shells of the freshwater Unio mollusc yield information on the isotopic composition of the water in which the shell was formed, which in turn relates to climatic conditions prevailing during the bivalves' life span. Here we analysed shells from one modern Unio, from a modern lake shore in Anatolia, and 4 subfossil Unio shells from Catalhoyuk (dated between 7200 BC and 5000 BC, Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods). Sequential carbon and oxygen isotope analysis along the surface of the shells provides information on seasonal or shorter-term variability of lake waters during the lifetime of the organisms. delta O-18 values of the modern shell are consistent with it being collected from a dammed portion of the Seyhan River that does not undergo intensive summer evaporation. This is in contrast to many of the surface water bodies in Anatolia which suffer extensive evaporation in the arid summers. delta O-18 values of the subfossil shells from the Catalhoyuk middens indicate that the bivalves came from lakes which evaporated extensively during the summer months but were replenished by high winter rainfall, suggesting that the subfossil shells lived in relatively small lakes or ponds. Stable isotope analysis along the growth of freshwater bivalves is one of the few methods for investigating seasonal water fluctuations in the past.

Changing climatic conditions seriously put an impact on these available ice and snow masses. These glaciers may affect downstream population by glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF) and surge events due to climatic variation. So, monitoring of these glaciers and available ice masses is important. This research delivers an approach for dynamics of major glaciers of the Hunza River Basin. We delineated 27 major glaciers of HRB and examined their status by using Landsat (OLI, ETM+, ETM, TM), digital elevation model (DEM) over the period of 1990-2018. In 1990, the total area covered by these glaciers is about 2589.75 +/- 86 km(2) and about 2565.12 +/- 68km(2) in 2018. Our results revealed that from 2009 to 2015, glacier coverage of HRB advanced with a mean annual advance rate of 2.22 +/- 0.1 km(2) a(-1). Conversely, from 1994 to 1999, the strongest reduction in glacier area with a mean rate of - 3.126 +/- 0.3 km(2) a(-1) is recorded. The glaciers of HRB are relatively stable compared to Hindukush, Himalayan, and Tibetan Plateau region of the world. The steep slope glacier's retreat rate is more than that of gentle slope glaciers, and the glaciers below an elevation of 5000 m above sea level change significantly. Based on climate data from 1995 to 2018, HRB shows a decreasing trend in temperature and increasing precipitation. The glacier area's overall retreat is due to an increase in summer temperature while the glacier advancement is induced possibly by winter and autumn precipitation.

Nutrient-diffusing artificial substrata were used in summer and autumn to assess limiting nutrients for periphytic algal growth in streams draining sub-alpine, forested, agricultural and urban catchments in eastern Victoria, Australia. 2. Chlorophyll a density was primarily limited by nitrogen in most cases; often phosphorus was secondarily limiting. One sub-alpine, one forest and one agricultural stream were primarily phosphorus limited in at least one season. Added trace elements and vitamins did not increase chlorophyll density. 3. The dominant filamentous algal genera did not differ greatly between various nutrient enrichments. However, the relative abundance of Stigeoclonium spp. was sometimes increased on substrata containing the limiting nutrient. 4. The results suggest that nutrient limitation is a widespread phenomenon in Victorian streams, and that limiting nutrients can be inferred from stream-water nitrogen to phosphorus ratios in many instances.

For the next 2 yr, the persistence of picloram was monitored in the soil at sites within and outside the treatment area. Picloram was monitored for a 3-yr period in the groundwater at off-target sites and in the surface waters and sediments of a creek and two lakes adjoining the treatment area. Extensive leaching of the herbicide was noted. After 14 months residues were recovered from the 60- to 90-cm soil depths, and after 22 months from the 90- to 120-cm soil layer. After 26 months between 138 and 396 g ha-1 of picloram were recovered from the top 120-cm soil depth. Picloram was detected in the top 30 cm of soils, approximately 1 km from the treatment area, when sampled 14 and 22 months following the initial application. Picloram (0.25-83.3 .mu.g L-1) was recovered after 35 months from groundwater samples collected at 120 cm from the same off-target sites. This transfer to nontreated sites was considered to result from a combination of blowing surface soil and groundwater movement from the treated area. Samples of surface waters taken from a lake approximately 1 km from the treatment zone indicated that picloram residues could be detected (0.1-1.15 .mu.g L-1) in the falls of 1983 and 1984, but not in the summers of 1984 and 1985. Traces of picloram (0.14-0.39 .mu.g L-1) were recovered in the fall of 1983 and summer of 1985 in creek waters situated approximately 300 m from the edge of the treatment area. Picloram was detected (12 .mu.g kg-1) in only one lake sediment sample at one sampling period.																			0047-2425	1537-2537				APR-JUN	1988	17	2					262	268		10.2134/jeq1988.00472425001700020017x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1988.00472425001700020017x													WOS:A1988N218700016
J	Huybers, P; Tziperman, E				Huybers, Peter; Tziperman, Eli			Integrated summer insolation forcing and 40,000-year glacial cycles: The perspective from an ice-sheet/energy-balance model	PALEOCEANOGRAPHY												Although the origins of the 40,000-year glacial cycles during the early Pleistocene are readily attributed to changes in Earth's obliquity (also having a 40,000-year period), the lack of ice-volume variability at precession periods (20,000 years) is difficult to reconcile with most parameterizations of the insolation forcing. It was recently proposed that precession's influence on glaciation is muted because variations in the intensity of summer insolation are counterbalanced by changes in the duration of the summertime, but no climate model has yet been shown to generate obliquity period glacial cycles in response to the seasonal insolation forcing. Here we present a coupled ice-sheet/energy-balance model that reproduces the seasonal cycle and, when run over long time periods, generates glacial variability in response to changes in Earth's orbital configuration. The model is forced by the full seasonal cycle in insolation, and its response can be understood within the context of the integrated summer insolation forcing. The simple fact that obliquity's period is roughly twice as long as that of precession results in a larger amplitude glacial response to obliquity. However, for the model to generate almost exclusively obliquity period glacial variability, two other conditions must be met. First, the ice sheet's ablation zone must reside poleward of similar to 60 degrees N because insolation intensity is more sensitive to changes in Earth's obliquity at high latitudes. Second, the ablation season must be long enough for precession's opposing influences on summer and fall insolation intensity to counterbalance one another. These conditions are consistent with a warm climate and a thin ice sheet, where the latter is simulated as a response to subglacial sediment deformation. If a colder climate is prescribed, or in the absence of basal motion, ice sheets tend to be larger and undergo greater precession period variability, in keeping with proxy observations of late Pleistocene glaciation.					; Tziperman, Eli/A-1219-2008	Huybers, Peter/0000-0002-3734-8145; 													0883-8305	1944-9186				FEB 13	2008	23	1							PA1208	10.1029/2007PA001463	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2007PA001463													WOS:000253237000001

We used high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA genes to study seasonal dynamics of bacterial and microeukaryotic communities at pelagic site of Lake Baikal from spring (under-ice, mixing) to autumn (direct stratification). The microbial community was subdivided into distinctive coherent clusters of operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Individual OTUs were consistently replaced during different seasonal events. The coherent clusters change their contribution to the microbial community depending on season. Changes of temperature, concentrations of silicon, and nitrates are the key factors affected the structure of microbial communities. Functional prediction revealed that some bacterial or eukaryotic taxa that switched with seasons had similar functional properties, which demonstrate their functional redundancy. We have also detected specific functional properties in different coherent clusters of bacteria or microeukaryotes, which can indicate their ability to adapt to seasonal changes of environment. Our results revealed a relationship between seasonal succession, coherency, and functional features of freshwater bacteria and microeukaryotes.

J	DRAGO, EC				DRAGO, EC			THERMAL SUMMER CHARACTERISTICS OF LAKES AND PONDS ON DECEPTION ISLAND, ANTARCTICA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												During January and February 1981, water temperature measurements were made in lakes and ponds of Deception Island, Antarctica. The depth of these water bodies varies between 0.88 m and 36 m, with maximum surface areas of over 290 000 m2. Some ponds freeze completely during winter, and the lakes are covered by ice for 9-10 months of each year. The maximum ice thickness measured in early summer (December), did not exceed 0.5 m. Solar radiation and geothermal heating largely determine the thermal structure of these aquatic environments. The water temperature of tributary meltwater streams did not exceed 3.degree.C, but the littoral waters reached 9.degree.C. The bottom water temperatures of meromictic lakes 5 (Irizar) and 9, are 12.3.degree.C and 19.9.degree.C respectively. These deep waters are heated from geothermal sources and it is possible that some ponds may be also influenced by their proximity to hot soils. With the exception of the meromictic lakes, the aquatic environments studied here did not show a vertical stratification of temperature. It is not possible to establish a general thermal classification for the waterbodies of Deception Island. The interaction of the lacustrine morphology, solar radiation and vulcanism produce contrasting thermal features. Taking into account only the upper layers of meromictic lakes (mixolimnion), and emphasizing the fact of that some ponds freeze completely during winter, the waterbodies of Deception Island would be classified as ''pleomictics'' (Paschaslki, 1964).																			0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV 1	1989	184	1-2					51	60		10.1007/BF00014301	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00014301													WOS:A1989CB24100006

A considerable proportion of the population of the floodplain lake immigrated into the channel at dusk and left it at dawn. During two winters (1994-1995, 1997-1998) the abundance of fishes increased considerably in the channels. The winter migrations, studied in detail in one of the channels in 1997-1998, started in late October, when the water temperature dropped below 10degrees C. In contrast to the mean of 500 fishes per 100 m channel length between May and October, >5000 fishes were found from November to March, with maximum values of >50 000 fishes per 100 m channel length in February 1998. More than 90% of these shoals were 0+ year fishes, dominated by roach Rutilus rutilus, bream, perch Perca fluviatilis and rudd Scardinius erythrophthahmus. These shoals entered the channel at sunrise and left it around sunset. Generally, the 0+ year fishes in the shoals swam separately from the older fishes, and different reactions towards the attack of predatory fishes were observed. The migrating shoals of juvenile fishes during the winter were interpreted as a strategy to minimize predation risk. (C) 2002 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

J	HARRISON, AF				HARRISON, AF			LABILE ORGANIC PHOSPHORUS MINERALIZATION IN RELATIONSHIP TO SOIL PROPERTIES	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												The relationships between the rate of mineralization of labile organic P and soil chemical and physical properties were investigated in 50 Lake District woodland soils. The rate of mineralization was primarily related to soil pH and extractable Ca contents. Interactions were found with underlying geology and season of the year. On soils overlying slate grit and andesite-tuff rocks, mineralization was also highly related to phosphatase activity and soil respiration rates; no such relationships were found for soils overlying limestone. In autumn, rates of mineralization, some of which were negative, were strongly positively correlated with water-soluble and bicarbonate extractable inorganic P and organic P contents but no such relationships were found in spring, when mineralization rate was significantly negatively related to bicarbonate-extractable organic P contents. Over 90% of the variation in rates of mineralization were accounted for by soil chemical and physical properties. Nearly half the variation in rates of mineralization were accounted for by plant-available P contents of soils.																			0038-0717	1879-3428					1982	14	4					343	351		10.1016/0038-0717(82)90004-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0038-0717(82)90004-9													WOS:A1982PB41300004
J	Väänänen, VM				Väänänen, VM			Hunting disturbance and the timing of autumn migration in Anas species	WILDLIFE BIOLOGY												In Europe, waterfowl hunting is a popular recreational activity, especially in waterfowl staging and wintering areas, but also in breeding areas such as Finland. This paper gives an account of hunting disturbance, timing of autumn migration and refuge use in Anas species in eutrophic wetlands in central Finland (63 degreesN, 27 degreesE) during 1995-1999. Based on the timing of migration, duck species may be divided into early and late migrants. In two lakes (total area 2.2 km(2)) which were monitored on a weekly basis during 1995-1998, numbers of late migrants, i.e. mallard Anas platyrhynchos, teal Anas crecca and wigeon Anas penelope, increased towards the opening of hunting season on 20 August, whereas shoveler Anas clypeata, pintail Anas acuta and garganey Anas querquedula migrated early, and peak numbers of these species occurred already in the beginning of August. Consequently, in Finland's inland lake area, hunting disturbance relates differently to early and late migrating species. Immediately after the opening of the season the numbers of dabbling ducks collapsed and the average numbers in the wetlands were only 9.3% of the numbers present at the end of the protection period in 1995-1998. A corresponding decrease in numbers occurred in 13 lakes (total area 8.5 km(2)) in the Finnish inland lake district in 1999. After the beginning of the open season numbers of wigeon, teal and mallard decreased in unprotected areas,but increased in a refuge area. In Finland, refuge areas with high-quality foraging and moulting habitats for waterfowl are few, so a network of waterfowl reserves could mitigate the effects of hunting disturbance.																			0909-6396					MAR	2001	7	1					3	9																WOS:000167691000002

Using pigment analysis, the contribution of diatom chlorophyll, and green and red algal chlorophyll to total chlorophyll-a was calculated. The green and red algae in this lake are relatively important in the summer period, contributing > 50% of total chlorophyll at the bankside. In summer, total chlorophyll is at a minimum. From autumn through May, the number of diatoms increases, as does the chlorophyll-a concentration. Simultaneously, the architecture becomes increasingly complex, eventually resulting in 3 readily distinguishable layers of diatoms. The basal and intermediate layer from the main part of the architecture during the colonization period of the diatoms. The upper layer become important after Jan., reaching its maximum development in May. In that period, the basal layer apparently detoriates, showing an increase in chlorotic cells and a heavy fungal infection. The light availability within the reed-belt was not a limiting factor at the dramatic decrease in chlorophyll-a. Self-shading by the top layer of the periphtic community may have a detrimental effect on the basal cells, being responsible for the separation of the periphytic community from its substratum.																			0003-9136						1985	102	4					487	502																WOS:A1985ADE2100007

Long-term fate of a pulse arsenic input to a eutrophic lake	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The long-term fate of a 30-year-old pulse arsenic input to a eutrophic lake was studied to determine if As has become effectively trapped in sediments or remains in active exchange with the water column. Legacy As was readily mobilized from sediments of Spy Pond (Arlington, MA), a eutrophic kettle-hole lake that was treated with 1000s kg As in the 1960s to manage excessive aquatic macrophyte growth. Arsenic was mobilized from hypolimnetic sediments during bottom-water anoxia in spring, summer, and fall, and As accumulated to maximum concentrations of 2100 nM. Mobilization of As from epilimnetic sediments was the largest source of As to the water column on a mass basis (145 mol), despite the fact that the epilimnion remains oxic year-round. Sediment cores revealed that surficial sediments contained As at 30-50 times background levels and suggested that there is contemporary As loading to hypolimnetic sediments (590 mol y(-1)). Mass balance estimates indicate that < 5% of the contemporary As load comes from external inputs and that the remainder can be explained by mobilization and redistribution of legacy As, both through the water column and by vertical migration of dissolved As within sediments. These findings demonstrate that, decades after As inputs cease, As in contaminated sediments may remain labile and be mobilized to both anoxic and oxic water columns and accumulate to levels near the sediment surface and in the water column that may pose ongoing risks to ecological health.					; Senn, David/HLX-8942-2023; Senn, David/E-7813-2010	Gawel, James/0000-0002-1595-3678; Senn, David/0000-0002-4869-3550; 													0013-936X					MAY 1	2007	41	9					3062	3068		10.1021/es062444m	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es062444m								17539505					WOS:000246371100011
J	Faithful, JW				Faithful, John W.			Physico-chemical changes in two northern headwater lakes in the Northwest Territories, Canada, during winter to spring seasonal transitions	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												This note describes extended monitoring of two small headwater lakes in the Lockhart River in the Northwest Territories (Canada) during consecutive late winter and spring transitions. During these transitions, the lakes changed from isolated ice-bound water bodies to interconnected lakes, throughout which they exhibited similar modifications to their physico-chemical characteristics. Lake temperature changes were linked to ambient conditions, with warming after May 1 initiating snow- and ice melt inflows. Lake temperatures of 3 degrees C to 4 degrees C were measured in both lakes at the start of monitoring, which were maintained until a steady increase commenced in early June 1 as ice cover started to recede. This period was also associated with peak water levels and lake discharges. Conductivity decreases (similar to 26 to similar to 12 mu S/cm in the larger, shallower lake, Area 8, to 16 to 11 mu S/cm in the smaller, deeper lake, Lake I1) commenced around mid-May, in advance of lake temperatures increases, and stabilized after approximately 3 weeks once lake ice had melted. The extent of lake dilution based on conductivity decreases (54-56% in Area 8, and 31% in Lake I1) was attributed primarily to the ice cover melt volume on each lake at the start of monitoring. DO concentrations were mostly undersaturated at the start of the monitoring period, with values below aquatic life guidelines; Area 8 reached saturation once lake conductivity stabilized, but Lake I1 was saturated once conductivity started to decrease. pH transitioned from slightly acidic (similar to 5.8; below aquatic life guidelines) to circumneutral, with the transition slightly different between lakes depending on the lake conductivity transition.

Except for O. limosus, branchiobdellidans were observed on all crayfish examined. On noble crayfish, specimens of Branchiobdella italica and Branchiobdella hexodonta were found on the same host. Branchiobdella italica was largely recovered from all white clawed crayfish. The specimens of signal crayfish were found to carry only Xironogiton victoriensis.

J	Shore, JA				Shore, Jennifer A.			Characteristics of the Exchange Flow of the Bay of Quinte and Its Sheltered Embayments with Lake Ontario	WATER												The nature of the exchange flow between the Bay of Quinte and Lake Ontario has been studied to illustrate the effects of the seasonal onset of stratification on the flushing and transport of material within the bay. Flushing is an important physical process in bays used as drinking water sources because it affects phosphorous loads and water quality. A 2-d analytical model and a 3-dimensional numerical coastal model (FVCOM) were used together with in situ observations of temperature and water speed to illustrate the two-layer nature of the late summer exchange flow between the Bay of Quinte and Lake Ontario. Observations and model simulations were performed for spring and summer of 2018 and showed a cool wedge of bottom water in late summer extending from Lake Ontario and moving into Hay Bay at approximately 3 cm/s. Observed and modelled water speeds were used to calculate monthly averaged fluxes out of the Bay of Quinte. After the thermocline developed, Lake Ontario water backflowed into the Bay of Quinte at a rate approximately equal to the surface outflow decreasing the flushing rate. Over approximately 18.5 days of July 2018, the winds were insufficiently strong to break down the stratification, indicating that deeper waters of the bay are not well mixed. Particle tracking was used to illustrate how Hay Bay provides a habitat for algae growth within the bay.																				2073-4441				JUL	2021	13	13							1857	10.3390/w13131857	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13131857													WOS:000671270600001
J	Boudala, FS; Wu, D; Isaac, GA; Gultepe, I				Boudala, Faisal S.; Wu, Di; Isaac, George A.; Gultepe, Ismail			Seasonal and Microphysical Characteristics of Fog at a Northern Airport in Alberta, Canada	REMOTE SENSING												Reduction in visibility (Vis) due to fog is one of the deadliest severe weather hazards affecting aviation and public transportation. Nowcasting/forecasting of Vis reduction due to fog using current models is still problematic, with most using some type of empirical parameterization. To improve the models, further observational studies to better understand fog microphysics and seasonal variability are required. To help achieve these goals, the seasonal and microphysical characteristics of different fog types at Cold Lake airport (CYOD), Alberta, Canada were analyzed using hourly and sub-hourly METAR data. Microphysical and meteorological measurements obtained using the DMT Fog Monitor FM-120 and the Vaisala PWD22 were examined. The results showed that radiation fog (RF) dominates at CYOD in summer while precipitation, advection and cloud-base-lowering fogs mostly occur in fall and winter. All fog types usually form at night or early morning and dissipate after sunrise. The observed dense fog events (Vis < 400 m) were mainly caused by RF. The observed mean fog particle spectra (n(D)) for different fog types and temperatures showed bimodal n(D) (with two modes near 4 mu m and 17-25 mu m; the maximum total number concentration (N-d) was 100 cm(-3) and 20 cm(-3), respectively, corresponding to each mode). Parameterizations of Vis as a function of liquid water content (LWC) and N-d were developed using both the observed Vis and calculated Vis based on n(D). It was found that the observed Vis was higher than the calculated Vis for warm fog with LWC > 0.1 gm(-3) and most of the mass was contributed by the large drops. Based on the observed Vis, the relative error of the visibility parameterization as a function of both LWC and N-d (32%) was slightly lower than that (34%) using LWC alone for warm fogs.						bouadala, faisal/0000-0002-1943-3928; Isaac, George/0000-0002-9335-8452														2072-4292				OCT	2022	14	19							4865	10.3390/rs14194865	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14194865													WOS:000867203100001

However, the biogeochemical. cycling of Hg in this reservoir is not well studied. Sediment cores were collected in fall 2002, spring 2003 and in spring and fall 2004. THg and MeHg concentrations in all sediment profiles ranged from 0.26 to 38.9 mg/kg and from 0.5 to 27.5 mu g/kg (d.w.), respectively. The distribution of THg in sediment cores was characterized by a few peaks, which may correspond to the Hg-containing wastewater discharge history of the GOCP. The average THg concentrations in sediments cores decreased from upstream to downstream due to the deposition of particulate Hg, which is the major form of Hg in water. THg and MeHg concentrations in pore water varied from 6.1 to 5860 ng/L and from 0.3 to 15.4 ng/L, respectively, which were significantly higher than levels in the overlying water column. Average diffusive flux from sediment to water is 1642 and 36 ng/m(2)/day for THg and MeHg. The spatial distribution of THg in pore water from upstream to downstream showed the same trend as the sediment, but MeHg in pore water did not show a declining pattern with distance from the GOCP. These results suggested that sediments experienced serious contamination of Hg, and the contaminated sediment is an important Hg contamination source to the overlying water. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

These biological indices are compared with Indices of Contamination derived from chemical data from the St. Lawrence River, Port Hope Harbour, Southern Indian Lake - Notigi Reservoir, Tobin Lake, and Last Mountain Lake. Biological and chemical indices both identified Lac St. Louis Site 4 on the St. Lawrence River as the most highly contaminated site and the Wupaw Bay site in the Southern Indian Lake - Notigi Reservoir as the least contaminated of the 23 sites studied. The increase in frequency and severity of deformities in spring and summer data from the Rat Lake basin suggests that larvae are sensitive to increased mercury availability resulting from the greater activity of mercury-methylating bacteria in warmer summer waters.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JUL	1991	48	7					1151	1166		10.1139/f91-139	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f91-139													WOS:A1991FY95000004

No correlation was found between the water total phosphorus concentration and either the sediment phosphorus concentration alone or with sediment calcium concentration. The increase in total phosphorus from winter to summer, which is partly a function of net internal P-loading, was lowest in lakes with high Fe:P ratios in the surface sediment. A study of aerobic sediments from fifteen lakes, selected as representative of Danish lakes with respect to the sediment Fe and phosphorus content, showed that the release of soluble reactive phosphorus was negatively correlated with the surface sediment Fe:P ratio. Analysis of phosphate adsorption properties of surface sediment from 12 lakes revealed that the capability of aerobic sediments to buffer phosphate concentration correlated with the Fe:P ratio while the maximum adsorption capacity correlated with total iron. Thus, the Fe:P ratio may provide a measure of free sorption sites for orthophosphate ions on iron hydroxyoxide surfaces. The results indicate that provided the Fe:P ratio is above 15 (by weight) it may be possible to control internal P-loading by keeping the surface sediment oxidized. Since the Fe:P ratio is easy to measure, it may be a useful tool in the management of shallow lakes.

The observed decrease in BKS sea ice and the corresponding increase in SST during June aligns with enhanced precipitation in the Yangtze River basin on an interannual timescale. The BKS thermal forcing induces an equivalent barotropic Rossby wave train in the middle and upper troposphere, which propagates southeastward to the Northwest Pacific (NWP). This Rossby wave train features two positive centers over the BKS and NWP and one negative center above Baikal Lake. The strengthened NWP subtropical high and upper-level westerly jet contribute to increased rainfall in the Yangtze River basin by enhancing moisture transport and anomalous ascending motions. These findings provide important implications for predicting summer rainfall in East Asia.

It is a pure anorganic calcite precipitation, caused by the loss of free carbonic acid to the atmosphere during the mixing of epilimnic and hypolimnic water. An essential coprecipitation of phosphorus with the anorganic calcite precipitation could be shown by calcium and phosphorus balances and by SEM investigations. During the epilimnic biogenic calcite precipitation (in summer) phosphorus coprecipitation makes 0.19% of the calcium fallout. Phosphorus coprecipitation increases up to 0.42% during the anorganic calcite precipitation when autumn overturn takes place. With respect to the total phosphorus sedimentation in the lake 25% are coprecipitated with calcite.																			0020-9309						1990	75	2					153	173		10.1002/iroh.19900750204	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19900750204													WOS:A1990ER81100003

The present study covers measurement and evaluation of water quality parameters. Omerli Dam Reservoir has eutrophic character in terms of secchi disc depth (varies between 1.0-3.0 m) and phosphorus parameter (varies between 0.001-3.52 mg/L). It has oligotrophic character in terms of phytoplankton and carbon produced per unit area. Although pH of the reservoir is often alkaline in character, it shows categorically weak acid character after heavy rains. The chlorophyll-a parameter measured in the reservoir varies in vertical and horizontal positions. The average chlorophyll-a in the reservoir is 1.03 mg/L. Based on the water temperature measurements in the reservoir, it was determined that there was stratification in the reservoir during summer months. This stratification (the thermocline) was determined to be destroyed during winter months and the spring. The mean value of the measured dissolved oxygen in the reservoir was 8.49 mg/L. The TKN average in the reservoir was calculated as 1.83 mg/L. With these parameters, Omerli Dam Reservoir water quality could not be considered in a very clean class. Some rehabilitation studies have been carried out to solve the pollution problem in the lake basin. Preventing the pollution and improving water quality have affected the nature of the reservoir basin but it is necessary to continuously monitor the ecological balance of the reservoir continuously, which is significant for drinking water, fisheries and recreation facilities.

Analysis of hydrological drought frequency for the Xijiang River Basin in South China using observed streamflow data	NATURAL HAZARDS												Climate change is likely to lead to an increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, including floods and droughts. Hydrological drought refers to deficiencies in surface and subsurface water supplies and is usually measured by streamflow, and lake, reservoir and ground water levels. Properly assessing hydrological drought is crucial to decision-making and management of regional water resources. In this study, changes in hydrological drought frequency over the Xijiang River Basin in South China are investigated through an analysis of daily streamflow data observed at major hydrological stations along the river during the period 1951-2013. The main results are as follows: (1) Standardized Runoff Drought Index is a suitable measure for regional hydrological drought research in the Xijiang Basin, as its correlation coefficient with actual disaster areas is above 0.6 for Wuzhou hydrological station; (2) the hydrological droughts in the Xijiang Basin typically have a short duration that are often less than 60 days; (3) there were three serious hydrological drought periods (the 1950s to mid-1960s, the late 1980s to mid-1990s and the mid-2000s to early 2010s) and two drought relief periods (the late 1960s to mid-1980s and the late 1990s to early 2000s) for the Xijiang Basin; (4) hydrological droughts in the Xijiang River occur frequently and are mainly concentrated in summer and spring, although serious hydrological droughts can easily arise in autumn. Droughts tend to be more frequent but less severe moving from upstream to downstream, and a long duration often accompanies high severity for a single drought event; and (5) severe hydrological droughts in upstream and midstream areas are characterized by long durations and high severities, respectively. Return periods based on copula could generally reflect actual drought situations, and severe and extreme hydrological droughts occur when return periods greater than 20 and 50 a, respectively.

Turtles emerged from overwintering sites where the water depth, sediment depth, and temperature did not differ from the average for the pond, but were less variable. Turtles overwintered in areas with water depths from 0.2 to 0.48 m, sediment depths from 0.5 to 0.95 m, and sediment temperatures from 3 to 6.degree. C. Contrary to prediction, turtles did not overwinter in the regions of the pond that were the first to melt in the spring. Four turtles tagged with temperature-sensitive transmitters and followed over the winter maintained carapace surface temperatures between 4 and 6.degree. C during the period of ice cover. Movements of turtles continued after ice cover but virtually ended once the water became anoxic.

Here, we present a chronology for kashiwa oak (Quercus dentata Thunb.) at Lake Saroma on the north central coast of Hokkaido. This record (1710-1993) was compared with meteorological data from Abashiri, the longest existing station (1899-1989) near the site. Growth correlates positively with current June-July temperatures, but negatively with prior-year August temperatures. Growth also correlates positively with prior November, December, and March temperatures and with prior February precipitation. Results suggest that these oaks grow best during warm, early summers or after warm, snowy winters. The lowest growth year is 1784, following the ''year without a summer'' elsewhere in Japan. This record contributes to a growing tree-ring network for the North Pacific rim, including sites in Japan, Kamchatka, Korea, Alaska, and Canada. It also adds a new species to those considered useful for dendroclimatology.																			0045-5067	1208-6037				APR	1997	27	4					613	617		10.1139/x96-220	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x96-220													WOS:A1997XE85700020

Diet selection by wintering Lesser White-fronted Goose Anser erythropus and the role of food availability	BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL												The Fennoscandian population of the Lesser White-fronted Goose Anser erythropus (LWfG) is on the verge of extinction and migrates from northern Fennoscandia to Greece on a regular seasonal basis. For the first time, diet selection was investigated during two years at Kerkini Lake, a wintering site in Greece. The relative use of LWfG's feeding habitats was systematically recorded by visual observations of the LWfG flocks. Food availability was measured by the relative cover of available vegetation types while the diet composition was determined by the microhistological analysis of droppings. In addition, we determined crude protein, neutral detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre and acid detergent lignin content of the most preferred plant species by LWfG and all vegetation categories that contributed to LWfG diet in the middle of the duration of their stay at Kerkini Lake and after their departure from the lake. LWfG feeding habitat was exclusively marshy grassland in water less than 5 cm deep up to 300-400 m away from the shore. LWfG selected a diverse number of plant species (33), however, grass made up the 58% of their diets. The most preferred plant species were Echinochloa crus-galli, Cyperus esculentus, Scirpus lacustris and Ranunculus sceleratus. LWfG departed from Kerkini Lake in mid-December to the Evros Delta (Thrace, eastern Greece), when either food availability falls in very low levels or flooding occurred in their main feeding habitat. Consequently, as long as food and habitat resources are available for LWfG, it is very likely that the birds will winter mainly at Kerkini Lake and not at the Evros Delta, which will contribute to further minimisation of the theoretical risk of accidental shooting of LWfG at the latter wintering habitat. Thus, future conservation actions should primarily focus on the grassland improvement at Kerkini Lake enhancing the availability of food resources for LWfG (mainly grasses) and the protection of the feeding habitat from flooding.

J	NISBET, EG				NISBET, EG			SOME NORTHERN SOURCES OF ATMOSPHERIC METHANE - PRODUCTION, HISTORY, AND FUTURE IMPLICATIONS	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Northern sources, including wetlands and perhaps gas hydrates, contribute significantly to the CH4 content of the atmosphere. Methane production from northern wetlands, including bogs, swamps, and ponds, is probably very seasonal, being most important in late summer, with significant evasion in autumn as lakes overturn. The strong recovery of beaver populations in Canada, from near-extinction 50 years ago to present abundance, may also be important, both in creating new wetlands and in the alteration of them; wetlands that have been altered by beaver activity produce orders of magnitude more methane than beaver-free wetlands. In the Arctic, methane gas hydrates represent a significant source of methane, which may become more important if Arctic warming occurs as part of global climate change. The danger of a thermal runway caused by CH4 release from permafrost is minor, but real. Other high-latitude sources of CH4 include Arctic peat bogs, and losses from natural gas production, especially in the Soviet Union [USSR].																			0008-4077	1480-3313				AUG	1989	26	8					1603	1611		10.1139/e89-136	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/e89-136													WOS:A1989AR52000008

Migratory routing and departure decisions of Porzana carolina (Sora): New insights from the Motus Wildlife Tracking System	ORNITHOLOGY												During migration, birds make a variety of decisions that may impact their overall survival and fitness. These decisions include but are not limited to their overall migration route as well as their departure timing considering variable weather conditions. Understanding how birds make these decisions can provide insight into not only their general migration strategy, but also the constraints they face during migration. Unfortunately, the migratory ecology of many members of the Rallidae family remains poorly documented. From 2017 to 2022, we fitted 202 Porzana carolina (Sora) with transmitters at Jug Bay, a critical stopover site along the Patuxent River, Maryland, USA, and tracked their migratory movements and decisions using the Motus Wildlife Tracking System. Tracking data revealed a tendency to follow the Atlantic coast in the fall. Spring migrants took variable paths, with routes primarily to the Great Lakes region, and had shorter stopovers. We also determined the timing and atmospheric conditions under which P. carolina initiated migration. Rising atmospheric pressure 24 hr before departure increased departure likelihood, as did wind profit (favorable tailwinds), while increased cloud cover slightly reduced departure probability, possibly due to disrupted nighttime navigation. Porzana carolina may select these conditions to maximize their travel speed and limit likelihood of disorientation while aloft. This time-minimization strategy is offset by their extended stopovers on the ground, which extend the duration of their migration. Porzana carolina needs to spend more time fueling to ensure they have enough energy to survive any obstacles they face while en route. By looking at the migration strategies of this understudied species, we can better understand the constraints birds face on migration. center dot Motus Wildlife Tracking System was used to track migratory pathways and departure decisions of Porzana carolina (Sora).center dot Migrating P. carolina in the fall tended to follow coastal pathways en route to their wintering grounds while birds captured in the spring were most often tracked to sites in the Great Lakes, generally following inland routes.center dot P. carolina took extended stopovers at the study site, particularly in the fall. However, there was no evidence of a difference in stopover duration across age and sex classes.center dot Most P. carolina departed within 2 hr of civil dusk when the sun was between 6 and 25 degrees C below the horizon. Porzana carolina migrating in the fall favored departing on nights characterized by rising air pressure trends in the fall and tailwinds in both spring and fall. Birds also favored conditions with lower cloud cover, though to a lesser extent.

Los migrantes de primavera siguieron rutas variables, principalmente hacia la regi & oacute;n de los Grandes Lagos, y realizaron paradas m & aacute;s cortas. Tambi & eacute;n identificamos el momento y las condiciones atmosf & eacute;ricas bajo las cuales P. carolina iniciaba la migraci & oacute;n. El aumento de la presi & oacute;n atmosf & eacute;rica 24 horas antes de la partida incrementaba la probabilidad de salida, al igual que el beneficio del viento (vientos de cola favorables); en cambio, el incremento de nubosidad reduc & iacute;a ligeramente la probabilidad de partida, posiblemente debido a interferencias en la navegaci & oacute;n nocturna.

AUFWUCHS AND PLANKTON COMMUNITIES OF SELECTED SOFT-WATER LAKES, HARD WATER LAKES AND CALCAREOUS SPRING PONDS	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Summer studies of 5 soft water lakes, 5 hard water lakes and 6 calcareous spring ponds in Wisconsin [USA] were made with respect to the composition of the plankton and aufwuchs communities and the relative role of desmids in those communities. The results are compared with similar data obtained from selected acid bog lakes, alkaline bog lakes and closed bogs. Soft water lakes harbored a greater aufwuchs and plankton desmid diversity than hard water lakes or spring ponds; however, diversity in acid bog lakes was substantially greater than in any other lake type. Utricularia contained the greatest desmid diversity and population density in every lake where it occurred. Staurastrum was the most prevalent genus in the plankton and it was the only one recorded from hard water lakes and calcareous spring ponds. Desmid aufwuchs population densities were roughly comparable in hard water lakes, soft water lakes and acid bogs and the contribution of desmids to the total aufwuchs population was similar for the latter 2 lake types. The plankton of acid bog lakes generally harbored substantially greater desmid populations and these populations contributed much more to the total population than in any other lake type. Aufwuchs data are presented for several hosts and comparisons of population densities are given among hosts within a given lake and between the same host in different lakes of a given type. Data for other algal groups are also included.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1976	49	1					3	25		10.1007/BF00016163	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00016163													WOS:A1976BS05700001

We investigated the climate condition from about 400 years before present (B.P.) in the central TP at the shore of Co (means "lake") Nag using aeolian sediments. A 2.7-m sand profile with 57 sediment samples and six optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) samples were studied through grain-size analysis, geochemical elements and parameters, and depositional rate estimation. A previous assumption was verified that sand deposition at the shore of Lake Co Nag originated from hills to the east. Two significant wet periods between 90-140 and about 380 years B.P. were indicated by the variation of element profiles and sediment depositional rates. Aeolian activity is sensitive to variations from different seasonal changing patterns of climate factors in the study area, and aeolian sediments respond differently to climate conditions during the cold little ice age (LIA) and the warm 20th century. Present day dry seasons of winter and spring might be much warmer and drier compared to seasons of 400 years ago although summer precipitation has increased, resulting in significantly more aeolian activity and higher depositional rate (about 6 times compared to 380-240 years ago) of sandy sediments. Aeolian problems like blown-sand deposition and desertification may be worse in a projected warming future in the central TP as well as other cold and high altitude regions. Our results suggest an agreement with environmental evolution during the little ice age and the 20th century in a broader scale on the TP.

Temporal Analysis of the Honey Bee Microbiome Reveals Four Novel Viruses and Seasonal Prevalence of Known Viruses, Nosema, and Crithidia	PLOS ONE												Honey bees (Apis mellifera) play a critical role in global food production as pollinators of numerous crops. Recently, honey bee populations in the United States, Canada, and Europe have suffered an unexplained increase in annual losses due to a phenomenon known as Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). Epidemiological analysis of CCD is confounded by a relative dearth of bee pathogen field studies. To identify what constitutes an abnormal pathophysiological condition in a honey bee colony, it is critical to have characterized the spectrum of exogenous infectious agents in healthy hives over time. We conducted a prospective study of a large scale migratory bee keeping operation using high-frequency sampling paired with comprehensive molecular detection methods, including a custom microarray, qPCR, and ultra deep sequencing. We established seasonal incidence and abundance of known viruses, Nosema sp., Crithidia mellificae, and bacteria. Ultra deep sequence analysis further identified four novel RNA viruses, two of which were the most abundant observed components of the honey bee microbiome (similar to 10(11) viruses per honey bee). Our results demonstrate episodic viral incidence and distinct pathogen patterns between summer and winter time-points. Peak infection of common honey bee viruses and Nosema occurred in the summer, whereas levels of the trypanosomatid Crithidia mellificae and Lake Sinai virus 2, a novel virus, peaked in January.

J	Yang, C; Telmer, K; Veizer, J				Yang, C; Telmer, K; Veizer, J			Chemical dynamics of the ''St Lawrence'' riverine system: delta D-H2O, delta O-18(H2O), delta C-13(DIC), delta S-34(sulfate), and dissolved Sr-87/Sr-86	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Chemical and stable isotope analyses of the St. Clair, Detroit, Niagara, and St. Lawrence rivers (''St. Lawrence'' system) and their tributaries show that the chemical and isotopic compositions of the waters are strongly controlled by the geology of their drainage basins. Tributaries draining the Canadian Shield have very low TDS, HCO3-, SO42-, Ca2+, Mg2+, NO3-, Sr2+, higher Si and Fe-total, and high Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios (0.710-0.713). The Grand and Thames rivers that drain Paleozoic limestones, dolostones, and evaporites are characterized by opposite attributes. The ''St. Lawrence'' and the tributaries draining the Canadian Appalachians fall between these two endmembers. The St. Clair, Detroit, and Niagara rivers do not show any pronounced seasonal variations in major component chemistry due to buffering by the Great Lakes. In contrast, pronounced seasonal variations characterize the lower St. Lawrence mainly because of significant tributary inputs into the overall water budget. The delta D and delta(18)O in the ''St. Lawrence'' range from -60.9 to -44.5 parts per thousand and from -8.5 to -6.1 parts per thousand SMOW, respectively, much heavier than the comparative values measured for the tributaries (-92.8 to -58.3 parts per thousand and -13.1 to -8.5 parts per thousand). This is a consequence of evaporative loss that, over the residence time of water of similar to 10(2) years, equals about 7% of the water volume in the Great Lakes. The strontium and sulfur isotopic values for the ''St. Lawrence'' system are relatively uniform, with measured values from 0.70927 to 0.71112 for Sr-87/Sr-86 and from 4.3 to 5.6 parts per thousand for sulfate delta(34)S. Their seasonal variations are also minor. The strontium and sulfur fluxes of the St. Lawrence river are calculated to be 7.84 x 10(8) and 1.09 x 10(11) mol/a, respectively. The relative contributions of the Great Lakes, tributaries, and other sources to these fluxes are 73:16:11% for strontium and 64:13:23% for sulfur. Isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic carbon (delta(13)C(DIC)) in the ''St. Lawrence'' system ranges from -4.7 to +0.7 parts per thousand, considerably heavier than the values for the tributaries (-16.5 to -6.7 parts per thousand). The light delta(13)C(DIC) values for the tributaries suggest that CO2 from bacterial respiration plays an important role in the isotopic composition of riverine DIC. However, in the main stem river(s), this bacterial signal is masked by isotopic equilibration with atmospheric CO2 due to the long residence time of water in the Great Lakes. Seasonally, the main stem river(s) have heavier delta(13)C values in the fall than in the spring, a consequence of preferential C-12 consumption by photosynthetic plants in the epilimnion of the Great Lakes during the growth season. In the down-stream portion of the St. Lawrence river, influx of isotopically light tributary waters causes progressive C-13 depletion, from -1.3 to -2.0 parts per thousand and -1.4 to -3.0 parts per thousand in the fall and spring, respectively. The total DIC carbon flux of the St. Lawrence river is calculated to be 3.9 x 10(11) mol/a. Mass balance calculations show that the relative contributions of the Great Lakes, tributaries, decay of organic matter, exchange with the atmosphere, and dissolution of carbonates to this total DIC flux are 81:13:2:-6:10% in the spring, and 83:15:-2:4:0% in the fall, respectively.

This study is focused on two annual cycles of G. semen in shallow temperate lakes (one of which stratifies) with a particular emphasis on the species' ecology and its potential impact on the alternation of phytoplankton assemblages. Temperature and phosphorus were the main forces driving seasonal growth of the raphidophyte. G. semen occurred at a broad temperature range and prevailed for the extended period from spring to late autumn at maximum biovolume and forming up to 98.7% of total phytoplankton in June-July and/or September. The species exclusively dominated under phosphate-replete conditions and caused heavy blooms in the stratified lake. The species outcompeted other flagellates in the lakes; considerable fluctuations in phytoplankton species composition occurred during the periods at low G. semen biovolume. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

It is necessary to investigate heavy metals content and assess their ecological risk in order to protect the aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we collected surface sediment samples from the freshwater ecosystem of the city of Zhenjiang, in China, in both winter and summer. Then, we analyzed the seasonal and spatial distribution patterns of lead (Pb), chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd), zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu). The contamination factor (CF), enrichment factor (EF), geo-accumulation index (I-geo), and potential ecological risk (E-r(i)) were jointly used to assess the pollution degree and the ecological risk posed to the freshwater ecosystem by the aforementioned elements. Multivariate statistical analysis, including Pearson's correlation and principal component analysis and cluster analysis, were used to identify potential sources of the investigated metals in this research area. Study results showed that: (1) the average concentrations values were 1.81 mg/kg and 1.15 mg/kg for Cd, 55.3 mg/kg and 62.2 mg/kg for Cu, 88.0 mg/kg and 52.5 mg/kg for Cr, 27.3 mg/kg and 22.8 mg/kg for Pb, 87.0 mg/kg and 271 mg/kg for Zn, in winter and summer, respectively. Amongst the investigated elements, the average concentrations of Cd, Cu, Cr, and Pb, were above the local background values in winter, whereas, Cd, Cu and Zn concentrations were higher than the background values in Zhenjiang; (2) The CF and EF indicated that Cd had a high contamination degree and a significant enrichment compare to others investigated metals in the surface sediment of in this research area. (3) Cd posed moderate, considerable, or very high ecological risks in different sites, while the other elements (i.e., Cu, Cr, Pb, and Zn) presented a low degree of ecological risk. (4) Multivariate statistical analyses results indicated Pb, Cu, and Zn had similar geochemical characteristics, while, Cd and Cr had significant differences with the above elements. Therefore, Pb, Cu, and Zn probably originate from the same sources, while Cd and Cr might have mixed sources, including both natural sources and human activities. Overall, more attention should be paid to Cd for risk assessment in the current study area. The findings of this study provide fundamental information for the evaluation and management of the heavy metals investigated in the freshwater ecosystem of Zhenjiang.

J	STABEL, HH				STABEL, HH			THE ROLE OF PLANKTON BIOMASS IN CONTROLLING FLUCTUATIONS OF SUSPENDED MATTER IN LAKE CONSTANCE	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The concentrations of particulate matter, expressed as dry weight (DW), particulate organic (POM), and inorganic material were measured at regular intervals in Lake Constance between February 1980 and December 1982. Maximum particle concentrations were recorded for the euphotic zone in summer (7 mg l-1), while minima occurred during the early summer and in winter. Annual mean concentrations of DW within the entire water column varied between 0.6 and 0.7 mg l-1. In the euphotic zone nearly 70% of DW is organic material. The inorganic particles originate either from phytoplankton (diatomaceous silicon, biogenic decalcification) or from the tributaries. Although phytoplankton biomass only comprises a relatively small proportion (i.e. 30% at maximum) of organic matter, it is the primary source of POM. Therefore, seasonal variations in phytoplankton control epilimnetic concentrations of POM in Lake Constance. Inorganic material comprises smaller proportions of suspended matter. Seasonal variations are related predominantly to fluctuations in biomass and therefore particulate inorganic matter is suggested to originate mainly from autochthonous sources. At the sampling station concentrations of inorganic particles supported by the main tributary, the Alpenrhein, only occasionally vary concomitantly with runoff.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP 20	1986	140	2					173	181		10.1007/BF00007572	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007572													WOS:A1986E771900010

Weak precipitation, warm winters and springs impact glaciers of south slopes of Mt. Everest (central Himalaya) in the last 2 decades (1994-2013)	CRYOSPHERE												Studies on recent climate trends from the Himalayan range are limited, and even completely absent at high elevation (> 5000ma.s.l.). This study specifically explores the southern slopes of Mt. Everest, analyzing the time series of temperature and precipitation reconstructed from seven stations located between 2660 and 5600ma.s.l. during 1994-2013, complemented with the data from all existing ground weather stations located on both sides of the mountain range (Koshi Basin) over the same period. Overall we find that the main and most significant increase in temperature is concentrated outside of the monsoon period. Above 5000ma.s.l. the increasing trend in the time series of minimum temperature (+ 0.072 degrees C yr(-1)) is much stronger than of maximum temperature (+ 0.009 degrees C yr(-1)), while the mean temperature increased by + 0.044 degrees C yr(-1). Moreover, we note a substantial liquid precipitation weakening (9.3mmyr(-1)) during the monsoon season. The annual rate of decrease in precipitation at higher elevations is similar to the one at lower elevations on the southern side of the Koshi Basin, but the drier conditions of this remote environment make the fractional loss much more consistent (47% during the monsoon period). Our results challenge the assumptions on whether temperature or precipitation is the main driver of recent glacier mass changes in the region. The main implications are the following: (1) the negative mass balances of glaciers observed in this region can be more ascribed to a decrease in accumulation (snowfall) than to an increase in surface melting; (2) the melting has only been favoured during winter and spring months and close to the glaciers terminus; (3) a decrease in the probability of snowfall (10 %) has made a significant impact only at glacier ablation zone, but the magnitude of this decrease is distinctly lower than the observed decrease in precipitation; (4) the decrease in accumulation could have caused the observed decrease in glacier flow velocity and the current stagnation of glacier termini, which in turn could have produced more melting under the debris glacier cover, leading to the formation of numerous supraglacial and proglacial lakes that have characterized the region in the last decades.

Changes in Observed Daily Precipitation over the United States between 1950-79 and 1980-2009	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												Changes in observed daily precipitation over the conterminous United States between two 30-yr periods (1950-79 and 1980-2009) are examined using a 60-yr daily precipitation analysis obtained from the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Unified Raingauge Database. Several simple measures are used to characterize the changes, including mean, frequency, intensity, and return period. Seasonality is accounted for by examining each measure for four nonoverlapping seasons. The possible role of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle as an explanation for differences between the two periods is also examined. There have been more light (1 mm <= P < 10 mm), moderate (10 mm <= P < 25 mm), and heavy (P >= 25 mm) daily precipitation events (P) in many regions of the country during the more recent 30-yr period with some of the largest and most spatially coherent increases over the Great Plains and lower Mississippi Valley during autumn and winter. Some regions, such as portions of the Southeast and the Pacific Northwest, have seen decreases, especially during the winter. Increases in multiday heavy precipitation events have been observed in the more recent period, especially over portions of the Great Plains, Great Lakes, and Northeast. These changes are associated with changes in the mean and frequency of daily precipitation during the more recent 30-yr period. Difference patterns are strongly related to the ENSO cycle and are consistent with the stronger El Nino events during the more recent 30-yr period. Return periods for both heavy and light daily precipitation events during 1950-79 are shorter during 1980-2009 at most locations, with some notable regional exceptions.																			1525-755X	1525-7541				FEB	2013	14	1					105	121		10.1175/JHM-D-12-062.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-12-062.1													WOS:000315363800006

The total APA activity of microplankton varied strongly. Vmax was highest during summer P depletion, and in autumn and winter total APA activity was low. The total APA specific activity of the microplankton was also highest (average 355 pmole PO43- ng ATP-1 min-1) when ambient orthophosphate concentrations were very low. Both Vmax and specific APA activity were not dependent on the biomass of microplankton; they were strongly affected by P available for microplankton. A differential filtration technique was used for separation of microplankton into two size classes, i.e., algal, larger than 3 .mu.m, and bacterial fraction with size 0.2-3.0 .mu.m. The algal size fraction had lower specific APA activity (average 1.224 pmole PO43- ng ATP-1 min-1) and higher KM values (38.8 .mu.mole .times. liter-1) than microorganisms which were smaller than 3 .mu.m (2.011 pmole PO43- ng ATP-1 min-1 and 25.4 .mu.mole liter-1, respectively). The KM values of free, dissolved APA (36.8 .mu.mole liter-1) indicated that free APA was probably released by algae. Phytoplankton were major APA activity producers in the photic zone of the lake from March to November, and their activity constituted, on the average, 48.6% of the total APA activity in the water. Bacteria were the dominant APA activity producers in winter (41.3-44.9%); however, during other periods they contributed significantly (average 21.7%) to total APA activity. When surplus constituted less than 10% of particulate P in seston, phytoplankton produced high specific APA activity, and when surplus P was higher than 15%, the specific APA activity of phytoplankton size fraction rapidly decreased. APA of the bacterial size fraction of the seston was not affected by P concentrations. Orthophosphate was a competitive inhibitor of APA produced by microorganisms of the size fraction larger than 3.0 .mu.m, and increasing concentrations of inorganic phosphate caused an increase in KM values. The hypothetical metabolic-coupling between phytoplankton and bacterioplankton in the phosphorus cycle in conjunction with carbon metabolism in the lake is discussed.

Wintering chironomids mine oxygen	PALAIOS												Seasonally sampled cores of burrowed sediment containing chironomid larvae were collected from Cooking Lake, Alberta, and analyzed to (1) assess and establish the typical burrowing behavior and burrow architecture of chironomid larvae; (2) record micrometer-scale geo-chemical profiles of O-2, H2S, and pH in the uppermost sedimentary layers throughout a seasonal cycle; and (3) link changing geochemical conditions to changing burrowing behaviors. We observed that the larvae lived in soft, water-saturated sediment, maintained by open burrows accreted by the animal's mucous. Chironomid-larvae burrows were small and Y-shaped (e.g., Polykladichnus-like) or Y-shaped with basal branches (Thalassinoides -like) and were 20 cm deep. The larvae moved up and down from the oxygenated zone ("sounding" behavior) to exploit food in suboxic and anoxic sediment. Geochemical analyses showed that H2S was present in the pore waters to within 1.5 mm of the sediment-water interface during the summer, when lake-bottom algae and cyanobacteria generated so sufficient O-2 to drive the oxic-anoxic redoxcline into the sediment. In the winter, the H2S front extended upward into the water column owing to the cessation of algal and cyanobacterial activity. The prevalence of H2S results from a combination of high-dissolved-sulfate concentrations in the lake and the abundance of microbial biomass that fuels an active subsurface population of sulfate-reducing bacteria. Interestingly, burrowing behavior was not linked to seasonal changes in the sediment chemistry. This is in part due to the ability of chironomid larvae to exploit oxygen islands in the sediment: n the winter, the chironomid larvae harvest their oxygen from the uppermost photosynthetic layer in otherwise O-2-impoverished sediments.

Effects of fish farming on plankton structure in a Brazilian tropical reservoir	HYDROBIOLOGIA												This study investigated the effects of fish farming on phytoplankton and zooplankton structure in a Brazilian tropical reservoir. Samplings were undertaken among 15 net cages and upstream and downstream of the cages over a 120-day period. Soon after the tilapia feeding, we observed the highest density of phytoplankton, with dominance of Cyanobacteria which probably increased due to the increase in predation pressure by cladocerans and copepods on the Cryptophyceae. However, after 30 days from that, a reduction in zooplankton density was registered due to the dominance of Cyanobacteria. The absence of a clear spatial difference in the phytoplankton and zooplankton densities was observed. The effects of the net cages on the nutrients and planktonic communities were small, probably due to the low number of net cages and fish employed, the seasons (autumn/winter) and the hydrodynamics, as lotic traits, the strong influence of the wind, and the large extension of the mixture zone.					; Bonecker, Claudia/D-5946-2013; Dias, Juliana/B-3184-2013	Bonecker, Claudia/0000-0003-4338-9012; Dias, Juliana/0000-0003-2881-3751; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL	2010	649	1					279	291		10.1007/s10750-010-0271-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0271-2													WOS:000277720100025

In summer, water vapor transport can reach Qinghai Lake and the eastern section of the Qilian Mountains; in winter, westerly winds mainly control the climate. This article compares the wet/dry changes in the region during the mid-Holocene (MH) warm period, the medieval climate anomaly (MCA), the current warm period (CWP), and the future warm period from the perspective of paleoclimate. We found that the MH warm period was mainly affected by the orbit-controlled East Asian summer monsoon, and the region showed warm and humid climate characteristics. The MCA was mainly controlled by solar radiation, and there was a warm and dry phenomenon. The CWP and the future warm period are mainly controlled by the rise in temperature caused by the increase in greenhouse gases, and the climate is becoming more arid. The wet/dry patterns in the CWP and the future warm period in the next century on the northern Tibetan Plateau are similar to those in the MCA. Continued warming will lead to the expansion of the westerly belt and a gradually humid climate. The future wet/dry changes will be more similar to the MH warm period.																			1674-7313	1869-1897				2024 MAR 18	2024										10.1007/s11430-023-1260-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11430-023-1260-6		MAR 2024											WOS:001187449300001

The water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and electrical conductivity (EC) were measured on an hourly basis in the open space and inside the ADP, and a phenomenological study was performed, dividing seasons into normal and rainy seasons and environments into stagnant and circulating conditions. The results showed that the water quality parameters inside the ADP exhibit lower fluctuations and diurnal variations compared with the open space. On average, the water temperature inside the ADP is lower than outside it by 1.7-3.7 degrees C in stagnant conditions, and by 0.6-0.7 degrees C in circulating conditions during early summer. Thermal stratification occurs inside the ADP but is temporarily disturbed due to the mixing from the forced circulation and the rainwater input through rainfall events. The ADP provided a constant and optimal water temperature for living and spawning for bitterling (i.e., 15.0-21.0 degrees C), which dominated in experimental pond during spring to summer. Most importantly, the ADP was able to significantly reduce the thermal stress of the fish in the study site, and as a result, the bitterling, a cool water fish species, could successfully become dominant. Finally, the deployment of the ADP appears to provide a practical alternative for effective fishery resources management to improve species diversity and fish communities in an artificial freshwater ecosystem (garden pond, park pond, other artificial wetlands, etc.).					; Joo, Jin/Y-9304-2019; Lee, Saeromi/AAD-7043-2022	Joo, Jin Chul/0000-0001-8551-3945; 													2073-4441					JAN	2019	11	1							139	10.3390/w11010139	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11010139													WOS:000459735100137

The EASM exhibits a distinct interdecadal variation, with stronger (weaker) summer monsoon maintained from 1950-1964 (1976-1997). In the former case, there is an enhanced Walker cell in the eastern Pacific and an anti-Walker cell in the western Pacific. The associated ascending motion resides in the central Pacific, which flows eastward and westward in the upper troposphere, descending in the eastern and western ends of the Pacific basin. At the same time, an anomalous East Asian Hadley Cell (EAHC) is found to connect the low-latitude and mid-latitude systems in East Asia, which strengthens the EASM. The descending branch of the EAHC lies in the west part of the anti-Walker cell, flowing northward in the lower troposphere and then ascending at the south of Lake Baikal (40 degrees-50 degrees N, 95 degrees-115 degrees E) before returning to low latitudes in the upper troposphere, thus strengthening the EASM. The relationship between the EASM and SST in the eastern tropical Pacific is also discussed. A possible mechanism is proposed to link interdecadal variation of the EASM with the eastern tropical Pacific SST. A warmer sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) therein induces anomalous ascending motion in the eastern Pacific, resulting in a weaker Walker cell, and at the same time inducing an anomalous Walker cell in the western Pacific and an enhanced EAHC, leading to a weaker EASM. Furthermore, the interdecadal variation of summer precipitation over North China is found to be strongly regulated by the velocity potential over the south of Lake Baikal through enhancing and reducing the regional vertical motions.

Evidence of yellow perch, largemouth bass and pumpkinseed metapopulations in coastal embayments of Lake Ontario	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Coastal embayments have been and will continue to be constructed along the northwest shoreline of Lake Ontario to restore and create warmwater fish habitat. However, very little is known about the biological connections among embayments. Using otolith microchemistry on pumpkinseed, largemouth bass and yellow perch collected from three constructed embayments in 2006-2009, we confirm that these three species of fish each exist in a metapopulation. We find that juvenile pumpkinseed, largemouth bass and yellow perch occupy embayments different from their natal habitat after their first winter, and for at least pumpkinseed, continue to move among embayments after their second winter. We hypothesize that these fishes move among embayments after haphazardly dispersing from their overwintering habitat to the littoral zone each spring. Habitat restoration and remediation efforts in coastal Great Lakes habitats should take a system-based management approach that considers the spatial proximity of embayments, and attempts to create or preserve connected networks.

However, robust empirical assessments of its environmental effects are still lacking. We used a Before-After-Control-Impact design replicated at the ecosystem level (n = 6 lakes: three lakes with FPV compared to three non-FPV lakes) to determine the global effects of FPV on water temperature over three years and allowing to isolate FPV effects from natural variability. Overall, we found that the presence of FPV strongly decreased annual water temperature (1.2 degrees C on average). The reduction in water temperature induced by FPV increased significantly with air temperature and differed between seasons, with stronger reductions (up to 3 degrees C) observed during warmest days of the year in spring and summer. In addition, the reduction in water temperature also occurred in areas of the lakes that were not covered by FPV. In the context of climate warming, decreased water temperature in summer could benefit freshwater organisms but these benefits could be counterbalanced by other negative impacts such as decreases in dissolved oxygen and modifications in the C cycle, including greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, the cascading effects of FPV on freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem functioning still need to be assessed.

However, the current understanding of GHGs emissions from arid river systems remains largely unknown. To shed light on GHGs emissions from inland waters in arid regions, high-resolution carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emission measurements were carried out in the arid Kuye River Basin (KRB) on the Chinese Loess Plateau to examine their spatio-temporal variability. Our results show that all streams and rivers were net C sources, but some of the reservoirs in the KRB became carbon sinks at certain times. The CO2 flux (FCO2) recorded in the rivers (91.0 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) was higher than that of the reservoirs (10.0 mmol m(-2) d(-1)), while CH4 flux (FCH4) in rivers (0.35 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) was lower than that of the reservoirs (0.78 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). The best model developed from a number of environmental parameters was able to explain almost 40% of the variability in partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) for rivers and reservoirs, respectively. For CH4 emissions, at least 70% of the flux occurred in the form of ebullition. The emissions of CH4 in summer were more than threefold higher than in spring and autumn, with water temperature being the key environmental variable affecting emission rates. Since the construction of reservoirs can alter the morphology of existing fluvial systems and consequently the characteristics of CO2 and CH4 emissions, we conclude that future sampling efforts conducted at the basin scale need to cover both rivers and reservoirs concurrently.					; Liu, Boyi/P-2998-2019; Ran, Lishan/AAT-9924-2021	Liu, Boyi/0000-0003-1909-9568; Ran, Lishan/0000-0002-4386-1471; 														2073-4441				JUN	2021	13	12							1614	10.3390/w13121614	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13121614													WOS:000666950100001

Precipitation control over inorganic nitrogen import-export budgets across watersheds: a synthesis of long-term ecological research	ECOHYDROLOGY												We investigated long-term and seasonal patterns of N imports and exports, as well as patterns following climate perturbations, across biomes using data from 15 watershed from nine Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites in North America. Mean dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) import-export budgets (N import via precipitation-N export via stream flow) for common years across all watersheds was highly variable, ranging from a net loss of -0.17 +/- 0.09 kg N ha(-1)mo(-1) to net retention of 0.68 +/- 0.08 kg N ha(-1)mo(-1). The net retention of DIN decreased (smaller import-export budget) with increasing precipitation as well as with increasing variation in precipitation during the winter, spring, and fall. Averaged across all seasons net DIN retention decreased as teh coefficient of variation (CV) in precipitation increased across all sites (r(2) = 0.48. P = 0.005). This trend was made stronger when the disturbed watersheds were withheld from the analysis (r(2) = 0.80, p < 0.001, n = 11). Thus, DIN exports were either similar to or exceeded imports in the tropiocal, boreal, and wet coniferous watershed, whereas imports exceeded exports in temperate deciduous watersheds. In general, forest harvesting, hurricanes, or floods corresponded with periods of increased DIN exports relative to imports. Periods when water throughput within a watershed was likely to be lower (i.e. low snow pack or EI Nino years) corresponded with decreased DIN exports relative to imports. These data provided a basis for ranking diverse sites in terms of their ability to retain DIN in the context of changing precipitation regimes likely to occur in the future.

Mixed-stock Inconnu Stenodus leucichthys habitat use in an Arctic estuarine delta complex	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Inconnu Stenodus leucichthys is a large, long-lived piscivorous whitefish found in the Arctic and subarctic waters of Alaska. In the Kotzebue region of northwestern Alaska, Inconnu is one of the most important fishes harvested for subsistence purposes. With ongoing climate change, it is important to understand how a changing environment will affect Inconnu habitat use. This study described the habitat use of Inconnu in the Hotham Inlet/Selawik Lake complex from 2010 to 2012. Data collection consisted of surgically implanting acoustic telemetry tags in 80 fish from both rivers in 2010 and 2011 (n = 320), and deploying a fixed array of 20 Vemco VR2W acoustic receiving stations affixed with archival tags throughout the study area. Inconnu were detected at water temperatures and salinities ranging from -1.39 to 23.51 A degrees C and 0 to 31.3 psu, respectively, and there was no detection of stock-specific or temporal trends in habitat use. Fish occupied colder water temperatures (-0.5 to 0.5 A degrees C) during winter and primarily occupied the upper (15 A degrees C) and lower (0 A degrees C) ends of the temperature spectrum during summer. Although Inconnu occupied the entire range of salinities available during summer and winter months, they generally occupied waters of 5 to 20 psu. By providing a more thorough account of Inconnu habitat use, our results contribute baseline data for future comparisons to evaluate effects from climate-induced changes to Inconnu sustainability.

Modelling the effects of changing retention time on abundance and composition of phytoplankton species in a small lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The phytoplankton community model, PROTECH, was used to model the algal response to changing annual mean retention time in a small lake. 2. Simulations of short retention time with a fixed nutrient load resulted in a reduced chlorophyll concentration. A similar relationship was observed when the simulations were repeated but with inflowing nutrients increased in proportion to river discharge. 3. Longer retention time caused the spring bloom to start earlier and the autumn bloom to persist longer. 4. Changes in discharge of the inflowing river also caused a change in the thermal structure of the lake. This change in thermal structure, in turn, influenced the magnitude and composition of the phytoplankton population, particularly those in the CS-functional group, such as Aphanizomenon.

In this study, we aimed to tease apart the influence of tourism from that of climate in a mountain lake located within one of the largest French ski resorts, by combining paleolimnological and present ecological data. The reconstructed long-term ecological dynamics highlighted an increase in lake biological production from the end of the Little Ice Age up to the 1950s, suggesting a historical dominance of climate control. Afterward, a major drop in pelagic production occurred at the same time as the watershed erosion increased and peaked in the 1990s, concomitant with massive digging for the ski resort expansion. The benthic invertebrates collapsed in the 1980s, concomitantly with the onset of massive salmonid stocking and recent warming. Stable isotope analyses identified benthic invertebrates as the major salmonid diet resource and suggested a possible direct impact of salmonid stocking on benthic invertebrates. However, habitat use may differ among salmonid species as suggested by the way fish DNA was preserved in surficial sediment. The high abundances of macrozooplankton further confirmed the limited reliance of salmonids on pelagic resources. The variable thermal tolerance of benthic invertebrates suggested that the recent warming may mostly affect littoral habitats. Our results indicate that winter and summer tourism may differently affect the biodiversity of mountain lakes and could collectively interfere with the ecological impacts of recent warming, making local management of primary importance to preserve their ecological integrity.

Using 555 citizen-based captures gathered between 1977 and 2016, we show that silver-haired bats overwinter (December-February) as far north as the 45th parallel, in areas roughly demarcated by the -12.2 degrees C (10 degrees F) mean daily minimum isotherm for January. Although summering populations adjacent to the lake are dominated by males, wintering animals are predominantly female and presumably migrants from north of Lake Superior. Logistic regression suggests that silver-haired bats are more likely to overwinter in warm areas, in counties near the lake, in urbanized locales, and on the west side of the lake. We believe that these small-bodied, solitary bats are hibernating in buildings and that use of human-made structures has allowed the silver-haired bat to overwinter in regions that are devoid of mines, caves and rock crevices and that are too cold for successful hibernation in trees. Lake Michigan impacts where this animal overwinters, presumably through the moderating influence of the lake on multiple aspects of the surrounding climate and because the shoreline likely is a major migratory pathway.

To understand past vegetation responses to such environmental changes in Korea, we estimated the abundance of C-3 and C-4 plants using the C/N and carbon isotope ratios of sedimentary organic matter. The MIS3 sedimentary unit at the Cheollipo site, located in a western coastal area of Korea, is characterized by a dark to light gray colored sedimentary unit (3.05 to 5.05 m in elevation, MIS3), which is between an underlain oxidized yellowish sedimentary unit (<3.05 m in elevation) and an overlain oxidized yellowish sedimentary unit (>5.05 m in elevation). The estimated abundance of C-4 plants varied between 60 and 10% during the MIS3. The suborbital-scale variation in the estimated percentage of C-4 plants was similar to those reported in continental ice volume and the East Asian monsoon intensity, suggesting that C-4 plants prevailed under colder and drier conditions (intensified winter monsoon), whereas C-3 plants have favored a warmer and wetter climate (intensified summer monsoon). Compared with high latitude regions (e.g., Chinese Loess Plateau and Lake Baikal) where low summer temperature suppressed aridity and pCO(2) influences during the last glacial period, vegetation change in Cheollipo area may have more sensitively responded to aridity change which had been affected by the summer/winter monsoon intensity. The climate change in the western coastal area (Yellow Sea side) of Korea during the late Pleistocene may have been controlled by regional climate change coupled with continental ice volume change.

Rapid evolution, seasonality, and the termination of parasite epidemics	ECOLOGY												Why do epidemics end? This simple question has puzzled ecologists and epidemiologists for decades. Early explanations focused on drops in host density arising from highly virulent parasites and, later, on the effects of acquired immunity. More recently, however, two additional epidemic-ending mechanisms have surfaced: environmental change (including seasonality) and rapid evolution of increased resistance of hosts to infection. Both mechanisms, via either decreasing seasonal temperatures or evolution of resistance, act by altering transmission rates. To explore these possibilities, we tracked five epidemics of a virulent yeast parasite in lake populations of Daphnia dentifera from late summer through autumn. We then fit and compared performance of time-series models that included temperature-dependent and/or evolutionary changes in transmission rates. The analyses show evolution to be the better explanation of epidemic dynamics. Thus, by integrating data and models, this study highlights the potential role of evolution in driving the termination of epidemics in natural populations.

J	Newton, RM; Burns, DA; Blette, VL; Driscoll, CT				Newton, RM; Burns, DA; Blette, VL; Driscoll, CT			Effect of whole catchment liming on the episodic acidification of two Adirondack streams	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												During the fall of 1989 7.7Mg/ha of calcium carbonate was applied on two tributary catchments (40 ha and 60 ha) to Woods Lake, a small (25 ha) acidic headwater lake in the western Adirondack region of New York. Stream-water chemistry in both catchment tributaries responded immediately. Acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC) increased by more than 200 mu eq/L in one of the streams and more than 1000 mu eq/L in the other, from pre liming values which ranged from -25 to +40 mu eq/L. The increase in ANC was primarily due to increases in dissolved Ca2+ concentrations. Most of the initial response of the streams was due to the dissolution of calcite that fell directly into the stream channels and adjacent wetlands. A small beaver impoundment and associated wetlands were probably responsible for the greater response observed in one of the streams. After the liming of subcatchment IV (60 ha), Ca2+ concentrations increased with increasing stream discharge in the stream during fall rain events, suggesting a contribution from calcite dissolved within the soil and transported to the stream by surface runoff or shallow interflow. Concentrations of other ions not associated with the calcite (e.g. Na+) decreased during fall rain events, presumably due to mixing of solute-rich base flow with more dilute shallow interflow. The strong relation between changes in Ca2+ and changes in NO3- concentrations during spring snowmelt, (r(2) = 0.93, slope = 0.96, on an equivalent basis) suggests that both solutes had a common source in the organic horizon of the soil. Increases in NO3- concentrations during snowmelt were balanced by increases in Ca2+ that was released either directly from the calcite or from exchange sires, mitigating episodic acidification of the stream. However, high ambient NO3- concentrations and relatively low ambient Ca2+ concentrations in the stream during the spring caused the stream to become acidic despite the CaCO3 treatment. In stream WO2 (40ha), Ca2+ concentrations were much higher than in stream WO4 because of the dissolution of calcite which fell directly into the upstream beaver pond and its associated wetlands. Calcium concentrations decreased as both NO3- concentrations and stream discharge increased, due to the dilution of Ca-enriched beaver pond water by shallow interflow. Despite this dilution, Ca2+ concentrations were high enough to more than balance strong acid anion (SO42-, NO3-, Cl-) concentrations, resulting in a positive ANC in this stream throughout the year. These data indicate that liming of wetlands and beaver ponds is more effective than whole catchment liming in neutralizing acidic surface waters.

Hydrological variability affects particulate nitrogen and phosphorus in streams of the Northern Great Plains	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: The study area is located in southern Manitoba, in the prairie region of Canada Study focus: This study examined the impact of hydrological variability on the timing and magnitude of nutrient export from seven agriculturally-dominated watersheds in the Red River Valley, Manitoba, Canada. New hydrological insights for the region: In 2013, discharge showed a seasonal pattern typical of streams traversing the Canadian prairies: high discharge during snowmelt followed by cessation of flow in early June due to lack of precipitation. In 2014, discharge still peaked during snowmelt but, compared to 2013, was 49% lower during snowmelt yet 21% higher during summer and fall due to greater rainfall. These hydrologic differences were associated with differences in fractionation of nutrients between years. Thus, higher concentrations and loads of particulate phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N), and a greater (p < 0.05) share of the total nutrient pool in particulate forms (particularly for P), were observed during the snowmelt-dominated year (2013). Our findings show that the nutrient concentrations, fractionation and export from prairie watersheds differ between years, and amongst hydrological seasons, in relation to hydrological conditions. Additional management actions may be required to address changes in the quantity, timing and fractionation of nutrient export associated with rainier summers forecasted under future climate scenarios.

Salinization of Mirror Lake by Road Salt	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												The salinization of Mirror Lake in the White Mountains of New Hampshire has been ongoing steadily since Interstate 93 (I-93) was built through the NE subcatchment of the lake in the fall and winter of 1969-1970. Salt added to I-93 during winter as a deicer has been transported to the lake by different quantified, hydrologic pathways, but primarily from the Northeast Tributary, which was intersected by I-93. Now, surprisingly, after the New Hampshire Department of Transportation has spent more than $500,000 on recent structural modifications to divert salt from I-93 away from the Northeast subcatchment of Mirror Lake, applications of salt to a small, town road traversing the other two subcatchments for the lake and servicing a new housing development, have become the major source of salt to the lake. Streamflow from these two subcatchments currently provides more than three times as much salt to the lake as from I-93, and the salt concentration in the lake continues to rise.																			0049-6979					JAN	2010	205	1-4					205	214		10.1007/s11270-009-0066-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-009-0066-0													WOS:000272851000015

It holds one of the reserves of tropical evergreen forest in Mexico, as well as several maar lakes. One of them, Lago Verde, was chosen for a three-fold study ( 1) on its present limnological conditions, ( 2) on the algal community living in the water column and preserved in the surface sediments; and ( 3) on its recent history (ca. 340 yr). The palaeo-limnological study was based on multiproxy analyses on core material dated by Pb-210, Cs-137 and C-14. LagoVerde is a small, shallow lake with dilute, slightly alkaline water (CO32- + HCO3- > Cl- > SO42-, Na+ + K+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+). It is turbid, eutrophic, with high phosphorus levels. It is a warm polymictic lake, with thermal and oxygen strati. cation establishing by midday during the warm months. The lake does not stratify in winter. Diatoms dominate the phytoplankton community in the cold 'nortes' season, Cyanobacteria in summer, and Chlorophyta in autumn. Cyanobacteria (Chroococcales) are not well preserved in the surface sediments while Chlorophyta are better preserved. Sedimentary diatoms are well preserved, dominated by the three most abundant species in the water column: Achnanthidium minutissimum, Fragilaria capucina and Aulacoseira granulata. The base of the studied sequences is constrained by the historic eruption of 1664. The period from 1664 to 1963 is characterised by a meso-eutrophic lake. Tropical Forest vegetation reaches maximumvalues between ca. 1800 and 1963. Between ca. 1785 and 1885 the lakewas slightly shallower than in the rest of the 1664-1963 period, probably recording climatic variability. An early pulse of anthropogenic disturbance was recorded by ca. 1921 and after ca. 1963 intense forest clearance and high erosion rates led to a more turbid, more productive, nutrient-rich lake. The highest anthropogenic impact was reached by ca. 1988; afterwards the lake and its basin reached a new balance, with the establishment of the present modern conditions.					; Ruiz-Fernández, Ana Carolina/ABG-6985-2020; Vazquez, Gabriela/Q-6824-2018; Rodríguez-Trejo, Alejandro/AAG-3691-2020	Ortega-Guerrero, Beatriz/0000-0002-3823-1926; RUIZ-FERNANDEZ, ANA CAROLINA/0000-0002-2515-1249; Lozano-Garcia, Socorro/0000-0002-3579-175X; Vazquez, Gabriela/0000-0002-8870-7224; Caballero, Margarita/0000-0001-5691-0773; Sosa Najera, Maria Susana/0000-0003-3778-2563; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				JAN	2006	35	1					83	97		10.1007/s10933-005-7427-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-005-7427-5													WOS:000233939300006

Verification of a coupled hydrometeorological modelling approach for alpine tributaries in the Rhine basin	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												This study describes the results of a model setup for the off-line one-way coupling of a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model with the hydrological PREVAH model for flood prediction and its multi-year validation. The hydrological model has been applied to the Rhine basin down to the gauge Rheinfelden (34,550 km(2)) with a spatial resolution of 500 by 500 m 2 using an hourly time-step. The calibration of the hydrological model was based on surface observations and has been carried out for each of the 23 subcatchments, whose runoff regimes range from glacial to nival and pluvial. Because of the presence of lakes in the investigated catchments, it was a necessity to include a function which represents the retarding and flattening of flood peaks by lakes. Results show that the model is capable to reproduce the relevant hydrological processes in the investigated catchments and that the model properly captures the extreme runoff peaks both during the calibration (1997-1998) and validation period (1999-2002). Validation runs with 19 to 42 h atmospheric forecasts for the period 1997-2002 show, as expected, a decrease in model accuracy. The use of precipitation forecasts considerably increases the False Alarm Rate (FAR), while the Critical Success Index (CSI) decreases. Consequences of errors in the precipitation forecasts are most pronounced for higher thresholds, while the coupled modelling system performs better for smaller precipitation events. The effects of errors in the temperature forecasts are most pronounced in spring and summer. This is caused by an overestimation of snowpack accumulation in winter, which consequently results in too much snowmelt during the melt season in the upper catchments. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Small water bodies are most abundant in permanently frozen peatlands, and it is speculated that their emissions will increase as the permafrost thaws. We made 6806 measurements of CH4 ebullition during four consecutive summers using a total of 40 bubble traps that were systematically distributed across the depth zones of three lakes in a sporadic permafrost landscape in northernmost Sweden. We identified significant spatial and temporal variations in ebullition and observed a large spread in the bubbles' CH4 concentration, ranging from 0.04% to 98.6%. Ebullition followed lake temperatures, and releases were significantly larger during periods with decreasing atmospheric pressure. Although shallow zone ebullition dominated the seasonal bubble CH4 flux, we found a shift in the depth dependency towards higher fluxes from intermediate and deep zones in early fall. The average daily flux of 13.4mg CH4 m(-2) was lower than those measured in most other high-latitude lakes. Locally, however, our study lakes are a substantial CH4 source; we estimate that 350kg of CH4 is released via ebullition during summer (June-September), which is approximately 40% of total whole year emissions from the nearby peatland. In order to capture the large variability and to accurately scale lake CH4 ebullition temporally and spatially, frequent measurements over long time periods are critical.

The average CRD is July 14 for 1985-1999 and July 24 for 2000-2014. Corresponding to the CRD delay, the July rainfall is concentrated in the northern South Korea during 2000-2014, whereas tends to be intense along the southern coast during 1985-1999. The delayed CRD is associated with, in the lower and mid-troposphere, a strengthened cyclonic circulation around Lake Baikal-eastern Sea of Japan and an enhanced anticyclonic circulation in East China Sea. Thus, northerlies from strengthened cyclones and anomalous southerlies from the enhanced anticyclones converge at the northern-central Korean Peninsula. The anomalous anticyclone is associated with the strengthening of the western North Pacific subtropical high that has strengthened in meridional direction in the later epoch, supplying warm and moist air to Korean Peninsula. The result is verified by the enhanced warm and moist anomalous upward flows in the latitude where Korean Peninsula is placed. The delayed CRD in the latter epoch is related to the decreased spring snowfall over East Asia except for the vicinity of the Lake Baikal, which results in severely hot weather in the East Asia continent from spring to July. The continent heating from spring to July weakened (increases), the thermal gradient between continent and ocean, thereby forming a low-pressure system on East Asia and a high-pressure system in western North Pacific, resulting in the strengthening of Changma rain belt in July and delayed the Changma withdrawal.

Phytoplankton composition shifted from a diatom-dominated community (75% of phytoplankton carbon) during May to a phytoflagellate-dominated community (71% of phytoplankton carbon) during July-August. This summer phytoflagellate dominance in the 1980s is distinctly different from the summer blue-green and green algae dominance in the 1970s. Foodweb interactions caused by a changing zooplankton composition and nutrient supply changes were two possible causes. A deep chlorophyll layer (DCL) developed after the onset of thermal stratification. The DCL initially developed in the 15-30 m region and deepen to 25-50 m in July and the 40-70 m region in August. The DCL in 1982-84 was larger in size and located deeper in the water column than those reported from the 1970s. This difference was related to increases in light transparency found in the 1980s that were a result of increased zooplankton grazing pressure.

The North Pacific-Driven Severe Midwest Winter of 2013/14	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												The severe 2013/14 winter (December-March) in the Midwest was dominated by a persistent atmospheric circulation pattern anchored to a North Pacific Ocean that was much warmer than average. Strong teleconnection magnitudes of the eastern Pacific oscillation (-EPO), tropical Northern Hemisphere pattern (+TNH), and second-lowest Hudson Bay 500-hPa geopotential height field are indicators that led to severe winter weather across the eastern United States. Unlike in previous cold and snowy midwestern winters, Atlantic Ocean blocking played little to no role in the winter of 2013/14. The primary atmospheric feature of the 2013/14 winter was the 500-hPa high pressure anchored over the North Pacific in response to the extremely warm sea surface temperature anomalies observed of +3.7 standard deviations. Only one other severe midwestern winter (1983/84) since 1950 featured a similar Pacific blocking. The accumulated winter season severity index, which is a metric that combines daily snowfall, snow depth, and temperature data for the winter season, was used to compare the 2013/14 winter with past winters since 1950. Detroit, Michigan, and Duluth, Minnesota, experienced their worst winter of the 55-yr period. Seven climate divisions in northern Illinois, eastern Iowa, and parts of Wisconsin experienced record-cold mean temperatures. These climate conditions were associated with a number of impacts, including a disruption to the U.S. economy, the second-highest ice coverage of the Great Lakes since 1973, and a flight-cancellation rate that had not been seen in 25 years.

The sedimentary distribution of chlorophylls, carotenoids and their breakdown products following the winter-spring bloom of the dinoflagellate Peridinium gatunense in Lake Kinneret was determined both spatially and vertically within the sediments, using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). 2. All four stations (epilimnic, oxic St. J (depth = 8m) and D (12 m) and hypolimnic, anoxic St. F (21 m) A (41 m) were characterized by the presence of chlorophyll a (chl-a) chl-b, chl-c, phaeophytins a (ph'tin-a) and b, phaeophorbide a (ph'bide-a) and lutein, fucoxanthin, diatoxanthin and beta-carotene together with spectrally similar, but HPLC-resolved, breakdown products in the surface sediments. The central deep station A (41 m), which is seasonally anoxic, trapped and preserved significantly more pigments (e.g. chl-a = 16.35-mu-g g-1 organic matter) than the more erosive, oxic littoral stations (chl-a = 1.10 and 0.76-mu-g g-1 OM at St. D and J, respectively). 3. Whereas it was possible to ascribe the presence of lutein and chl-b to inputs of green algae and higher plants from the catchment, and fucoxanthin and chl-c1, c2 to winter diatom blooms (e.g. Melosira granulata), there was a remarkable absence of peridinin and dinoxanthin from sediments, despite the dominance of dinoflagellates in the phytobiomass. This is consistent with the well-known oxic lability of this epoxy carotenoid in aquatic systems, and indicates efficient breakdown of this dinoflagellate organic matter in the water column, prior to sedimentation. 4. Although pigment concentrations all decreased with depths within sediments, lutein and beta-carotene were selectively preserved compared to chl-a and fucoxanthin which, at 40 m depth at St. A, decreased to < 1% of their surface concentrations.

By combining the position of marginal moraines with AMS radiocarbon dated glacier-meltwater induced sediments in proglacial lakes draining northern Folgefonna, a continuous high-resolution record of variations in glacier size and equilibrium-line altitudes (ELAs) during the Lateglacial and early Holocene has been obtained. After the termination of the Younger Dryas (c. 11500cal.yrBP), a short-lived (100-150 years) climatically induced glacier readvance termed the 'Jondal Event 1' occurred within the 'Preboreal Oscillation' (PBO) c. 11100cal.yrBP. Bracketed to 10550-10450cal.yrBP, a second glacier readvance is named the 'Jondal Event 2'. A third readvance occurred about 10000cal.yrBP and corresponds with the 'Erdalen Event 1' recorded at Jostedalsbreen. An exponential relationship between mean solid winter precipitation and ablation-season temperature at the ELA of Norwegian glaciers is used to reconstruct former variations in winter precipitation based on the corresponding ELA and an independent proxy for summer temperature. Compared to the present, the Younger Dryas was much colder and drier, the 'Jondal Event 1'/PBO was colder and somewhat drier, and the 'Jondal Event 2' was much wetter. The 'Erdalen Event 1' started as rather dry and terminated as somewhat wetter. Variations in glacier magnitude/ELAs and corresponding palaeoclimatic reconstructions at northern Folgefonna suggest that low-altitude cirque glaciers (lowest altitude of marginal moraines 290 m) in the area existed for the last time during the Younger Dryas. These low-altitude cirque glaciers of suggested Younger Dryas age do not fit into the previous reconstructions of the Younger Dryas ice sheet in Hardanger.

J	Steinman, A; Rediske, R; Reddy, KR				Steinman, A; Rediske, R; Reddy, KR			The reduction of internal phosphorus loading using alum in Spring Lake, Michigan	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												The release of P from lake sediments, which occurs as a part of internal loading, may contribute a significant portion of the total P load to a lake. Phosphorus release rates from sediments in Spring Lake, Michigan, and the degree to which alum reduces P release from these sediments, were investigated during the summer of 2003. Triplicate sediment cores were sampled from four sites in the lake, and exposed to one of four treatments in the laboratory: (i) aerobic water column/ alum, (ii) aerobic water column/no alum, (iii) anaerobic water column/ alum, or (iv) anaerobic water column/no alum. Total P (TP) release rates were virtually undetectable in the alum treatments (both aerobic and anaerobic). Low, but detectable, release rates were measured in the aerobictno alum treatment. The highest release rates were measured in the anaerobic/no alum treatments, and ranged from 1.6 to 29.5 mg P m(-2) d(-1) depending on how the calculations were derived. These fluxes translated to mean internal loads that ranged between 2.7 (low range) and 6.4 (high range) Mg yr(-1) when extrapolated to a whole-lake basis. Internal P loads accounted for between 55 and 65% of the total P load to Spring Lake. Although alum is a potentially effective means of reducing the sediment source of P, there is considerable uncertainty in how long an alum treatment would remain effective in this system given the current rates of external loading and the lack of information on wind-wave action and bioturbation in Spring Lake.					; Steinman, Alan/B-8723-2014	Rediske, Richard/0000-0002-5048-1063; Steinman, Alan/0000-0002-4886-4305; 													0047-2425	1537-2537				NOV-DEC	2004	33	6					2040	2048		10.2134/jeq2004.2040	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2004.2040								15537926					WOS:000225240900009

With the rapid development of industry, there is an increasing risk of freshwater contamination by heavy metals (HMs). The danger of HM pollution is also attributed to their accumulation, which can subsequently become a source of secondary pollution in aquatic environments. In the Lake Gusinoe basin, located in Russia, concentrations of HMs were measured in both water and bottom sediments within the lake area, as well as in inflowing and outflowing watercourses. Ecological risk indices were also calculated for the Gusinoe basin. Our results showed that the average concentrations of Fe, Zn, Cr, Ni, Cd, and Pb in the water did not exceed the maximum allowable concentrations (MACs) set by Russian national standards and WHO standards, while the concentrations of Mn and Cu exceeded the corresponding MACs during winter, spring, and autumn possibly due to decomposition of aquatic vegetation and influx from groundwater sources. The average concentrations of the investigated HMs in the BSs did not exceed the background values. The water hazard index indicated a low risk for all samples in the lake water area. For all BS samples, the geoaccumulation index (Igeo) and the Pollution Load Index (PLI) indicated low pollution levels, while the values of the Enrichment Factor (EF) and the Contamination Factor (CF) indicated moderate pollution in the central part of the lake. The Ecological Risk Factor (Er) for Cu in BSs at points near major settlements and in the Tel River indicated moderate pollution. The Potential Ecological Risk Index (RI) in all investigated BS samples indicated a low risk of contamination.

Localised factors at the lake level ensure that individual pit lakes develop different water qualities and ecological values. The Collie Lake District is formed from open cut coal mining operations in the south-west of Western Australia. The limnology and water quality of 13 of these lakes were investigated in 2009. All of the deep pit lakes appeared to be thermally stratified over the summer but many had, or were close to, mixing by autumn. The lakes were mainly Al buffered, with pH ranging from 2.5 to 6.4. Most lakes could be considered oligotrophic but some contained high N and moderate P concentrations. Dissolved organic C and metal concentrations were generally very low.

We here review the terrestrial and near-shore proxy data from Australia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea (PNG), New Zealand and surrounding oceans during 35-10 ka, an interval spanning the lead-up to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the LGM proper (21 +/- 2 ka), and the ensuing deglaciation. Sites selected for detailed discussion have a continuous or near continuous sedimentary record for this time interval, a stratigraphically consistent chronology, and one or more sources of proxy climatic data. Tropical Australia, Indonesia and PNG had LGM mean annual temperatures 3-7 degrees C below present values and summer precipitation reduced by at least 30%, consistent with a weaker summer monsoon and a northward displacement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The summer monsoon was re-established in northwest Australia by 14 ka. Precipitation in northeast Australia was reduced to less than 50% of present values until warmer and wetter conditions resumed at 17-16 ka, followed by a second warmer, wetter phase at 15-14 ka. LGM temperatures were up to 8 degrees C lower than today in mainland southeast Australia and up to 4 degrees C cooler in Tasmania. Winter rainfall was much reduced throughout much of southern Australia although periodic extreme flood events are evident in the fluvial record. Glacial advances in southeast Australia are dated to 32 +/- 2.5, 19.1 +/- 1.6 and 16.8 +/- 1.4 ka, with periglacial activity concentrated towards 23-16 ka. Deglaciation was rapid in the Snowy Mountains, which were ice-free by 15.8 ka. Minimum effective precipitation in southern Australia was from 14 to 12 ka. In New Zealand the glacial advances date to similar to 28, 21.5 and 19 ka, with the onset of major cooling at similar to 28 ka, or well before the LGM. There is no convincing evidence for a Younger Dryas cooling event in or around New Zealand, but there are signs of the Antarctic Cold Reversal in and around New Zealand and off southern Australia. There remain unresolved discrepancies between the climates inferred from pollen and those inferred from the beetle and chironomid fauna at a number of New Zealand sites. One explanation may be that pollen provides a generalised regional climatic signal in contrast to the finer local resolution offered by beetles and chironomids. Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) were up to 5 degrees C cooler during the LGM with rapid warming after 20 ka to attain present values by 15 ka. The increase in summer monsoonal precipitation at or before 15 ka reflects higher insolation, warmer SSTs and steeper thermal gradients between land and sea. The postglacial increase in winter rainfall in southern Australia is probably related to the southward displacement of the westerlies as SSTs around Antarctica became warmer and the winter pack ice and Antarctic Convergence Zone retreated to the south.

J	Nelson, WA; Steinman, AD				Nelson, Whitney A.; Steinman, Alan D.			Changes in the benthic communities of Muskegon Lake, a Great Lakes Area of Concern	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Sediment contamination resulting from the direct discharge of industrial and municipal wastes contributed to the designation of Muskegon Lake (Michigan) as a Great Lakes Area of Concern. To assess the changes occurring in the sedient-dwelling invertebrate communities since wastewater diversion began in 1973, benthic samples were collected three times per year (spring, summer, fall) between 2004 and 2010 from six sites and compared to historic samples. The density and diversity of invertebrate populations were analyzed to: 1) identify spatial and temporal patterns in the community structure; 2) determine if community structure patterns were related to environmental variables; and 3) assess the recovery of Muskegon Lake's benthic community following wastewater diversion. Our results revealed that invertebrate community structure changed on both annual and spatial scales, while seasonal differences were shown to be modest between 2004 and 2010. The environmental variables with the greatest explanatory power included dissolved oxygen, pH, and depth. Overall, recovery of benthic invertebrate community structure was evident based on multiple lines of evidence, including increased densities of all major taxonomic groups and species diversity since wastewater diversion, decreases in both the oligochaete-chironomid ratio (0.92 in 1972; 0.69 in 2010) and the proportion of oligochaetes, and declining sediment metal concentration overtime. However, comparisons of present-day and historic sampling sites must be viewed with caution because sampling locations and protocols varied among years. Significant changes in benthic invertebrate composition and water quality metrics since 1972 suggest improved environmental conditions and the continued recovery of Muskegon Lake from historic pollution.

Climate-driven deoxygenation of northern lakes	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE												Oxygen depletion constitutes a major threat to lake ecosystems and the services they provide. Most of the world's lakes are located >45 degrees N, where accelerated climate warming and elevated carbon loads might severely increase the risk of hypoxia, but this has not been systematically examined. Here analysis of 2.6 million water quality observations from 8,288 lakes shows that between 1960 and 2022, most northern lakes experienced rapid deoxygenation strongly linked to climate-driven prolongation of summer stratification. Oxygen levels deteriorated most in small lakes (<10 ha) owing to their greater volumetric oxygen demand and surface warming rates, while the largest lakes gained oxygen under minimal stratification changes and improved aeration at spring overturns. Seasonal oxygen consumption rates declined, despite widespread browning. Proliferating anoxia enhanced seasonal internal loading of C, P and N but depleted P long-term, indicating that deoxygenation can exhaust redox-sensitive fractions of sediment nutrient reservoirs.					; del Giorgio, Paul/AAD-1315-2019; Prairie, Yves/B-9108-2008; Simpson, Gavin/C-1671-2008; Jansen, Joachim/IXN-4782-2023; Weyhenmeyer, Gesa/Y-6135-2019	Simpson, Gavin/0000-0002-9084-8413; del Giorgio, Paul/0000-0003-1866-8159; Prairie, Yves/0000-0003-1210-992X; Harkonen, Laura/0000-0003-1399-5978; Weyhenmeyer, Gesa/0000-0002-4013-2281; Paterson, Andrew/0000-0002-4296-9528; Jansen, Joachim/0000-0001-5965-7662; 													1758-678X	1758-6798				AUG	2024	14	8								10.1038/s41558-024-02058-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41558-024-02058-3		JUL 2024											WOS:001260401000001
J	Blindow, I; Hargeby, A; Andersson, G				Blindow, I; Hargeby, A; Andersson, G			Seasonal changes of mechanisms maintaining clear water in a shallow lake with abundant Chara vegetation	AQUATIC BOTANY												The study is based on monitoring data on the seasonal variation during four (1996-1999) vegetation periods, as well as long-term summer data on submerged vegetation, nutrients, light, phyto-plankton and zooplankton in Lake Krankesjon, a shallow, calcium-rich, moderately eutrophic take in southern Sweden. The lake has been in the clear water state with abundant submerged vegetation since the end of the 1980s. Somewhat lower summer biomass of submerged macrophytes during 1997 and 1999 indicates a temporary instability of the clear water state. During these 2 years, summer transparency was about 1.2-2.1 m, while concentrations of total phosphorus and chlorophyll (Chl) a were about 26-40 and 8-18 mug 1(-1), respectively. Summer biomass of submerged macrophytes was higher during 1996 and 1998. In both years, a distinct increase in light availability and decrease in concentrations of nutrients and chlorophyll occurred simultaneously with the development of dense Chara vegetation. Summer values for transparency were about 2.0-2.5 m, while concentrations of total phosphorus and Chl a were about 20-32 and 4-11 mug 1(-1), respectively. Summer biomass of crustacean zooplankton was below 250 mug 1(-1) during all 4 years. A peak abundance of Cladocera (mainly Bosmina longirostris) during May or June caused only a short-term reduction in chlorophyll concentrations that was more pronounced in 1997 than in 1996. Measured light attenuation during 1999 was closely correlated with light attenuation calculated from the amount of suspended solids, chlorophyll concentrations, and water colour. Detritus contributed most to the total amount of suspended solids, while chlorophyll was the main contributor to light attenuation. A long-term decrease of the ratios between chlorophyll and total phosphorus suggests that phytoplankton in the clear water state is limited by factors other than total phosphorus concentrations. Increased sedimentation rate, carbon limitation, allelopathy and a lower bioavailable fraction of the total amount of phosphorus are possible explanations, while nitrogen limitation and grazing from zooplankton probably are of minor importance. Possible reasons for the "instability" of the clear water state during 1997 and 1999 are discussed. Unusually high water level as well as cold and windy weather during the spring of 1996-1999 may have caused a slow and late growth of the plants and thus a temporary instability. However, a tendency for an increase in total phosphorus concentrations and sediment accumulation along the wind-protected shores during the clear water state indicate the possibility of a long-term. destabilization which contradicts the alternative stable states model.

The Great Lakes shape nocturnal bird migration in southern Ontario	AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY												Coastlines in marine areas are known to influence use of the airspace as a habitat by migrating birds, but less is known about how the complex configuration of the Great Lakes influences bird migration patterns. If birds alter their migration in response to the lakes, they may become concentrated in specific areas, which should receive particular attention from a conservation perspective. In this study, we examined the effects of these lakes on flight directions and densities of nocturnally migrating birds in southern Ontario, Canada, using data from two Canadian weather surveillance radars for three years in autumn (2009-2011) and two years in spring (2010-2011). On nights of high migration intensity, we estimated migration directions and bird densities 2.5 and 6 hours after sunset, using a sampling design that tested specific hypotheses about the lake effects at different scales. We found that the Great Lakes influenced migration patterns, with many birds flying along a NE-SW corridor, in autumn passing between Georgian Bay and Lake Ontario and then likely crossing Lake Erie. In spring, most birds passed over the eastern half of Lake Erie and then flew northeast between Georgian Bay and Lake Ontario. These concentration areas had estimated densities of migrating birds up to 4 times those in other areas. Although some birds flew across the middle of the lakes, many birds appeared to follow routes that minimize the flight distance over water. This was particularly evident later in the night when migration directions shifted even more to avoid crossing lakes. These concentration areas include some of the most heavily developed lands in southern Ontario. To obtain better spatiotemporal information that can be used to guide conservation in this region, we recommend further analyses of radar data at a finer scale and over a longer time interval using refined algorithms.																			1712-6568					AUG	2022	17	2							2	10.5751/ACE-02118-170202	http://dx.doi.org/10.5751/ACE-02118-170202													WOS:000859338000008
J	Antón-Pardo, M; Armengol, X				Anton-Pardo, Maria; Armengol, Xavier			Influence of biotic variables on invertebrate size structure and diversity in coastal wetlands of Southeastern Spain	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Biomass and size-based estimations provide relevant information regarding ecosystem functioning and biotic interactions. Our aims were to study the effect of fish and macrophytes on the size structure of invertebrate assemblages (from rotifers to insects) in a set of coastal water bodies, estimating the biomass (total and main invertebrate groups), the biomass-size spectra (model of Pareto) and size diversity. In fishless ponds, cladoceran and ostracod biomass were higher, and they presented greater size diversity. In fish ponds, rotifer biomass presented greater proportion; while in fishless ponds, cladocerans were usually the most abundant taxa and the largest organisms. The biomass size spectra showed more irregularities in fishless ponds, due to the low densities of small taxa (rotifers and copepod juveniles) and big taxa (malacostraceans or insects). Differences is size structure and diversity were also observed between spring and summer, suggesting a higher recruitment of juveniles in spring, and thus, a higher predation pressure upon zooplankton at that moment. Macrophyte cover did not apparently influence those parameters, except for the biomass of ostracods, copepods, and insects. Therefore, predation by fish strongly affected invertebrate biomass, reflecting their selective feeding, and allowing high densities of small taxa. Predation pressure decreased size diversity, by limiting the abundance of vulnerable taxa of specific size. Seasonal changes were likely related to the spring recruitment of fish juveniles. The presence of small fish and invertebrate predator taxa among the macrophytes, restrict their role as refuges for prey invertebrates. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the summer periods, bears moved up to the Barents Sea coast, and in winters, they were dormant. The main ecotopes for these animals were river floodplains, large lake systems, seaside saline marshes, and seashore. In the summer periods, the population structure is represented by females with cubs (33.9%), single animals (45.8%), and groups of two or three individuals (18.3%). On average, one female has 1.6 cubs. The marriage lasts from late June till August. Hibernation continues from late September-October till May. The main diet of bears is berries and vegetative parts 2 of different plants. The greatest number of bears was in river floodplains. on average, 0.22 individuals per I kin. For the last years, the number of bears is increasing due to the appearance of new ecological niches because of rising air temperature in Subarctic region.

Spring Downings Clarify the Migration Biology of Eared Grebes (Podiceps nigricollis)	WATERBIRDS												Eared Grebes (Podiceps nigricollis) staging at the Great Salt Lake, Utah, USA, sometimes experience weather-induced downings where many individuals are killed. Downings of Eared Grebes moving south during the fall have been reported for decades; however, spring downings are rare and underrepresented in the literature. On 15 April 2013, 13,500 Eared Grebes flying northward encountered inclement weather, were attracted to lights on Dugway Proving Ground, and downed. This spring downing was documented, and population characteristics were compared with those observed in previous downings. An estimated 38% were killed outright. Rescue efforts promoted the survival of 88% of those not killed on impact. Grebes that were 9-10 months old were, on average, 10% lighter than adults in the same flight, perhaps indicating slow growth or age differences in foraging efficiency. Adults dominated all downings, supporting previous information that adults and young migrate on different schedules. The sex ratio in the North American population appears to be 1:1. Downings occur when Eared Grebes encounter inclement weather and are attracted to lights. Knowledge of the route, migration period, and flight speed of Eared Grebes allows predictions about when and where downings are likely to occur. Reducing the number and intensity of lights on snowy nights in high risk areas may decrease mortality.

Nitrogen loads can alter ecosystem structure and functioning, resulting in increased algal productivity, algal blooms and eutrophication. The principal aim of the present paper is to extend the use of epilithic delta N-15 signatures to a lake ecosystem in order to evaluate the potential impact of anthropogenic nitrogen discharges (organic and inorganic) that can also reach coastal waters. Epilithic associations were collected from volcanic rocks in different seasons in shallow water along the entire perimeter of Lake Bracciano and analysed for their nitrogen stable isotope signatures. Furthermore, some stones were moved from an unpolluted site to a polluted one in order to verify the effect on the nitrogen signature of the epilithic association. The epilithon's delta N-15 signatures provided strong evidence of the space-time variability of N inputs. The differing quality of nitrogen loads was reflected in high isotopic variation within the lake, especially at the beginning of summer (1.7 parts per thousand <= delta N-15 <= 13.3 parts per thousand), while in winter, when anthropogenic pressure was lowest, the delta N-15 signature variation was less accentuated (3.1 parts per thousand <= delta N-15 <= 7.6 parts per thousand). At all sampling times, spatial variability was found to be related to the various human activities along the lake shore (especially tourism and agriculture), while seasonal variation at all sampling sites was related to the intensity of anthropogenic pressures (higher in summer and lower in winter). Our results showed that epilithic algal associations and the physicochemical properties of the water did not influence the delta N-15 signature, which in contrast was strongly related to the site-specific effect of human activities around the lake. Thus, the distribution of delta N-15 across space and time can be used to direct nutrient reduction strategies in the region and can assist in monitoring the effectiveness of environmental protection measures.					; Lasinio, Giovanna/P-4031-2015	CICALA, DAVIDE/0000-0001-9942-9859; Careddu, Giulio/0000-0002-7553-9161													1470-160X	1872-7034				AUG	2017	79						19	27		10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.04.007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.04.007													WOS:000406436000003

Vegetation associations of the endangered fountain darter Etheostoma fonticola	ENDANGERED SPECIES RESEARCH												Aquatic vegetation provides many services for aquatic habitats and fish communities. The federally listed fountain darter Etheostoma fonticola, found only in spring systems of the San Marcos and Comal rivers in central Texas, is reported to associate with vegetation for feeding, reproduction, and refuge. Descriptions of associations with vegetation range from preferred to exclusive, whereas other studies describe fountain darters found outside of vegetation. The purposes of this study were to quantify fountain darter occurrences and abundances among vegetated habitats using the concept of obligate and facultative habitat use. Wadeable and non-wadeable habitats among multiple reaches of the San Marcos and Comal rivers were sampled with seines and SCUBA diving methods in the spring and fall from 2014 to 2019. Fountain darters were often associated with aquatic vegetation but demonstrated both obligate and facultative tendencies. Fountain darters occurred in vegetation more than expected among wadeable and nonwadeable habitats in the majority of reaches within the San Marcos and Comal rivers. Among vegetation taxa, they were positively associated with bryophytes and negatively associated with Texas wild rice, but associations with other vegetation taxa varied by river and were possibly influenced by other variables.

This article describes a streamflow hydrograph separation analysis carried out over three complete annual cycles (1997-1999) for five subarctic catchments ranging in size from 202 to 2050 km(2) situated near the confluence of the Liard and Mackenzie rivers. This heterogeneous landscape, characterized by extensive wetlands (fen and bog), shallow lakes and widespread discontinuous permafrost, is representative of vast flow-contributing areas of the upper Mackenzie Valley, and is suspected to be highly sensitive to climate variability and change. We document seasonal patterns and interannual variability in the isotopic composition of local streamflow, attributable to mixing of three distinctly labelled flow sources, namely groundwater, surface water plus rain, and direct snowmelt, and apply these isotopic signals to partition sources and their temporal variability. Although groundwater input is the dominant and most persistent streamflow source in all five catchments throughout the year, direct snowmelt runoff via surface and shallow subsurface pathways (during spring freshet) and surface waters from lakes and wetlands situated in low-lying areas of the basins (during summer and fall) are also significant seasonal contributors. Catchment-specific differences are also apparent, particularly in the generation of snowmelt runoff, which is more attenuated in fen-dominated than in bog-dominated catchments. The data set additionally reveals notable interannual variability in snow isotope signatures and snow water equivalent, apparently enhanced by the 1998 El Nino event.

To assess the loads, movement, and fate of the MPs in the wetland from this point source, water and sediment samples were collected in the fall and spring of 2021-2023. Additional samples, including sediment cores and atmospheric particulates, were collected during the summer of 2023 from select areas of the wetland. The MPs were isolated from the field samples using density separation, filtration, and chemical oxidation. Infrared and Raman spectroscopy analyses identified the MPs as polyethylene, which were quantified visually using a stereomicroscope. The numbers of MPs in 100 mL of the marsh water closest to the source ranged from several hundred to over 400,000, while the open water samples contained few microplastics. Marsh surface sediments were highly contaminated with MPs, up to 18,800 per 30.0 g dry mass (dm), compared to core samples in the lower depths (>15 cm) that contained only smaller MPs (<200 mu m), numbering 0-480 per 30.0 g (dm). The wide variations in loads of MP contaminants indicate the influence of numerous factors, such as proximity to the point source pollution, weather conditions, natural matter, and pollution sinks, namely sediment deposition. As proof of concept, we demonstrated a novel remediation method using these real-world samples to effectively agglomerate and remove MPs from contaminated waters.					; Davis, Christina/ITV-5817-2023; Doudrick, Kyle/J-4683-2014	Wilson, Antigone/0000-0001-5611-8866; Doudrick, Kyle/0000-0003-1912-9819; McCool, Jon-Paul/0000-0003-2384-4620; Nwachukwu, Ozioma/0000-0002-2451-2639														2073-4441				JAN	2024	16	1							11	10.3390/w16010011	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16010011								39219624					WOS:001141475500001

Neither depleted phosphate concentrations nor high dissolved salts correlated with the appearance of methylated forms of As. A temporal study of As speciation in Davis Creek Reservior, a seasonally anoxic lake in northern California, demonstrated that dimethylarsinic acid increased sufficiently to become the dominant form of dissolved As within the surface photic zone during late summer and fall. Methylated forms decreased while arsenate increased when the lake over-turned in early December, which suggested a degradation of dimethylarsinic acid to arsenate.																			0013-936X					MAR	1991	25	3					420	427		10.1021/es00015a007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es00015a007													WOS:A1991EZ64300012

Drowning in children: Aseer Central Hospital experience, Southwestern Saudi Arabia	JOURNAL OF FAMILY AND COMMUNITY MEDICINE												Aim: To study the reasons, magnitude and outcome of drowning following submersion in water of children admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit in Aseer Province, Saudi Arabia. Materials and Methods: A retrospective cohort study of all pediatric patients (0-13) years old who drowned and were admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Aseer Central Hospital, Southwestern Saudi Arabia, between January 1st 1999 and December 31st 2009. Results: A total of 19 cases were admitted following submersion in water. The mean age was 5.2 years +/- 3.8. Majority of victims (94.1%) were from the highland areas. Events most frequently occurred in the summer (46.7%), followed by spring and winter, 33.3% and 20%, respectively. Home events constituted 44.4% of submersion cases. Of these, 55.6% drowned in a washing container, While 53.4% submersed in swimming pools. Twenty-two percent of these accidents occurred in the sea and in wells while 11.1% occurred in a lake. The mean duration of submersion was 4.04 minutes +/- 5.35. Cardiac arrest was reported upon arrival at hospital in 42.1% of the victims. There were seven deaths (36.8 %) and in one patient (5.2 %) there was severe brain injury. In all deceased cases, no adults were watching the children when the accidents occurred. Conclusion: Drowning is a significant risk factor facing our children and can claim lives. The media as well as the authority should play a major role in increasing the public awareness to minimize or prevent such a problem.

Presence of salmon increases passerine density on Pacific Northwest streams	AUK												The annual migration of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) to freshwater streams and lakes provides an important nutrient subsidy to terrestrial systems in North America. We investigated the effects of salmon and other habitat variables on abundance of Winter Wren (Troglodytes troglodytes), Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus), Varied Thrush (Ixoreus naevius), Pacific-slope Flycatcher (Empidonax difficilis), Golden-crowned Kinglet (Regulus satrapa), and Chestnut-backed Chickadee (Poecile rufescens) on the central coast of British Columbia. In our comparisons of salmon-bearing and non-salmon-bearing reaches of two rivers that had waterfall barriers to salmon partway upstream, we found that position above or below the falls and proximity to the stream were the major predictors of songbird abundance. Each species, except for Chestnut-backed Chickadee, had higher densities below the falls at both rivers. Our results suggest that salmon-derived nutrients influence songbird density, and thus benefit multiple trophic levels within riparian ecosystems.																			0004-8038	1938-4254				JAN	2008	125	1					51	59		10.1525/auk.2008.125.1.51	http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/auk.2008.125.1.51													WOS:000256372500006

Despite the importance of Llangorse Lake as the largest natural body of fresh water in South Wales, no long-term limnological project has ever been planned for the lake. 2. A mass of data is available from sampling carried out at intervals since 1961, but these visits were for various reasons and used widely differing levels of expertise. However, from these data some indications of seasonal variations, effects of climate and human interference on the lake system over 30 years have been inferred. 3. Depth soundings revealed the general shallowness of the lake with two deeper basins. Wind action oxygenated the water and stirred up sediments releasing nutrients and resting algal stages into the water column. Periods of thermal stratification were transient in summer. Secchi disc and light readings showed greatest light penetration in April/May. The lake water remained alkaline throughout. Dissolved ammonia Values were low in the 1960s, increased in the 1970s and decreased again in the 1980s. Nitrite- and nitrate-nitrogen showed a converse pattern over the years. Phosphate (PO4-P) and silica (SiO2) values were highest in the 1960s, showed a decrease in the 1970s and early-1980s, and rose again towards the end of the decade, as did the chloride values. Seasonal fluctuations of all nutrients were observed. 4. Diatoms dominated the phytoplankton, with highest production in summer and early autumn. The Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) produced blooms in the 1960s and 1970s, but Chlorophyta (green algae) increased over the years and dominated in the 1980s after a diversion of sewage from the lake. Diatom production followed a vernal and late summer periodicity common in temperate lakes. Results from diatom stratigraphy of the deep sediment cores indicated a change from epiphytic to planktonic species related to land-use change and a subsequent increase in soil erosion and turbidity.

J	Yao, SX; Sun, QF; Huang, Q; Chu, P				Yao, Suxiang; Sun, Qingfei; Huang, Qian; Chu, Peng			The 10-30-day intraseasonal variation of the East Asian winter monsoon: The temperature mode	DYNAMICS OF ATMOSPHERES AND OCEANS												East Asia is known for its monsoon characteristics, but little research has been performed on the intraseasonal time scale of the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM). In this paper, the extended reanalysis (ERA) -Interim sub-daily data are used to study the surface air temperature intraseasonal oscillation (ISO) of the EAWM. The results show that the air temperature (2-m level) of the EAWM has a dominant period of 10-30 days. Lake Baikal and south China are the centers of the air temperature ISO. An anomalous low frequency (10-30-day filtered) anticyclone corresponds to the intraseasonal cold air. The 10-30-day filtered cold air spreads from Novaya Zemlya to Lake Baikal and even to South China. The ISO of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) index influences the temperature of the EAWM by stimulating Rossby waves in middle latitude, causing meridional circulation, and eventually leads to the temperature ISO of the EAWM. RegCM4 has good performance for the simulation of the air temperature ISO. The simulated results indicate that the plateau is responsible for the southward propagation of the intraseasonal anticyclone. The anticyclone could not reach South China when there was no plateau in western China and its upper reaches. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

Forests constitute pools of terrestrial carbon and are generally considered as global sinks of atmospheric CO2. contributing to attenuating the greenhouse effect. Large amounts of carbon are also stored in boreal lakes, bogs and wetlands, partially released as CH4 and other trace Rases to the atmosphere during the spring and summer months. Human activities in die forest zone are however reducing the size of the carbon pool and climate change is triggering shorter winters and earlier thaw onset, changing the natural equilibrium. Given its global importance, there is a need to map and monitor the boreal zone, and as the changes occur on all from local, regional to global scales, fine resolution information over vast areas is required. The Global Boreal Forest Mapping (GBFM) project is an international collaborative undertaking initiated by NASDA in 1996 as a follow-on to the tropical-focused Global Rain Forest Mapping (GRFM) project [1]. Utilising die L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) on the Japanese Earth Resources Satellite (JERS-1), one of the main objectives of the GBFM project is the generation of extensive, pan-boreal, SAR image mosaics, to provide snap-shots of the forest-, wetland and open water status in die mid-1990's. Mosaics over Canada, Alaska, Siberia and Europe have been generated, available oil the Internet and on DVD free of charge for research and educational purposes. The GBFM project also entails research activities in North America. Siberia and northern Europe, aimed at advancing scientific applications of L-band SAR data in the boreal zone.

Climatic fluctuations as a significant contributing factor for volcanic collapses. Evidence from Mexico during the Late Pleistocene	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Climate oscillations have significantly contributed to the planet's evolution, including volcanic activity. Major glaciations have been considered not only as a triggering mechanism for large magmatic eruptions but also inducing volcano instability. Generally, volcano instability can be inferred from detailed volcanological and structural studies of a volcano and its associated depositional sequence, but the triggering mechanism has been always difficult to infer. In this paper, we present evidence of how climatic variations during the Late Pleistocene could have forced sector collapses of the main Mexican stratovolcanoes and enhanced the mobility of associated massive flows inducing the transformation of debris avalanche into debris flows. In particular, the climatic record based on atmospheric moisture content from robustly dated lake record from Guatemala and a U/Th dated speleothem from New Mexico are used here as indicators of summer and winter precipitation. Depositional sequences associated with Late Pleistocene sector collapses of Volcan de Colima, Nevado de Toluca, Citlaltepetl (Pico de Orizaba) and Cofre de Perote volcanoes are here analyzed. Comparing the timing of the event with the climatic record, a combination of summer and/or winter pluvial conditions could have forced and triggered the failure of already unstable volcanoes, even during glacier advances (as for the Citlaltepetl event). Independent of the main cause of the volcano instability (magmatic or tectonic) it is important to highlight that the climatic factor played an important role in enhancing the volcano instability and promoted the lateral transformation of debris avalanches, which under dry conditions would have affected more limited areas.

Phosphorus in the Selenga River Water and Its Input to Lake Baikal in Conditions of Low Hydraulicity	GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES												Based on hydrological, hydrochemical and hydrobiological studies made during 2010-2016 and considering the previous data, we discuss seasonal and interannual changes in the content of total and inorganic phosphorus on the Russian territory of the Selenga river. The study period is characterized by low hydraulicity of the river (especially in 2015) and short-lasting summer floods in 2012 and 2013. Concentrations of inorganic phosphorus varied within 0-174 g/L, and total phosphorus varied from 28 to346 g/L. Their maximum values are largely due to phosphorous inputs with sewage from economic facilities. It is shown that inputs of pollutants from the Mongolian territory are responsible for the increased phosphorus content levels in the river (as far as the river mouth) on the Russian territory, with corresponding local increases in phosphorus concentrations content manifesting themselves under the influence of anthropogenic factors. The lowest concentrations of inorganic phosphorus are recorded in the spring-autumn period with low hydraulicity and the mass development of the phytoplankton. During floods, high concentrations of inorganic phosphorus are recorded with an increase in flow velocity as well as with input of suspended solids and pollutants from the catchment area accompanied by a dramatic decrease of algal growth. In conditions of a long-lasting low water level since 1996, the Selenga has shown a tendency for a decrease in average annual concentrations of inorganic phosphorus and for an increase in the content level of its organic compounds. It is shown that the inputs of both inorganic and total phosphorus by the river are governed by changes in the water runoff. During the 2010-2016 low water level, the output of inorganic phosphorus with the waters of the Selenga river decreased by a factor of 1.9-4.5, whereas the total phosphorus concentration increased by a factor of 2.9. The structure of phosphorus output to the lake has changed, i.e. outputs of inorganic and organic phosphorus decreased and increased, respectively.

In recent years, climate change has considerablely influenced the timing of ice phenomena in these lakes. The objective of the paper is an investigation of long-term changes and periodicity of ice phenomena in high mountain Lake Morskie Oko (1392.8 m a.s.l.) located in the Tatra Mts. in the period 1971-2020. The study employed the Lomb-Scargle periodogram, linear regression modelling for temporal trends, correlation analysis, parameters of variability, and flashiness index. Periodicity of the duration of ice phenomena (similar to 5.4 y) and ice cover on the lake (similar to 13.5 y) was observed, although both are statistically insignificant. Ice cover duration has been interrupted several times by winter thaws after 1996 whereas no such events had been reported earlier. The trend towards a delayed appearance of ice phenomena reaches 4.0 d center dot decade(-1) (p < 0.001). The observed trend towards an earlier ice phenomena disappearance reaches 5.1 d center dot decade(-1) (p < 0.001). It results in a decline of the number of days with ice phenomena on Lake Morskie Oko at a rate of 9.0 d center dot decade(-1) (p < 0.001). The duration of ice cover on Lake Morskie Oko has been decreasing at a rate of 10.4 d center dot decade(-1). It is attributed to later freeze-up (3.9 d center dot decade(-1), p < 0.001) and earlier ice break-up (5.6 d center dot decade(-1), p < 0.001). An increasing trend of average annual air temperature (0.4 degrees C center dot decade(-1), p < 0.001) in the period 1971-2020 is observed. A statistically significant correlation is recorded between ice phenomena and ice cover (beginning, end, duration), average annual air temperature, average air temperature of three summer months (June, July, August), and average air temperature of the six months period from June to November. Higher air temperature induces growing heat resources accumulated in the lake water in the summer and autumn seasons, potentially causing later initiation of ice phenomena in the lake. There is no statistically significant relationship between maximum ice thickness and any air temperature parameters. Variability of maximum ice thickness appears to have been significantly increasing in the second part of the investigated period (1996-2020).

The lakes were: Wakatipu, Te Anau, Manapouri, Hayes, Mahinerangi and Ross Creek Reservoir. Among the lakes, picoplankton abundance was associated positively with temperature; picoplankton were most abundant in summer and autumn when they attained densities of 108,000-270,000 cells/ml in the oligotrophic lakes. In these lakes, prokaryotic picoplankton was generally an order of magnitude more abundant than eukaryotic picoplankton. Consistent with the hypothesis that picoplankton are more important in oligotrophic than eutrophic ecosystems, there was a weak negative correlation between the density of prokaryotic picoplankton in the lakes and the level of chlorophyll a. The presence of large numbers of chroococcoid cyanobacteria in the guts of Ceriodaphnia dubia and Bosmina meridionalis implies that prokaryotic picoplankton are collected, but not digested, by these species.																			0020-9309						1991	76	4					523	536		10.1002/iroh.19910760405	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19910760405													WOS:A1991HE11500004
J	Arcand-Hoy, LD; Metcalfe, CD				Arcand-Hoy, LD; Metcalfe, CD			Hepatic micronuclei in brown bullheads (Ameiurus nebulosus) as a biomarker for exposure to genotoxic chemicals	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												In order to test whether an in vivo technique for detecting hepatic micronuclei in teleosts can be used as a biomarker for exposure to genotoxic chemicals in the aquatic environment, the frequencies of hepatic micronuclei were determined in brown bullheads (Ameiurus nebulosus) from two contaminated sires (Hamilton Harbour. Black River) and two reference sites (Bay of Quinte, Old Woman Creek) in Lake Ontario and Lake Erie, respectively. Micronuclei were enumerated in the hepatocytes of fish with and without prior exposure to a hepatic necrogen, allyl formate; which was previously shown to stimulate regenerational proliferation of hepatocytes in an in vivo trout model. Bullheads collected in the spring from the Black River had mean hepatic micronucleus frequencies of 1.0 and 0.41 per 1,000 hepatocytes in treatments with and without allyl formate, respectively, which was significantly greater than the mean frequencies of 0.1 and 0 micronuclei per 1,000 hepatocytes in bullheads collected in the spring from the Old Woman Creek reference site in treatments with and without allyl formate, respectively. No micronuclei were observed in bullheads collected in the fall from Hamilton Harbour and the Bay of Quinte in rests with and without allyl formate. Elevated numbers of binucleated hepatocytes in bullheads from the Black River and Hamilton Harbour that were not injected with allyl formate indicated enhanced regenerational proliferation of liver tissue in fish from contaminated sites. These data indicate that monitoring of micronuclei in teleost hepatocytes has potential as an in situ biomarker for genotoxic contaminants but this assay may not be sufficiently sensitive to detect exposures in moderately contaminated locations.

Movements of Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii peelii) in a large Australian lowland river	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												This study of Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii peelii) movements in a large lowland river in south-eastern Australia indicated that the species was not sedentary, but undertook complex movements that followed a seasonal pattern. While there were sedentary periods with limited home ranges and high site fidelity, Murray cod also under took larger movements for considerable portions of the year coinciding with its spawning schedule. This generally comprised movements (up to 130 km) from a home location in late winter and early spring to a new upstream position, followed by a rapid downstream migration typically back to the same river reach. Timing of movements was not synchronous amongst individuals and variation in the scale of movements was observed between individuals, fish size, original location and years.

J	CAUMETTE, P; BALEUX, B				CAUMETTE, P; BALEUX, B			STUDY OF RED WATER DUE TO THE PROLIFERATION OF PHOTOSYNTHETIC SULFIDE-OXIDIZING BACTERIA IN THE LAKE OF PREVOST, A BRACKISH MEDITERRANEAN LAGOON	MARINE BIOLOGY												Dystrophic crises or malaigues with red water were observed in summer in Mediterranean brackish lagoons near Montpellier, France. During July 1976, the photosynthetic sulfide-oxidizing bacteria causing this phenomenon were isolated from the Prevost lagoon. The most important genera isolated from this red water were Chromatium, Thiocystis and Thiocapsa (Chromatiaceae): the predominant species was T. roseopersicina. Water and sediment samples from the same lagoon were collected during the winter season (Oct. 1976 and Jan. 1977) and were enriched with organic matter. The samples were incubated in aquaria under artificial light (800-1000 lx) at room temperature. Eight to 10 days later, red water developed which was similar to that observed in situ in summer. These red waters develop under conditions of anaerobiosis and H2S production. Such conditions are necessary for the growth of Chromatiaceae. Excessive deposits of organic matter in the lagoon water lead to increased O2 consumption and overproduction of H2S, which can be oxidized by photosynthetic sulfide-oxidizing bacteria. This bacteria bloom (causing the red water) removes the H2S, re-establishing aerobiotic conditions in the water of the Prevost lagoon.																			0025-3162	1432-1793					1980	56	3					183	194		10.1007/BF00645342	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00645342													WOS:A1980KB28700002

Chlorophyll a, total seston, sestonic organic matter, Secchi depth, and nephelometric turbidity were determined for each respective spectral measurement. Changes in algal taxonomic structure and abundance coincided with the development and senescence of a midsummer through autumn bloom of Anabaena. Taxonomic structure was more diverse in late winter and spring when Synedra sp. (diatom) and several chlorophytes and dinoflagellates were present. Overall, chlorophyll a varied from about 20 to 280 mu g.L-1, Secchi transparency from 18 to 74 cm, and seston dry weight from 11 to 48 mg.L-1 in February and September, respectively. Particulate matter completely dominated lake water light attenuation. Dissolved organic matter had low optical activity. The most sensitive spectral feature to variation in chlorophyll a concentration was the magnitude of the scattering peak near 700 nm. The 700-nm peak correlated to chlorophyll concentration through the relationships between algal pigment absorption near 670 nm and the cell biomass and surface-related scattering signal in the near infrared. An algorithm relating the height of the 700-nm reflectance peak above a reference baseline between 670 and 850 nm to chlorophyll a was accurate and robust despite large variations in optical constituents caused by both strong seasonality in the algal system and short-term variations in seston from wind-induced sediment resuspension. The present algorithms were successfully used in other systems with different seasonality and productivity patterns. The coefficients of the models relating chlorophyll a and spectral reflectance variables appeared to be ecosystem specific: both the intercept and slope for the models in this study were moderately lower than for several other recently published results. We validated our algorithm coefficients with a second, independent dataset. The standard error for chlorophyll a prediction was +/-28 mu g.L-1.					; Gitelson, Anatoly/G-3452-2012	Schalles, John/0000-0003-4228-1288; 														1529-8817				APR	1998	34	2					383	390		10.1046/j.1529-8817.1998.340383.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1529-8817.1998.340383.x													WOS:000073239700021
J	Bunt, CM; Jacobson, B				Bunt, Christopher M.; Jacobson, Bailey			Adfluvial migration and passage of Steelhead before and after dam removal at a major Great Lakes tributary	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Despite the importance of Great Lakes fisheries and the increasing popularity of dam removal as a method to restore river connectivity and increase fish passage, the adfluvial migration of Steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) has been drastically understudied and only relatively few published studies have examined the impacts of dam removal on fish movement and timing. To help fill these knowledge gaps, spawning migrations of Great Lakes adfluvial Steelhead tagged in spring and fall were monitored for two years before and three years after removal of a dam that partially blocked upstream movement for 100 years. Removal of the dam not only reduced downstream delay and increased passage at the site of the dam removal itself, but increased travel speeds and increased passage at remaining upstream dams for both spring and fall run fish, underscoring the cumulative impact of successive dam passage on fish migration. Fall fish were most impacted by the dam removal and were able to pass not only the dam footprint, but, for the first time, were also able to pass both remaining upstream dams, allowing them to overwinter at locations closer to known spawning areas. For these fish, delay at the footprint was reduced from the order of 100+ days to < 1 hour and the number of days passage occurred compared to the number of days fish were present and blocked increased from 2% to 82%. The benefits of dam removal should ultimately equate to increases in fish production, as more critical habitat becomes reconnected and more fish are able to pass dams and arrive at spawning beds. The observation that fish are likely able to remain in better condition and retain more energy for continued migration and reproduction warrants further study.																			2296-701X					MAR 12	2024	12								1346712	10.3389/fevo.2024.1346712	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2024.1346712													WOS:001190343800001
J	Crump, BC; Hobbie, JE				Crump, BC; Hobbie, JE			Synchrony and seasonality in bacterioplankton communities of two temperate rivers	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The bacterioplankton community composition (measured with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of 16S ribosomal DNA [rDNA]) of two nonintersecting temperate rivers was nearly identical and changed synchronously over 2.5 yr, suggesting that intrinsic controls on bacteria were similar in the two rivers and that seasonal changes were driven by extrinsic factors such as climate. Most potential controls on community composition also exhibited synchrony; these included bacterial production rate (leucine incorporation), water temperature, river flow rate, and a suite of chemical measurements. Temperature and river flow rate were the best predictors of temporal patterns in diversity. However, diversity patterns also correlated with bacterial production and concentrations of dissolved organic nitrogen and nitrate, suggesting that diversity is directly or indirectly influenced by complex seasonal shifts in environmental conditions. Winter and summer communities were somewhat predictable over 3 yr, although these communities were not identical. Two polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified clone libraries of 16S rDNA, constructed with summer samples from each river, were not significantly different and contained typical freshwater bacterioplankton of the beta-Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria, including members of five new freshwater bacterioplankton clusters. However, libraries also included several phylotypes related to bacteria from soil and sediment, indicating the potential importance of allochthonous organisms in river diversity.					; Crump, Byron/ABF-3711-2020	Crump, Byron/0000-0001-7062-1273; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2005	50	6					1718	1729		10.4319/lo.2005.50.6.1718	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2005.50.6.1718													WOS:000233370600002
J	JAKOBSEN, PJ; JOHNSEN, GH				JAKOBSEN, PJ; JOHNSEN, GH			THE INFLUENCE OF PREDATION ON HORIZONTAL DISTRIBUTION OF ZOOPLANKTON SPECIES	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The horizontal distributions of Daphnia longispina and Bosmina longispina in Lake Kvernavatn (Norway) were investigated twice in 1982. In late spring, when populations were small, the two species inhibited the same areas, and they were evenly distributed from the littoral to the pelagic. At high population densities, during mid-summer, the species were spatially segregated, D. longispina being pelagic and B. longispina littoral in distribution. 2. The distribution and feeding of three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) were also studied. The sticklebacks were apparently forced into littoral areas by larger piscivorous predators in the pelagic and they were consequently restricted to foraging primarily on B. longispina, which formed dense swarms during daytime in summer. 3. We suggest that predation and competition influence the spatial distribution fo zooplankton species. The feeding efficiency of fish foraging on high-density zooplankton populations can be reduced by spatial segregation of zooplankton species. Where high local densities occur, due to swarm formation, predation is changed from size-selective feeding to consumption of spatially isolated individuals.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				JUN	1987	17	3					501	507		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1987.tb01070.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1987.tb01070.x													WOS:A1987H580700010

In all reservoirs, higher fluxes were measured in summer than in spring and winter. Low fluxes were measured in alpine reservoirs as compared to run-of-the-river and storage reservoirs. The low temperatures as well as the low organic matter input from the watershed explained this observation. Bubbling was higher in run-of-the-river reservoirs, as compared to storage reservoirs. This was related to a higher ratio between the length of wooded river network in the watershed, and the reservoir surface area. This ratio was considered as a proxy for allochthonous particulate organic matter input per reservoir surface unit and its accumulation in the sediments. In the larger storage reservoirs, this preferential sedimentation area was limited to the river-reservoir transition zone, the extent of which is primarily a function of reservoir hydrodynamic and morphological parameters. Conversely, the long water residence time in deep storage reservoirs favoured greenhouse gas (GHG) accumulation in the bottom water and diffusion and downstream pathways as compared to bubbling. Classical drivers of GHG emissions in large reservoirs partly failed to explain our measurements, especially for bubbling which seemed to be primarily controlled by allochthonous particulate organic matter input per reservoir surface area. This may results from the small size and the large diversity of the studied reservoirs as compared to the larger systems classically used for global estimates.
