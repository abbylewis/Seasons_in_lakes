Mean numbers of ducks shot per hunter on opening morning reflected the numbers of ducks at the sites two to three weeks previously. At Barrenbox Swamp, but not at Lake Cowal, mean bag sizes were inversely related to recent local rainfall. Mean bag sizes on opening morning at Lake Cowal and Barrenbox Swamp did not diminish following reduction of the opening-day bag limit from 20 to 10 ducks per day in 1988. Generally, numbers of ducks and mean bag sizes at Lake Cowal and Barrenbox Swamp have not declined or increased since 1972 (exceptions are increased numbers but decreased bag sizes of Pacific black duck at Barrenbox Swamp, and increased bag sizes of maned duck at Lake Cowal). At neither hunting site were numbers of ducks related to mean bag sizes in the previous year. In summary, hunting does not appear to be adversely affecting numbers of major species of game ducks at either Lake Cowal or Barrenbox Swamp.

This technique, which prospects the entire depth of water wherever it is disposed, allows to make a rigourous sampling strategy by dividing the plan of the lake according to pre-defined topogaphic descriptors considered as poles which creat a differential attraction on the different species of fishes. For each sampling campaign, the simultaneous prospection of all the different attraction poles have been repeated six times. Global, then inter and intra-group correspondence analysis have been made on every seasonal series of catches per unit effort grouped by pole in order to estimate spatial variability, and by sampling sequences in order to analyse the temporal variability. This approach shows a strong logic organization of species around the posts prospected and the dynamic aspect of the attraction of the pre-defined poles.																			0767-2861						1993		329					199	220		10.1051/kmae:1993021	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/kmae:1993021													WOS:A1993ME01600002

Community parameters were followed on a bimonthly basis, during a 27 month period (February 1986 - May 1988). The community is characterized by high values of specific richness and diversity and by a remarkable regularity in the distribution of the specific abundances. These parameters, and also the density and biomass of fish, vary on a seasonal and an interannual basis in relation with the hydrology of the system. In addition, the community is distributed among the different habitats in a heterogeneous way. Factorial analysis of correspondences show that the main source of variability is interannual and concern mainly the most marginal habitats. The seasonal variability has been related to the water level in the system. The results suggest that, in spite of this variability, the community is persistent and stable.																			0065-6755						1993	12	3-4					415	441																WOS:A1993NT90500005

J	VINCENT, WF; DOWNES, MT				VINCENT, WF; DOWNES, MT			VARIATION IN NUTRIENT REMOVAL FROM A STREAM BY WATERCRESS (NASTURTIUM-OFFICINALE R BR)	AQUATIC BOTANY												Large seasonal variation was observed in the removal of nitrate, phosphate and ammonium from a small stream (flow rate: 0.071-0.108 m3 s-1) entering Lake Taupo in North Island, New Zealand. Loss of all 3 nutrients was greatest between mid-Nov. and mid-Feb., the time of maximum growth of watercress (N. officinale R. Br.). Nitrate loss varied markedly throughout the day and night, with maximum removal occurring at midday and minimum removal at midnight. The diel variation in nitrate loss was closely correlated with changes in dissolved O2 concentration in the stream, but with a lag of 4 h. There was no pronounced diel change in rates of ammonium or phosphate removal. In-situ root incubations with watercress demonstrated that the plant is capable of removing nitrate and phosphate at rates that can account for most of the loss of stream nutrients. The diel pattern of nitrate uptake by the adventitious roots paralleled that of nitrate loss from the stream. There was no diel change in the rate of phosphate uptake. As a measure of the assimilation capacity of watercress for nitrate-N, the levels of nitrate reductase in root, stem and leaf tissue were monitored. Enzyme activity was greatest in the leaves and varied throughout the day and night. The implications of the large-scale nutrient removal by watercress are discussed in relation to nutrient loading budgets.

J	Klosowski, S				Klosowski, S			Temporal and spatial variation of habitat conditions in the zonation of vegetation in the late stages of lake overgrowth	ACTA SOCIETATIS BOTANICORUM POLONIAE												The water and substrate properties in the vegetation zones characteristic of the late stages of lake overgrowth were determined. It was demonstrated that the spatial distribution of plant communities conformed with the spatial gradient of habitat conditions. With regard to water properties the largest differences between the zones were found in Mg2+, Ca2+, electrolytic conductivity and NH4+. In the case of substrate the zones differed significantly in Ca2+ total Fe and organic matter content. The water properties varied greatly during the vegetative season in the successive zones. The temporal changes often proceeded at a different level of a given component or factor in most zones. The differences between the zones were, however, maintained. It appears that the plant communities can alter their habitats to a large extent. In the lake studied, the invasion of raised and transitional bog vegetation was observed. The process of dystrophy proceeded from the terrestrialized peripheral parts of the lake to the centre of the lake.																			0001-6977						2002	71	4					329	337																WOS:000179871400009
J	Marxmeier, U; Düttmann, H				Marxmeier, U; Düttmann, H			Reed die-back affects breeding biology of the Great Crested Grebe (Podiceps cristatus) at Lake Dummer (Lower Saxony, Germany)	JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												In the beginning of the 90s the breeding population of the Great Crested Grebe on the hypertrophic shallow Lake Dimmer decreased from almost 400 pairs to about 40-120 pairs. We addressed the question of whether this decrease was due to changes in prey availability or to changes in nesting sites. Fishing catches by gillnet and electrical fishing gear throughout the breeding season indicated that prey availability was not a limiting factor. In particular, lake whitefish were found to occur in high densities. In the pre-laying period the whitefish stock consisted of individuals with 17.1 cm total length on average. In the following periods of hatching and rearing the young, the fish stock was dominated by juveniles of small size. Observations of breeding pairs and parents feeding their young support the hypothesis that prey availability was high: (1) We found no evidence that nowadays clutches are smaller than in the 80s. In 1998 clutch size did not decrease with laying date and first clutches were not significantly larger than second clutches. (2) In hunting for prey fishes for their chicks, adults grebes were very successful. The mode time interval between two feedings did not exceed 20 seconds. With regard to prey size we found no evidence for active or passive selection by the Grebes. Obvious changes in reproductive behaviour were related to the nesting sites. In the 80s most pairs nested in flooded reed beds, whereas in more recently most clutches have been found in water-lilies and flooded beds of calamus and bulrush. This change in nesting sites was apparently caused by the dying off of large areas of flooded reed beds in the last 30 years. In some inlets flooded reed beds completely disappeared. In 1998 the start of laying was clearly related to the nesting site: reed-breeders started significantly earlier than birds breeding in water-lilies and beds of calamus and bulrush. Owing to the change in nesting sites during the last 10 years, we observed a time-shift in the reproduction: today Grebes start laying almost 50 days later than in the 80s. Moreover, we recorded a significant difference in the stability of nests related to the nesting site: nests in reed beds and bulrush had a higher stability than those in water-lilies and beds of calamus. The present findings are discussed in the light of reproductive decisions and reproductive successes.																			2193-7192	2193-7206				JAN	2002	143	1					15	32		10.1007/BF02465455	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02465455													WOS:000173750200002

The range of these values for all the fish sampled were: red blood cells (RBC) 1.7-4.6 10(6) cells/ uL; hemoglobin (Hb) 5.2-15.2 g/dL; packed cell volume (PCV) 27-82 percent; plasma proteins (PP) 4.4-10.4 g/dL; mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 103-320 fL; mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) 9.3-29.2 pg; mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) 16.4-50.3 g/dL; hepatosomatic index (HSI) 0.22-2.9 percent; spleenosomatic index (SSI) 0.006-0.37 percent; and gonadosomatic index (GSI) 0.002-0.67 percent (males) and 0.027-6.8 percent (females). GSI increased with age in both genders, and four of the blood parameters measured (RBC, PCV, Hb, and PP) decreased with age. Whereas Hb, RBC, and MCHC peaked during the reproductive season (January/February), PCV and MCV values were lowest between October and February and highest between May and September. Plasma proteins and MCH remained constant throughout the year. Changes in both gonad and liver weights followed a similar seasonal pattern, with highest values in bass sampled in January/February (spawning). Fish from Knight Farm North had significantly higher RBC, Hb, and PCV when compared to other sites. In addition, bass from Knight Farm North and Lake Apopka had higher PP concentrations in relation to fish sampled from Lakes Griffin and Woodruff. Our results indicate that age, season of the year, and location, are important factors to consider if hematological parameters and organosomatic indices are to be used as indicators of general health in largemouth bass.

For each leech species, 3 cohorts were identified during the study. Prevalence, mean intensity, and relative density levels were highest in G. complanata, and slightly higher in E. octoculata than in H. stagnalis. For each cohort of each of the leech species, there were no clear patterns in seasonal changes in these levels, although there was a slight tendency for increasing values as E. octoculata and G complanata aged, with a decline in values near the end of a cohort. Within each leech population, the frequency distribution of the parasite showed no clear trends as cohorts aged. There was no evidence for parasite-induced host mortality for any of the leech species, or for any adverse effects of the parasite on the attainment of sexual maturity and reproduction.																			0022-3395	1937-2345				DEC	1986	72	6					837	845		10.2307/3281831	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3281831													WOS:A1986G308800003

The area mainly comprises compact and non-vesicular amygdaloidal and chlorophaeitic basalt, red or black tachylitic basalt and volcanic breccias of different kinds. The intake tunnel which uses lake tapping technique for the first time in India is to be pierced under the Koyna Lake in a single blast. Seismic refraction and reflection studies were carried out in the Koyna Lake along two alternate dam alignments and in the area where the lake tapping tunnel opens out to determine the lake-bed levels, probable rock levels and rock quality. The proposed dam is to be constructed for lowering the minimum draw down level for the intake tunnel to generate power even during the lean season. Seismic refraction results revealed a silty sandy top layer on land (Vp=300-900 m/s) and a saturated sand and gravel bed in the river portion (Vp=1700-2000 m/s). Rock was found shallower in the we stern part and deeper on the eastern side with bedrock levels varying from 646 m to 602 m. The compressional wave velocities of the bedrock ranged from 4200 m/s to 5500 m/s which indicated that the rock. was of good quality. Seismic reflection studies revealed three prominent reflectors corresponding to the lake-bed, weathered and good rock. While seismic refraction survey on land delineated the weathered rock (Vp=1000-1400 m/s) the same however, did not delineate the weathered rock underwater due to the poor contrast between overburden and the weathered rock. The depth contours of lakebed and bedrock were drawn. The lake-bed levels varied between 650 m and 612 m while the same for bedrock ranged from 646 m to 602 m. The bedrock levels, correspond to rock having RQD greater than 95% indicating rock to be of very good quality. The rock levels as evaluated by seismic studies correlate well with those inferred from the few boreholes drilled. From the seismic studies it was concluded that rock at site is generally of good quality. Also, the bedrock levels evaluated along two alternate dam alignments are same indicating that there is no difference in foundation level of the proposed alignments.

Special attention was paid to species diversity, weed coverage, distribution, and phenology on inner and outer field edges. Organic farming led to fairly higher degrees of species diversity, to a natural development of weed cover degrees during the growing season due to being cut during harvest time only, not affected by occasional herbicide impacts, and to intensively fructifying weeds. Weeds found on the conventionally farmed field mostly occurred in surrounding habitats, too; while 35 of 46 weed species growing in the organically farmed field were restricted to the field itself. From among the surrounding habitats, only an extensively used meadow with newly planted small trees and bushes was found to be a refugium for arable weed species. Fructification on this area of only 0.5 ha had double the generative reproduction success of the neighbouring 6 ha conventionally farmed barley field. Local weed distributions were used to differentiate between ecological weed groups prefering field, fallow strip, meadow wood habitats, and the ecotones between. Weed fructification on the conventionally farmed field mostly could be completed only at field edges where the barley suffered from failing fertilizers more than arable weeds did from herbicide impacts. Strips adjacent to fields or weedy and grassy edges of hedges and small woods should be mowed irregularly, both to promote annual arable weed species, which prefer low and sparse vegetation during the year, but also to enable fructification of perennial species in another.																			0015-8003					DEC	1994	113	6					325	344		10.1007/BF02936708	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02936708													WOS:A1994QA74500001

The diatomite was deposited in a shallow, eutrophic, slightly alkaline lake with low salinity and turbidity. The deposit consists of well laminated, massive and bioturbated, and dark organic rich diatomite facies which are dominated by Melosira granulata. The deposit is cyclic at three scales; (1) Paired laminae of diatomite and diatomite plus clay the thickness of which varies with a period of 11.6, 23.2, and 51.2 yr, (2) Packets of varves variable thickness composed of 10-25 paired laminae each, and (3) megascopic cycles about 1 m thick of laminated diatomite grading up into massive and/or brecciated diatomite and thence into bioturbated dark coloured diatomite. These cycles are interpreted as: (1) strong annually seasonal variations in temperature and/or light availability, (2) packets reflecting wide variations in solar activity and (3) longer term climatic instability with a period less than or equal to 8 ka which produced cycles we interpret as shallowing upwards variations in the lake levels. On this basis we conclude that strong climatic seasonality existed at this locality during the late Miocene as well as longer term climatic cycles.																			0031-0182	1872-616X				MAR	1990	77	2					127	143		10.1016/0031-0182(90)90129-U	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0031-0182(90)90129-U													WOS:A1990CY04400002

Species richness declined by nearly 50% from dry season values during the rainy season. Species richness was higher in the littoral zone during the dry season, the reverse was the case during the rainy season. Species abundance followed similar trend as species richness. Abundance was closely associated with dissolved oxygen, biological oxygen demand and width of the lake and these in turn varied significantly between seasons. Shannon-Weaver diversity varied from 2.2 to 3.8 bit ind.(-1) and significantly between seasons (p < 0.05).

J	JAMES, RT				JAMES, RT			MICROBIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY OF ACID LAKES IN FLORIDA .2. SEASONAL RELATIONSHIPS	HYDROBIOLOGIA												To determine relationships of chemistry and microbiology in lakes exposed to acid precipitation, three clear and two dark acid lakes on the Katharine Ordway Preserve near Gainesville, Florida were monitored from February 1986 to July 1987. Chemical measurements included Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC), pH, acidity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and nutrients. Bacterial densities, bacterial biomass, bacterial growth, bacterial assimilation of glucose, protozoan densities, and chlorophyll a were also measured. Rainfall and rainfall chemistry data were obtained from the Bradford Forest Acid Deposition station approximately 34 kilometers NNW of the preserve. Although rainfall pH and clear-lake pH were similar, there were no relationships between H+ deposition and clear-lake pH. There were no consistent or significant relationships between clear-lake pH and bacterial densities, bacterial biomass, chlorophyll a, or protozoan densities. Rainfall and acid deposition were both inversely related to glucose assimilation in surface water bacteria of clear lakes, indicating a stress of increased acid loading on the water column bacteria. Using both clear- and dark-lake measurements, a series of significant polynomial regressions between DOC and bacterial densities, bacterial biomass, bacterial growth, protozoan densities, and chlorophyll a were found. This suggested subsidy-stress relationships. As DOC increased to 20 mg Cl-1 the bacteria, protozoans, and chlorophyll a increased, a response to increased availability of substrate. Above 20 mg Cl-1 as DOC increased the bacteria, protozoans, and chlorophyll a declined, a response to increased concentrations of toxic organic compounds such as phenols.																			0018-8158					MAY 10	1991	213	3					227	240		10.1007/BF00016424	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00016424													WOS:A1991FQ25400005

Polytene chromosomes from ovarian nurse cells were examined from mosquitoes of 20 populations, mostly from the southeastern United States but including one population from New York State. In every population surveyed, the heterokaryotype (3L1/3L2) was the predominant type at an unusually high frequency that implied selection for the hybrid condition. The heterokaryotype (3L1/3L2) was present at average frequencies of 72.3% +/- 1.16% for species A and of 73.3% +/- 1.15% for species B. The homokaryotypes, 3L1/3L1 and 3L2/3L2, were present at frequencies of 14.5% +/- 0.91% and 13.2% +/- 0.88%, respectively, in species A, and of 12.6% +/- 0.86% and 14.2% +/- 0.90%, respectively, in species B. Chi-square analyses showed that the relative frequencies of the three chromosome types were uniform across the various populations, thus indicating no significant geographical (clinal) effects for either species A or B. In the one population for which sufficient samples of species B were available (Octahatchee Lake, Florida), there were no temporal effects, and the frequencies of each type remained stable throughout the breeding season over a 2-year period.																			0022-1503	1465-7333				MAY-JUN	1991	82	3					221	227		10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a111069	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a111069													WOS:A1991FV43600007
J	HARRISON, AF				HARRISON, AF			VARIATION OF 4 PHOSPHORUS PROPERTIES IN WOODLAND SOILS	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												Variation in total, organic and available-P contents and phosphatase activity of P-deficient soils of some English Lake District [UK], woodlands of differing vegetative composition [conifer-deciduous trees] were examined in relation to individual woodlands, 2 depths in the soil profile, mull, moder and mor humus types, and different times of the year. Depth in the soil profile was a more important source of variation in the P properties than different woodlands. Soils in individual woodlands differed in their degree of variability in the 4 P properties. Available P contents and phosphatase activities were more variable than total and organic P contents. Available P and organic P contents and phosphatase activity showed seasonal variation. Seasonal variation in available P was almost as great as differences in available P between woodlands. Total and organic P contents showed similar patterns of variation with respect to individual woodlands, humus type and soil depth. Differences in degree of variation within woodlands and differences in degree and pattern of variation of the 4 P properties may need to be taken into account in soil sampling programs of studies comparing soils under differing vegetation regimes. Different interpretations of the variation in the soil P properties were obtained by expressing the data in terms of soil weight (g-1 soil) or soil volume (cm-3 soil), due to marked variation in bulk densities of the woodland soils. Where soils vary in bulk density, soil data should be expressed in terms of soil volume. The P deficiency of the woodland soils is probably associated with the relatively low total P content per unit volume of soil and the high proportion of it which is organically bound.																			0038-0717	1879-3428					1979	11	4					393	403		10.1016/0038-0717(79)90053-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0038-0717(79)90053-1													WOS:A1979HH38700012

Corresponding data from the "downriver" estuarine (piston) core fail to show a QBO-like period but disclose periods of 3.6, 3.8, 7.6 and 19.1 years, some of which may be tidal, though their statistical significance is probably questionable. As a working hypothesis the watershed serves as a large area seasonal precipitation concentrator similar to the case of the Harding ice field and Skilak lake, Alaska. If so, what is witnessed is an equatorial to polar transport of moisture modulated by the equatorial QBO. An alternate model would be based more directly upon temperature, i.e. glacial melt. Combination of these cannot be ruled out. No evidence for solar forcing at an 11-yr period is found in either core, contrary to Skilak Lake, Alaska varve data.																			0031-0182					NOV	1992	98	1					57	65		10.1016/0031-0182(92)90256-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0031-0182(92)90256-5													WOS:000202963700007

The size at maturity was established at 13.4 cm for the females; that for the male was at 16.7 cm. It is shown that the sexes were dominated by females, with a ratio of 1 female to 0.60 male. The gonado-somatic index (G.S.I) was higher in the females than in the males. Females with mature ovaries were caught throughout the year, but males with running testes were encountered only during the spawning season. Two periods of peak spawning were established for the species. These are Oct.-Nov. and May to June/July. The fecundity of the females was estimated, and its relationship to body length and body weight are described. The mode of nest construction was observed and described for specimens kept in aquaria.

One hundred and twenty-seven Oto, and 50 Twa women were measured at the end of the major dry and the major rainy seasons. The 20-39 age groups and the nursing women seemed to be most affected, with a 1.4- kg wt loss being reported among the Oto. Pregnant women did not lose weight during this time as opposed to some observations in the Sahelian countries. Twa women had significantly lower scores for arm circumference and skinfolds than the Oto of the same physiological state, this was probably related to the poorer nutritional and health status of the Twa in the Ntomba villages.																			0367-0244	1543-5237					1984	15	1					13	27		10.1080/03670244.1984.9990806	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03670244.1984.9990806													WOS:A1984TN26100003

This model is preferred for environmental management over other models discussed in the text, because it predicts limited rates of growth as phytoplankton biomass increases, admits simple analytical solution, includes measurements which are relatively easy and inexpensive to obtain and requires no field calibration. Growth rate is limited in the model by the inclusion of an inhibition factor.

J	QUIGLEY, MA; ROBBINS, JA				QUIGLEY, MA; ROBBINS, JA			SILICA REGENERATION PROCESSES IN NEARSHORE SOUTHERN LAKE-MICHIGAN	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The seasonal depletion of dissolved silica to levels that limit diatom production is particularly critical in Lake Michigan''s nearshore zone where diatom biomass is greatest, and where silica regeneration from sediments is not well-understood. Intact, medium-fine sand cores, collected from an 11 m dep site in nearshore Lake Michigan during July-Aug. 1980, released soluble reactive silica (SRS) at a mean rate of 2707 .+-. 122 (SE) .mu.g Si cm-2 yr-1 when incubated in darkness and at 12.degree. C. This measured SRS release was greater than a diffusive flux (270 .+-. 49 (90% C.I.) .mu.g Si cm-2 yr-1) estimated from SRS pore water profiles and physical sediment properties. SRS release from individual cores was not correlated with abundance of most macroinvertebrates (chironomids, pisidiid clams or oligochaetes). A significant (P < 0.05) and inverse relationship between SRS release and Pontoporeia hoyi densities implied that amphipods suppressed SRS release through mixing and burial of a surficial floc layer, where most dissolution of biogenic silica occurs. SRS release rates measured from the coarse-grained nearshore sediments were comparable to rates reported for fine-grained offshore material and further implicate dissolution of surficial biogenic silica as the source of remineralized SRS. Because nearshore areas of Lake Michigan undergo strong seasonal variations in temperature and diatom production, and because significant riverine silica inputs exist, these results cannot be extrapolated on a lakewide, or season-long basis. The data strongly imply that nearshore sediments are an important participant in the Lake Michigan silica cycle.																			0380-1330						1984	10	4					383	392		10.1016/S0380-1330(84)71854-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(84)71854-5													WOS:A1984TY89600005
J	RUTHERFORD, JC				RUTHERFORD, JC			TRENDS IN LAKE ROTORUA WATER-QUALITY	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Fourteen determinands relating to the water quality of Lake Rotorua were examined for trend over the period 1966-1983. A linear regression package was used, but additional manipulations were performed to eliminate markedly non-normal distributions, remove seasonality, compute monthly averages, fill gaps, and correct for serial correlation. Since lake data came from 3 different organizations, with possibly different analytical techniques, trends were calculated over 3 periods separately. Lake quality deteriorated during 1967-1970 largely because meteorological conditions favored lake stratification. During 1978-1983, despite favorable meteorological conditions, quality again deteriorated at the same time as, and probably as a result of, an increase of available nutrient input from sewage effluent. Improved sewage nutrient removal could halt this deterioration.																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1984	18	3					355	365		10.1080/00288330.1984.9516056	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1984.9516056													WOS:A1984TU48400009
J	WHITE, JM; MATHEWES, RW				WHITE, JM; MATHEWES, RW			HOLOCENE VEGETATION AND CLIMATIC-CHANGE IN THE PEACE-RIVER DISTRICT, CANADA	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												A sediment core from a pond on the Alberta Plateau in the Peace River district of British Columbia was studied using pollen analysis and radiocarbon dating. Percentage and influx diagrams were produced, and radiocarbon dates were corrected to calender years to calculate the sedimentation rate. The 231 cm core terminated in clay, and a basal date of 7250 .+-. 120 yr BP was obtained, several thousand years after the recession of Glacial Lake Peace. The formation of the pond is interpreted as resulting from a climatic change, probably a transition from the peak of the Hypsithermal. Zone 1, from 7250 to 5500 yr BP, is interpreted as representing a seasonal slough, with upland vegetation percentages consistent with a boreal forest. At about 5500 yr BP a permanent pond with surrounding sedge wetlands was formed. Vegetation has been essentially modern during the last 3100 yr. Measurements of spruce grains suggest the presence of black and white spruce throughout the pollen record. The formation of permanent ponds and wetlands on the Alberta Plateau at about 5500 yr BP is thought to have been the most important vegetation change of the last 7000 yr, which may have affected faunal and human populations.

J	MALMQVIST, B				MALMQVIST, B			THE SPAWNING MIGRATION OF THE BROOK LAMPREY, LAMPETRA-PLANERI BLOCH, IN A SOUTH SWEDISH STREAM	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The spawning migration of brook lampreys (L. planeri, Bloch) was investigated in a southern Swedish lake and stream system for 2 consecutive years. The nightly variations were analyzed by a multiple regression technique. In one season characterized by frequent rain storms, water level was the most important factor explaining 60% of the observed variation in migration. In the following year, when the migration period was unusually dry, temperature and onshore winds at the mouth of the stream were the most influential environmental variables explaining 50% of the observed changes in behavior. When data were combined for the 2 yr only, temperature showed a significant influence. The critical temperature for the onset of migration was 7.5.degree. C. Size distributions and sex ratios of the migrating lampreys, which are semelparous, indicated that the age distribution was complex and that females were older than males. Migration was essentially nocturnal, but late in the season day migration was also observed. A marking experiment resulted in few recaptures probably because of high predation and/or orientation difficulties.																				1095-8649					1980	16	1					105	114		10.1111/j.1095-8649.1980.tb03690.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1980.tb03690.x													WOS:A1980JL94100009

Corelation of biotic and abiotic factors in lakes of Chikhaldara, Melghat region	BIOSCIENCE BIOTECHNOLOGY RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS												Environmental parameters like temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen and salinity were measured during collection of zooplanktons from Sakkar Talav, Macchi Talav, Dev Talav and Paras Talav in Chikhaldara, dist. Amravati, Maharashtra. The reservoir is used for irrigation and supply of drinking water to the villages around the Chikhaldara taluka. The samples were collected from month of April 2009 to March 2010. The population density was also measured in these months. It was observed that maximum density of the zooplanktons was recorded in the month of February and October, while the minimum density was recorded in the month of April and May. There are abundance of zooplanktons were recorded of the order Protozoan's, Rotifera, Cladocera, Copepoda and Ostracoda. The seasonal fluctuation in population density of zooplanktons is related to the physic-chemical factors and due to the organic pollution in the lake water by adding detergents to the water due to washing clothes in the lake water. In Sakkar Talav various physico-chemical parameters determined that the fluctuation in water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO) and salinity were within the desirable limits. In Macchi Talav, the contamination of water bodies might lead to a change in water that it is unsuitable for fish farming. Several physico-chemical or biological factors could acts as a barrier and adverse effect on the fish growth and reproduction. For that the regulation monitoring of physico-chemical and biological water quality parameters is essential to determine status of water body.																			0974-6455					JUN	2010	3	1					43	49																WOS:000420290100004
J	Pala, M; Yuksel, F				Pala, Murat; Yuksel, Fahrettin			Comparison of the Catching Efficiency of Monofilament Gillnets with Different Mesh Size	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND VETERINARY ADVANCES												This study was conducted in Keban dam lake Cemisgezek region during 2000-2001 fishing season. In the study, the effect of mesh size on catching efficiency was analyzed. For this reason, a total length of 800 m gillnet was used, particularly two monofilament gillnets with 50, 60, 70 and 90 mm mesh size, each being 100 m long. During the research, Cyprinus carpio and Squalius cephalus was indicated with own species names, which are caught on 22 hunting attempts. Barbus esocinus, Barbus capito pectoralis and Barbus mystaceus species regarded as Barbus sp., Capoeta trutta and Capoeta umbla species regarded as Capoeta sp. The most frequently caught species in the research were Capoeta sp. on 50 and 70 mm mesh sizes, Barbus sp. on 60 mm mesh size and Cyprinus carpi on 90 mm mesh size. The species that is least frequently fished on all gillnets was Squalius cephalus. When the catch per unit effort was analyzed taking into account all species, it was observed that with 83.1 g m(-1) catch per unit effort, 60 mm gillnet was more efficient than all other gillnets. This gillnet was followed by 79.9, 41.0 and 31.8 g m(-1) catch per unit efforts for 50, 70 and 90 mm mesh sizes, respectively. In conclusion, it has been found out that in the study region, gillnets with 50 and 60 mm mesh sizes are more effective than gillnets with 70 and 90 mm mesh sizes.																			1680-5593	1993-601X				JUN 1	2010	9	7					1146	1149																WOS:000277120800011

Water samples were taken from shallow wells installed 10-50 m downgradient from 7 septic systems 20-40 yr old. The equivalent volumetric fraction of each sample consisting of undiluted effluent was estimated from Cl- concentration. A Monte Carlo analysis was used to account for the various sources of uncertainty. Movement of diluted septic effluent to the lake was common; transport of > 1% of effluent P through the soil was probable for only 4 of 26 samples. The greatest apparent P movement was associated with persistently saturated conditions.																			0043-1303						1983	55	10					1297	1305																WOS:A1983RN35800017

DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Water samples were collected from Lake Suwa, one of the most eutrophic lakes in Japan, once a month from April, 1979-August, 1980 and analyzed for dissolved organic C [DOC], carbohydrate, protein including amino acids and acetic acid. Molecular weight distribution of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in each of the water samples was also tested by gel-filtration technique using Sephadex G-25. DOC concentration ranged from 1.4-3.4 mg C/l, and varied in close relationship to the seasonal change in the standing stock and species composition of phytoplankton. Diatoms and Microcystis aeruginosa influenced the concentration of DOC. Seasonal distribution profiles of dissolved carbohydrate, proteins, amino acids and acetic acid differed little from that of DOC. Glucose, galactose, xylose, rhamnose, and fucose were found. Extracellular production of polysaccharide(s) by phytoplankton and seasonal change in MW distribution of dissolved carbohydrate and protein were evident. Poly- and oligosaccharides determined the concentration of dissolved carbohydrate. The proteinaceous materials changed their concentration irrespective of MW.

The aim is to study and evaluate the temporal variation of different Hg-dose and lake sensitivity parameters vs. Hg in 1-kg pike and small perch (< 10 g). The lakes were treated with different remedies (such as lake liming) during 1987 in order to reduce Hg-levels in fish. Lake water chemistry has a large seasonal variation but the yearly means is clearly affected by the treatments (mean alkalinity is increased from 0.05 to 0.19 meq*L-1). There is a marked change of Hg in perch 2 yr after treatment; the median decrease is 33%, a further time delay of about 2 yr is suggested for Hg in pike. Among the dose parameters, Hg in material from sediment traps and in water the fraction RIHg seem to be affected by the remedies with an accentuated decrease during 1988, while a slight increase of total-Hg (THg) in water can be observed. A regression model where the Hg content in perch (Hg-pe) is predicted by Hg-dose, pH and lake water retention time is presented (r2 = 0.71, n = 22) as an example of the importance of using time compatible data with respect to the effect parameter (Hg-pe).																			0049-6979					APR	1991	56						169	186		10.1007/BF00342270	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00342270													WOS:A1991GM38200015
J	UNGER, PA; LEWIS, WM				UNGER, PA; LEWIS, WM			POPULATION ECOLOGY OF A PELAGIC FISH, XENOMELANIRIS-VENEZUELAE (ATHERINIDAE), IN LAKE VALENCIA, VENEZUELA	ECOLOGY												Trophic bottleneck, which is a common phenomenon in the pelagic food chains of large tropical lakes, was studied in Lake Valencia, a large and eutrophic lake located in Venezuela. Mechanisms of trophic bottleneck in lake Valencia were demonstrated through two years of population studies of Xenomelaniris venezuelae, a small planktivorous fish that accounts for most of the zooplankton consumption in open water. Major components of variation in abundance of Xenomelaniris included small-scale spatial (0.1-1.0 km, 70%), large-scale spatial (1-10 km, 23%), and temporal (months, seasons, 7%). The population showed a repeated annual cycle based primarily on a dominant cohort recruited during January and February. Spawning in the littoral zone continued throughout the year, but larvae survived only when rotifer densities exceeded 100 individuals/L, which occurred predictably during late seasonal mixing, but only irregularly thereafter. Steady mortality (15%/mo) of spawning fish occurred through predation. Catastrophic, predictable mortality of all fish occurred through anoxia during early seasonal mixing (57%/mo for two months). Xenomelaniris showed a strong ontogenetic shift in diet from rotifers during early development to copepods and Chaoborus during later development. Daily rations ranged from 28% of dry body mass in the smallest fish to 10% in the largest. Although Xenomelaniris was the only planktivore and was capable of consuming all major zooplankton taxa, it consumed only 3.6% of zooplankton production because it was never sufficiently abundant to exploit its food resource fully. Total growth of adult Xenomelaniris (somatic plus reproductive) conformed to the same equation as somatic growth of juveniles; growth potential was diverted increasingly to reproduction as the fish aged. Young adult fish showed 66% assimilation efficiency and 11% growth efficiency. Respiration losses decreased during development as the 0.73 power of body mass. The annual ratio of production to biomass was high (4.0), reflecting food sufficiency, a long growing season, and continuous loss of older fish to spawning mortality. Annual fresh-mass production of Xenomelaniris (31 kg/ha) is a small proportion of primary production (< 0.03%) and of zooplankton production (3.6%); energy budgets show that actual Xenomelaniris production is only one third of potential production given the observed zooplankton production and the measured growth efficiency of Xenomelaniris. The explanation of this trophic bottleneck is mortality, which prevents the population from reaching carrying capacity and thus blocks energy flow between zooplankton and pelagic fish. Although there were three significant kinds of mortality, larval mortality - apparently through starvation - was the explanation of the trophic bottleneck because it restricted the reproductive output of Xenomelaniris, which could otherwise have brought the population to carrying capacity. The trophic bottleneck may be of significance beyond Lake Valencia, in view of the low diversity and abundance of pelagic planktivores in tropical lakes.																			0012-9658	1939-9170				APR	1991	72	2					440	456		10.2307/2937186	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2937186													WOS:A1991FE24800004
J	MASON, CF				MASON, CF			POPULATIONS AND PRODUCTION OF BENTHIC ANIMALS IN 2 CONTRASTING SHALLOW LAKES IN NORFOLK	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												The populations of benthic invertebrates were studied in Alderfen and Upton Broads [England] from Nov. 1971-June 1975 inclusive. Production estimates were made for the last 2 yr. Both lakes are small and shallow. Alderfen Broad was culturally enriched, with a phytoplankton bloom and absence of aquatic macrophytes. Upton Broad was naturally eutrophic, with clear water and a dense growth of Najas marina. Twenty-two spp. or groups occurred in Alderfen Broad, 7 of them regularly. Forty spp. or groups were present in Upton Broad, 17 of them regularly. The greater diversity at Upton Broad was related to the presence of Najas. Potamothrix hammoniensis was abundant in Alderfen Broad (maximum population 22,500 m-2). Chironomus plumosus was also common. At Upton Broad C. tentans occurred and Tanytarsus holochlorus formed seasonally large populations (up to 130,000 m-2). Molluscs, Caenis horaria and Mistacides longicornis were also common at Upton Broad. Annual respiration and production estimates are presented for individual species. The overall production amounted to 99 KJ m-2 and 176 KJ m-2 in the 2 yr at Alderfen Broad. Corresponding values for Upton Broad were 130 KJ m-2 and 273 KJ m-2. Overall P:B ratios were estimated as 2.1 and 1.8 at Alderfen Broad and 2.2 and 3.0 at Upton Broad. Production was higher at both sites in the 2nd year. Biomass and community metabolism remained higher over the year at Alderfen Broad. At Upton Broad biomass and community metabolism was low for most of the year, but was very high from May to July. The significance of these patterns of production to the population of long-lived predators, especially fish, is discussed. A nutrient perturbation in the diverse but essentially fragile ecosystem of a shallow lake such as Upton Broad could result in accelerating eutrophication through positive feedback interactions in the community once environmental heterogeneity is reduced.																			0021-8790	1365-2656					1977	46	1					147	172		10.2307/3953	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3953													WOS:A1977CU67200011

Parasitic juvenile worms leave the host after the midge emerges from the pupa to the flying adult stage. Gross changes induced in C decorus by the parasite were as follows. Parasitized males had wider wings than normal and antennae lacked the plumose condition and also exhibited a reduction of flagellomeres.

Fyke nets were an effective method of sampling the population for marked fish during the spawning season. A total of 20,277 roach were processed during the recapturing period. The population density of roach (.gtoreq. 14 cm) was estimated to be 1,246,458. The growth rate of roach in the lake although relatively poor (von Bertalanffy''s L .infin. for males and females, 22 and 26 cm, respectively) for the species was similar to that recorded in 3 other Friesian lakes. The mortality rate of males was higher than that of females. Logarithmic length-weight regression analyses showed that the value of the coefficient varied both within and between the sexes, that of females being higher (range 3.038-3.375) than that of males (2.760-3.254). Seasonal changes in the size of the coefficient were due to a disproportionate loss of gonad weight in larger fish. The fecundity of the population was comparatively high for the species. The total production of the population was 95 kg/ha of which 39 kg/ha was contributed by fry. In older (.gtoreq. IV) fish the production of females (12 kg/ha) exceeded that (2 kg/ha) of males, due to differences in their growth and mortality rates. The relatively poor performance of roach in Tjeukemeer, in terms of biomass and production was due to a scarcity of zoobenthos and competition from other species of fish. The productive potential of roach in lakes was not high, even though macrophytes and detritus can be consumed in significant amounts.																			0022-1112	1095-8649					1979	15	4					473	498		10.1111/j.1095-8649.1979.tb03632.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1979.tb03632.x													WOS:A1979HV24900014

J	STABEL, HH; CHONDROGIANNI, C				STABEL, HH; CHONDROGIANNI, C			SEASONAL SHIFTS IN THE GRAIN-SIZE OF SETTLING PARTICLES IN LAKE CONSTANCE	WATER RESEARCH												Grain size parameters were studied from particles settling from the euphotic zone of Lake Constance in 1986. Three types of material were recorded throughout the year. They were either dominated by authigenic calcite or were characterized by enhanced proportions of allochthonous minerals. The materials differed in mean size, sorting, and kurtosis and contained unequal proportions of calcite and quartz (ratios Cc/Qz). There was a marked shift in the mean sizes from lower to higher .vphi. values (i.e. from about .vphi. = 6.25 to 6.9) during August due to variations in the grain size of the main constituent, authigenically grown calcite. We suggest that the seasonal changes in the diameters of the calcite crystals were controlled by fluctuations in the contents of lacustrine dissolved orthophosphate.																			0043-1354	1879-2448				FEB	1988	22	2					251	255		10.1016/0043-1354(88)90086-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(88)90086-3													WOS:A1988M343700016
J	HALFON, E				HALFON, E			MODELING THE FATE OF MIREX AND LINDANE IN LAKE-ONTARIO, OFF THE NIAGARA RIVER MOUTH	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												A seasonally averaged (June-November) fate model (TOXFATE) of organic contaminants was used to assess the relative importance of transport, degradation and volatilization processes in the Niagara River and in Lake Ontario near the river mouth. The model predicts concentrations in several compartments, including suspended sediments, water, plankton, and fish. Two contaminants were modelled, Mirex and .alpha.-hexachlorocyclohexane (Lindane). Simulations show that the largest amount of contaminants is usually in the water fraction. About 70% of Mirex is in the water at the mouth of the Niagara River, compared with 99% for Lindane. For these two contaminants, the processes of degradation and volatilization are two to three orders of magnitude slower than the rate of transport through the river and the plume. In the water, the most important process is a change of phase, from the dissolved to the adsorbed state. This change of state is mostly relevant for strongly hydrophobic compounds like Mirex, and less so for Lindane. Simulations were performed for a 40-day period during which fish concentrations did not reach equilibrium with Mirex, but they did with Lindane. Spatial distributions of these contaminants were also predicted and compared with available data.																			0304-3800	1872-7026				SEP	1986	33	1					13	33		10.1016/0304-3800(86)90105-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3800(86)90105-5													WOS:A1986E935200002

The dynamics of thermal stratification limit the growing season to 8 wk at a depth of 6 m compared to 17 wk at 2 m. Light may limit growth at 6 m during the short growing season, but is not limiting in midsummer at 2 m or 4 m. Plants of equivalent size produce 60-75% less biomass [B] annually at 6 than at 2 or 4 m. The seasonally maximal biomass (in mid-Aug.) is equivalent to the annual net production [P] as calculated from periodic inventories of new, old and senescent tissue (thus P/B = 1.0). Uptake of nutrient elements (N, P, Ca, Mg, Na, K) is synchronous with biomass production. Nutrients do not become enriched in the overwintering tissue (52% of the maximum biomass). This species is unusually rich in Zn (1000 .mu.g g dry wt-1), relatively rich in N (2.9% dry wt), but quite poor in P (0.084%).																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1980	10	5					391	400		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1980.tb01214.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1980.tb01214.x													WOS:A1980KL20600002

The study was undertaken near Lake Eacham on the Atherton Tableland in northeast Queensland. Cumulative nitrogen mineralization for 1 year did not differ between forests. It amounted to 265 +/- 13-mu-g N g-1 oven dry soil at the upper position (0-7.5 cm) and 122 +/- 11-mu-g N g-1 oven dry soil at the lower position (7.5-15 cm; mean +/- s.e. for pooled data). Rates were highest during the wet season but were not strongly correlated with moisture content or temperature. Relative nitrification (cumulative nitrate-nitrogen production expressed as a percentage of cumulative nitrogen mineralization) at the upper position was significantly higher in the complex than the simple forest (100% c.f. 88%). At the lower position it amounted to 100% for cumulative data in both forests. Nitrate was the dominant form of inorganic nitrogen in the complex forest but in the simple forest nitrate and ammonium were of similar importance. The association between forest physiognomic structure and nutrient status at Lake Eacham represents a more-general pattern in rainforests of northeast Queensland and further study is needed to ascertain whether results from this study apply more generally.																			0307-692X					MAR	1991	16	1					47	51		10.1111/j.1442-9993.1991.tb01480.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.1991.tb01480.x													WOS:A1991FB84100005

After a 24 h exposure, free (FABA) and hydrolyzable (HABA) abscisic acid and dihydrophaseic acid (DPA) were measured in the plant tops by gas chromatography. Warm-season crops, exposed to 10.degree. C exhibited elevated levels of FABA, HABA and DPA compared to those plants exposed to 25.degree. or 40.degree. C. Among cool-season crops, only peas had higher FABA and HABA levels at 40.degree.

Residues of four insecticides were detected but concentrations of hexachlorobenzene, HCH and lindane in liver did not exceed 0.3 mg kg-1 extractable lipid. Unaltered DDT, or its metabolites DDD and DDE, were found in every sample, almost all as DDE. Levels varied seasonally, with the highest found between May and September. Risk of increased mortality in full-grown birds was negligible but visceral fat of adult females contained DDE levels associated else where with eggshell thinning and breeding failure in a related species. In a separate study, tissues from ten birds were analysed for mercury. Up to 13.6 mg mercury kg-1 dry weight was found in liver tissue but this should not increase risk of mortality significantly.																			0030-6525					SEP	1992	63	2-3					123	127		10.1080/00306525.1992.9633963	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00306525.1992.9633963													WOS:A1992KE01200009
J	LEWIS, WM				LEWIS, WM			COMPOSITIONAL, PHYTOGEOGRAPHICAL AND ELEMENTARY STRUCTURAL-ANALYSIS OF PHYTOPLANKTON IN A TROPICAL LAKE - LAKE LANAO, PHILIPPINES	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												A 15 mo. study of the phytoplankton of Lake Lanao, Philippines, shows that the community is composed of 70 euplanktonic autotroph species, including Cyanophyta (12), Euglenophyta (4), Chlorophyta (44), Chrysophyceae (1), Bacillariophyceae (4), Dinophyceae (3) and Cryptophyceae (2). A comparison of the year-round composition of Lake Lanao phytoplankton with survey data taken in other studies indicates that in Southeast Asia a lacustrine plankton community will most often contain 50-100 euplanktonic autotroph species that reach detectable abundances (> 1/ml) at least once per year. Species-richness appears to be considerably lower in tropical than in temperate phytoplankton communities. In lakes of Southeast Asia, including Lanao, about half the species are chlorophytes, and over half of all species are found in a single integrated aliquot of 1 ml taken at any time of year. Southeast Asian phytoplankton communities have a higher .beta.-diversity than communities of east alpine lakes, but there is a generic overlap of at least 80% between tropical Asian lakes chosen at random. The generic overlap between tropical and temperate lakes is much lower (45%). The taxonomic overlap between tropical phytoplankton communities does not differ detectably between continents, and this is given as evidence for existence of a pantropical phytoplankton assemblage, of which that found in Lake Lanao is representative. A survey of the literature shows that phytoplankton biomass is considerably higher in Lake Lanao and other tropical lakes on average than in temperate lakes, either on an annual basis or during the ice-free season. In Lake Lanao, 13 spp. account for 90% of annual biomass, and 10 spp. account for 90% of the annual number of individuals. A statistical test shows no evidence that dominants are more likely to come from one taxonomic division than another.

At Lake Naivasha, breeding also occurred primarily during April-June. There was no evidence of a consistent seasonal increase in prey abundance during this period, and the timing was not linked consistently to any other environmental changes, such as amount of rainfall, lake water level or transparency, daily photoperiod, or ambient air temperature. Onset of the main rains, however, appeared to be a possible stimulant to breeding readiness in the population as a whole. It is suggested that breeding timing at Lake Naivasha may be influenced by a combination of the subspecies' nearly 12-month endogenous reproductive cycle and an annual trigger through a local environmental factor, possibly the onset of the main rains.																			0030-6525					SEP	2001	72	3-4					149	158		10.2989/00306520109485308	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/00306520109485308													WOS:000172475900005
J	HOLMGREN, S				HOLMGREN, S			PHYTOPLANKTON IN A POLLUTED SUBARCTIC LAKE BEFORE AND AFTER NUTRIENT REDUCTION	WATER RESEARCH												Phytoplankton and water chemistry were studied in a eutrophic subarctic Swedish lake before and after nutrient reduction. Pollution started in 1964 and the lake had received .apprx. 4.5 tons of P by the time the treatment plant was built in 1974. After that, only 18-20 kg P/yr entered the lake. Before nutrient reduction, the phytoplankton consisted principally of: Dictyosphaerium pulchellum var. minutum, Chromulina darlecarlica and Cryptomonas ovata. Two yr after the P load was reduced, Chlamydomonas spp. and Mallomonas akrokomos predominated in the plankton and their dominance was maintained during the period of study. Seasonal average phytoplankton biomass decreased from 11.2 g/m3 in 1973 to 2.9 g/m3 in 1980. Average seasonal total P concentrations decreased from 168 .mu.g/l in 1973 to 74 .mu.g/l in 1980. Average Secchi depth readings increased from 1.3 m in 1973 to 2.1 m in 1980.

Crustacean community development in treated enclosures exhibited no obvious acute or chronic effects from the range of Se concentrations applied. Seasonal changes in zooplankton composition, abundance and reproduction were similar among controls and the 1 and 10 .mu.g Se/l enclosures. Differences in species dynamics observed in the 100 .mu.g Se/l enclosure and in a sediment control enclosure were attributable to biotic interactions rather than Se. Predation appeared to be the dominant factor governing zooplankton community structure in all enclosures. Differences in the number of planktivorous fish among enclosures led to variations in the abundance of predatory Leptodora kindtii, which in turn affected abundances of the small cladoceran Bosmina longirostris.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1985	42	6					1132	1143		10.1139/f85-140	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f85-140													WOS:A1985ALP7900009

Its abundance changed significantly along the exposure gradient (p < 0.001). X. difformis occurred most frequently on shores of intermediate exposure. This distribution pattern could result from maximum growth rates on intermediate-exposed shores or competitive displacement from less exposed, sheltered shores that have little disturbance, high nutrient concentrations and dense vegetation. An attempt was made to distinguish between these 2 mechanisms by growing ramets of X. difformis in the absence of neighbors (potential competitors) along the exposure gradient on a lakeshore and measuring the accumulated biomass after 1 growing season. Biomass varied with position on the exposure gradient (p < 0.01). Maximum biomass was accumulated on shores of intermediate and high exposure. In another experiment, seeds of X. difformis germinated on substrates from both ends of the exposure gradient at several water depths. The proportion of seeds germinating below the waterline on substrates from sheltered shores was significantly lower than the proportion germinating on substrates from exposed shores, suggesting that seeds of X. difformis may have low germination ability on sheltered shores. The shoreline distribution of X. difformis along the exposure gradient is consistent with its physiological response curve along the gradient.

Two lakes with different rates and seasonal patterns of methanogenic activity were compared. There was good agreement (at the 97.5% confidence level) between rates of in situ methane release and initial (lasting an average of 120 h) rates of production measured in vitro in surface (0- to 3-cm) sediment. Evidence from this study, and others, indicated that it is the in situ surface sediment methane production which is primarily responsible for maintaining in situ methane release; thus, the above agreement was what was expected if surface in situ activity was maintained in vitro. When deeper sediment was investigated, the sum of in vitro rates from 0-20 cm (measured in 1.5- to 3-cm intervals) was much higher than in situ release rates, and would have resulted in an impossibly high volume of gas. The extra gas could not have been stored within the sediments. The in situ methanogenic activity of the 0- to 3-cm anaerobic surface sediments could be preserved during removal and laboratory incubation. However, similar treatment of deeper sediment appeared to stimulate methanogenic activity.

Fitting the model to a seasonal data base shows that equally satisfactory simulations are obtained with a variety of parameterizations and regardless of conditions of annual periodicity imposed on the solution. Comparison of model output with long-term observations demonstrates that seasonal verification studies of dynamic models by themselves are not sufficient to diagnose the utility of such models for predicting long-term trends. The uncertainty surrounding the formulation of sedimentation and nutrient regeneration, in conjunction with the sensitivity of models to assumptions regarding dynamic balance between lake concentrations and nutrient loadings, undermines the predictive capability of dynamic water quality models.																			0043-1397	1944-7973					1980	16	1					105	116		10.1029/WR016i001p00105	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/WR016i001p00105													WOS:A1980JN06500010

Planktonic Crustacea were dominated by the true estuarine copepods, Acartia tonsa and Eurytemora affinis and the euryhaline marine copepods Oithona similis and Pseudocalanus minutus. Atypical estuarine forms, confined to a lower fiord-like basin with salinity of 20.permill. were the amphipod Parathemisto abyssorum and the mysid Erythrops erythrophthalma. River flows were highly variable from year to year. Certain basins function as lakes in some years and estuaries in other years, causing extreme zooplankton community fluctuations, and succession patterns dependent on salinity rather than season. On occasion freshwater zooplankters maintained viable populations at unusually high salinities (.apprx. 5.permill.). Vertical and horizontal distributions of zooplankters indicate that the estuary comprises 2 systems: a true estuary in the upper reaches and the surface waters at the lower end, and a fiord in a subsidiary basin in the lower end.																			0160-8347						1983	6	2					142	153		10.2307/1351704	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1351704													WOS:A1983QZ71600006

The technique for calculating mean biomass and variance for the doubling sampling procedure is described. The relationship between stem weight and height was linear for flowering stems, but a logarithmic transformation of weight was used for the non-flowering stem regressions. Growth began in late May and stems reached maximum weight by mid-Aug. Stem mortality (up to 14%) was highest at sites with high stem density, but mortality was limited to small stems at all sites. Total biomass of these stems was < 4% of the peak above-ground standing crop. In nutrient-poor sites, Typha was found on floating organic mats, but in more nutrient rich sites on grounded substrates. Peak above-ground biomass ranged from 456 to 848 g m-2, generally in response to the successional and nutrient status of the oxbow lake.

J	RYDER, JP; SOMPPI, PL				RYDER, JP; SOMPPI, PL			FEMALE-FEMALE PAIRING IN RING-BILLED GULLS	AUK												Female-female pairs of ring-billed gulls (Larvus delawarensis) were recorded attending supernormal clutches (5-8 eggs) on Granite Island, northern Lake Superior in 1978. Female-female pairs complete their clutches usually before the peak of egg-laying in the colony. Supernormal clutches completed after the peak are thought to result from egg-dumping by several unpaired females. Compared to normal 3-egg clutches, laid early in the season, the average hatching success of supernormal clutches was lower (8-20% vs. 80-90%) and over 50% of the embryos showed depressed growth and development. Although the phenomenon of homosexual pairing is likely not recent in ring-billed gulls, as compared to the situation in western gulls [L. occidentalis] the adaptive significance of such pairs is currently unknown.																				1938-4254					1979	96	1					1	5																WOS:A1979GQ20100001

Comparison of 3 methods for in situ determination of daily ration levels indicated the method outlined here and the more complex method of Thorpe yield similar results. The method of Keast and Welsh and derivatives of this method which correct for digestion between sampling periods gave unreliable values that are 50% below the other 2 and, in general, were below maintenance ration levels.

Consumption of eelgrass amounted to 0.839 g C/m2 for the entire Lake Grevelingen, 23% for the birds and 77% for Idotea, respectively. Only 3.7% of the living eelgrass production, estimated at 23 g C/m2 per yr for the entire Lake Grevelingen, was estimated as consumed by macroconsumers during the growing season. A maximum estimate of eelgrass consumption leads to 1.486 g C/m2, i.e., 6.5% of the eelgrass production during the period May-Aug.																			0077-7579						1978	12	2					180	194		10.1016/0077-7579(78)90004-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0077-7579(78)90004-2													WOS:A1978GJ72000004

Primary-form plants were used as inoculum in the quadrats; leaf numbers, fresh weight and percentage cover changes were recorded. These 3 parameters were significantly correlated. The highest individual rates of increase recorded in the lagoon were 51.4%/day for percentage cover, 50.1% day for leaf numbers and 38.3%/day for fresh weight. In the lake, the highest values were 19.0%/day, 25.7%/day and 16.6%/day, respectively. A simple growth model for this species, relating growth rate to water temperature, accounted for 76% of the observed variance in leaf number growth rates in the lagoon. The same model only explained 5% of the variance in the lake, suggesting growth limitations by other factors.

A population explosion took place in 1976. Dynamics, growth and biomass development were studied during 1976 and 1977. One generation a year was observed, with 1976 settlement around Aug. 1, Densities at a 12 m deep station were mostly < 10 m-2, at 2 shallow (1 m) stations numbers increased to 40 to 60 m-2, as a result of immigration. Numbers at 2 3 m stations, with peak values of 200 m-2, showed a cyclic pattern with a minimum in July 1977 due to migratory movements. Biomass increased over the period of investigation. A lowest maximum biomass was found at 12 m (0.16 g Ash-Free dryweight [ADW] m-2) and a highest of 5.0 g at a 3 m station. The lake average in April 1977 amounted to between 1.2 and 2.1 g ADW m-2. The dominant 1976 yr class showed a gradual decline from .apprx. 300 individuals .cntdot. m-2 between 2 and 3.5 m to .apprx. 60 m-2 in water deeper than 10 m. Growth rates were also depth dependent. Within the range of 2-25 m juveniles born in 1976 showed a maximum mean size of 6.8 mm after one growing season at 5 to 6 m depth against only 3.6 mm in deep water. Highest mean values after 2 growing-seasons, i.e. 16 mm, were reached at the 1 m deep stations, which might be inflated by size-dependent immigration. Growth was poor (8 mm) at the 12 m station. Growth rates are similar to Swedish observations, but were reached at 10 to 50 times higher densities in Lake Grevelingen.																			0077-7579						1984	18	3-4					395	417		10.1016/0077-7579(84)90012-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0077-7579(84)90012-7													WOS:A1984ASJ2800012
J	VINER, AB				VINER, AB			RESISTANCE TO MIXING IN NEW-ZEALAND LAKES	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Lake stability (S) calculations quantify the resistance a column of water has to vertical mixing. Data from a selection of New Zealand lakes were used to show a predictive relationship between the seasonal maximum stability (Smax) and mean depth (.hivin.z, volume:surface area). Because of their proportionality, Smax can be substituted for the total annual stability (Stot) for the purposes of lake comparisons, although Stot would be a better ecological parameter if enough data were available. Stability calculations in the euphotic zones of lakes enable useful comparisons to be made regarding growth conditions for different types of phytoplankton, in particular buoyant cyanophytes, and especially in relation to light penetration. An example is given where the degree of thermal stratification (stability) could be related to wind stress energy.																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1984	18	1					73	82		10.1080/00288330.1984.9516031	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1984.9516031													WOS:A1984TC62300009

Landsat satellite data of multispectral scanner (MSS), thematic mapper (TM) and aerial photographs were the main sources of information. Visual image interpretation and field surveys were the methods employed to analyse and map the drainage patterns. The drainage system of the park includes the rivers Dinder and Rahad, their tributaries and mayas (wet meadows), Mayas are a special feature of the drainage system, straddling low-lying basins, river meanders and oxbow lakes. They are the major source of water and green fodder during the dry season (November-June). The spectrum runs from young productive wet mayas to old non-productive dry ones. During the past 2 decades and due to the decrease in the amount of river discharge and rainfall, coupled with repeated fires, the catchment areas of mayas have deteriorated drastically causing many of them to silt up to almost complete dryness. Perennial grasses, for example, have been substituted by annuals. The water and food supply available to wildlife has thus decreased greatly. The study assessed the present condition of the mayas and suggested possible means for improvement and restoring the natural storage capacities of some mayas.

Although productive sites differed from non-productive sites in terms of pH, N and potential N mineralization, redox potential was considered to be the major factor which distinguished these site classes. Productivity of wild rice in commercial stands could not be consistently correlated to sediment nutrients. However, growth appeared to be restricted in strongly reduced sediments and sediment Eh is considered to be a rapid, accurate method of estimating site potential. Good growth is expected if Eh is above -150mV while poor growth is expected when Eh drops below -200 mV. Eh values of sediment samples changed as storage time increased. It is therefore recommended that Eh is recorded on-site.																			0032-079X					DEC	1990	129	2					109	116		10.1007/BF00032402	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00032402													WOS:A1990EV07400001

Mapping the fresh-water-salt-water interface in the terminal moraine of the Bering Glacier	BERING GLACIER: INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES OF EARTHS LARGEST TEMPERATE SURGING GLACIER	Geological Society of America Special Papers											The principal objective of this investigation was to delineate the geometry of the subterranean discharge of fresh melt water from Vitus Lake (VL) at the terminus of the Bering Glacier into the Gulf of Alaska (GoA). It was hypothesized that during the seasons where the glacier was exhibiting melting, increases in VL elevation would push freshwater through the moraine toward the GoA. Because of the proximity to the GoA, intruded seawater would lie below the freshwater. The fresh and salt waters were delineated by measuring variations in apparent resistivity-as a proxy for salinity-with depth using two-dimensional electrical resistivity tomography at a variety of locations between the GoA and VL. The surveys were conducted using Schlumberger and pole-dipole arrays, along with temporal surveys to examine tidal effects. The results of field surveys conducted in August 2007 and 2008 showed that an interface between the fresh and salt water exists within the moraine at depth and that the interface is deeper progressing from the GoA toward VL. Although the fresh/salt water interface was readily apparent proximal to the GoA, a distinct interface was not apparent closer to VL. The inability to measure a distinct interface could be due to depth limitations (similar to 68 m) for the maximum array length (330 m) and/or mixing of fresh and seawater due to the seasonal effects on melting, which would likely result in seasonal changes in the interface.

Air-sea interactions of semi-volatile organic compounds in the tropical environment of Southeast Asia	ERCA 9: FROM THE GLOBAL MERCURY CYCLE TO THE DISCOVERIES OF KUIPER BELT OBJECTS	EPJ Web of Conferences				Conference on European Research Course on Atmospheres (ERCA 9) - From the Global Mercury Cycle to the Discoveries of Kuiper Belt Objects	JAN 11-FEB 12, 2010	Grenoble, FRANCE	European Res Course Atmosphere (ERCA)				Major urban and industrial centers increase loadings of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) to proximate sea waters through riverine transport, atmospheric deposition via dry particle deposition, wet deposition, and air-sea gas exchange. In addition to acting as sinks for SVOCs, oceans can act as sources of SVOCs to coastal atmospheres and play important roles in the global biogeochemistry of SVOCs. Particle-sorbed SVOCs can settle to the ocean surface by dry particle deposition, a uni-directional advective transport process from the atmosphere to the water, the removal rate by which is a function of the physical and chemical properties of the aerosols and bound pollutants, meteorological conditions and surface characteristics. In addition, SVOCs are removed from the atmosphere and transported to the waters by precipitation scavenging of atmospheric vapors and particles, which are incorporated into the rain within or below the clouds. After SVOCs are deposited into the bulk seawater, water-column partitioning can affect the distribution of pollutants between the dissolved aqueous and the solid phases and eventually impact the fate of these compounds in oceans. Other than the abovementioned processes, air-sea exchange can make SVOCs diffuse across the air-sea interface; however, the sea surface microlayer (SML), a unique compartment at the air-sea boundary defined operationally as the upper millimeter (1 similar to 1000 mu m) of the sea surface, has large storage capacity to delay the transport of SVOCs across the interface. This article reports the dry particle deposition and wet deposition of selected SVOCs based on an extensive set of yearly data collected in Singapore. Singapore, a representative country of Southeast Asia (SEA), is a small but highly developed island with dense industrial parks in the Southwestern part, where the terrestrial sources affect the surrounding coasts. In this study, Singapore's Southern coastline was chosen during the Northeast monsoon season to evaluate if this coastal area acts a sink or source for selected SVOCs via air-sea diffusive exchange as well as to investigate the SML enrichment effect.

The collection was done during two seasons of the year, dry (January to May) and rainy (June to October). The microorganisms were subjected to a dissection for the extraction of the intestine tube, as well as the gonads, siphons and gills tissues. The parasitological study was done by microscopy examinations of the intestinal content using a temporary dye of lugol and fixed dyes of ferric hematoxiline and kinyoun. The tissues were evaluated histological with the dye of hematoxiline-eosine. From the total amount of mussels collected 42% were parasitized in the intestinal content, with species of clinical concern for the human being like the following protozoa: Complex Entamoeba histolytica/dispar, Entamoeba coli, Entamoeba hartmanni, Giardia lamblia, lodamoeba spp., Blastocystis spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. The cystic stage was dominant in those species. Strongyloides stercoralis was recovered among the helminths. In regard to the season of the year, it was observed a higher presence of parasites in mussels collected during the dry season (50%) while in the rainy season was 34%. The species Entamoeba histolytica/dispar and Entamoeba coli were the most abundant, 45 and 30% (dry season) and 26% and 19% (rainy season), respectively. The presence of these parasites responsible for some gastrointestinal illness in a fish product with a high demand represents a warning for the governmental entities about its pathogenic potential and a worry for its sanitary control.																			0798-2259					JAN-FEB	2010	20	1					7	16																WOS:000274913100002

Quickly and accurately monitoring the status of vegetation growth and evolution has certain reference meaning in the socio-economic constructions and ecologic studies. Remote sensing is an effective measure to monitor vegetation at regional and global scales. Taking the sensitive area to the global climate and environmental change, Lake Baikal and Siberia, the present study aims to explore the response of vegetation to the climate changes. The data of monthly NDVI / MODIS data, with a spatial resolution of 0.05 deg from 2003 to 2008 were used in this study. The results showed that the yearly variations of NDVI were well corresponding to the growth and decline of vegetation and seasonal changes, which showed obvious phenological phenomena. Correlation analysis presented that with increasing in temperature and precipitation, NDVI increased gradually and vegetations grew well. Moreover, the influence of the precipitation on vegetation was slightly lower than that of the temperature. From 2003 to 2008, the change of NDVI showed a gradual upward trend except the low value in 2006. In the growing seasons, NDVI from 2003 to 2008, roughly showed an upward trend; in non-growing seasons, NDVI showed a roughly linear downward trend. The spatial distribution of NDVI in the west Lake Baikal was relatively lower, and the highest value appeared in the north, followed by the south and east. Different vegetation types emerged in the different NDVI values. NDVI of the tundra was the lowest, followed by scrub and agricultural land, the NDVI values of the wetlands and grassland were relatively high, and the NDVI value of forest lands was the maximum.

Although forgotten today, during the eighteenth and late into the nineteenth century, maple sugar served as the primary sweetener used by American families in food preparation, particularly in the northern half of the country. Maple sugar processing became an integral part of farmstead operations in the Midwest, Northeast, and Great Lakes regions during this period. Sugar's value extended beyond a farm family's subsistence needs, because as a craft product it provided extra income during the off-season. While some historical accounts of maple sugar and syrup production in America exist, little if any physical remains of these early sugar furnaces and/or camps are documented. The results of the excavations at the Petticrew-Taylor farmstead (33MY819) fill this information gap for a maple sugar camp and stone furnace dating to the 1840s to the 1860s in southwest Ohio. They provide important new details on artifacts associated with this site type, perspective on the spatial use of the landscape, and the layout and physical attributes of an early furnace style that represented the experimental and transitional phase to the modern day evaporator.																			0146-1109	2327-4271					2010	35	2					133	166		10.1179/mca.2010.008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1179/mca.2010.008													WOS:000217718900002

The model was built by combining the US EPA MM5/MCIP/SMOKE/CMAQ modelling system with a dynamic air-soil exchange model, PEM (Pesticide Emission Model), which was developed by Canadian ORTECH Environmental Ltd. The combined model accounts for the important physical and chemical processes governing the behaviour of the SVOM in both the soil and the atmosphere Hourly outputs from the modelling system include SVOM emission from the soil, its concentrations in both the gas phase and on atmospheric particulate matter and its wet and dry deposition to terrestrial and water surfaces. The CMAQ system used the CB4 mechanism and simulated common pollutants such as NOX, VOCs and SO2, which interacted with the SVOM. The model was tested by simulating the emission, transport, chemical reactions and deposition of toxaphene, a persistent, bio-accumulative, toxic pesticide. Although banned more than 20 years ago in North America, significant residues remain in the soil and these continue to be emitted slowly into the atmosphere. The model was evaluated from January I to December 31, 2000 in a domain that covers most of North America. Satisfactory agreement was obtained between the model predictions and measurements for: (a) daily-average toxaphene air concentrations, (b) fraction on atmospheric particulate matter, and (c) annual wet and dry deposition into Lake Ontario and the seasonal variations of these depositions.																			1871-465X		978-90-481-3810-4				2010							181	+																WOS:000280347800031

The lake is the largest at the Balkan and has a surface area which fluctuates seasonally from 370 to 600 km2. Although its precise origin is unknown, the lake probably formed during the Tertiary and/or Quaternary periods by dissolution of limestone in an active tectonic basin. The present day lake, a subtropical body of water lying 5 m above sea level, has a 5490 km2 drainage basin.The area of Skadar Lake basin and the lake itself, with all their specific features, was and still is a challenge for various researchers. However, in spite of all that, the water status of the Skadar Lake has not been defined in the light of "EU Guideline for water" .Regarding it, in this work are emphasized the basic aims of aforementioned guideline, with retrospective view on their practical implementation. The available database of the current monitoring of the Skadar lake waters is shown in this work in order to distinguish the necessity for operative monitoring in the direct lake basin and research monitoring of the Skadar Lake waters, according to defined elements.The processed data show the impact of pollution sources in the basin (waste waters in the settlements and industries, where the Aluminium plant in Podgorica is dominant and uncontrolled usage of fertilizers) on Skadar Lake waters quality, but it is not still enough to define the Skadar lake waters status according to elements from the Guideline.

This study measured the fluxes of carbon dioxide and methane simultaneously by opaque static chamber-gas chromatography technique for typical wetland vegetation ecosystems in the growing season. In view of the advantages both in temporal and spatial, HJ-1 satellite images were chosen as the data source for vegetation cover classification and area estimates. And based on the areas in different vegetation, carbon flux for the entire study area was estimated during the growing season.

Weak seasonality was apparent for Chara fibrosa at 1.8 m, Elodea canadensis, Isoetes alpinus, and Chara globularis. The biomass of other species did not appear to be directly related to annual changes in solar radiation and water temperature. Annual growth for six species was estimated from annual changes in aboveground biomass and ranged from 296 mg C m-2 day-1 (for E. canadensis) to 17 mg C m-2 day-1 (for Chara corallina). The growth of two species was also determined using short-term measurements of stem and branch length and gave estimates of 177 and 545 mg C m-2 day-1 for E. canadensis at two sites and 97 mg C m-2 day-1 for Myriophuyllum triphyllum.																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1987	21	2					215	221		10.1080/00288330.1987.9516217	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1987.9516217													WOS:A1987M134600005

It is subjected to large fluctuations in salinity and dissolved oxygen on a yearly cycle. Corbula trigona occupies the whole lake. The succession of cohorts was investigated during the successive years, and showed: a continuous recruitment in the north of the lake, with a maximum during the rainy season. This is the zone where fresh water flows in and where salinity is lowest. A recruitment during the rainy season in the south, with a complete interruption and even elimination of the population during the dry season. Salinity then reaches its highest level owing to the influence of sea water and oxygen its lowest level in the lake. The use of the Battacharya method for discriminating cohorts is discussed.																			0030-1299	1600-0706				MAY	1986	46	3					292	302		10.2307/3565826	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3565826													WOS:A1986C437800003
J	BLABER, SJM				BLABER, SJM			FOOD AND FEEDING ECOLOGY OF MUGILIDAE IN ST LUCIA LAKE SYSTEM	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY												The diet and feeding interrelationships of 10 spp. of Mugilidae [Mugil cephalus, Liza alata, L. dumerili, L. macrolepis, L. tricuspidens, Myxus capensis, Valamugil buchanani, V. cunnesius, V. robustus, V. seheli] were studied over a 2 yr period in the St. Lucia lake system of South Africa. Qualitative stomach analyses were performed on over 1000 fish of more than 5 cm (standard length). All were soft bottom substrate feeders ingesting inorganic particles mixed with food items. The food of most species was the same and consisted of Assiminea bifasciata, foraminifera, the large centric diatom Aptinoptychus splendens, small centric and pennate diatoms, and filamentous algae. Individual species of mullet differed in the size of inorganic particles ingested and exhibited marked sand grain size preferences. The consumption of the various food items may have depended upon their occurrence on substrates of the preferred particle size. There was no apparent change in diet and particle size preference according to age in any of the species and no seasonal variation was recorded in the diet. Interspecific competition for food was probably reduced by substrate particle size selection and perhaps by differences in feeding periodicity. Where there was an apparent overlap in diet, as in the case of A. bifasciata, on substrates of the same size then there was a superabundance of the food organism which served to minimize competitive interactions.																			0024-4066	1095-8312					1976	8	3					267	277		10.1111/j.1095-8312.1976.tb00249.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1976.tb00249.x													WOS:A1976CC55600005

Gams was isolated during three growing seasons from the stems, leaves and roots of Eurasian water milfoil (M. spicatum L.) that grew submerged in University Bay of Lake Mendota, Wisconsin [USA]. Despite substantial variation, an overall trend suggested more frequent incidence of this fungal-plant association as the season progressed. Surveys of 8 other Wisconsin lakes located in 3 drainage basins showed this relationship to be of general occurrence. A. curvulum occurred with seeds and, more commonly, with vegetative fragments of milfoil. Anatomical evidence from sectioned or fractured milfoil cells, scanning electron microscopy of stem and leaf surfaces, and plating of surface-disinfested tissue pieces indicated that Acremonium grew both epiphytically and endophytically. Healthy plants harbored the fungus, which was apparently eliminated by immersion of shoots in a solution of the fungicide thiabendazole. If milfoil was stressed by environmental or mechanical manipulations, proliferation of A. curvulum accompanied decline of the plant. Healthy, Acremonium-free, cultured milfoil immersed in a conidial suspension developed systemic basal necrosis that spread acropetally to involve about two-thirds of the tissue within 1 wk. Dry weight and shoot elongation of inoculated, diseased milfoil were slightly less than those of control plants, although new growth was usually initiated from adventitious buds within 3-4 wk. Recovery of infected plants was promoted somewhat by thiabendazole.																			0008-4026						1982	60	7					1216	1221		10.1139/b82-154	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b82-154													WOS:A1982PC17600025
J	MOSHA, FW; MUTERO, CM				MOSHA, FW; MUTERO, CM			THE INFLUENCE OF SALINITY ON LARVAL DEVELOPMENT AND POPULATION-DYNAMICS OF ANOPHELES-MERUS DONITZ (DIPTERA, CULICIDAE)	BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Variations in density of adults of A. merus Doen. in Jimbo Village on the Kenya Coast were correlated both with rainfall and with salinity at their breeding sites. Densities started to increase at the beginning of the rains when several breeding sites were formed. This was followed by a decline in numbers resulting mainly from the decrease in salinity in the semi-permanent breeding sites. A 2nd rise occurred after the end of the rains, corresponding with an increase in salinity in the semi-permanent breeding sites due to evaporation. Peak density coincided with salinities of 30-50% sea water in the breeding sites. Laboratory breeding experiments showed that the larvae were usually capable of completing development in 0-100% sea water, with optimum development at 0, 40 and 60% sea water. Failure to complete development in 100% sea water at certain periods of the year indicated that there could be some seasonal variation in salt tolerance. The larvae were also found to complete development in alkaline saline water collected from an inland location around Lake Jipe in Kenya. The LC50 of sea water for 1st and 4th-instar larvae after exposure for 2 h were 135.0 and 930.0%, respectively. First-instar larvae were less tolerant of NaCl than of sea water of equivalent strength. The LC50 of NaCl for 1st-instar was only 102.5% sea water equivalent. In tests against 1st-instar larvae larvae of other soluble chemical salts normally present in sea water, the highest LC50 (122.0 g/l) was of sodium sulfate and the lowest (10.5 g/l) of potassium carbonate.																			0007-4853	1475-2670					1982	72	1					119	128		10.1017/S0007485300050331	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007485300050331													WOS:A1982NH50200011
J	REINERTSEN, H				REINERTSEN, H			THE EFFECT OF NUTRIENT ADDITION ON THE PHYTOPLANKTON COMMUNITY OF AN OLIGOTROPHIC LAKE	HOLARCTIC ECOLOGY												An investigation was performed during 5 yr (1974-1978) in the oligotrophic Lake Langvatn, central Norway. In 1975 and 1976 the lake was enriched with a commercial fertilizer. In 1975 increase in phytoplankton biomass was first recorded more than 3 wk after the fertilization started, despite a near 5-fold increase in the primary production after fertilizer application. The mean seasonal biomass increased from .apprx. 3500 mg wet weight m-2 in 1974 to 4400 mg in 1975. In 1976 the biomass increased to near 9600 mg m-2 and the seasonal primary production to 49.0 g C m-2 (22.2 g C in 1975), despite a reduction in the nutrients added. Chrysophytes constituted the largest share of the seasonal algal biomass in all years, but in fertilization periods cryptophytes dominated in 1975 and diatoms, chlorophytes and cryptophytes in 1976. The highest biomass turnover rate was recorded during a period of cryptophyte dominance. The different biomass and production development in the fertilization years may be explained by change in the consumer level.																			0105-9327						1982	5	3					225	252																WOS:A1982PM11500002
J	KUSHLAN, JA				KUSHLAN, JA			POPULATION ENERGETICS OF AMERICAN WHITE IBIS	AUK												The white ibis [Eudocimus albus] population nesting in the fluctuating water ecosystem of S Florida [USA] numbered up to 62,000 birds and used several nesting habitats including islands in large lakes, the vast freshwater marshes of the Everglades and coastal estuaries. Periodic reproduction at large inland colonies, accounting for 93-98% of the nesting birds, sustains the population at its current level, but smaller, more consistantly successful coastal colonies provide recruitment during years of inland nesting failure. Clutch size, brood reduction pattern and energy requirements showed intraregional variation. Clutch size differences may be related to habitat, with lowered clutch sizes along the coast. Despite clutch size differences, the number of young fledged was similar in different colonies. Intraregional variation in timing of brood reduction resulted in differences in the energy required for nesting. The daily energy expenditure of white ibis was estimated from the time-activity budget and multiples of measured metabolic rates. Although existence metabolism was similar to that predicted by Kendeigh''s (1970) regression, daily energy expenditure was considerably below that predicted by extrapolating King''s (1974) regression, suggesting a slower increase of DEE [daily energy expenditure] at higher body weights. The white ibis consumed about 21% of its body weight daily, similar to that found in other studies of ciconiiformes. The energy required to raise a brood of young was 9.2-9.9 .times. 103 kcal. The nesting population expended 930 and 640 .times. 106 kcal during 1972 and 1973, respectively. Over 70% of this energy was derived from the Everglades and over 90% from inland habitats. Contrasted with the wood stork, the smaller size and shorter nesting cycle enables nesting white ibis to support 11 times the population on 1.1 times the energy. The ability of smaller birds to maintain higher populations on a given resource base may supply a competitive advantage during times of intense resource-based selection. Together the south Florida populations of white ibis and wood storks require 1.9 billion kcal/nesting season and are important determinants of energy flow in the wetland ecosystem.																				1938-4254					1977	94	1					114	122																WOS:A1977CW06700013
J	AMARASINGHE, US; PITCHER, TJ				AMARASINGHE, US; PITCHER, TJ			ASSESSMENT OF FISHING EFFORT IN PARAKRAMA SAMUDRA, AN ANCIENT MAN-MADE LAKE IN SRI-LANKA	FISHERIES RESEARCH												As in most artisanal fisheries, assessment of fishing effort is crucial to the management of the artisanal fishery of Parakrama Samudra, an ancient man-made tropical lake in Sri Lanka. Since there were few similarities between alternative ways of expressing effort for the grill-net cichlid fishery in the lake, this study aimed to find the most effective formulation of catch per unit effort (CPUE). The variability of preliminary estimates showed that, before analysis, the data needed to be stratified for different seasons with low and high water levels, and for three geographically distinct areas of the lake. Standardised catch per man was higher in boats operated by smaller numbers of fishermen, but catch per net did not change with the number of nets per boat, and is therefore recommended as the best measure of CPUE. The measure of fishing effort also needs to take account of fishermen who increased their catch by a water-beating technique. The incidence of beating varied with season and area, but could account for a significant portion of the catch. The highest catch efficiencies derived from one-man boats using this technique. Using this method of assessing effort, total annual yield from Parakrama Samudra was estimated at about 120 kg ha-1, a lower value than previously reported.					; Amarasinghe, Upali/AAI-7435-2021	Amarasinghe, Upali S./0000-0002-0465-6950; 													0165-7836	1872-6763				DEC	1986	4	3-4					271	282		10.1016/0165-7836(86)90008-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0165-7836(86)90008-1													WOS:A1986F954700008
J	MORGAN, MD				MORGAN, MD			THE EFFECT OF ALTERED PH ON ZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITY STRUCTURE IN A DISTURBED NEW-JERSEY PINE-BARRENS POND	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												The role of pH in controlling crustacean community structure (species composition and abundance) in Nescochague Lake, a disturbed New Jersey Pine Barrens pond, was experimentally investigated using in situ enclosures. Four experimental treatments were tested: acidification to pH 4.4, alkalinization to pH 7.4, alkalinization to pH 7.8 using a weak NaHCO3 buffer, and a control (pH 6.3). Chl a and total P did not change as a result of the treatments. Zooplankton species composition did not respond in any consistent manner to the altered pH. All treatments were dominated by the same five taxa: Bosmina coregoni, Ceriodaphnia sp., Simocephalus sp., Chydorus sp., and cyclopoid copepods. There were also no significant alterations in the abundance patterns of the dominant taxa in response to changing pH. Work at other locations has shown that pH changes from 4-8 have a dramatic impact on the zooplankton community. The failure of zooplankton in Nescochague Lake to respond to these pH changes confirmed earlier work that suggested these species were pre-selected by diurnal and seasonal fluctuations of pH to be composed of only acid tolerant forms. Thus, pH had virtually no effect on these species over the ranges tested.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				DEC	1986	3	4					467	476		10.1080/02705060.1986.9665139	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1986.9665139													WOS:A1986F353500004

Phytoplankton production was measured during 1981-82 in Bahia de Puno, a large polymictic system that is part of Lake Titicaca in the tropical Andes (Peru-Bolivia). Photosynthesis followed a weak seasonal pattern through each 12-month cycle but the largest variations occurred between years. 2. The large temporal variations in productivity appeared to be controlled by biological events rather than by the direct effects of seasonal or aseasonal physical processes. Major shifts in production over the 2-year period were attributable to the proportional abundance and activity of N2-fixing blue-green algae. Production was uncorrelated with the seasonal radiation cycle. 3. In vivo fluorescence and photosynthetic assays revealed large changes in phytoplankton community structure over time and depth. The shifts in vertical structure were associated with changes in transparency and water column stability. Physiological as well as floristic effects dictated the variations in fluorescence per unit chlorophyll .alpha.. 4. An anlaysis to twenty-seven primary productivity data sets from different lattitudes showed that Bahia de Puno resembled other tropical lakes in its relatively weak coupling between algal photosynthesis and seasonal variations in light. Productivity in the temperate zone correlated with the annual cycle of incoming radiation while the tropical production data did not. For many of the tropical lakes, but few temperate lakes, the between-month variance in primary production was significantly higher than the between-month variance for incoming radiation. There was a significant positive relationship between maximum production variance explained by light (maximum r2 for each data set) and latitude. 5. As in many tropical lakes, Bahia de Puno experiences moderately large variations in algal photosynthesis. The muted seasonal cycle of light explains only a small portion of the total variation in productivity, and other factors such as weather-related events are disproportionately important.

J	COULTER, GW				COULTER, GW			BIOMASS, PRODUCTION, AND POTENTIAL YIELD OF THE LAKE TANGANYIKA PELAGIC FISH COMMUNITY	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The Lake Tanganyika pelagic fish community consists of 2 short-lived clupeid species, of which Stolothrissa tanganicae is dominant, and 4 much larger, long-lived Lates spp. Purseseine catches in previously unfished areas contained approximately equal amounts of clupeid prey and Lates predators. The annual production[P]/mean biomass [B] ratio for Stolothrissa is 3.5-4, which approximates the instantaneous mortality rate. Predator P/B ratios probably are < 1. Prey fish biomass is .apprx. 230 kg/ha, and production is .apprx. 700 kg/ha per yr in the north of the lake (Burundi). Even in intensively fished areas, most prey production probably is converted to predator tissue. Without predators, potentially harvestable clupeid production in the Burundi sector would theoretically be 350 kg/ha per yr, which extrapolates to 1.1 million tons/yr for the lake. Purse-seining removes Lates spp. faster than clupeids, leaving more clupeid production for yield. Fishery models should attempt to correlate variations in Lates biomass to clupeid productivity. Limits to potential clupeid yield might be indicated by quantitative equilibria with natural predators, but it is unlikely that present fishery methods could closely simulate natural predation. With increasing dependence on clupeid species, the fishery may become more seasonal and more susceptible to annual environmental fluctuations. These and other African data strongly suggest that fish production and potential yield usually are higher in tropical than in temperate fresh water. Predators are more prominent in tropical fish communities because of relatively high productivity of prey fish.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1981	110	3					325	335		10.1577/1548-8659(1981)110<325:BPAPYO>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1981)110<325:BPAPYO>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1981LU90100002
J	FREMPONG, E				FREMPONG, E			DIEL VARIATION IN THE ABUNDANCE, VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION, AND SPECIES COMPOSITION OF PHYTOPLANKTON IN A EUTROPHIC ENGLISH LAKE	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Diel variation in the phytoplankton community was studied in a eutrophic lake, Esthwaite Water, during 8 sampling periods between June 1977-Sept. 1978. The abundance of different species of alga in the phytoplankton was recorded and the effects of environmental conditions (light flux, wind-induced water movements, dissolved O2 and thermal stratification) on these were studied. The seasonal variation of environmental factors, such as thermal and density stratification, largely controlled the size of the diel variations in biomass concentrations. Under strongly stratified conditions and with little turbulence the amplitude of the diel variations increased and the influence of many factors was restricted to the upper water layers. High daytime light flux influenced the distribution of the dominant motile algae. Sub-surface population maxima under high surface light flux were also observed for 2 buoyant species, Anabaena flos-aquae and A. solitaria. Loss or accumulation of phytoplankton at the sampling site by lateral transport was associated with wind-induced water movements. Wind-induced mixing of the epilimnion also led to a random distribution of non-motile algae and suppression of diel variation. Sinking of senescent and parasitized non-flagellate species was also recorded. Two flagellates, Ceratium hirundinella and Cryptomonas ovata, showed diel vertical migration. Pseudo-diel variations were recognized; these were associated with weather events (e.g., strong winds) with some degree of regularity. These, with other irregular changes related to weather, further complicate the interpretation of diel variations in the phytoplankton community.																			0022-0477	1365-2745					1981	69	3					919	939		10.2307/2259645	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2259645													WOS:A1981MS97300014

One survey was during, the other after, the spawning season of the bleak (Alburnus alburnus (L.) ), which is the predominant pelagic fish in the lake. Different methods of calculation were used to estimate the average biomass: parametric and spatial statistics. The estimates are close, but only the geostatistical estimate provides a useful confidence interval less than 20% of the estimated mean. The geostatistical variograms can be processed following a linear or a spherical model. Knowledge of fish population distributions and of natural phenomena in the lake leads to the choice of the linear model. The linear variogram takes into account the heterogeneity of the spatial distribution of the fish population and the spatial correlation of the samples.					; GUILLARD, Jean/A-2577-2011	Guillard, Jean/0000-0003-0116-1167; 													0165-7836					APR	1992	13	4					395	406		10.1016/0165-7836(92)90060-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0165-7836(92)90060-7													WOS:A1992HU89400004

When the abundance of benthic resources was at its lowest, in May 1988, the fish showed a very low overlap in their diet. In contrast, when these resources were most abundant, in August 1988, the four species had a high degree of food overlap. Two other sampling periods, in June and July, revealed intermediate situations. A fifth species, the silvery minnow, Hybognathus nuchalis, was phytophagous and, therefore, did not compete with the other species for food resources. An ecomorphological analysis of the first four species suggests that these partition food resources according to their functional morphology. Our results support Schoener's hypothesis, which states that the intensity of interspecific competition, in terms of resource partitioning, varies according to the abundance of these resources.

The use of monofilament web was probably increased exploitation pressure on whitefish. Both gears selectes whitefish of the same size despite stock differences in individual size and shape. Catches in both gears declined during the full moon phase, possibly due to increased net visibility.

We used existing data to investigate the effects of timber harvesting on the activity Status of beaver lodges in central Ontario, Canada. Beaver lodges were initially visited from 1976 to 1979 and active lodges were revisited in 1994. We analyzed a sample of 100 lodges. Fifty had some timber harvesting within 400 m of the lodge, 41 of which had harvest within 100 m of the shoreline (subsequently referred to as shoreline harvest). We differentiated timber harvest by type (clearcut vs. partial cut), years since harvest, and location for each lodge. Clearcut timber harvesting appeared to have a positive effect oil the occupancy of beaver lodges. Seventy-three percent of lodges adjacent to shoreline clearcut areas were active, whereas only 34% of lodges with no shoreline harvest were active. We developed logistic regression models to evaluate the relationship between presence of timber harvest and activity status based on harvest location, harvest type, years since harvest, and water feature (pond, stream, lake, or wetland). Using Akaikes Information Criterion, our modeling suggested that the presence of a 21 - to 35-year-old shoreline clearcut adjacent to a lodge, combined with the associated water feat-Lire type, was the best predictor of lodge activity. How ever, our dataset included only a small sample of lodges in this harvest category (n = 11). While these results are viewed as preliminary, they do suggest that further investigation into the effects of shoreline timber harvest and shoreline reserves oil habitat suitability for beavers is warranted.																			0015-7546					NOV-DEC	2009	85	6					878	884		10.5558/tfc85878-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.5558/tfc85878-6													WOS:000272690400008

PROGRESSIVE CHANGES IN PHYTOPLANKTON COMMUNITY STRUCTURE IN URBANIZED LOWLAND RIVER FLOODPLAINS-A MULTIVARIATE APPROACH	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Phytoplankton communities along the river Yamuna in Delhi stretch and its associated floodplain lakes showed considerable spatio-temporal variations. Most of the species identified were cosmopolitan and typical of highly polluted rivers in tropical ecosystems. All the groups of phytoplankton with predominance of Cyanophyceae and some species of Chlorophyceae were distributed within the river stretch though with varying diversity and density. Relatively cleaner sites supported. larger phytoplankton assemblages compared to those subjected to sewage outfalls and industrial effluents. Species elimination was observed mainly in the mid-stretch and downstream of Okhla subjected to high loads of pollution. Co-inertia analysis indicated significant co-structures between water quality and species richness and density indicating water quality as the governing factor for phytoplankton distributions in the river stretch. Floodplain plays an important role in regenerating water quality thereby enhancing species richness and density. Floods play an important role in seasonal dynamics through dilution effects and promoting connectivity between river channel and floodplain lakes thereby facilitating species exchanges.

The concentrations of the trace elements together with pH, alkalinity, dissolved cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, and K+), dissolved inorganic ligands (Cl-, SO42-), particulate Al, Ca, inorganic and organic carbon are used to assess the contamination of the study area and biogeochemical processes controlling trace element concentrations. Thermodynamic speciation calculations have also been utilized to enhance our understanding of the system. In the sediments Rb, Ba, Cu and Zn concentrations were mainly controlled by the abundance of the aluminosilicate fraction. Strontium was mainly associated with the calcium carbonate fraction. The aluminosilicate fraction constitutes a major sink for Mn and Cd but the concentration of these elements are also strongly related to calcite precipitation. The main processes that control the dissolved distribution of trace elements in the Balaton system were: solid phase formation (carbonate) for Mn; coprecipitation with calcite for Sr, Ba, Rb and possibly Mn and Cd; adsorption/desorption processes (pH dependent) for Zn and Pb; solubilization of Mn and precipitation of Cd and Cu in reed covered wetland areas where anoxic conditions were probably existing during the warm season. A preliminary budget of atmospheric and river input to Lake Balaton has also been outlined. Although Lake Balaton, is subjected to anthropogenic inputs mainly from agricultural and domestic activities, their impact on trace element concentrations in the Balaton system is very limited due to the efficiency of removal processes (i.e. adsorption and co-precipitation) and to high sedimentation rates and strong sediment re-suspension. Anthropogenic inputs are only detected for Pb.

(1994) concluded that during the 'Little Ice Age' (about AD 1500 to 1850), the Devils Lake Basin generally had less effective moisture (precipitation minus evaporation) and warmer temperatures than at present. In this comment we argue that historic data indicate that runoff and effective moisture were greater than at present. The largest nineteenth-century hoods (AD 1826, 1852 and 1861) were significantly greater than the twentieth-century floods, and flooding in the Red River of the North Basin occurred more frequently from AD 1800 to 1870 than since 1870. Between AD 1776 and 1870, the ratio of wet to dry years was about 2 to 1. Mean temperatures in all seasons were cooler for 1850-70 than for 1931-60. Lake levels of Devils Lake during the first half of the nineteenth century were higher than they are today, and, even when Devils Lake was almost dry, the salinity was less than the 'diatom-inferred' salinity values that Fritz et al. (1994) estimated for 1800 through about 1850. We acknowledge the importance of high-resolution palaeoclimatic records, but interpretation of these records must be consistent with historic information.																			0959-6836					DEC	1996	6	4					489	490		10.1177/095968369600600413	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/095968369600600413													WOS:A1996VY51700013

The composition of the food was dominated by carbohydrate (39.6 % AFDW); protein (11.6 % AFDW) and lipid (9.7 % AFDW) had approximately equal contributions to the food. Seasonal variations were observed both in the composition of the food and in the ability of the fish to digest and absorb different components of the food. The quality of food ranges from inadequate to that which can support growth of fish. A digestible organic matter > 20 % and with a sufficient level of digestible protein (minimum 2 % D.W.) provides adequate nutrition to Oreochromis niloticus in Lake Ziway. The quality of food ingested and the feeding rate are both low to suggest that Lake Ziway fishery is not able to sustain continuous exploitation.

Eight sampling stations (various habitats) were chosen within the lake system and random sampling was undertaken at selected area. A total 24 fish species were recorded during the sampling, which comprises of 944 individuals. Majority of fish were represented by the Cyprinidae and Thynnichthys thynnoides, Cyclocheilichythys apogon and Notopterus notopterus were the most family dominance species recorded in Lake Chini. Paired t-test analysis demonstrates that there is a significant fish density difference between day time and night time sampling (p = 0.01, alpha = 0.05) and predators were dominant during night time. Fish diversity and density were high during monsoon season catch, as a result of immigrant fish of Sungai Pahang to Lake Chini through Chini River.

The species was distinguished from N. venustus Lynch, 1936 by having smaller eggs, longer lemnisci and proboscis hooks in the middle not equal to those of the anterior circle in size. A key further distinguishing it from other North American species from fish is presented.It was also separated from similar species infecting fish elsewhere in the world as well as from those infecting North American turtles. The life history of N. robertbaueri in E. sucetta was very brief (April-July). Juveniles were established in anterior intestinal locations by April but moved posteriorly with maturation and with earlier loss of males by July. Seasonal concurrent infections primarily with 3 other helminth species (a cestode, a trematode and an acanthocephalan) are also discussed.																			0022-3395	1937-2345					1985	71	3					312	318		10.2307/3282012	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3282012													WOS:A1985ALL6900009

The thermal stratification, and resultant chemical differentiation of the epilimnion and hypolimnion, was the dominant limnological feature of the reservoir. A pronounced thermocline was present for most of the year and, during the stratified phase, diurnal circulation appeared to be the main mechanism for mixis. 3. Evidence for the presence of an internal seiche, a phenomenon commonly associated with stratified water bodies, was also observed. 4. An annual overturn in June-July coincided with the minimum in solar radiation. The ''wet'' season (January-March) caused either partial or complete circulation depending on the volume of the reservoir and the rate of inflow. In 1982 the lake circulated once, fitting the warm monomictic pattern, but in 1983 there were two circulations, the first resulting from flood inflows. The study illustrated the inappropriate nature of a thermally derived classification scheme for a small reservoir.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1985	15	4					493	503		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1985.tb00219.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1985.tb00219.x													WOS:A1985APM2900008

J	POORE, GCB				POORE, GCB			BENTHIC COMMUNITIES OF THE GIPPSLAND LAKES, VICTORIA	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Samples of benthos from muddy or sandy bottoms along the axis of the Gippsland Lakes, Victoria, and on shallow seagrass beds were taken between Nov. 1978 and Oct. 1979. The benthic communities are described and the likely effects resulting from changes in water usage in the catchment discussed. Gradients in environmental parameters (salinity, temperature dissolved O2 and suspended solids) were not regular but were steepest near a constriction in the system, McLennans Strait. Ninety species of benthic fauna were recorded, with greatest diversity and density at the seagrass sites. The fauna was similar to that recorded in other southeastern Australian estuaries except for its rich amphipod fauna and depauperate bivalve fauna. Densities, especially on seagrass, were higher than recorded in other estuaries although the number of species was lower. Temporal changes in the fauna could not be related clearly to seasonal changes in temperature or other environmental factors. Classification of the data revealed a seagrass community and smaller groups of species and stations, only loosely indicating a faunal gradient along the lakes. A distinct marine fauna was recognized on well-sorted sand at the lower end of the lakes, Reeve Channel and a freshwater component at the opposite end. Physical structures such as McLennans Strait are responsible for the major differences between the faunas of adjacent areas in the greater part of the system. Increased salinity in the future may allow establishment of euryhaline species in more placid parts of the lakes but that deoxygenation of bottom water and high benthic mortalities may occur if a salt wedge is maintained.																			0067-1940						1982	33	5					901	915		10.1071/MF9820901	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF9820901													WOS:A1982PR44000011

Predictive Capability of Three Empirical Models in Estimating the Chlorophyll: A Comparative Case Study of Ecosystem	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY & DEVELOPMENT												The primary productivity of a coastal lagoon can be inferred from the data on the concentration of the primary photosynthetic pigment, chlorophyll-a in phytoplankton. Being the essential macronutrient limiting the growth of phytoplankton, the concentration of primary nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrate in their dissolved states can be related to the concentration of chlorophyll-a in the water. Thus it is possible to determine the trophic status of a lagoon through predicted values of chlorophyll-a obtained by using the empirical relationship between the phytopigment and its limiting nutrient. In the present study, three empirical models developed by Dillon and Rigler (1974), Rast and Lee (1978) and Bartsch and Gakstatter (1978) relating the concentrations to inorganic phosphate to chlorophyll-a have been investigated for their capability to predict the concentrations of the phytopigment at Pulicat lagoon in the Southeast coast of India. The results obtained from the study have been used to describe the trophic status of a coastal lagoon in the southeast coast of India, namely, Pulicat lagoon ecosystem. The results obtained suggest that there are large discrepancies in the values obtained from these models and those obtained from analysis of the samples. From the present study model performance is influenced by the non-linear relationships between the nutrient concentration and the production of phytopigment, chlorophyll-a varying over different seasons and years.

Two major classes of transformation were systematically varied: binary and smoothing. Binary transformation scaled the cutoff threshold between ''presence'' and ''absence'' of a species to various levels of abundance. With successively smaller universes and smoothing windows and successive species exclusion, ordinations of sample dates revealed smaller scaled structures in the order: annual cycles of species turnover, seasonal areas of attraction and uniqueness of individual sample dates. Gradual increases in the length of the smoothing window resulted in gradual shifts in the positions of points in sample date ordination, but not necessarily in the species ordinations. Thus, sample data structures are more stable with change in scale than are species data structures. These differences in stability are discussed in the context of filtering characteristics of data collection and data analysis. Transformations producing similar species statistics (means, variances and skews) did not generally give similar ordination results, while some transformations giving similar ordinations differed in species statistical parameters.																			0042-3106						1984	56	3					147	160																WOS:A1984TG65800003

The epipelic biomass, dominated by Cyanophyceae and Bacillariophyceae, was high (5.6-20.1 cm3m-2) at all depths in the lake with the highest values in the hypolimnion (8-13.7 m). Calculated over mean depth, it was 20 times higher than that of the phytoplankton. There was no significant increase in biomass during fertilization, nor did the species composition change. The chlorphyll concentration was significantly higher in late 1978 and in 1979, which was probably an effect of the declining light climate caused by a large phytoplankton development in the lake. Constant seasonal biomass and species composition indicate a perennial epipelic community in this lake.																			0105-9327						1984	7	2					195	201																WOS:A1984SX64700014

The photosynthesis at a given temperature in low or high irradiance and the chlorophyll content of Littorella and Isoetes were almost independent of season. In accordance with the zonation, the light-saturated net photosynthesis of Littorella was consistently higher compared with Isoetes, and the difference increased with temperature (5-20.degree. C). The photosynthesis in low irradiance was often slightly, but not significantly, higher in Isoetes and, despite its higher chlorophyll content and lower specific leaf area, the slope of the initial part of the photosynthesis-light curve was rather similar for the 2 spp. The dark respiration of the underground parts was lower than the leaf respiration, and the respiration was lower for Isoetes than for Littorella. The physiological responses are discussed in relation to the ecological conditions in oligotrophic lakes and the distributional pattern of the 2 spp.					Sand-Jensen, Kaj/F-3041-2015	Sand-Jensen, Kaj/0000-0003-2534-4638													0304-3770	1879-1522					1978	4	1					1	10		10.1016/0304-3770(78)90002-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(78)90002-5													WOS:A1978EG74200001

Basic water parameters, such as oxygen content, pH, electrical conductivity and temperature show seasonal variations largely determined by the changes in wet and dry seasons. Both waterbodies are monomictic, with water mixing taking place in January, the coldest period of the year. Pre-impoundment forest clearence of the future reservoir bottom in the shallow Selingue reservoir was carried out only in the proximity of the dam site. In the deeper reservoir Manantali the savanna forest was cleared from an area of about 25 percent, and the tree gallery was cleared along the river. The initial filling of Manantali reservoir was followed by a nearly complete drainage of the reservoir. After refilling some months later, the dissolved oxygen content stayed reasonably high and therefore there was no fish mortality. Also no hydrogen sulphide or a large-scale spread of noxious aquatic plants developed. At present the fish fauna is dominated by cichlids and pelagic species, i.e. at Selingue by clupeids, and at Manantali by cyprinids (Leptocypris niloticus). In both reservoirs was the genus Citharinus considerably reduced. At Selingue reservoir disappeared Protopterus annectens.

Lagartijo reservoir supplies an important part of the water demand for Caracas city and wide fluctuations on water volume occur annually. Relevant physical, chemical and biological data were obtained from three sampling stations between July 1990 and April 1992. The reservoir was permanently stratified with a well defined thermocline. The main tributary (Lagartijo river), with a temperature about 6-degrees-C colder than the surface temperature of the reservoir, flows through the hypolimnion producing distinct chemical and biological properties. The average of the daily integral phytoplankton photosynthesis was 1550 mg C m-2 d-1. The present annual average of the net photosynthetic activity is about 40 % lower than the reported for 1970 and corresponds to an apparent decrease in phytoplankton biomass and to the reduction of the euphotic zone. Photosynthetic activity was higher for the wet season than for the dry season. Actual chlorophyll a concentration in the euphotic zone averages 4.9 mug l-1. Abundance of zooplankton was significantly decreased in comparison to 1976. Mean zooplankton biomass (dry weight) for the upper 10 m layer was 596 mug l-1. Copepods accounted for most of this biomass, followed by cladocerans and rotifers. For the first time, a freshwater medusa (probably Craspedacusta sowerbyi) was collected from Venezuelan waters.																			0020-9309						1994	79	1					17	25		10.1002/iroh.19940790105	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19940790105													WOS:A1994NM81400003

Russell is an impoundment of the Savannah River. The lake's waters are soft and mildly acidic. Organic matter is abundant. Seasonal oxygen depletion occurs during stratification, and reduced species, including Mn2+, accumulate in the hypolimnion. Electron paramagnetic resonance studies indicate that Mn in the water column is present almost entirely as soluble and colloidal Mn2+ species, except near the surface where particulate forms sometimes predominate. Field and laboratory studies were used to estimate the rate of oxidation of Mn2+ in the water column, and to characterize the flux of reduced Mn across the sediment-water interface. Surprisingly, incubating bottom deposits with oxygenated bathylimnetic water released more Mn than did maintaining anoxia.																			0065-2393		0-8412-2526-5				1994	237						499	524																WOS:A1994BZ52H00016

To determine the genetic uniqueness of these fish, samples of Arctic char from five isolated lakes in New England and eastern Canada were examined by restriction endonuclease analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and compared with samples of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) and Arctic char from Scandinavia. Results suggest that (1) Arctic char of eastern North America should all be considered members of Salvelinus alpinus oquassa, (2) char from Floods Pond possess a unique mtDNA banding pattern for one restriction enzyme not observed in fish from any other sampled locality (this difference delineates a distinct lineage of Arctic char whose preservation is warranted on genetic grounds), and (3) unique banding patterns did not characterize any other studied char population, including geographic variants (these populations may be viewed as genetically homogeneous, and none warrant individual protection based upon our genetic characterizations). We contend that genetically identified lineages in the early stages of divergence warrant preservation.																			0706-652X					JAN	1994	51	1					62	67		10.1139/f94-008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f94-008													WOS:A1994NC19800008
J	VYVERMAN, W				VYVERMAN, W			LIMNOLOGICAL FEATURES OF LAKES ON THE SEPIK-RAMU FLOODPLAIN, PAPUA-NEW-GUINEA	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												The Sepik-Ramu floodplain is one of the major wetland areas in south-eastern Asia. This paper reports preliminary limnological data on 26 lakes on the lower and middle reaches of the floodplain. Conductivity, pH and alkalinity increase from upstream lakes to downstream lakes. A first attempt is made to classify the lakes according to water colour and sediment load, as indicators of local hydrology. Humic-stained black waters can be distinguished from sediment-loaded white waters as well as from a number of transitional mixed waters. All the lakes studied had very shallow optical depths (Secchi depths between 0.25 and 1.84 m), owing to either high gilvin concentrations or turbidity. Extinction coefficients for downward irradiance, measured in three lakes, were higher in surface water layers (K-d = 3.4 - 19.5 m(-1)) than in deeper layers (K-d = 2.5 - 11.0 m(-1)). The data suggest that the lakes represent a range of stratification regimes, from nonstratified lakes to lakes stratified over prolonged periods. Local hydrology, basin morphometry and local topography seem to be the major factors controlling stratification regime. Phytoplankton biomass was lowest in black-water lakes (2.3 X 10(5) mu m(3) mL(-1)), and high values (1.7 X 10(8) mu m(3) mL(-1)) were recorded in white-water and stratified mixed-water lakes. The preliminary data suggest that there may be considerable seasonal fluctuation of phytoplankton biomass.																			0067-1940						1994	45	7					1209	1224																WOS:A1994QL12500009

Low concentrations (about 2-5-mu-g L-1) of soluble Mn (i.e. filtration size <0.02-mu-m) are typically found in these waters during the wet season, the main natural sources apparently being rainwater and groundwater. An additional source of soluble Mn has been identified, possibly being seepage from a mine retention pond. Rather surprisingly, the concentration of colloidal Mn (0.4-0.02-mu-m) was almost three times higher than that of soluble Mn and was correlated with it. The primary process controlling the concentration of soluble Mn in this system appears to be rapid adsorption of soluble Mn to existing colloidal matter, followed by slower transfer of part of this surface-bound Mn to the interior of the colloid. Colloidal Mn is postulated to have a particularly long lifetime in this system because the removal process (aggregation to form particulate Mn) would be slow due to the extremely low concentrations of Ca and Mg ions during the wet season. A mixing experiment, undertaken to provide information on the possible fate of Mn in a mine retention pond if this wastewater should be discharged to the creek, clearly showed that Mn would be rapidly removed from the water column via colloidal and particulate forms. The precise mechanism was shown to be complex, depending upon the amount and characteristics of the colloidal and particulate matter present at the time of discharge, the changes in the Ca and Mg concentrations (which would influence the rate of aggregation), and the amount of turbulence in the creek.																			0067-1940						1992	43	2					421	441																WOS:A1992HY64400007
J	PRIVALSKY, V				PRIVALSKY, V			STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS AND PREDICTABILITY OF LAKE ERIE WATER LEVEL VARIATIONS	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Statistical predictability and spectra of mean monthly and annual water levels (MMWL and MAWL) of Lake Erie at Cleveland, Ohio, 1860-1988, are studied within the framework of the Kolmogorov-Wiener theory of extrapolation using AR modeling and the theory of non-stationary product random processes in order to assess the attainable quality of least-squares predictions of water levels. MMWL are shown to possess relatively high predictability due to a strong seasonal cycle in water level variations, with predictability limits extending up to 12 months. MAWL reveal a time-dependent structure in the mean value, variance, and spectrum which can be ascribed, among other reasons, to a climatic change. Their predictability is quite low (predictability limit not more than 1 or 2 years) and cannot be improved by applying other techniques of scalar time series extrapolation. The uncertainties in water level predictions should be taken into account quantitatively when making decisions which depend upon hydrological parameters.																			0380-1330						1992	18	1					236	243		10.1016/S0380-1330(92)71291-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(92)71291-X													WOS:A1992HP68100023
J	TILZER, MM				TILZER, MM			DISTINCTION BETWEEN LIGHT-MEDIATED AND LIGHT-INDEPENDENT VARIATIONS IN PHYTOPLANKTON PRODUCTION-RATES	HYDROBIOLOGIA												An array of factors simultaneously controls phytoplankton photosynthesis and hence the primary production process. Because their relative importance shifts both with depth and with season, the significance of individual factors cannot be resolved by in situ incubations, even if all relevant environmental and biotic variables are measured. Here a procedure is described by which in addition to in situ mesurements, photosynthesis is simultaneously assessed in identical subsamples under constant temperature (10.degree. C) and light (0.66 mol m-2 h-1 PAR conditions, ''in vitro''). By calculatign photosynthesis per unit of chlorophyll, effects of shifting biomass on photosynthesis can be eliminated but seasonal variations of light-saturated photosynthesis generated by temperature, and vertical changes of light-requirements (e.g. by light-shade adaptation) remain obscure. Quotients of in situ photosynthesis rates divided by in vitro rates allow the quantification of light-mediated changes. Provided that photosynthesis measured in vitro is light-saturated, quotients in situ: in vitro rates should never exceed unity. They are a measure for the degree of light-limitation. In vitro rates normalized to chlorophyll give information on temporal changes caused by variations in photosynthetic capacity. In Lake Constance [West Germany], mean cell size appears to control light-saturated assimilation numbers.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR 22	1989	173	2					135	140		10.1007/BF00015523	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00015523													WOS:A1989U317100007

J	ROBARTS, RD				ROBARTS, RD			UNDERWATER LIGHT PENETRATION, CHLOROPHYLL A AND PRIMARY PRODUCTION IN A TROPICAL AFRICAN LAKE (LAKE MCILWAINE, RHODESIA)	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The relationship between underwater light penetration, algal standing crop (chlorophyll [chl] a) and primary productivity (14C) in eutrophic Lake McIlwaine, Rhodesia was examined. The depth of the euphotic zone, Zeu = 3.7/.epsilon.min, ranged between 1.3-3.6 m and was inversely correlated with algal standing crop (12-95 mg/m3 chl a). The algae had a high self-shading potential which was a major factor in controlling standing crop. Chlorophyll accounted for a mean value of 52.9% of the light extinction in Lake McIlwaine. The maximum productivity value recorded was 653 mg C/m3 per h. Most seasonal variation in the measured hourly rates of integral photosynthesis (mg C/m2 per h) was accounted for by the variation in the ratio of Amax/.epsilon.min (light-saturated rate of photosynthesis/minimum extinction coefficient). Photosynthetic capacity, [mg C (mg chl a)-1], ranged between 4-21 and was inversely related to algal standing crop. The combination of increased photosynthetic capacity and increased light penetration with smaller standing crops gave integral productivity values which were similar to values obtained with significantly greater algal populations. Water managers may be able to calculate an optimum algal standing crop which will allow Lake McIlwaine to continue to support a commercial fishery and provide a city''s drinking water for minimal cost.																			0003-9136						1979	86	4					423	444																WOS:A1979HR18200002

The high degree of reduction calls for an efficient coagulant, but also an optimal chemistry such as correct dosing amount and an optimal flocculation-pH. The paper describes different removal efficiencies of organic matter, particularly with respect to pH in flocculation. During the warm season, the raw water can also suffer from large amounts of plankton that are difficult to remove to a satisfactory degree, In a two-step chemical treatment concept, with Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) and the pulsator process, the plankton content in the final outlet water is reduced to very low levels. It follows that eventual peaks of plankton in the raw water cannot be detected in the final outlet water. Ozone is added for removal of taste and odour originating from the presence of plankton. In the pretreatment step prior to the ozonation, a great deal of the organic matter is removed, which reduces the necessary ozone dosage. The Municipal Water Company of Warsaw City has decided to consider an additional pre-treatment step to the existing water treatment plant at Wieliszew. For that purpose, and bearing in mind an integrated process design, the company has performed pilot-scale experiments with DAF installed prior to a process line identical with the existing full-scale plant. The experimental flow is about 10 m3/h.																			1606-9749		1-900222-61-2				2001	1	2					115	122		10.2166/ws.2001.0028	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/ws.2001.0028													WOS:000175400600014

Storm pathways to Bear Lake during snowfall events were estimated using the HYSPLIT4 backward-trajectory model developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Deposition of acidic ions of nitrate and sulfate in snowfall during the study varied substantially (two- to threefold) depending on storm trajectory because air masses traversing the park originated from different surrounding areas, including some having large sources of emissions of nitrate and sulfate. Concentrations of nitrate and sulfate in samples were lowest when storms reached ROMO from north and east of the park and were elevated when air masses traveled from the west where a number of power plants are located. Concentrations were highest in storms reaching ROMO from the south, a region with urban areas including Metropolitan Denver.																			0161-0589						2001							32	42																WOS:000174272100004

The model was calibrated, but attempts at validation failed. Errors in the vertical water budget and river routing portions of the model were not large enough to account for the differences between observed and modelled streamflow. Field studies suggest the model structure did not adequately simulate the effect of storage capacity differences between land cover types on the sub-grid transfer of runoff to the stream. Runoff is delayed or prevented from reaching higher order streams because of seasonal changes in hillslope and headwater lake storage capacities, while the model structure implies that any excess water from the hillslope vertical water budget is immediately transferred.																			0144-7815		1-901502-61-9				2001		270					113	116																WOS:000172971900016

The concentration of TDOC varied aperiodically. The release of DOC by phytoplankton and its utilization by bacteria fluctuated markedly, but these processes did not play a significant role in causing the seasonal variations of TDOC. Increases in the concentration of TDOC greatly exceeded the amounts accumulated from release by the phytoplankton, even when maximum rates of phytoplankton DOC release were calculated by assuming release exclusively from a large intracellular pool not at isotopic equilibrium. In addition, bacterial utilization of the phytoplankton DOC alone could not account for decreases in TDOC concentration. Therefore, there must be other major sources of dissolved organic matter than that provided by the mechanism of extracellular release by phytoplankton. The littoral flora and the decomposition of dead particulate organic materials are the most likely sources of fluctuations of TDOC in Frains Lake.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1978	23	1					112	119		10.4319/lo.1978.23.1.0112	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1978.23.1.0112													WOS:A1978EW90700011

Use of an oxygen-releasing compound to aerate eutrophic reservoir water	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART A-TOXIC/HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES & ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												This study examined the use of an Oxygen Release Compound (ORC (R)) as a slow release chemical aeration agent within eutrophic surface water systems. Bench and pilot-scale experiments involving ORC (R) treatment of eutrophic reservoir water were conducted to determine operational properties of ORC (R) and examine its performance as an aeration agent within a surface water environment. The bench-scale study involved the application of 10, 25 and 50 g ORC (R) doses to 1 L Erlenmeyer flasks containing various water and sediment samples. The pilot-scale study involved a scaled up simulation of full-scale reservoir systems using large fiberglass tanks, where water quality parameters in an ORC (R)-treated tank were compared to an untreated tank over a 4 month period. The results of these experiments indicate that the application of ORC (R) can result in substantial increases in dissolved oxygen and pH when applied to deoxygenated water systems. Within the pilot scale study, a 300 g/m(2) dose of ORC (R) at the sediment water interface prevented the onset of anoxic conditions over a 4 month growing season period, releasing approximately 20% of its mass as oxygen within this time frame.					; Gagnon, Graham/J-3891-2019	Jamieson, Rob/0000-0003-3170-3203; Gagnon, Graham/0000-0001-5925-2294; /0000-0002-6445-3346													1093-4529	1532-4117				JUL 15	2009	44	9					906	913		10.1080/10934520902958757	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934520902958757								19799059					WOS:000268578600009

The lifeform of E. azurea is termed 'semi-emergent', because the plant has well developed trailing stems just under the water, and the aerial lamina emerges with the thick petiole. The density of shoot apices was 9.9, 17.2 and 17.1 m(-2) in Lake Dom Helvecio, Lake Jacare and Lake Carioca, respectively. The mean daily increment of the apical shoot biomass was between 1.8 and 4.8 g m(-2) day(-1). The mean leaf life-span in Lake Dom Helvecio, Lake Jacare and Lake Carioca was estimated to be 78, 49 and 64 days in the wet season and 73, 70 and 73 days in the dry season, respectively. The stem life-span was estimated to be about 28 months. Starch content in the current years' stem ranged from 24 to 118 mg g(-1) dry matter with fluctuations, the amplitude of which decreased with age. The differences for most of the growth parameters, such as density of shoot apices, dairy increment of biomass and leaf life-span, between dry and wet season are smaller than those among the three lakes. Both the decrease in daily dry matter production and the increase in leaf life-span occurred in order from Lake Dom Helvecio to Lake Jacare and Lake Carioca. The low productivity of E. azurea is considered to be related to a low leaf area index, a long time interval for the emergence of new leaves, long leaf life-span and a low capacity for branching.																			0912-3814					DEC	1993	8	3					287	295		10.1007/BF02347188	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02347188													WOS:A1993MK76900004

The gonads of males and females developed rapidly from August and the GSI of both sexes indicated the highest values in October. The diameter of ovulated oocytes in the body cavity ranged from 0.74 to 0.99 mm and the relation between the number and standard length of fish was represented as E-0.00188 x L8.418. The spawning season of the ayu in the lake was from early October to late November. The ayu spawned mainly at shore lines shallower than about 30 cm in depth and the substrate of reds consisted of fine gravel, ranging mostly from 3-10 mm in diameter. The sex composition of the ayu crowding the spawning site was not the same throughout the spawning season. Males predominated in the early period of the season, and females in the latter. The male fish matured simultaneously and most of them crowded at spawning grounds. On the other hand, the fully matured female appeared at the spawning site one by one, while the immature ones dispersed around the site in low density. It is suggested that this mode of spawning in the ayu may be one of the important factors for sustaining its population land locked in Lake Ikeda.																			0021-5392					DEC	1991	57	12					2187	2192																WOS:A1991HB71100004
J	Sanchez, X; Roget, E; Planella, J				Sanchez, Xavier; Roget, Elena; Planella, Jesus			Heat flux through a geothermally heated fluidized bed at the bottom of a lake	WATER RESEARCH												Heat fluxes and the underground inflow through a natural fluidized bed within the main sub-basin of Lake Banyoles are studied and parameterized. In the upper part of this fluidized bed, at a depth of about 30 m, the vertical gradients of particle concentration and temperature are very sharply located within an interface a few centimeters thick. within this interface (lutocline), the depths where the temperature and the concentration gradients are maximum match exactly. On the other hand, the lutocline determines a flat, horizontal surface dividing the water column into a hot, turbid medium at the bottom and clear, colder, bulk water above. Through this interface the flow regime also varies from being laminar just below it, to turbulent due to convective processes developing above it. More precisely, in studied main sub-basin a buoyant plume develops above the lutocline, as a result of the heat flux, and affects the lake's water quality due to particles dragged along by it. In this paper it is proposed to determine the temperature at the depth of maximum gradient within the interface by means of measured temperature profiles, and consider the stationary heat transport equation in the laminar region below it, in order to obtain the water velocity and the heat flux. Heat flux parameterization is given based on a large number of thermal high-resolution profiles, covering six campaigns in different years and seasons.

J	REYNOLDS, JD; SCUDDER, GGE				REYNOLDS, JD; SCUDDER, GGE			EXPERIMENTAL-EVIDENCE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL FEEDING NICHE IN CENOCORIXA (HEMIPTERA, CORIXIDAE)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												The fundamental feeding niche of Cenocorixa bifida hungerfordi Lansbury and Cenocorixa expleta (Uhler) from saline lakes (500-20,000 .mu.S cm-1 at 25.degree. C) was determined in laboratory experiments. Each species was offered a variety of potential foods, to determine potential dietary overlap. No significant differences in food acceptance were seen between corixids collected from different lakes or at different seasons. The species were both carnivorous and predaceous, showing little propensity to feed on plant material. Adults of both species attacked and fed on chironomid larvae most frequently; larval instars were less specific. Cenocorixa expleta adults and larval instars of both C. expleta and C. bifida fed more on dead than living food organisms. When offered mixed live zooplankton, C. bifida chose more Ceriodaphnia than Diaptomus, whereas C. expleta showed no such selection; these differences were not seen with dead zooplankton. Cencorixa bifida and C. expleta coexist at moderate salinities, and appear physiologically capable of inhabiting the entire salinity range encountered. Their fundamental feeding niches, although not identical, overlap considerably and could result in competition for food. This could lead to the exclusion of C. expleta from low salinity lakes.

Both species normally had 6 giant subcuticular nuclei and 3 giant lemniscal nuclei but yonger N. prolixoides had more than the usual 8 giant nuclei in the cement gland. Numerical variations were not related to season or worm sex. Neoechinorhynchus robertbaueri apparently do not reach the older adult stage. In most older adult N. prolixoides, the giant nuclei do not assume the prereproductive condition. Reproductive activity and growth proceed simultaneously in both species. Structural changes of giant nuclei of the various developmental stages are described. Some overlap of stages of giant subcuticular nuclei was observed in N. robertbaueri and attributed to the compression of its reproductive season into 2-4 months. No positional changes in the giant subcuticular nuclei occurred in either species. Qualitative findings support the hypothesis that changes in all 3 sets of giant nuclei are associated with the initiation and maintenance of reproductive activity of worms. The relationship between giant nuclei patterns and the synchronization of reproductive and generation cycles appear to be common in neoechinorhynchid acanthocephalans.																			0018-0130					JUL	1986	53	2					184	193																WOS:A1986D857200007
J	BLACK, RW				BLACK, RW			THE NATURE AND CAUSES OF CYCLOMORPHOSIS IN A SPECIES OF THE BOSMINA-LONGIROSTRIS COMPLEX	ECOLOGY												Cyclomorphosis was examined in the long-featured species of the B. longirostris complex at an inshore study site in Lake Washington, Washington, USA, in 1975 and 1976. Summertime decreases were observed in the mean size and relative growth of 4 morphological characters in 1975 and in the mean size of 3 of these characters in 1976. Seasonal changes in antennule length, the number of antennule segments, mucro length and the number of mucro sutures were unrelated to the age structure of the population. Samples of clones that were isolated from the field population and acclimated to a single set of laboratory conditions contained significant between-clone heterogeneity with respect to the mean size of 3 characters: antennule length, mucro length and the number of mucro sutures. Acclimated clone sets isolated from springtime populations contained significantly larger characters than did sets that were isolated from summertime populations and acclimated to the same conditions. Clones can be genetically distinct with respect to these 3 cyclomorphic characters and the field population contained considerable genetic diversity with respect to these characters at any one time. Genetic changes occurred in the population with respect to each character. These genetic changes did not occur as large-scale extinctions of clones, but probably involved the succession of morphologically distinct clones as the numerically dominant clone. Comparison of the observed cyclomorphosis with those patterns predicted by the various hypotheses for the causes of this phenomenon revealed that the seasonal morphological changes shown by this species were probably caused by the selective predation of a temporally important predator. Cyclomorphosis in the long-featured species was not related to water temperature or O2 stress in the manner proposed for other species.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1980	61	5					1122	1132		10.2307/1936832	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1936832													WOS:A1980KY31700018

Moving averages, Spearman''s rank correlation coefficient and regression methods, which modeled the seasonal cycle, were used. pH and alkalinity decreased, and nitrate increased, but these changes did not occur for all months. Since river discharge did not change significantly in any month, the changes in pH, alkalinity and nitrate were not due simply to changes in discharge. A change in total P concentrations over the years was not detected.																			0380-1330						1983	9	2					234	240		10.1016/S0380-1330(83)71892-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(83)71892-7													WOS:A1983QR88400014

Feeding experiments showed that T. prasinus was omnivorous in the later instars but this species was neither cannibalistic nor did it prey on other microcrustaceans. Consequently, late instar and adult diets of T. prasinus and C. b. thomasi did not overlap. Seasonal abundance peaks revealed a temporal segregation of the naupliar instars of these 2 cyclopoid copepods. Competition between T. prasinus and C. b. thomasi was therefore unlikely. Laboratory experiments showed that the only other potentially important invertebrate predator found in Placid Lake, Chaoborus flavicans, ate more C. b. thomasi than T. prasinus but in the absence of Chaoborus in beaker environments, C. b. thomasi always outnumbered T. prasinus after 50 or 100 days. Large-scale enclosure experiments revealed that lake densities of C. b. thomasi could limit the abundance of T. prasinus in Placid Lake. Survivorship curves indicated that there was high T. prasinus naupliar mortality even in the absence of C. b. thomasi but when C. b. thomasi was included in the enclosure plankton, mortality of the nauplius 4 to copepodid I instars was greatly increased.																			0008-4301	1480-3283					1983	61	1					250	265		10.1139/z83-031	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z83-031													WOS:A1983QD59500031
J	POLLERO, RJ; BRENNER, RR				POLLERO, RJ; BRENNER, RR			EFFECT OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND FASTING ON THE LIPID AND FATTY-ACID COMPOSITION OF DIPLODOM-PATAGONICUS	LIPIDS												Some effects of food, habitat and temperature on the lipid composition of a freshwater mollusk, D. patagonicus, were studied. Animals kept and fasted up to 60 days in an aquarium at 9.degree. C and 20.degree. C showed a decrease of the total lipid content that corresponded to a decrease of triacylglycerols and diacylglycerol ethers. This decrease evolked an increase of polar-to-nonpolar lipid ratio. No significant change in the total fatty acid composition was shown. A decrease of temperature from 20.degree. C-9.degree. C decreased the incorporation of labeled linoleic and .alpha.-linolenic acid into the lipids, but did not modify the unsaturated:saturated acid ratio of the mollusk lipids. A change of habitat from lake to estuary changed very significantly the fatty acid composition of the animal. The .omega.6 acids, linoleic and arachidonic, typical of D. patagonicus living in the lake, were partially replaced by .omega.3 acids. That this change was due to a change of food composition was indicated by the fatty acids of corresponding sediments. The fatty acid composition of D. patagonicus is highly sensitive to food composition and varies little with temperature and seasonal changes.																			0024-4201	1558-9307					1981	16	9					685	690		10.1007/BF02535064	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02535064								27519236					WOS:A1981MJ63400007

Fish populations in the lake have lesions of epizooty from which Aeromonas spp. are readily isolated. Distribution and population densities of Aeromonas in the water column were measured along an O2 and temperature gradient and seasonally. Greater population densities of Aeromonas occurred below the O2 chemocline when the lake was stratified. Survival of A. hydrophila under in situ conditions in epilimnetic and hypolimnetic waters was determined through the use of polycarbonate membrane diffusion chambers during 2 separate reactor operating conditions. Survival levels of pure cultures of A. hydrophila corresponded to the distrib-tion patterns of the naturally occurring Aeromonas-like populations. The greater survival of A. hydrophila during full reactor operation suggests that the fish populations may be exposed to Aeromonas for a longer period of time than when the reactor is not operating.

J	MOMOT, WT; GOWING, H				MOMOT, WT; GOWING, H			PRODUCTION AND POPULATION-DYNAMICS OF CRAYFISH ORCONECTES-VIRILIS IN 3 MICHIGAN LAKES	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												Fluctuations in mortality rather than in growth rates produced most of the year-to-year differences in biomass accumulation of 3 different populations of the crayfish O. virilis. Yearly biomass changes resulted from density-dependent control of mortality and fecundity during certain portions of the life cycle. Density-dependent changes in mortality rates controlled population size for adults in all lakes and for young-of-the-year in 2 of the 3 study lakes. Growth rates were much less responsive to fluctuating densities. Disparity between the number of ovarian and attached eggs increased as density of age I+ crayfish increased. This provided a strong density regulator on fecundity. Differences occurred in the number of recruits produced by a brood stock that survive to the end of the 1st growing season in the various lakes. Yet the number of females surviving to reproductive age 2 yr later was strongly regulated. Strong population regulation produced 2 female recruits of breeding age for every 2-6 parental breeding females. The high biomass and production levels of crayfish discovered in West Lost Lake in 1962-63 also occurred in the other area lakes. Higher but variable levels of recruitment resulted in larger standing crops and production in West Lost lake. This resulted from less effective density controls on the mortality rates of younger age-groups in that lake. Despite great variation in biomass of from 46-213 kg/ha and annual production from 60-142 kg/ha, the annual turnover ratio of the biomass varied only between 0.94-1.53.																									1977	34	11					2041	2055		10.1139/f77-273	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f77-273													WOS:A1977EB57200005

Causes for spatial and temporal variability in mercury concentrations in biota are reviewed. The significance of intertrophic and intratrophic biotic relationships is evaluated on both a site-specific and intersite basis. Larger mature fish are the most effective integrators as these organisms are the most buffered from site-specific and seasonal variations in mercury concentrations and bioavailability. Where there are no physical barriers preventing movement of biota between contaminated and uncontaminated parts of the watercourse, younger, smaller organisms can better - ical zones of contamination because of their restricted range. Because many organisms can provide information on mercury contamination, the choice of the most suitable indicator depends upon the purpose of the study, the pharmacokinetics of mercury uptake by the organisms in question, and the chemodynamics of methyl and inorganic mercury species in the field.

AMYLASE	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Seasonal changes of the amylolytic activity in the gut content of the roach and rudd in 4 Tyrolean lakes [Austria] and the adaptation of the amylase to 4 acclimation temperatures and to different natural foods were studied. In the roach, amylolytic activity varied with the environmental temperature. Between Sept. and Oct., however, enzyme activity shifted to a higher level, where it remained for the entire cold season. In the rudd, which has almost the same seasonal pattern of amylolytic activity as the roach, the activity of the enzyme is independent of environmental temperature. This suggests an endogenous rhythm of enzyme activity. Under natural conditions the roach, but not the rudd, has a higher amylolytic activity when feeding on animals and a lower activity when feeding on detritus. The laboratory experiments revealed no significant differences in amylase activity between fish feeding on animals and those feeding on plants, although in both species the enzymatic activity was lowest when Chara served as food.																				1095-8649					1979	14	6					565	572																WOS:A1979HF73500009

A surface bloom was present on only 6 of 64 sampling dates, always associated with calm, sunny weather following cold fronts. A subsurface Chl a maximum was often observed at 3-5 m, associated with a transient upper breeze thermocline. Analysis of distributed-lag antecedent wind stress showed that stress during the 6 h immediately before sampling predicts lateral gradients in Chl standing crop (CSC) unless slight recent stress follows high stress and an important directional shift. The short response time agrees with fetch transit times for the surface wind drift current and lag times involving the epilimnetic set-up. Increasing the average CSC increases its lateral response to wind stress, possibly because large standing crops tend to be buoyant and hence readily advected by the wind. [Because of the utility of Chl in estimating algal standing crops and potential photosynthesis, the temporal factors controlling its spatial distribution should be studied.].																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1982	27	1					66	74		10.4319/lo.1982.27.1.0066	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1982.27.1.0066													WOS:A1982NA27100006

We also investigated levels of lead in livers. Livers and gizzards of 342 ducks, Pacific black duck (96), grey teal (122), maned duck (102), pink-eared duck (15) and Australasian shoveler (7), were collected during the 1987 duck shooting season. Few birds had ingested shot (1.5%). Black ducks had more grit, the size of shot, in their gizzards than did grey teal or maned duck. Total grit contents in the gizzards were of a similar weight for black duck and maned ducks but less for grey teal. Two ducks had lead levels in the liver indicative of lead poisoning (> 6 ppm) wet weight. Lead levels in the liver were generally low, 0.32 .+-. 0.76 ppm (mean .+-. s.d.). There were no differences between species or sexes in levels of lead in livers. There was also no differences beteen lead levels of ducks shot on opening day compared to those shot 4 weeks later. Crude density estimates, extrapolated from 77 samples of sediment (800 cm2), averaged 16 000 shot per hectare for areas close to where hunters camped. Crude density, extrapolated from 100 samples, was 3400 shot per hectare for areas of low hunter density.

The two methods used to assess the activity pattern were the point sample technique, with one sample involving several elephants, and the continuous observation method. A variant of the latter, the 5-min interval method, was used with observations on one focal elephant each time. Activities were analysed with respect to time of the day and tree density in the study area. Chi-squared tests showed that there was no variation of activities with respect to various Acacia tortilis density categories. Elephants descend the escarpment every morning so that walking is a pronounced activity at this time. They rest in the woodland around noon and visit the lake shore in the evening before most of them return up the escarpment.																			0141-6707	1365-2028				DEC	1987	25	4					255	263		10.1111/j.1365-2028.1987.tb01117.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2028.1987.tb01117.x													WOS:A1987L395500006
J	SAAD, MAH				SAAD, MAH			LIMNOLOGICAL STUDIES ON THE NOZHA HYDRODROME, EGYPT, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE PROBLEMS OF POLLUTION	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Water samples were collected in the different seasons during the period 1979-1981 from the Nozha Hydrodrome, Egypt, a small shallow lake receiving polluted Nile water, to gain information on the environmental conditions, nutrient contents, levels of trace metals and their possible variations in relation to pollution effects. The accumulation of trace metals in the lake sediments and in different tissues of the common fish, Tilapia species, was also investigated. During the study period, values for each of the parameters investigated generally gave a wide range of variability. The highest seasonal average air and water temperatures were recorded in July and the lowest values in January; the water temperature usually followed the pattern of the air temperature. The maximum seasonal average chlorosity in July is due to an increase in the rate of evaporation. The highest seasonal average for dissolved oxygen (DO) in January coincided mainly with a decrease in the rate of oxygen consumption associated with a drop in temperature and the continual mixing of the lake by wind action. The minimum regional averages of Secchi disc and chlorosity, as well as the lower regional average values of pH and DO in the supply canal reflect the turbidity and nature of the polluted feed Nile water. The seasonal changes of nutrients in the Hydrodrome are most influenced by their allochthonous input, and their main source is the supply of polluted Nile water, which first affects the inlet region. The high concentrations of inorganic nitrogenous and phosphate salts in the feed water are due to the discharge of untreated sewage and industrial wastes, as well as agricultural run-off into the water source of the Hydrodrome (Mahmoudia Canal). The nitrite produced in the lake is principally from nitrification of ammonia. The autochthonous supply of nitrate and phosphate is mainly from the decay of phytoplankton and subsequent release from lake sediments. The increase in silicate coincided principally with dissolution of diatom frustules. It appears that phytoplankton represents the main factor responsible for decreasing the concentations of nutrients in the Hydrodrome. The seasonal variations of trace metals in the Hydrodrome are attributed to both external and internal effects. The former reflets the impact of man on the water source of the Hydrodrome, whereas the latter represents the events which occur within this lake. The data suggest a direct relationship between the concentrations of metals in the lake water and their concentrations in Tilapia fish. The data illustrate the ability of fish to absorb high levels of heavy metals and the ability of the lake sediments to accumulate these metals relative to those found in the lake water and the fish. In general, iron showed the highest mean values in the lake water, sediments and fish, whereas cadmium was present in the lowest concentrations. Comparisons between the annual average value of each parameter in the present study and the corresponding value for the study of the heavily polluted Lake Mariut during the same period, as well as the comparison between the annual averages of nutrients and trace metals in the Hydrodrome and those in the predominantly clean Damietta branch of the Nile, provided evidence for the amount of pollution occurring in the study area.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				DEC	1987	67	2-3					195	214		10.1016/0048-9697(87)90212-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0048-9697(87)90212-9													WOS:A1987L485300009

Coinciding with the principal weight loss of carbohydrate material, the main exothermic reaction for all lake samples began at 200-250.degree.C and peaked at 345-355.degree.C. Trap samples varied over the season and samples from the deep traps (178 m) had exotherms which were broader with less energy content than from traps near the bottom of the metalimnion. This trend continued into the sediments. Compounds likely to be found in sediments (cellulose, chitin, and humic substances) were also analysed. The calcium carbonate endotherm which begins near 675.degree.C distinguishes this compound from the total "ash" content. DTA and TGA can be used to detect changes in composition of lake organic matter during the sediment-forming process.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				DEC	1987	44	12					2216	2224		10.1139/f87-272	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f87-272													WOS:A1987M856600020
J	MCKAYE, KR; STAUFFER, JR				MCKAYE, KR; STAUFFER, JR			SEASONALITY, DEPTH AND HABITAT DISTRIBUTION OF BREEDING MALES OF OREOCHROMIS SPP, CHAMBO, IN LAKE MALAWI NATIONAL-PARK	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The temporal pattern of breeding by chambo, Oreochromis spp., and the vertical and horizontal distribution of territorial males at the Golden Sands-Chembe beach were examined in the Cape Maclear region of Lake Malawi National Park. The breeding season began in September and ended in April, and the number of breeding males between 3 and 15 m was approximately 25 ha-1. Along the beach studied, the highest concentrations of nests were found at the ends of the beach near rocks, and the lowest number of breeding males occurred in front of Chembe village. Results from experimental gill netting demonstrated that the catches of chambo within the 100-m Lake Malawi National Park ''no fishing zone'' were identical to those outside the 100-m zone, suggesting that fishermen would suffer little or no loss in catch by being encouraged to fish more than 100 m from the shore. Such a reduction in fishing and disturbance of the shallow water breeding grounds would probably enhance the chambo fishery. Preliminary data are provided on the chambo nest forms found in the Cape Maclear region, and further research is suggested to resolve the question of how many species comprise the genus Oreochromis in Lake Malawi.

The sites represented a wide range of environmental conditions, including soils from organic to sand, soil pH from 3.1 to 6.4, elevations from 3 to 529 m, and average number of frost-free days per year from 80 to 162. Habitats included peatlands, streamsides and lakeshores. Spore(-) nodules dominated with 61% of the nodules examined sp(-) and 39% sp(+). Two sites were 100% sp(+), 7 sites were 100% sp(-) and the remaining 25 sites had varying proportions of both types. Overall, sp(+) and mixed sites dominated in the southern interior and coastal regions, areas with lower elevations and longer growing seasons. Spore(-) sites were located primarily in northern and western Maine, areas with higher elevations and shorter growing seasons. In all habitats occurrence of spore(+) nodules was positively correlated with the average number of frost-free days per year (r = 0.57 for peatlands, r = 0.71 for lakeshores and streamsides). In addition, at the 21 lakeshore and streamside sites occurrence of sp(+) nodules was also positively correlated with percent organic matter in the soil (r = 0.56) and negatively correlated with pH (r = - 0.60). Within mixed sites sp(+) and sp(-) nodules were distributed randomly and were often closely intermingled.																			0032-079X	1573-5036					1987	104	1					113	120		10.1007/BF02370633	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02370633													WOS:A1987K931100016
J	BERKES, F				BERKES, F			COMPETITION BETWEEN COMMERCIAL AND SPORT FISHERMEN - AN ECOLOGICAL ANALYSIS	HUMAN ECOLOGY												The competition between the 2 major user groups of fishermen in northeastern Lake Erie is analyzed in terms of models of interspecific competition used in animal ecology. Treating the 2 user groups as 2 cultural species, neither the fishing areas used (geographical distribution of the species) nor the composition of the catch (food of the species) shows significant overlap. Nevertheless, both parties believe that a conflict exists. There are possible explanations for this discrepancy: the conflict may be real in some areas and seasons, even though on the whole there is no significant competition under the usual standards used in ecological niche overlap studies, and the conflict may be due to perceptions, and may therefore be of cultural rather than of ecological origin, suggesting that biological models provide incomplete tools for the analysis of problems in human ecology.																			0300-7839	1572-9915					1984	12	4					413	429		10.1007/BF01531126	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01531126													WOS:A1984APQ1100004

Some groups, notably cnidarians, ctenophores, chaetognaths, annelids and salps contained only small amounts of lipid (0.05-3.4% fresh weight) and the storage lipid was usually triacylglycerol. An exception was a ctenophore tentatively identified as Pleurobrachia sp., which contained a small wax ester droplet close to the gut. Crustaceans usually contained moderate or large amounts of lipid (1.3-19.4% fresh weight) of which a significant proportion was often wax ester, especially in copepods and some euphausiids. There was a significant positive correlation between total lipid content and the proportion of wax ester in the lipid. Freshwater zooplankton from Heywood Lake on Signy Island, South Orkneys, differed from marine species in storing triacylglycerol rather than wax ester, despite a strong seasonal variation in food availability.																			0007-0262						1984		63					57	70																WOS:A1984SS92700004

CONTROL OF SEASONAL RATES OF NET PHOTOSYNTHESIS BY MOISTURE, LIGHT, AND TEMPERATURE IN STEREOCAULON-PASCHALE	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												Changes in rates of respiration and net photosynthesis in S. paschale (L.) Hoffm. in relation to temperature, moisture and light were documented for a woodland population collected in the Abitau-Dunvegan Lake area of the Northwest Territories [Canada]. The temperature optimum for net photosynthesis is about 20-30.degree. C. Maximal rates of net photosynthesis are only developed at low levels (100-150% water content by wt) of thallus saturation, suggesting a good degree of adaptation to the xeric conditions normally found in spruce-lichen woodland. Similarly the relatively high light requirement of 1000 .mu.E [einsteins] .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. s-1 correlates well with the open nature of lichen woodland and especially with the disappearance of S. paschale in old woodland with the closure of the canopy. The sensitivity of S. paschale, when dry, to thermal stress is examined in detail and even the moderate thallus temperature of 35.degree. C is highly stressful to this speices. Surface temperatures in the low arctic are often above 35.degree. C and over recently burnt surfaces, temperatures above 45.degree. C occur on a regular basis. Thus the delayed entry of S. paschale into the successional sequence reflects its extreme sensitivity to thermal stress. With the gradual accumulation of an organic layer and an enhanced retention of soil moisture over the initial 60 yr of succession there is a significant reduction in both the sensible heat flux and the surface temperatures. At the same time, tree growth leads to a sharp decrease in direct radiation, and the combination of these 2 developments results in a much cooler surface and one which can be colonized by Stereocaulon. Thermal stress tolerance of lichens in an air-dry state, to either high or low temperatures may be centrally important to their overall ecology. Furthermore, the net photosynthetic response pattern to temperature, moisture, light and time of year may, play a subordinate role in the ecology of a lichen.																			0008-4026						1978	56	22					2825	2830		10.1139/b78-338	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b78-338													WOS:A1978GB20400003

In fact, the lipid profile of the muscle is strongly subjected to environmental influence and, as a consequence, its use as a parameter allowing 'identification of origin' of the fish products may be possible. omega 3 HUFA (highly unsaturated fatty acids = C 20:5 + C 22:5 + C 22:6) content of fish from Lake Bolsena was lower than in coregonid from Lake Maggiore, while the saturated fraction (SFA) was higher. Fish from Lake Neuchatel showed a lower omega 3 HUFA proportion than in the two other lakes. These data demonstrate that significant differences in fatty acid composition occur in similar fish species living in different lakes. Further studies are required to identify the role of each environmental variable, with special attention to temperature and food range.

For both years an unusually high regression slope of species number on area (z = 0.44) was obtained. On these islands where immigration rates are extremely high, the number of bird species on an island may be determined primarily by the number of species that find an island ecologically suitable. The smaller islands (< 2.6 ha) are near the minimum territory sizes for a majority of the bird species. When islands of increasing size are examined, it appears that a threshold of minimum territory size is reached more or less simultaneously by several species. This tendency results in a rapid increase in species number with increasing island size.																			0014-3820	1558-5646					1979	33	1					468	477		10.2307/2407635	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2407635								28568189					WOS:A1979GV98300019

All nine individuals tracked established a home range for at least three months during the first year after release. Relatively shallow and narrow segments of one reservoir were avoided by radio-tagged individuals and vegetation density in these areas showed typical seasonal fluctuations in contrast to vegetation density in areas grass carp preferred which steadily declined for the duration of the study.

Fresh pollen input to the traps followed the seasonal flowering pattern of the plants in the vicinity of the lake, but some refloated pollen was also caught. Total annual catches of tree pollen and of non-tree pollen varied between years by factors of up to .times. 6.8 and .times. 3.2, respectively. Consideration of weather records suggested that this variation was due to annual differences in pollen production (which is determined partly by climatic factors), rather than to the relative efficiency of pollen dispersal each year. Annual pollen input to the floating traps was significantly lower than to additional unroofed traps put out in woodland, reedswamp and pasture, where high input of pollen from local plants was recorded.

Productivity of the new reservoir was about twice those of the other 2 sites. Possible causes for this increased productivity were examined. Differences in productivity were due to differences in standing stocks of plankters only, and not due to differing photosynthetic efficiencies, better light, or a combination of these factors. Since changes in biomass may be predicted from change in P concentration, these findings support the hypothesis that the increased productivity in new impoundments may be explained by the increase in P concentration.																			0008-4026						1980	58	10					1174	1180		10.1139/b80-146	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b80-146													WOS:A1980JW68000009

Zooplankton enhanced algal productivity during July and Aug., and nocturnal grazers caused greater proportionate increases than did daytime densities. Consumers had neutral or negative effects in Sept. Animal biomass was associated significantly with enhanced productivity for the experiment in late July, and with decreased growth rates in the last trial of Sept. The direct relationship between the activities of zooplankton and primary productivity observed in other lakes is qualified by this seasonal change in net effect.

Plants in the seasonal pool showed a diurnal fluctuation of .apprx. 300 .mu.equivalents titratable acidity g/fresh wt [weight]; daytime deacidification was 75% complete by noon and nighttime acidification was 45% complete by midnight. Late in the season after the pool had dried, emergent leaves showed only a very weak tendency to accumulate acid at night. Plants from the oligotrophic lake had a diurnal change of .apprx. 100 .mu.eq g/fresh wt, daytime deacidification was only 45% complete by noon but nighttime acidification was 80% complete by midnight. Water characteristics were distinctly different between these 2 systems. In the seasonal pool there were marked diurnal changes in temperature, pH, O2 and CO2. Free-CO2 levels were an order of magnitude greater in the early morning than in the late afternoon. In contrast, the conditions in the oligotrophic lake showed no marked diurnal fluctuation, through total inorganic C levels were extremely low relative to other aquatic systems.																			0002-9122	1537-2197					1983	70	6					854	857		10.2307/2442937	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2442937													WOS:A1983QZ34000009

The aim of this work was to evaluate ecological aspects of phytoflagellate populations during the rainy and dry seasons of 2000 and 2001 in floodplain lakes in the Araguaia River. The analyses were based on species richness, composition and biovolume of the phytoflagellates, associated with climatic and limnological variables of the water. The Mantel test showed weak spatial patterns for phytoflagellate populations; moreover the Mantel test confirmed the importance of the local component in the structure of these populations. The results of DCA applied to the biological data showed that high- and low-water periods were not strikingly different in 2000 and 2001. Biovolume data indicated that the phytoplankton was dominated by Chryptophyceae (functional group Y) and Euglenophyceae (functional group W1) in 2000 and 2001. Species richness and biovolume responded to the flood pulse. Both high- and low-water had different dynamics in the two years; this seems to indicate the importance of the flood pulse for phytoflagellates.

J	Popovicová, J				Popovicova, Jarmila			Water quality assessment and ecoregional comparison of a reservoir in east-central Indiana	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												This study assessed water quality of a reservoir in an agricultural watershed of east-central Indiana, examined the effects of a thermal and oxygen regime on cycling of nutrients, and compared the results to ecoregional data and reference guidelines. Two locations were monitored biweekly from May through September 2007 for pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, alkalinity, Secchi disk transparency (SD), chlorophyll a, and nutrient concentrations. The reservoir did not stratify during the monitoring season, although both anoxia and reoxygenation of the hypolimnion were observed. These conditions affected nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycling because nitrification was found to occur in the hypolimnion, and both internal load and water column mixing affected the concentrations and distribution of P. The reservoir was characterized as a eutrophic water body based on SD, total N and chlorophyll a concentrations, while total P concentrations classified the reservoir as slightly hypereutrophic (TSI = 73). This P overload has shifted the system toward N-limiting conditions (molar TN:TP = 18). Comparison of trophic parameters to Ecoregion 55 data placed this reservoir within the 75th percentile, and all parameters exceeded the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency ecoregional reference guidelines. I discuss a potential restoration of this water body to comply with the ecoregional nutrient criteria and to avoid future deterioration associated with N limitation.																			1040-2381	2151-5530					2009	25	2					155	166		10.1080/07438140902905570	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140902905570													WOS:000269667400005

Alteration of Sediment Porewater Associated with a Eurasian Watermilfoil Invasion	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												Competitive advantages possessed by invasive species encourage aggressive growth that ultimately results in loss of native species diversity and richness. Eurasian watermilfoil, Myriophyllum spicatum L., is a non-native invasive macrophyte that has altered native species composition on several trophic levels. In this study, we examined changes in the nitrogen and phosphorus porewater content within sediments underlying areas dominated by M. spicatum and adjacent sediments supporting native macrophytes. Total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) concentrations were significantly greater early in the growing season in porewater underlying an M. spicatum canopy and declined more rapidly early in the growing season under areas dominated by M. spicatum than under native macrophytes. Rapid, early season uptake of TDP may provide a competitive advantage for M. spicatum. Throughout the growing season, total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) concentrations were on average 2 to 3 times greater in porewater from the native macrophyte areas than the M. spicatum dominated areas. A horizontal transect showed similar TDN profiles within 10 m of the M. spicatum bed center. Profiles of TDN at the edge and in the native area were significantly different from all other samples. M,c demonstrated that in Lake George, an oligotrophic lake, M. spicatum influences porewater TDP on a seasonal basis, while porewater TDN concentrations appear to be altered on a longer time scale. The increased microbial activity associated with macrophyte biomass and the possible strengthened nitrification-denitrification coupling may help explain the TDP and TDN profiles, respectively.																			0146-6623					JAN	2009	47						26	31																WOS:000266173800004

Their distribution and production was most influenced by seasonal changes in water temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration. C. zealandicus was more tolerant of low oxygen conditions, hence its dominance in deeper water, C. zealandicus produced three generations and Chironomus sp. a two generations annually. Annual production of C. zealandicus (120.7 g DW m-2) was 4 times that of Chironomus sp. a (30.7 g DW m-2) but production:biomass ratios of the two species were similar and comparable with those obtained from most other studies of Chironomus.																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1986	20	1					47	54		10.1080/00288330.1986.9516128	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1986.9516128													WOS:A1986C331600006

R. differens is sympatric with at least 2 other spp. in the area studied in this work, notably R. flavovirens and R. fuscopunctata. Courtship is primarily based on song. The role of the song in courtship and swarm formation is discussed. Oviposition is in the haulms of grasses and the oviposition site probably has a direct bearing on the synchrony of development and eventual synchrony of swarming. Development of the grass may be linked with the development of R. differens. The development of R. differens from anatrepsis is discussed in relation to the availability of water and the expected times of the 1st rainfall and the emergence of the 1st instar. Eclosion tends to be synchronous. The relationship between the fat reserves of R. differens and its total flight activity is discussed; comparison is made with the non-swarming sympatric species R. flavovirens. The state of the mitochondrial christae of the flight muscles in relation to swarming and age of the insect is considered. R. differens exhibits 6 color forms of which green and brown are the most common. Females have a higher incidence of green than males. The sex ratio within the swarm is discussed and results of sampling under varying conditions are compared with those of previous workers. The parasites of R. differens conditions are compared with those of previous workers. The parasites of R. differens consist mainly of a tachinid fly [Glaucocara flava]. Comments are made on a mite [Berlesia sp.] infecting the sympatric species R. flavovirens. Predators of R. differens (mainly birds, mammals and man) are listed. The pest status of R. differens based mainly on the observations of previous workers is summarized. The behavior of swarms in both rural and urban environments is described in detail. The most important evidence for the total phenology of swarming would be from direct observations in a rural situation. Analyses of 2 principal swarming periods in 1961-1962 and 1964 are given and an attempt is made to correlate the various sightings of these swarms throughout East Africa. Details are provided of the sequential and possibly concurrent diversion of numerous swarms to the lights of Kampala. Such accumulation of small swarms could lead by a snowball effect to the build-up of massive swarms. The subsequent effect of predators is discussed. The seasonality of swarming is discussed in relation to seasonal rainfall, changes in lake levels and changes in grassland and diet. Swarming is governed both by favorable rainfall and unfavorable drought, operating through changes in grasslands. The phenology of swarming in R. differens is discussed within the frame of general theory.																			0022-2933	1464-5262					1978	12	3					259	288		10.1080/00222937800770151	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00222937800770151													WOS:A1978FC21500003
J	JACOBSEN, OW				JACOBSEN, OW			USE OF FEEDING HABITATS BY BREEDING EURASIAN WIGEON	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE												The use of feeding habitats by breeding Eurasian wigeon (Anas penelope) was studied in two lakes in western Norway in 1983 and 1988. During the early and late breeding periods of both years, wigeon preferred to feed on agricultural fields surrounding parts of the lakes. Most individuals preferred to feed among emergent hydrophytes, whereas open water was used less than expected. Beds of floating hydrophytes were not used during the early period but were used in proportion to their availability during the late period. Use of and preference for feeding habitats varied among individuals and lakes and between years. Temporary availability of foods is the most important factor in the birds' selection of terrestrial and aquatic feeding habitats during the breeding season. Because one of the lakes has undergone eutrophication, which has affected the use of feeding habitats by wigeon between years, I suggest that the quality of feeding habitats in this lake can be improved by artificially removing the dense aquatic vegetation that covers much of the surface area. Improvement of the surrounding agricultural fields is another management alternative that could benefit grazing wigeon.																			0008-4301					MAY	1993	71	5					1046	1054		10.1139/z93-138	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z93-138													WOS:A1993LU83400026

The proposed mathematical model is developed starting from a study on modeling duckweed growth as a function of nitrogen carried out by Landesman, affected additionally by phosphorus. salinity and temperature parameters. After fitting the mathematical model to lake conditions, It is introduced to the computational hydrodynamic model to simulate growth of duckweed from January to november, which comprises a dry and a rainy season, characteristic of the area. The results of the simulations are compared with images of the lake from the MODIS the satellite, showing similarities in the areas of higher growth of duckweed. Also an analysis month by month of the results is carried out, finding differences among the dry and rainy seasons; with an increase of the potential of growth of duckweed towards the rainy season in the Lake as well as in the strait of Maracaibo.					del Carmen, Pérez/H-9375-2015														0254-0770					DEC	2008	31						41	49																WOS:000262338800006

The composition of settling particles revealed a dominant influence in lake Pusiano of autochthonous matter (about 80 %). This consisted of biogenic organic material and autochthonously precipitated calcite giving approximately similar contributions on an annual basis. In lake Mezzola, on the contrary, about 86 % of settling materials were estimated to be allochthonous and most of this external load was discharged during the thaw. Estimated mass fluxes of organic C, N, P, Fe and Mn were 133; 17; 3; 10; 3 and 113; 12; 11; 370; 13 g/m(2) yr, respectively in lakes Pusiano and Mezzola and the corresponding sedimentation rates were 1300 and 11400 g/m(2) yr. The flux of inorganic carbon was 90 g/m(2) yr in lake Pusiano while it was practically absent in Mezzola. Redfield type ratios in settling particles agreed well with the POC/PN ratio expected for biogenic matter while they showed deviations in the case of POC/PP and PN/PP ratios. These were probably due to the overlapping of the sorption/desorption processes to biological binding in the case of lake Pusiano and to the dominance of allochthonous particles in the Mezzola.

The relative abundance of psychrophiles/psychrotrophs and mesophiles varied with season, but psychrophilic/psychrotrophic bacteria predominated on every sampling occasion. A considerable number of the 37.degree. C isolates were psychrotrophs having broad temperature ranges for growth. An especially notable result was the isolation of psychrophiles on every sampling occasion, and in such high numbers, from this nonpermanently cold environment. A total of 388 isolates were described according to Gram reaction, colony and cell morphology, biochemical activities and thermal type, and on the basis of similarities they were grouped into 158 working types. Many of the working types were capable of gelatinase, amylase, chitinase and lipase production. A comparison of the generation times of the psychrophilic/psychrotrophic and mesophilic working types with their frequencies of occurrence, for all 4 samplings, did not reveal a direct relationship between numerical predominance and growth rate as determined by temperature.																			0008-4166	1480-3275					1980	26	10					1184	1191		10.1139/m80-198	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/m80-198								7459708					WOS:A1980KN38700003
J	MUNAWAR, M; MUNAWAR, IF				MUNAWAR, M; MUNAWAR, IF			GEORGIAN BAY PHYTOPLANKTON - ECOLOGY AND RESPONSE TO CONTAMINANTS	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The phytoplankton productivity of Georgian Bay was studied during 1974. Lakewide samples were collected at 16 stations during monthly cruises from April to December and identification and enumeration was carried out by the Utermohl technique. Contaminant bioassays with metals added singly and as a mixture were performed in 1980 and 1981. Based on an overall average, Diatomeae (36-73%) was the most prevalent component of phytoplankton biomass followed by Chrysophycease (5-38%), and Cyanophyta (3-27%). Biomass means of all stations by cruise indicated a range of 0.35 to 0.61 g .cntdot. m-3 with a bimodal seasonal pattern. Although ultraplankton made the highest mean percent contribution of the biomass (37%), the other size assemblages such as < 5 .mu.m (26%) and netplankton (29%) were not unimportant. Size fractionation of primary productivity during 1974 revealed that a major portion of photosynthesis (39-70%) was in the < 20 .mu.m size fraction. Algal Fractionation Bioassays conducted during 1980 and 1981 indicated a significant inhibition of ultraplankton productivity. Additional bioassays with single metals and in combination showed differential toxicity to various phytoplankton size assemblages. The phytoplankton biomass and floristic composition indicate the Georgian Bay ecosystem to be oligotrophic. This ecosystem appears to be controlled by the physical dynamics of thermal and flow regimes. Compared with other Great Lakes, the low P/B quotients recorded in oligotrophic Georgian Bay is enigmatic and may be attributable to the observed sensitivity of phytoplankton to contaminants originating from anthropogenic and natural sources.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN 20	1988	163						95	117		10.1007/BF00026923	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00026923													WOS:A1988P512800009

J	LEMLY, AD; DIMMICK, JF				LEMLY, AD; DIMMICK, JF			STRUCTURE AND DYNAMICS OF ZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITIES IN THE LITTORAL-ZONE OF SOME NORTH-CAROLINA LAKES	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Species composition and seasonal dynamics of zooplankton in the littoral zone were studied in 3 piedmont North Carolina lakes for 1 yr. Nygaard''s compound index indicated oligotrophic conditions in Belews Lake and eutrophic conditions in Salem Lake and Lake 150. A total of 32 spp. of zooplankton were found in the samples. Significantly fewer species of truely littoral zooplankton were present in the oligotrophic lake regardless of season (P < 0.05). Eutrophication appears to favor increased diversity in zooplankton of the littoral zone. Habitat heterogeneity, provided by a well-developed littoral zone containing aquatic macrophytes, may be the major factor contributing to the maintenance of more taxa of zooplankton in eutrophic systems. Distinct taxa of Cladocera and Copepoda are present in the littoral zone, exhibiting seasonal dynamics that are largely different from the limnetic fauna. Such dynamics may result from predation by characteristically limnetic species of cyclopoid copepods which seek prey in the littoral zone. The numerical and seasonal abundance of predators and prey are inversely related and the true littoral taxa, represented in the present study by the genera Alona, Chydorus, Pleuroxus, Sida, Simocephalus and Eucyclops, contained no predaceous species. The seasonal dynamics of these genera are very similar even in widely separated geographical regions, indicating that the factor(s) responsible operate independently of climatic and chemical variables. Intrazooplankton predation appears to be a more plausable explanation than segregation along depth which, although consistent with data from studies of limnetic waters, cannot be related to populations of zooplankton in shallow littoral areas.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1982	88	3					299	307		10.1007/BF00008511	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008511													WOS:A1982NJ86500009

J	NIEMI, GJ; HANOWSKI, JM				NIEMI, GJ; HANOWSKI, JM			EFFECTS OF A TRANSMISSION-LINE ON BIRD POPULATIONS IN THE RED LAKE PEATLAND, NORTHERN MINNESOTA	AUK												The effects of a 500-kV transmission line on bird populations were assessed by comparing paired treatment areas [which included a transmission line and right-of-way (ROW)] with similar control areas in 6 different habitat types during the breeding and migration seasons. Habitat structure was measured to examine the inherent differences between control and treatment areas. Using 2 census methods, territorial mapping and transect counts, it was determined that sedge wrens and LeConte''s sparrows had lower breeding-population densities in treatment areas than in control areas. LeConte''s sparrows and Connecticut warblers occurred at greater mean distances from the transmission line in treatment areas than from a similarly positioned line in control areas. Fifteen paired t-tests (5 habitats in 3 yr), in which territorial mapping data were used, revealed that community densities were lower in 1 treatment habitat (high shrub) in 1 of 3 yr (P < 0.05). A 2-way analysis of variance with transect counts was not confirmatory when yearly variation was included. Transect counts revealed lower population densities in 1 treatment habitat (low shrub) in 2 of 3 yr (P < 0.05). Greater species richness (P < 0.05) was observed in 2 treatment habitats (closed spruce and sedge fen) than in controls. Treatment habitats were most similar in habitat structure to their paired control habitats, but each habitat of the pair was significantly different (P < 0.05) from the other in at least 2 of 10 habitat characteristics analyzed. It is suggested that avian differences observed between paired areas were primarily attributable to the inherent habitat differences between control and treatment areas and the new habitat created under the transmission line. Data indicated negligible effects of this transmission line on bird populations, but interpretations are difficult, because the effects varied with habitat, season and method considered. Postimpact studies, which compare control and treatment areas, are less effective than before-and-after studies, because differences in habitat structure exist between any 2 areas.																				1938-4254					1984	101	3					487	498		10.1093/auk/101.3.487	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/auk/101.3.487													WOS:A1984TE21500006

Behaviour was classified into three major categories: foraging, leafing and other behaviour. For all three species, foraging went on throughout the daylight hours but the level was variable both in the dry and wet seasons and between species. For all three species, foraging basically consisted of standing-and-waiting. The Great White Egret spent more time foraging than the other two species. Overlap between species in foraging activity on an hourly basis was high during most hours of the day implying that ecological separation through temporal partitioning of daylight hours is negligible.																			0030-6525					MAR	2000	71	1-2					127	130		10.1080/00306525.2000.9639889	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00306525.2000.9639889													WOS:000088246100030

SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION AND RESOURCE PARTITIONING IN ZOOPLANKTIVOROUS FISH ASSEMBLAGES	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The distribution and the feeding ecology of Alestes baremoze Joannis and Brycinus nurse Ruppell in Gebel Aulia reservoir, on the White Nile were investigated. A third, species, Alestes dentex (L.) was found at lower population densities and was included in the food analysis. The co-occurrence of A. baremoze and B. nurse in Gebel Aulia reservoir provided a good opportunity to elucidate their habitat preferences and choice of food. All three species have been described as zooplanktivorous but with a large dietary spectrum including other feeding habits. The spatial distribution and specific mode of food selection in Gebel Aulia reservoir results in a clear pattern of resource partitioning between the two species. A. baremoze was most abundant in the surface stratum of the open lake. B. nurse exhibited high population densities.in the littoral zone but in the open water moved from the bottom to the surface at night. At periods of low zooplankton densities the diet of both species consisted, to a large extent, of macrophytes and detritus. At high zooplankton densities both species coexisted on this resource, but B. nurse had a greater tendency to include other food, e.g. airborne insects. Food selectivity by A. dentex was more similar tot that shown by A. baremoze. The migratory behaviour during the reproductive period indicate that all three species are basically riverine, but with a high flexibility to cope with the seasonally varying features of larger rivers and their flood zones. They are successful in exploiting zooplankton in reservoirs and lakes in the absence of a specific zooplanktivorous fish.																			0018-8158					JAN 31	1993	250	3					187	199		10.1007/BF00008589	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008589													WOS:A1993KP36300005

The presence of laminations may reflect either regular changes within the lake ecosystem itself or variation in the intensity of erosion and transport of material from the catchment, particularly where instability in the lake-watershed system has occurred as a result of human activities. The principal cause of lamination is seasonal variation of environmental conditions, particularly climate. Lakes with laminated sediments tend to be deep, exhibit a strong seasonal stratification and be situated in areas of continental climate. The 1st reported instance of a long sequence of laminated lake sediments from Great Britain is described. Unlike most of the previous examples, these have been formed in a shallow, polymictic lake, in an oceanic climate.																			0028-0836	1476-4687					1981	290	5803					238	241		10.1038/290238a0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/290238a0													WOS:A1981LG28700042

The half-saturation constant (Kt) for assimilation of NO3- was about 12 .mu.g N l-1 in the epilimnion (3 m) and mid-hypolimnion (20 m), and increased to about 50 .mu.g N l-1 in the aphotic-lower hypolimnion (25 m). A similar pattern was evident for NH4+ in 1979 (Kt = 2.7, 2.6, and 9.3 .mu.g l-1 at 3, 20 and 25 m, respectively) but not 1980 (Kt = 7.0, 14.0, and 6.0 .mu.g N l-1 at 3, 20 and 25 m, respectively). The trend in Kt values paralleled the availability of DIN to the phytoplankton at the various depths. Relatively low NH4+ enrichments (.simeq. 5 .mu.g NH4+-N l-1) strongly inhibited assimilation of NO3- at 3 m. Assimilation of NO3- was less sensitive to NH4+ at 20 m (.simeq. 40 .mu.g NH4+ N l-3 was required to inhibit NO3- assimilation) and was not affected by NH4+ concentration up to about 75 .mu.g N l-1 at 25 m. This strategy appears advantageous to the phytoplankton because NH4+ is the primary source of nitrogenous nutrition at 3 m while NO3- may be a more important nitrogen source below 20 m. The seasonal persistence of the deep-water phytoplankton maximum in Castle Lake appears to be dependent to a large extent on the adaptations of these organisms to the ambient DIN supply.																			0030-1299	1600-0706					1985	45	1					137	147		10.2307/3565231	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3565231													WOS:A1985APJ2000017

Its seasonal variation in 3 Norfolk broads was examined and, except for N-fixing species, it varied independently of the algal species composition. A good inverse correlation with the particulate N to C ratio was found. The seasonal variation in the pigment ratio was considerably affected by measurable lake concentrations of inorganic N supplied from the catchment. Other sources of N such as N fixation and release from the sediment were also indicated by changes in the ratio. By comparison with the distinctions of extreme, moderate and no N deficiency for the N/C ratio, values for the pigment ratio of < 1.4, 1.4-2.4 and > 2.4 indicated no, moderate and extreme N deficiency, respectively, in the phytoplankton. The relationship is attributed to the measurement of secondary carotenoids in response to N deficiency.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1979	9	6					585	594		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1979.tb01541.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1979.tb01541.x													WOS:A1979HU66600008

The highest number of captures and smallest sizes have been observed beneath floating macrophyte meadows. This suggests that these meadows serve a nursery habitats. The densities registered in the Amazon river were three times lower than in the lake. Maximum densities were recorded during low-water periods, while minimum densities were found during high water periods. These results point to a relationship between current force and catchability. In the floodplain lake, prawn abundance seems to be related to macrophyte expansion during the periods of rising water; the lowest captures were registered at high water, which is probably due to the spatial dispersion as the water volume increases. River prawn populations are characterized by larger sizes than the ones in the lake. They show a well-marked pattern of seasonal variation in size, with larger sizes found during periods of rising water and smaller sizes predominating during high-water periods. On the contrary, lagoonal prawns show maximum sizes during high-water, and smallest sizes during low-water periods. Despite its good fishing potential (up to 200 g/trap), the native prawn is not exploited in the Amazonas, but imported from the State of Para. Artesanal prawn fishing in floodplain lakes, or extensive culture in ponds for carnivorous fish or human consumption, can be a commercially lucrative activity for sustainable regional economic development.																			0065-6755						1993	12	3-4					399	413																WOS:A1993NT90500004

J	EVANS, SP; TREVISAN, M				EVANS, SP; TREVISAN, M			A SOIL WATER-BALANCE BUCKET MODEL FOR PALEOCLIMATIC PURPOSES .2. MODEL APPLICATION TO LATE HOLOCENE CLIMATE	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												The paper describes the application of the Soil Water-Balance Bucket Model (SWBBM), version B, to outline potential Holocene climate conditions leading to water fluctuations at the Lagoni peat-bog (Mercurago, Northern Italy). These are reconstructed from a series of radiocarbon-dated peat cores taken along present-day shores. Attention focuses on an event occurring during the late Sub-Boreal (4000-3000 years before present [BP]), during which peat recedes and subsequently expands, indicating reduced and increased water availability, respectively. This period is associated with a major change in human settlement patterns, both at local and regional scales, the appearance and disappearance of Bronze age lake-dwelling sites in Northern Italy; settlement patterns shift from the low plains of the Po valley to the upper plain and hills of the pre-Alpine system. Palynological data indicate no shift in mesic regional vegetation while changes are documented at the local scale, with an increase in hygrophilous vegetation as a response to raised lake levels. SWBBM/B, using a limited number of input climate parameters (temperature, precipitation and insolation), quantifies changes in soil hydrology parameters (evapotranspiration, soil water, percolation and runoff). Modern climate at the site is perturbed with insolation, temperature and precipitation altered to obtain variations in percolation and runoff, without varying evapotranspiration. Results show that 10% seasonal differences in total precipitation, with only a minor temperature change < 1 degrees C, lead to 30% changes in percolation and runoff but with no change in evapotranspiration. It appears that for this minor climatic shift in the late Sub-Boreal, palynological evidence does not seem to be a suitable proxy-climate indicator at regional scales. This results from sensitivity of lake levels and vegetation to different components of the hydrological cycle.																			0304-3800	1872-7026				OCT	1995	82	2					131	138		10.1016/0304-3800(94)00083-T	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3800(94)00083-T													WOS:A1995RV45400002

Techniques used were chemical extractions of P forms from core fractions and the incubation of undisturbed cores in the laboratory under ambient conditions of temperature and dissolved O2. The uptake of P during aerobic periods agreed with previously observed trends in that the amount sorbed was proportional to overlying P concentration supporting an adsorption type of model. P was given off during anoxic periods; however, the specific release rates could not be correlated with the gradient of interstitial P to overlying P concentrations as reported by others. Rather, release rates were closely correlated with average interstitial P concentrations. A diffusion model was presented, applicable to systems similar to those studied, in which soluble interstitial P varied from a greatly elevated concentration in close proximity to sediment particle surfaces to levels approaching those of overlying P.																			0043-1354	1879-2448					1978	12	9					677	685		10.1016/0043-1354(78)90178-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(78)90178-1													WOS:A1978FR24600006

Grain size characteristics of the beach, streams. cliffs and nearshore/offshore sedimentary environments are distinct, with variability being related to sediment supply, beach altitude and process conditions. Beach grain sizes range from silt to cobble, and are predominantly rounded discs and blades. There is an overall trend of offshore fining with increasing depth, beyond the mixed surf zone and clear limit of coarse sediment (coarser than -1 phi), resulting from dominant shore-normal process trends. Seasonal trends of water lever fluctuation, sediment discharge and transfer from river to beach are important controls on local scale variability. The broader significance is that local physiography, sediment characteristics and supply strongly influence beach sedimentology and morphological response, even in the context of larger scale climate change. The record of sedimentological variability detailed here is significant for beach management projects and a better understanding of lake sedimentary Facies within the Quaternary.																			0305-8719		1-86239-070-3				2000	175						123	138		10.1144/GSL.SP.2000.175.01.11	http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/GSL.SP.2000.175.01.11													WOS:000166812500011

Water samples were collected in the upper layer (0-10 m until end of 2001, and 0-20 in after 2001) using an integral sampler (Pelletier et Orand, 1978). After lugol fixation and sedimentation in Utermohl chambers, the organisms were identified and counted using an? inverted ZEISS microscope. Relative abundance of diatoms in phytoplankton showed large variations (from 0.1% to 91% of phytoplankton biomass) depending on the season and the year. Most abundant taxa were Asterionella formosa, Fragilaria crotonensis and Ulnaria ulna f. angustissima found respectively in 88%, 83% and 66% of the samples. Stephanodiscus minutulus, with 62% presence was very abundant from 1974 to 1980, and decreased after Diatoma tenuis was the diatom which showed the highest biomass (11,6 mg/L(-1), august 9, 2001) along the entire studied period. Compared to the other algal classes, Mougeotia gracillima (colonial Zygophyceae) reached 39,0 mg/L(-1) on July 25 2007. Nine diatom taxa reached a biomass over 1 mg/L(-1) 124 diatom taxa were identified during the studied period, compared to 538 diatom taxa already recorded in the lake from 1852 to nowadays (Druart and Balvay 2007). Dynamic of the most abundant taxa are compared. Art artificial neural networks analysis was used, an emergent self organizing map was computed. 8 diatom communities (groups of sampling sites) were identified with this analysis.

The spawning run of the salmon (299 females and 276 males) was observed in the river from March to April 1989. The sex ratio (males per female) was regarded as nearly 1.0, and this suggested that river-resident precocious males were very scarce in the river. Mean fork lengths and weights of spawners were 56.3 cm and 1,715 g, respectively. The rate of return was estimated as 1.07% for MC and 0.95% for MJ. No difference between either rate was observed though they were released at different sizes and times. Eyed-stage eggs and alevins were found in the river after the spawning season. These indicated that there is a high possibility of population establishment in the lake by the small parr release of masu salmon.																			0021-5392					NOV	1992	58	11					2009	2017																WOS:A1992KB88700002
J	FILLMORE, SJ; PARRY, EHO				FILLMORE, SJ; PARRY, EHO			EVOLUTION OF PERIPARTAL HEART-FAILURE IN ZARIA, NIGERIA - SOME ETIOLOGIC FACTORS	CIRCULATION												The subsequent course of 173 women with severe congestive heart failure hospitalized within 6 mo. of delivery was analyzed after 4-7 yr follow-up periods. Normotensive women (47) and 50 women hypertensive only during the initial 48 h had little long term morbidity. Women (36) with hypertension initially improved, but many are now showing enlarging cardiac silhouettes. Morbidity is increasing in this group. A similar, less severe pattern is developing in 36 women with intermittent hypertension. The uniquely high incidence of this condition in Zaria is associated with several locale factors. These Hausa-Fulani women eat large quantities of a local lake salt, kanwa, for 40 days postpartum. The syndrome is markedly more common in the hot rainy season, when evaporative water loss is less, than in the dry season. The 1st postpartum days are spent confined to bed in a small heated room. Once or twice daily the new mother is given hot baths with branches which were dipped in boiling water. The combination of excessive Na intake and diminished evaporative water excretion seems to precipitate failure in normotensive and hypertensive patients.																			0009-7322	1524-4539					1977	56	6					1058	1061		10.1161/01.CIR.56.6.1058	http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/01.CIR.56.6.1058								923045					WOS:A1977ED62100024

Surface areas of individual macrophytes were determined throughout the study period through the use of a non-miscible surfactant and a calibration curve of surfactant weight vs. known, calculated surface areas. Mean total surface area available for epiphytic colonization during the study period was 1.032 m2 macrophyte surface/m2 of littoral zone for Phragmites, 0.810 m2 for Potamogeton, and 0.167 m2 for Nuphar. Seasonal rates of mean primary productivity of algal epiphytes on Phragmites from the surface to the light-compensation depth ranged from 84-1406 mg C m-2 littoral zone d-1; ranges for epiphytes on Potamogeton and Nuphar were 77-586 and 69-268 mg C m-2 littoral zone d-1, respectively. Maximum rates were observed typically during June; minimum rates were observed typically during Aug.-Dec. Mean daily productivity rates over the 12 mo. period were for epiphytes on Potamogeton 167.0, on Nuphar 100.4 and on Phragmites 671.2 mg C m-2 littoral zone d-1. Calculated annual production for epiphytes on Nuphar was 36.65, on Potamogeton 60.95 and on Phragmites 245.0 g C m-2 littoral zone yr-1. Epiphytic production data were typically considerably higher than production data obtained for littoral and pelagial planktonic algae and compare favorably with published data for epiphytic and periphytic production in Lawrence Lake, Marion Lake, and Borax Lake.																			0105-9327						1981	4	3					155	160																WOS:A1981MJ26700002

By the method of seasonal reconstructions, the annual mean increments of three species of mosses were obtained, and, also on the basis of these data, the absolute net production in the zone of vegetation was found. In two lakes, the annual means of absolute net production of aquatic mosses were 32-41 g/m(2), while in the third lake, they were markedly higher, at 155 g air-dry mass m(-2) year(-1). The obtained results and characteristics of aquatic mosses are compared with those for other acidified lakes of Europe.

The main chemical component of drift was organic carbon, four fractions of which were distinguished: dissolved (DOC), fine particulate (FPOC), coarse (COPC) and large particulate organic carbon (LPOC). The most important of these was DOC, representing 88-100% of the TOC transported. Among the POC, the finest fraction (FPOC) prevailed, constituting as much as 98.3% of dry weight of the particulate matter. There were no significant differences between the average content of CPOC and LPOC, although significant seasonal changes were observed. Concentrations of both dissolved and particulate forms of carbon decreased with distance downriver, but that of POC diminished faster, possibly because of the effect of the lake.

At least 57 species in 15 families were identified among the 2003 individuals collected; 24 species were common to both sites. The length of the flight period of these adults, on average, was significantly longer than that observed at four temperate sites in eastern North America. Most probably, this is related to the warmer temperature regime associated with the Mediterranean climate of the California Coast Range. When years with varying amounts of precipitation were compared, the annual variability of Coast Range Trichoptera (as measured by year-to-year changes in population abundances) were found to be similar to annual variability observed for other temperate caddisfly faunas. When precipitation amounts were similar, year-to-year differences in caddisfly abundance were reduced.																			0031-0603	2162-0237				JAN	1987	63	1					75	91																WOS:A1987G178300012
J	Harris, IWE				Harris, IWE			Some factors affecting density and richness of invertebrate populations in the near-shore sediments of the St. Clair River, 1990-1995	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												Richness (the number of families/sample site) and density (the number of invertebrates/sq m) of benthic populations were measured from Lake Huron to the delta on Lake St. Clair. A sampling schedule was established over a six-year sampling period (1990-1995) to estimate yearly and seasonal effects between May and October (year-weeks 20-40), river flow rate, nutrient levels, sediment particle size distribution, vegetation density and downstream distance. Nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations in the shoreline sediment, used as measures of nutrients, were obtained from internal reports of the Ontario Ministry of the Environment and the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers and from personal correspondence. A total of twenty six fixed sites were sampled; eight for three consecutive years (1990-1992), eight for three consecutive years (1993-1995) and ten for six consecutive years (1990-1995). Regression analysis showed richness and density of invertebrate populations to be positively associated with total phosphorous in the sediment, week number (20-40) and finer sediments. Richness was, in addition, negatively associated with the year of sampling (1990-1995). Evidence of long-term cyclic variations in density at the family level was found. Frequency of occurrence of most invertebrate orders increased with distance downstream.																			0008-3550					OCT-DEC	1999	113	4					576	584																WOS:000084720700003
J	OHANJANIAN, IA				OHANJANIAN, IA			FOOD FLIGHTS OF RED-NECKED GREBES DURING THE BREEDING-SEASON	JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY												Red-necked Grebes (Podiceps grisegena) nested behind a dyke at Creston, British Columbia, and flew up to 2.5 km to an adjacent lake to forage for their young. Other Red-necked Grebes nested on the same lake and swam to foraging areas accompanied by their young. There were significant differences in size of prey chosen for chicks by "fliers" and "swimmers." As predicted by central place foraging theory, birds that flew to and from foraging areas, at a higher energetic cost, chose larger prey than those that foraged with their chicks. Small fish (< 50 mm in length) were avoided by "fliers," although "swimmers" fed such fish to their young. "Fliers" also took a greater proportion of large fish (> 75 mm in length) from the lake than did the "swimmers." Yellow perch was the preferred prey species; however, grebes broadened their diet to include more pumpkinseed and bass following a year-class failure of perch. The effect of flying to forage on an individual''s lifetime reproductive output is unknown.																			0273-8570	1557-9263				SPR	1989	60	2					143	153																WOS:A1989U945600003

Herbivorous cyclopoids, Paracyclops fimbriatus (Fischer) and Eucyclops serrulatus (Fischer) peaked in June and July-Aug., respectively. Cladocerans peaked in July-Aug. Carnivorous Cyclops cf. abyssorum Sars had peaks in May, June and Sept. Megacyclops viridis (Jurine) peaked in July-Aug. By repeated siphoning from mud, species were divided into epi- and infauna. Eurycercus lamellatus Mull. and Acroperus harpae Baird belonged to 1st category and Macrothrix hirsuticornis Norman and Brady to the 2nd. Comparatively large epifauna species (E. lamellatus and A. harpae) were much more common in the south than in the north basin, possibly because of more fish predation in the north basin. The small Alona rectangula Sars was epifaunal in the north basin in contrast to its infaunal habit in the south basin. The infaunal M. hirsuticornis was dominant in the north but scarce in the south basin, possibly due to competition with chironomids. An abrupt decline in the cladoceran abundance did not coincide with an increase in invertebrate predators, but could possibly be related to an increase in fry of the numerous stickle-back population. C. cf. abyssorum behaved more as a benthic than a planktic species in the north basin, but in the south basin the difference was less clear.																			0030-1299	1600-0706					1979	32	1-2					195	201		10.2307/3544227	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3544227													WOS:A1979HJ61200011

The incidence of crayfish in the diet increased, particularly in brown trout, over the period 1972-1977. The proportion of the trout''s diet comprising C. destructor increased with length of brown trout but not with length of rainbow trout. The size of crayfish ingested was positively correlated with fish length for both species of trout, although rainbow trout tended to ingest smaller crayfish than brown trout of equivalent size. Analysis of the crayfish''s diet revealed predominantly plant material. Spawning by the crayfish was apparently confined to the period December-April. The abundance of C. destructor in Lake Eucumbene was apparently low until about 1970 but increased between 1972-1977. A decline in the average size of brown and rainbow trout in the angler catch occurred from 1959-1960 until 1977-1978. Hypotheses are suggested for the increase of the crayfish population since impoundment of the lake (1957). Factors considered include predation by trout and the biology of the crayfish, particularly related to its occurrence in this lake, which has fluctuating water levels and a short season suitable for growth and spawning.																			0067-1940						1983	34	3					407	417																WOS:A1983QS89000005
J	JONES, RC				JONES, RC			APPLICATION OF A PRIMARY PRODUCTION-MODEL TO EPIPHYTIC ALGAE IN A SHALLOW, EUTROPHIC LAKE	ECOLOGY												A modification of Fee''s phytoplankton model was used to calculate the production of algae epiphytic on the submersed macrophyte Myriophyllum spicatum in shallow, eutrophic Lake Wingra, Wisconsin [USA]. The model involved integration of 4 basic relationships using time- and depth-stepped difference equations: depth distribution of algal biomass, photosynthesis per unit biomass as a function of light intensity, irradiance-depth relationship, and diurnal variation in surface irradiance. Epiphyte production in the littoral zone of Lake Wingra, measured (as C) for two growing seasons, was 29-38 g .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. yr-1, placing the lake at the lower range of reported values. Since epiphyte production was 48-79% of macrophyte production, well within the reported range, the lower production values resulted from less dense weedbeds (lower substrate availability) rather than lower density of epiphytes. Algal biomass defined the upper bound for production, while irradiance levels on each day determined actual production by decreasing this potential by varying degrees. Other parameters of the production model, such as light extinction coefficient and photosynthetic parameters, explained little of variation in production. These results emphasize the importance of accurately determining the quantity and vertical distribution of attached algal biomass when making production estimates.

The fish were weighed, state of maturity determined and RNA-DNA ratio of white muscle was measured. Water temperature and primary production were measured in the lake. RNA-DNA ratio declined during the spawning season, reaching a low in mid-May, then increased steadily during the remainder of the year. RNA-DNA ratio was significantly correlated with body weight. The correlation was improved if RNA-DNA ratio was paired with weight for the following wk. The correlation was further improved when the spawning season was removed from the data set. Both weight and RNA-DNA ratios were significantly correlated with water temperature, as expected. The correlations were again improved if water temperature was paired with weight and RNA-DNA values for the following wk. Weight and RNA-DNA ratio were also correlated with primary production when the correlation was made with concurrent values, and the correlations were improved when RNA-DNA ratio or weight were paired with primary production values for the previous mo.

Between July 1993 and June 1994, the planktonic crustacean assemblages of these systems were dominated by seven clacloceran species and five copepod species. Specific richness ranged from 13 species in TF to 16 species in T, out of a total 20 species. Nine species were common to all three systems, while the rest were absent from at least one reservoir. Canonic correspondence analysis showed that the structure and seasonal variation of these assemblages are regulated by factors directly related (transparency and dissolved oxygen) or inversely related (turbidity, temperature, mineralization and eutrophication) to the altitude at which the reservoirs are located. TF had the lowest levels of mineralization and the lowest specific richness, as well as the highest plankton diversity and mean density, while T had the highest mineralization and highest specific richness, but showed the lowest density. Crustacean mean size was smaller in T than in TF, possibly due to predation by fish in the former system and the presence of fish predators (waterfowl) in the latter, as well as the impact of the different hydrological regime and release schedules of the reservoirs.

Both spatial and temporal variations in productivity were observed. For the August 1997 field trip, productivities on the mainstem reservoir ranged from 485 to 1,243 mgC/m(2)/d, with an average value of 783 mgC/m(2)/d. Temporal differences between the August and October trips varied by as much as 880 mgC/m(2)/d. The data are compared to measurements taken over a four-year period to determine subtle, long-term changes in the water quality. Productivity at Lake Roosevelt is heavily influenced by tributary inflow, and generally increased in the reservoir reaches below the mouths of the tributaries. Mainstem sites between the tributaries had lower productivities than the upstream and downstream tributary sites, indicating that nutrients may be rapidly utilized in the immediate vicinity of the inflows. However, productivities in the tributary arms were consistently low, despite the fact that their physicochemical properties stimulated growth in the reservoir. The productivity data illustrate the difficulty in characterizing a large water body as a homogeneous quantity in terms of assessing loading impacts. The results also demonstrate that long-term changes in water quality can be masked by short-term events. The longterm trend is that Lake Roosevelt, a eutrophic/mesotrophic lake, is becoming an oligotrophic lake, but seasonal rainfall events influence the lake's specific characterization.																			0733-9372	1943-7870				AUG	1999	125	8					747	754		10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9372(1999)125:8(747)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9372(1999)125:8(747)													WOS:000081511200009

On the other hand, high values in December were utilized effectively radiant energy by accessory pigments of blue green alga, Aphanothece clathrata dominated. Changes of areal efficiencies epsilon-BAR within the euphotic layer were related mainly to primary productivity of phytoplankton.

There are many cases to illustrate the link of increased P levels with accelerated eutrophication and concomitant deterioration of water quality. In this paper the effect of water inflow and outflow reductions on the trophic status in lakes is analysed in P terms. The ecosystem analysis refers to a multi-annual time-scale, avoiding seasonal fluctuations and taking into account substantial changes during long periods. Steady-state conditions are assumed and P balances are modelled. Several types of system are described: stratified and nonstratified structures with Batch and Chemostat mechanisms. The characteristics of each type is defined by P-flow patterns. A case study of Lake Kinneret (Israel) is presented. It is concluded that the reduction of outflow will cause an increase of P content in the system.																			0304-3800					JUL	1992	62	1-3					135	147		10.1016/0304-3800(92)90086-T	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3800(92)90086-T													WOS:A1992JB86100008

Flight patterns of these trips showed seasonal and diurnal variation in departure and arrival time, in flock size and in flight direction. Surveys of all wetlands in Greece to a radius of 315 km from Lake Mikri Prespa revealed that White Pelicans utilized different food areas at the various stages of their breeding season, traveling daily distances ranging to 177 km one way. Early in the breeding period, pelicans flew a minimum round trip of 66 km to Lake Kastoria to obtain and return to the nesting colony for the night. As the season progressed, pelicans few daily roundtrips of 354 km from Lake Mikri Prespa to Lake Kerkini and Axios delta. After chicks fledged, a number of White Pelicans remained overnight on the feeding grounds. Conservation of this endangered species in Europe requires protected not only of the breeding habitat in Lake Mikri Prespa but of the wetlands used for foraging, as well.																			0738-6028						1989	12	1					43	50		10.2307/1521311	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1521311													WOS:A1989AD85600007
J	CALJON, AG				CALJON, AG			A RECENTLY LANDLOCKED BRACKISH-WATER LAGOON OF LAKE TANGANYIKA - PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS, AND SPATIOTEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION OF PHYTOPLANKTON	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Monthly measurements of physical and chemical characteristics were made at two localities in the eastern part of a recently landlocked lagoon of Lake Tanganyika. Variables analysed were: temperature, pH, conductivity, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, carbonate, bicarbonate, chloride and sulphate. Large seasonal fluctuations of salinity were recorded (1.68-8.21 g l-1). The seasonal water input controlled algal seasonality mainly through its effect on salinity and indirectly through its influence on nutrient concentration by dissolution and dilution of the excrements of the numerous cattle and other organic matter. Phytoplankton was mainly composed of Cyanophyta and Euglenophyta. Euglenophyta dominated during the dry periods with high salinity and probably very high nutrient levels, while Cyanophyta preferred moderate salt and nutrient concentrations during the rainy periods. The phytoplankton community was composed of a large number of perennial and a reduced quantity of annual organisms. A spatial study of the recently landlocked lagoon revealed an ascending salinity gradient, principally due to a sodium bicarbonate/carbonate enrichment, between locations near the lake and more inland situated stations. These facts point to a lake water supply and a salt concentration by evaporation in the swamps. Proportionally lower magnesium, calcium and potassium values were recorded at high salinities, due to chemical precipitation and biotic factors. A blue-green algal bloom was observed in the eastern water-body (salinity; 4.64 g l-1); simultaneously an important development of diatoms dominated the western water-body (salinity: 2.18 g l-1). No significant differences in morphometry, exposure, water temperature or nutrient levels (nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, orthophosphate) were observed. The relatively low salinity and high nutrient concentration in the western water-body probably favoured diatom development during the rainy season. The relatively higher salinity in the eastern water-body during the rainy season was probably responsible for the dominance of blue-green algae through its negative influence on silica concentration and notwithstanding the high inorganic nitrogen concentration.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				OCT 9	1987	153	1					55	70		10.1007/BF00005504	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00005504													WOS:A1987K081300005

The potential yearly number of generations was 15.8 at Msabaha, 6.6 at Nairobi and 13.1 at Mbita Point. Average developmental time from egg deposition to adult emergence was 23.1, 54.9 and 27.8 days, respectively. The longest, 77.3 days, was recorded in Nairobi and the shortest, 19.4 days, at Msabaha. The survival rate varied little seasonally at the coast but was erratic inland, with some generations failing and others successful. Larvae offered a choice of maize and stargrass (Cynodon dactylon) showed a preference for stargrass. Survival was higher on stargrass than on maize but the developmental time was longer. Mortality was higher in the larval stage. In all generations and at all locations, death was usually caused by a nuclear polyhedrosis virus. There was a positive relationship between larval mortality and rainfall, and a negative one between larval mortality and sunshine. Mating was restricted to after midnight. Females oviposited and then mated during the same night. Peak egg-laying took place before midnight, with a smaller peak at about 02.00-04.00 h.																			0007-4853	1475-2670					1981	71	2					289	297		10.1017/S0007485300008312	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007485300008312													WOS:A1981LT98300012

J	HONGVE, D; ERLANDSEN, AH				HONGVE, D; ERLANDSEN, AH			SHORTENING OF SURFACE SEDIMENT CORES DURING SAMPLING	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Coring in recent lake sediments is most easily performed using lightweight open barrel gravity corers. The cores will in most cases have the fine lamination intact and they may be interpreted as representative of the sediment in situ. Parallel cores taken by other techniques show that cores taken with open barrel gravity corers become shorter than the distance of penetration in the sediment. The shortening depends both on the corer diameter and on its velocity during the penetration. Experiments show that soft layers become more reduced in thickness than stiffer ones. This may lead to misinterpretation of sedimentation rate during special periods. Seasonally occurring sediment fractions may be diluted or concentrated during the coring.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1979	65	3					283	287																WOS:A1979HQ74500011

Critical thermal maxima and incipient upper lethal temperatures increase with acclimation temperature for both mature and young-of-year fish. Critical thermal maxima at equivalent acclimation temperatures are unaffected by age of the fish. Incipient upper lethal limits for young-of-year fish exceed those for mature fish by 3-6.degree. C. The ultimate lower lethal temperature for mature alewives appears to exceed 3.degree. C. Loss of heat tolerance following a 10.degree. C decrease in temperature occurs at approximately 1/2 the rate of gain of heat tolerance following a comparable temperature increase. Preferred temperatures for young-of-year alewives were consistently higher than those of mature fish. Seasonal factors other than lake temperature appear to be of considerable importance in determining preferred temperatures. The results are discussed in terms of potential effects of the heated plume from a nuclear generating station and available field data.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1976	105	1					96	106		10.1577/1548-8659(1976)105<96:LAPTOT>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1976)105<96:LAPTOT>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1976BP56100014
J	CRAIG, JF				CRAIG, JF			A NOTE ON GROWTH AND MORTALITY OF TROUT, SALMO-TRUTTA-L, IN AFFERENT STREAMS OF WINDERMERE	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Trout were sampled in 6 afferent streams of Windermere during the spawning season. The main migration of adult trout into the streams took place during early Nov. Length-weight relationships and scale-fish length relationships are given. There was no significant difference in length for age or sex between cohorts within streams. Three groups of fish could be identified depending on whether the fish entered the lake at 1+, 2+ or 3+ yr. The percentage number of the population entering the lake at each of these ages was 16, 70 and 14%, respectively. After the fish had migrated from the streams their growth in length fitted the von Bertalanffy growth model. Fish entering the lake at 1+ and 2+ yr had similar A.95 [age at which 95% of the growth is complete] values (6.31 and 6.97 yr) as the latter grew slightly faster in the lake. Those entering the lake at 3+ yr grew at a slower rate than the other 2 groups but achieved a longer ultimate length. Faster growing fish had higher instantaneous mortality rates. Of the males remaining in the stream at 1+ yrs, 28-29% became sexually mature. Faster growing females became sexually mature earlier. Only those fish which entered the lake at 1+ yr grew close, during their early years before sexual maturity, to the theoretical maximum given by Elliott''s model.																				1095-8649					1982	20	4					423	429		10.1111/j.1095-8649.1982.tb03935.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1982.tb03935.x													WOS:A1982NK73300005

Density estimates of 13 spp., assessed during dry season road counts, indicated about 5 individuals per km2 in the upland savanna regions and about 3 times this number in the Olli river valley. Hartebeest and roan antelooe comprised 60% of the upland savanna density while kob comprised 74% of the Olli river valley density. Total populations for the reserve, assessed during dry season aerial surveys, indicated that hartebeest and roan antelope were the 2 most abundant species, with about 2700 and 2200 individuals, respectively. The only other species with estimated populations greater than 500 were elephant and gray duiker. Total populations during the wet season, assessed during an aerial survey, indicated considerably fewer animals than during the dry season. Densities of the 6 most abundant species during the 1970-1976 period did not appear to have changed significantly, with the exception of elephant and roan antelope which were more abundant. Biomass density for the large herbivore populations in the upland savanna and for the Olli valley were almost the same, being approximately 1200 kg/km.																			0141-6707	1365-2028					1982	20	1					1	12		10.1111/j.1365-2028.1982.tb01077.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2028.1982.tb01077.x													WOS:A1982ND46100001

The reservoir had been invaded recently by the exotic submergent hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata). Hydrilla was an important habitat for some piscivores, particularly Pied-billed Grebes (Podilymbus podiceps) and also cormorants (Phalacrocorax spp.) and American White Pelicans (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos). Wading bird (Ardeidae) densities were low in hydrilla and highest in the emergent-hydrilla interface, unvegetated shoreline/shallow water and emergent habitats. Density comparisons between the main body of the lake and an associated cooling pond with higher water temperatures did not demonstrate consistent patterns across species or seasons. Overall piscivore densities were higher in the hot lake; this was largely due to high densities of Great Blue Herons (Ardea herodias) and cormorants. For many piscivores, neither the presence of hydrilla nor warm-water effluent influenced habitat use.																			0273-8570					SUM	1992	63	3					241	249																WOS:A1992JJ48600001

Therefore, it is likely that in the future dry and hot climatic conditions will be prevailing in this region. These changes also affect environments such as rivers whose temperature is directly related to air temperature. Since air temperatures will get higher and drought seasons are expected, the sustainability of fresh water resources will become more important for the future. Therefore fresh water resources must be monitored continuously or at regular intervals and the effects of climate change on these must be investigated. Turkey has a lot of fresh water resources like rivers, lakes and ground water reservoirs but the water demand also will increase with increasing temperatures. Therefore monitoring and future predictions will be required for determining the management alternatives of water use. In this study, statistical assessment of temperature changes of the main rivers in the Mediterranean region of Turkey is carried out. Regression models are developed to predict water temperatures from air temperatures and these are used in future predictions. Results show that significant changes can be expected in near future with possible impacts on the water quality and ecological status of rivers. Quantitative predictions can be achieved to aid managerial actions directed towards the river ecosystems.

Taking account of the relationship of river and lake, the operation of the Three Gorges Project has a series of complex effects on water quantity and quality of Poyang Lake. According to the operation mode of Three Gorge Project and the characteristics of Poyang Lake, we can analyze and compare the effect of the water quantity and quality of Poyang Lake basin by the operation modes of Three Gorges in Rainfall season and Rainless season. Because of the water of "five river". and jacking of Yangtze River to Poyang Lake, on the one hand, the situation of flood control and disaster reduction become more and more serious in rainfall season; On the other hand the drawdown of Poyang Lake because of the reduction of Yangtze River makes the quality of water worse and eutrophication in rainless season.

In 2005, the Department monitored lakeshore vegetation, water, and sediment at four locations, before and after seasonal applications of fluridone. Subchronic and chronic exposures were evaluated, and hazard quotients calculated for a worst-case exposure (WCE) scenario. Ingestion rates and other exposure factors were developed in public meetings with tribal members. Environmental sampling found fluridone present at extremely low levels in tule vegetation, water, and sediment. Exposures were four times greater in sub-chronic timeframes than chronic timeframes; however, hazards were less due to the 25-fold larger reference dose (RfD) used for subchronic calculations: RfD((subchronic)) = 2.0 mg/kg-day, RfD((chronic)) = 0.08 mg/kg-day. Conservative, child, total daily ingestion (TDI) doses were calculated to be 8.3 x 10(-5) mg/kg-day (subchronic) and 2.1 x 10(-5) mg/kg-day (chronic). Hazard quotients ( HQ) for subchronic and chronic exposures were on the order of 10(-5) and 10(-4), respectively, indicating that at current application regimes, there is little to no hazard of adverse effects from fluridone exposure via ingesting Clear Lake tules.																			1080-7039						2008	14	5					1056	1069		10.1080/10807030802387788	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10807030802387788													WOS:000261338000011

Water samples were taken monthly at the littoral and limnetic areas of the lake, from September 2003 to August 2004. Temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity (K-25), chlorophyll a, and nutrients (N and P) concentrations were measured. Phytoplankton was identified and counted including the fraction smaller than 2 mu m. Fifty phytoplankton species were identified, being Chlorophyta the dominant group. Two species belonging to the genus Microcystis showed high abundances in the lake from September to December 2003. Merismopedia panctata, Selenastrum minutum, Chlamydomonas globosa and Monoraphidium caribeum, as well as picophytoplankton, were dominant, Environmental and biological data clearly reflected two different seasons in the lake: one cold and dry season (September to March) and the second, warm and wet (April to August). Along the first season, mean values of water temperature (17.6 degrees C), nutrients (P-PO4 = 2.21, N-NO3 = 0.4 mg L-1) and chlorophyll a (200 mu g L-1) were lower, while K-25 (985 mu S cm(-1)) and dissolved oxygen (10.1 mu g L-1) concentrations were the higher Dominant species along the period were C. globosa, Cyclotella meneghiniana, M. griffithii, Cryptomonas ovata and Microcystis spp. The second period had the higher mean values of water temperature (21 degrees C), nutrients concentration (P-PO4 = 3.31, N-NO3 = 3.3 mg L-1) and clorophyll a (295 pg L-1), while K-25 (808 mu S cm(-1)) and dissolved oxygen concentrations (6.8 mg L-1) decreased. S. minutum, M. caribeum, Chlorogonium minimum and the picophytoplankton were dominant.

Periodic flooding restrains local succession of microphytobenthos in floodplain lakes	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Periodic flooding of river floodplains and connectivity of floodplain lakes and rivers is suggested to interfere with the succession of microphytobenthos. To analyse this we: 1. studied the impact of flooding on the relationship between irradiance level (depth) and microphytobenthic community composition; 2. sampled three lakes with different connection-disconnection patterns; and 3. studied seasonal variation in community composition in one floodplain lake subjected to several flooding events. Shortly after flooding and subsequent connection or floodplain lakes, microphytobenthic communities showed a uniform species composition. Disconnection of the lakes was followed by a succession of species according to local environmental conditions. However. assemblages were often set back before outgrowth of local species or divergence of community compositions. However, assemblages It is therefore concluded that flooding and the associated connection-disconnection regime of floodplain waters overrule the selective effects of local environmental parameters.

Diel isotopic fluctuation in surface seston and its physiological and ecological implications	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												We reported diet fluctuation in isotopic composition of surface seston from two connected lakes in China, oligotrophic Lake Fuxian and eutrophic Lake Xingyun. The decrease in nighttime and the increase in daytime of isotope signatures of seston might be attributed to the light-dependent balance between the photosynthesis and the respiration of phytoplankton and to the changes in the species composition and the relative abundance of phytoplankton functional groups at the water's surface in diel growth. The relatively high isotopic signatures and the large-extent diel fluctuation of phytoplankton in the eutrophic lake could be due to utilization of heavy-isotope-enriched inorganic sources and the high primary productivity. Extent of diel fluctuation in delta(13)C and delta(15)N of phytoplankton were relatively small compared with the isotopic enrichment per trophic transfer and thus might have negligible effect on the source identification and the trophic evaluation of consumers.

Past work to decrease phosphate levels concentrated on limiting agricultural runoff and reducing effluent from water treatment plants, yet phosphate levels have remained high. Close examination of the Willamette Silt and underlying Hillsboro Formation in the Tualatin Valley has revealed that phosphate is leaching from the substrata into the overlying drainage system through ground-water discharge. Hillsboro Formation samples from subsurface borings as deep as 330 m contain up to 3.17 mg/l orthophosphate as measured by saturated pastes. Three distinct zones of phosphate concentrations are recognized in the HBD-1 core drilled at the Hillsboro airport; the top 65 m average 0.3 mg/l orthophosphate, the next 60 m average 1.22 mg/l, and the bottom 138 m average 0.1 mg/l. Reductions in orthophosphate concentrations below a depth of 150 m correspond with the presence of small vivianite nodules and crystals, and increased abundances of magnetite, both which persist to the base of the Hillsboro Formation. Changing redox conditions with depth along with phosphate complex adsorption onto iron oxides in the shallow zone best explain the observed relationships between phosphate, vivianite, and magnetite concentrations in the sediments. Observations in other borings from the central and western Tualatin Basin support the above hypothesis. Naturally large phosphate concentrations leaching from the Hillsboro Formation and into the Tualatin River drainage system will always keep the river at risk of accelerated seasonal algal growth.																			1078-7275					SUM	1999	5	2					189	197																WOS:000082366900005
J	YOUNG, JO				YOUNG, JO			INTRASPECIFIC AND INTERSPECIFIC PREDATION ON THE COCOONS OF ERPOBDELLA-OCTOCULATA (L) (ANNELIDA, HIRUDINEA)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												In laboratory experiments, eleven out of twenty-one invertebrate species and all of the three fish species tested fed on freshly laid flaccid cocoons of Erpobdella octoculata, though predation was only severe from a dytiscid beetle, E. octoculata and the fish species. There was a tendency for more cocoons to be eaten by starved than fed predators. Only snail species damaged one-week-old toughter cocoons. Only one out of 471 E. octoculata collected during their breeding season from the stony shores of two eutrophic lakes had a cocoon in its gut. The role of cannibalism of and interspecific predation on cocoons in the control and regulation of lake-dwelling populations of the erpobdellid is discussed, and assessed to be relatively unimportant. A more likely regulatory mechanism may involve high juvenile mortality from as yet unknown causes.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV 10	1988	169	1					85	89		10.1007/BF00007936	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007936													WOS:A1988R086700008

The population fluctuations of C. diastrophus were more erratic than those of N. pseudobtusa. The population densities of S. lacustris were lower than those of the other 2 spp. and they decreased with time. A positive correlation was observed between the population densities of N. pseudobtusa and C. diastrophus, but there was a negative correlation between the densities of N. pseudobtusa and S. lacustris. Significant multiple correlations were found between the densities of N. pseudobtusa and C. diastrophus with food and temperature. Asexual reproduction was the main reproduction method. The proportion of the population of N. pseudobtusa with a bud was significantly correlated with food abundance. The mean doubling time of C. diastrophus was greater and more variable than that of N. pseudobtusa. The doubling time of a laboratory population of N. pseudobtusa was 4.2 days. N. pseudobtusa and C. diastrophus had similar, constant and contagious dispersion patterns.																			0021-8790	1365-2656					1978	47	2					615	626		10.2307/3805	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3805													WOS:A1978FF93300019

Human water contact sites in each village undergo constant changes in shape and vegetation. Snail sampling surveys in water contact sites were carried out monthly (for 27 mo.) in 8 villages using newly designed palm-leaf traps, and in 8 additional villages (for 16 mo.) using a modification of Olivier and Sneidermann''s man-time method. Results to date confirm the finding by Chu and Vanderburg that cercarial transmission in the lake takes place almost exclusively within water contact sites. Additional results indicate that even within individual water contact sites this transmission is focal, most infected snails being found very close to the shoreline. Transmission also varies significantly according to shape, vegetation and geographical location of the water contact sites, and is distinctly seasonal in most villages. Control of cercarial transmission in the Volta Lake is attainable and feasible with existing methods.																			0042-9686	1564-0604					1977	55	6					715	730											304396					WOS:A1977EH90900008

Growth was seasonal, with no significant increase in length occurring between April and Oct. For these months combined, back-calculations of length at previous age -ere generally significantly different from the mean length/age class. Females grew faster than males and growth in both sexes fitted the von Bertalanffy growth model. Seasonal changes in condition and gonad weight for each sex were studied by calculating mean monthly total and gonad weights for a given length. The reproductive cycle was examined f urther by recording stages of gonad development and calculating gonadosomatic indices. Fecundity from 66 females ranged from 2657-63,858. Females dominat all samples, with an overall male:female ratio of 1:4, although seasonal variatio was noted; the highest proportion of males, 1:1.7, occurred immediately before spawning.																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1980	14	4					391	400		10.1080/00288330.1980.9515881	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1980.9515881													WOS:A1980LA74400007

Percent Dissimilarity was chosen for community comparisons because it retained a large percentile range for scaling disimilar communities and responded linearly to the degree of overlap between communities. 3) Examination of three consecutive years of Lake Ontario [USA, Canada] phytoplankton data, using SD, produced reasonable disimilarity values. Inter-year variability was significantly greater than inter-station variability. 4) SD has a great potential in ecology for comparing communities which vary along any gradient.

J	Bae, DH; Georgakakos, KP; Kwon, WT				Bae, Deg-Hyo; Georgakakos, Konstantine P.; Kwon, Won-Tae			Climatological screening of climate model output with observations for Korean water resources applications	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												This study focuses on the characteristic features of the surface hydroclimatology of seven watersheds on the South Korean Peninsula and the degree to which four modern-day climate models represent it at nodal and watershed scales. Long-term means and standard deviations of watershed mean areal precipitation and surface air temperature, and watershed-outlet discharge are computed for each month of the year using daily observed data (1979-2002) aggregated to monthly averages. Cumulative frequency distributions of standardized anomalies by season and watershed characterize hydroclimatic variability. The results show that the surface climate variables examined exhibit strong seasonal cycles (monsoonal behavior) with substantial differences in mean and variability across watersheds and seasons. Single simulations from two high resolution (200 x 200 km(2)) and 10-member ensemble simulations from two coarser resolution (280 x 280 km(2) and 400 x 500 km(2)) models are also used to produce model hydroclimatologies of long-term monthly means, standard deviations, and seasonal cumulative frequency distributions of standardized anomalies for nodes on and around the South Korean Peninsula. The models differ in physical and numerical formulations and some utilize observed and others utilize persisted sea surface temperature forcing. A comparison of the unadjusted model-produced and observed hydroclimatology on peninsular scales showed that several models skillfully reproduce features of the hydroclimatology for certain seasons, but with substantial deficiencies in other features shown as well. The results of this paper form a basis for the judicious use of climate model simulations for developing hydroclimatology for means and variability of surface watershed variables for water resources planning in the South Korean Peninsula.

The spawning season was long (mid-June to mid-August) and the density of larvae was low. We tested the hypothesis that the extended spawning season was caused by later maturation of small fish. Gonado-somatic indices for large and small dace showed the same seasonal pattern (0.15 end-June, and 0.07 end-July). Fecundity (mature eggs) estimates showed inconsistent relationships with lengths (r2 = 0.01-0.72) and wide fluctuations in ranges, both of which are characteristics of fractional spawners. Egg diameter frequencies within the ovaries were bimodal, lending further support to our supposition that even in the more northern portion of its range, Phoxinus eos is a fractional spawner.					; Curry, R./ABG-3515-2020	Curry, R.

The results of the survival tests are transformed to a log No/Nt [original number/total number] form and expressed as die-off indexes. In the Watersportbaan, a .beta.-mesosaprobic lake in Belgium, fluctuations of the die-off indexes were largely governed by the seasonal variations in insolation and the concomitant changes in pH and in temperature. In the Coupure [Belgium], a heavily polluted .beta.-polysaprobic biotope, the indexes correlated primarily with the insolation and the temperature and to a minor extent with the dissolved O2 content of the water. The seasonal fluctuations of the indexes were much less pronounced in the sludge-water interphases of these biotopes. In the .beta.-mesosaprobic water, the bacterial populations constituted the dominant biotic component of the overall community homeostasis. In the .beta.-polysaprobic biotope, the die-off was largely the result of the activity of thermolabile toxins and of bacteriophages. The significance of the biochemical O2 demand-tolerance limit of aquatic environments with regard to the occurrence of microbial imbalances is discussed.																			0043-1354	1879-2448					1976	10	2					129	136		10.1016/0043-1354(76)90111-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(76)90111-1													WOS:A1976BE30900006

Diet of the Nile Tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, in lake Muhazi (Rwanda)	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The diet of Oreochromis niloticus, the mainly exploited species in Lake Muhazi, was studied from December 1989 to September 1990. The diet was investigated in terms of sites, seasons and size of the specimens caught. O. niloticus feeds on phytoplankton, and Cyanobacteria make up an important fraction in the stomach contents analyzed. In the 118 stomach contents, belonging to fishes larger than 90 mm, the index of occurrence reaches 100 % for some Cyanobacteria (Merismopedia tenuissima). For this dominant group, the mean abundance index is 64,3 %, the mean volumetric index is 83 % and the dominance index of Lauzanne is 58,1. Two species, Microcystis aeruginosa and Ceratium hirundinella represent more than 90 % of the biomass in the stomach contents analyzed from the two sites and in all seasons. For the period of study, we established that O. niloticus feeds only during the day (from 6 h to 21 h 30) and has a high daily ration (26,5 g.d(-1)). This may explain the good growth of this species in an environment where phytoplankton is abundant. However, the population of O. niloticus of Lake Muhazi has a relatively small biomass and feeds on a small fraction of the phytoplankton primary production (6 %).

Pre-plant-incorporated, pre- and post-emergence herbicides and their mixtures were tested in replicated, completely randomized block trails. Rice variety IR 28 was drilled each season at 125 kg/ha and fertilized with N (150 kg/ha) and P2O5 (40 kg/ha). In both seasons, the post-emergence herbicides propanil+oxadiazon at 3.0 + 1.0 kg a.i./ha, propanil+fluorodifen at 1.4 + 1.8 kg a.i./ha, propanil-bentazone at 3.6 + 1.5 kg a.i/ha and propanil at 3.6 kg a.i./ha as well as thiobencarb applied pre-emergence at 5.0 kg a.i./ha controlled the weeds effectively and gave similar grain yields to that from hand-weeding twice, and significantly higher grain yield than the unweeded control treatments. Grain yields similar to those from the ''two hand-weeding control'' were achieved also by use of the herbicide dymrone at 3.0 kg a.i./ha, either soil-incorporated pre-sowing or sprayed before weed emergence. The herbicides gave satisfactory control of the weeds, which were predominantly the broad-leaved weed Luffa echinata Roxb., together with the grasses Sorghum aethiopicum (Hack.)Rupr. ex Stapf., Echinochloa colona (L.) Link, Eleusine indica (L) Gaertn, Digitaria sanguinalis (L.) Scop., Oryza longistaminata (Chev. and Roehr.), and sedges Cyperus rotundus L. and Cyperus esculentus L.

In the 3 nesting seasons observed on Slothia, a crocodile remained near her nest and frequently charged the nesting iguanas. The crocodile emerged from the lake significantly more often when iguanas were present in the nest clearing. The crocodile seized an iguana on 12 occasions; 5 iguanas were eaten, 5 escaped, and the fate of 2 was unknown. In addition to the charges and captures, the crocodile''s mere presence in the nest clearing interfered with iguana nesting activity. The iguanas disturbed the crocodile nest and dug up crocodile eggs. The crocodile''s behavior involved nest defense and predatory behavior, although the exact motivational sequence is still unclear. Crocodiles and iguanas share nest sites in several other locations near Slothia. Similar nest site requirements and common nesting seasons bring the two species together.

Using a 105 .mu.m mesh net, vertical haul zooplankton samples were taken from 3 stations in the limnetic zone of the main lake at weekly intervals. The limnetic community was dominated by 4 spp.: the copepod Thermocyclops oblongatus, the cladoceran Diaphanosoma excisum and 2 spp. of rotifer, Brachionus caudatus and B. calyciflorus. Mesocyclops leuckarti occurred throughout the year in very low numbers and contributed less than 5% of the copepod biomass. There were occasional population eruptions of 2 cladocerans, Simocephalus vetulus and Daphnia laevis. This is the 1st record of D. laevis in Kenya. Both species contributed about 10% of the cladoceran biomass. Total zooplankton numbers and biomass showed a complex annual pattern with 2 major peaks which were coincident with the 2 rainy seasons. T. oblongatus and D. excisum were the major contributors to biomass in April-July and Sept.-Nov., respectively. The annual mean standing crop was 220 mg dry weight (dw)/m3 and ranged between 70-370 mg dw/m3. Since there are virtually no zooplanktivorous predators in the lake, the bulk of all the zooplankton production enters the decomposer food chain.																			0003-9136						1981	93	1					52	58																WOS:A1981MW23500005

J	FOX, GA; BOERSMA, D				FOX, GA; BOERSMA, D			CHARACTERISTICS OF SUPERNORMAL RING-BILLED GULL CLUTCHES AND THEIR ATTENDING ADULTS	WILSON BULLETIN												Some ring-billed gull (L. delawarensis) clutches of 5 and 6 eggs in the Gull Island colony in Lake Ontario in 1980 were attended by at least 2 females; others were attended by at least 1 male and 1 female. Since it was not ascertained whether or not a 3rd individual was in attendance, it can only be concluded that these supernormal clutches resulted from active female-female associations, polygyny, or from a single female. The female-female associations frequently involved 1 individual in subadult plumage. One female was a member of 2 consecutive female-female associations at 2 different colonies in the same breeding season. Minimum fertility of supernormal clutches was higher in those with a male in attendance. The prevalence of supernormal clutches is higher in growing colonies and in areas of range expansion than in saturated and declining colonies or in colonies within the long-established range. Thus supernormal clutches probably result from behavioral responses to a skewed operational sex ratio that accompanies range expansion and colonization.																			0043-5643						1983	95	4					552	559																WOS:A1983SF14200004
J	HAILA, Y				HAILA, Y			COLONIZATION OF ISLANDS IN A NORTH-BOREAL FINNISH LAKE BY LAND BIRDS	ANNALES ZOOLOGICI FENNICI												The colonization of the archipelago of Lake Inari (69.degree.N, 28.degree.E) by land birds is analyzed on the basis of census data from 41 islands with a size range of 0.5-885 ha (17 islands censused in 2 breeding seasons). Land birds (43 spp.) were recorded on the islands. In calculating species-specific expectations of population numbers on the islands, published density estimates from mainland habitats and data on regional abundances were used as a background. Of the 24 abundant species, 14 were observed on the islands in expected numbers, but only 1 deviating case was not plausibly explained by obvious differences in habitat structure between islands and the mainland (Anthus trivialis). Less numerous species on the islands are habitat specialists occurring there in roughly expected numbers. All absences are obviously caused by lack of suitable habitats on the islands; the missing species include specialists of alpine and tundara habitats. Habitat preferences of the species are the most important factor affecting the colonization propensity of land birds in Inari. Communities in different island type groups defined on the basis of habitat composition were relatively similar. Sampling seems the main factor causing increase in species numbers with increasing island size in Inari, although increasing habitat heterogeneity also has an influence. Frequency patterns in the total pooled data were also compared with distribution types of single species. Successful species on the islands can roughly be divided into 3 groups: characteristic generalists of forest habitats at the transition between taiga and tundra (4 spp.); characteristic species of the northern taiga, widely distributed in northern Palearctic (11 spp.); and species with an interzonal distribution type, i.e., specialized to habitats that are geographically widely distributed but locally patchy (in Inari shores and open, rocky grounds) (2 spp.). Data from the Inari islands support the suggestion that the forest avifauna of Finnish Forest Lapland is impoverished, and a comparison with data from northern Russia [USSR] and Siberia indicates that this is due to habitat impoverishment. Pine is the only conifer in Finnish northern Lapland, but the richest bird communities reside in spruce forests in the North Russian taiga.																			0003-455X	1797-2450					1983	20	3					179	197																WOS:A1983RX44700002

Catchability was similar among age groups of adult yellow perch. Annual catchability was similar in 4 of 5 yr, but 3-fold higher in the 5th, presumably due to lower water clarity in that year. Examination of within-season changes in CPUE indicate that other, undetermined environmental factors also affect catchability.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1983	112	1					53	59		10.1577/1548-8659(1983)112<53:VITCOY>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1983)112<53:VITCOY>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1983QC25800006

The instars are all planktonic except instars I-III of C. trivittatus in Lac a la Croix. All species have a 1 yr life cycle except C. americanus in Lac Gallienne which has a 2 yr cycle. The cycles of C. trivittatus in lacs Randin and Mechant are out of phase by 1 mo. or more with those of C. americanus and C. flavicans, respectively. Seasonal increases in length occurred in most instars except those of C. punctipennis in Lac a la Croix. Both species in Lac a la Croix made fairly extensive diurnal migrations but in lacs Gallienne and Mechant all species remained near the surface. Intense competition for food is considered the most likely cause of seasonal or spatial separation of instars of similar size in all lakes.																									1977	34	1					113	118		10.1139/f77-013	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f77-013													WOS:A1977CT39800013
J	VILARRUBIA, TV				VILARRUBIA, TV			WATER CHEMISTRY OF THE GURI RESERVOIR (RAINY-SEASON 1989) - RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN HUMIC COLOR AND AQUEOUS IRON AND THEIR LIMNOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The present work attempts to identify which factors regulate the metabolism and transport of elements of the Curl Reservoir, a tropical blackwater man-made lake on the Caroni River (Venezuela). Two sampling stations were located on each of the inlet rivers, five in the reservoir and further five downstream of the dam (Fig. 1). Variables measured were dissolved oxygen, conductivity, pH, temperature, turbidity, color, total suspended solids, chlorides, alkalinity, dissolved silicates and metals (Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe). Humic color, aqueous iron and turbidity were well correlated and increased towards the bottom layers, suggesting co-accumulation of humic substances and iron. This might involve adsorption of aquatic humus with hydrous iron oxides, and might have an important influence on the phosphorus cycle by retaining otherwise available phosphorus. The Curl Reservoir was undergoing intense oxygen consumption during the period of sampling due to oxidation of the recently flooded biomass. Nevertheless, waters leaving the reservoir suffered a reoxygenation process through natural mixing and partial overflow of excess waters that assures good water quality for future hydroelectrical uses downstreams.																			0003-9136					NOV	1994	132	1					69	94																WOS:A1994PW43300005

The embryonic development time was between 13.8 days at 2.degree.C and 1.8 days at 25.degree.C. Interclutch times varied from 1.9 to 4.0 days and no significant differences were observed at various temperatures. D. bicuspidatus was in diapause as C4 from June to October/November. The pelagic was during the cold season. 1 or 2 population pulses were produced per year. Egg bearing females carried between 50 and 92 eggs. Almost no adults were found in the pelagic. Mud collections revealed that a great part of the adults remain in the mud or close to the bottom of Gronne. Probably fish predation stops the immigration of adults into the pelagic or D. bicuspidatus has evolved a migration pattern to avoid predation.																			0003-9136					FEB	1990	117	4					485	495																WOS:A1990CV55500005

Appreciable variation was observed in body size and in the lengths of antennules and mucrones. Electrophoresis of clonal isolates collected over the period of study showed a seasonal cycle in esterase phenotypes. A definite association was demonstrated between the esterase phenotypes and morphologies of these clonal isolates. Individuals of one esterase phenotype were usually large and long-featured, whereas individuals of the other esterase phenotypes were smaller, with short features. The association of morphology and esterase phenotypes from laboratory experiments corresponded to the association observed in field samples. These results support the hypothesis that the cyclomorphosis of Lake Travis Bosmina involves a succession of clones and phenotypic plasticity.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1980	10	3					239	250		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1980.tb01199.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1980.tb01199.x													WOS:A1980JX00100006
J	MOCK, DW; MOCK, KC				MOCK, DW; MOCK, KC			FEEDING-BEHAVIOR AND ECOLOGY OF THE GOLIATH HERON	AUK												The feeding methods of Goliath herons (A. goliath) were studied in Lake St. Lucia, Natal during the Sept.-Dec. 1977 breeding season. The herons captured very large fish (estimated mean length of 30 cm and wet weight of 500-600 g), which they impaled on their bills. Goliath herons hunted well away from the lake''s edge, usually among beds of floating macrophytes. The plants probably attract greater fish populations; they also make the surrounding water clearer for visual penetration. Goliath herons moving to new feeding sites frequently landed on the macrophytes to effect splashless entry into the water. The plant mats were used extensively by herons as a place upon which to lay struggling prey for additional killing measures. Goliath herons are passive hunters, standing motionlessly about 3/4 of the time. They sometimes adopt very tall postures that allow deeper visual penetration during initial scanning. Prey are usually caught near the bottom of the lake and apparently struggle violently. Goliath herons direct stabs to the fish''s gill regions, presumably to stun them. The entire handling process lasts an average of 109 s, with hard-spined fish requiring more time. While engaged with the prey, Goliath herons are commonly attacked by various fish-pirates. Of the captures observed, 11% were lost during the harrassment. Only fish eagles (Haliaeetus vocifer) seem capable of taking fish away from Goliath herons, but other piscivores sometimes position themselves nearby to get any unattended prey. Fish eagles may be effective pirates because they are fast and formidable enough to pose a potential threat to the heron itself. Goliath herons consumed an average of 2.3 fish/day, an estimated 23-34% of their body weight. Such a low capture frequency may be related to the large average prey size, a pattern we call jackpot strategy. The great body size of the Goliath heron (1.5 m tall, 5 kg) is adapted to efficient handling of these profitable prey and probably not strongly related to interspecific competition with other ardeids.																				1938-4254					1980	97	3					433	448																WOS:A1980KA87900001

Methanobacterium ruminantium was the most numerous methanogen found in regions of high-organic-silt sediments. The population of this species ranged from 106-109 cells/g dry sediment. Methanobacterium strain MoH and Methanosarcina barkeri were identified in sand-silt, clay or sand sediments. These methanogens ranged in density from 106-107 cells/g dry sediment. Methanospirillum hungatii was observed only after an organic enrichment was performed on Cleveland Harbor sediments. The seasonal and selective sediment distribution of these methanogens appears to be related to the type and concentration of C as substrate and to the activities of heterotrophic and sulfate-reducing bacteria.																			0099-2240	1098-5336					1980	39	3					597	603		10.1128/AEM.39.3.597-603.1980	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.39.3.597-603.1980								16345529					WOS:A1980JM55600022

Assessment of aquatic vegetation invasion of Jebba Lake, Nigeria	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Quantitative and qualitative assessment of aquatic vegetation was carried out along the length and breadth of Jebba Lake, Nigeria (latitude 9 degrees 10' and 9 degrees 55'N and longitude 4 degrees 30' and 4 degrees 50'E). Ground truth survey was carried out between 23rd and 27th August 1999 to produce a map with a working grid which was subsequently superimposed on the latest satellite imagery of Jebba Lake obtained from Forestry Research and Meteorological Coordinating Unit, Abuja. Analysis of the map showed that aquatic vegetation is localized to the northern part of the lake. The highest vegetation coverage of the lake stood at about 1.91% in the rainy season during the period of study with aquatic vegetation coverage restricted to the upper reaches of the lake. The lower reaches of the lake were found devoid of vegetation probably due to the physical characteristics of the lake in the region, which include the depth and undisturbed pristine riverine forest surrounded by hills and mountains. These created an extensive relief detrimental to the establishment of flood plains and the development of emergent aquatic macrophytes.

J	CANFIELD, DE; JONES, JR; BACHMANN, RW				CANFIELD, DE; JONES, JR; BACHMANN, RW			SEDIMENTARY LOSSES OF PHOSPHORUS IN SOME NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL IOWA LAKES	HYDROBIOLOGIA												P sedimentation in 4 natural and 4 artificial Iowa lakes was measured by using sediment traps to determine if sedimentary P losses were greater in artificial lakes than in natural lakes and the limnological factors influencing P loss rates. Mean P sedimentation rates ranged from 13.3-218 mg .cntdot. m-2 day-1. Although P sedimentation rates for the natural lakes as a group did not differ significantly from the rates for artificial lakes, there were significant differences among individual lakes. P sedimentation rates also varied significantly during different seasons at different locations within a lake and at different depths within a location. Despite the variance, P sedimentation rates were strongly correlated with inorganic sediment concentrations and inorganic matter sedimentation rates, thus suggesting that inorganic sediments influence P sedimentation rates. When Iowa data were combined with data from published studies, mean sedimentation rates were directly correlated with mean chlorophyll a concentrations of the lakes. These data strongly suggest that sedimentation rates as measured by sediment traps are strongly influenced by the trophic status of a lake. Though sedimentation rates were higher in the more productive lakes, these rates probably represent only gross sedimentation rates rather than net sedimentation rates because of resuspension and resedimentation of bottom sediments.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1982	87	1					65	76		10.1007/BF00016663	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00016663													WOS:A1982NB50600008

Forty-five taxa were collected mostly through emergence trapping of adults (76 trap-yr). Q and R analyses were used to show similarities between the stations and associations between the species. The middle reaches of the mainstream harbour the richest communities which are an assemblage of a few ubiquitous species (Baetis gr. pygmaeus, Stenonema modestum, Harbrophlebia vibrans and Paraleptophlebia volitans), lotic species (B. flavistriga, B. pluto, Stenonema vicarium and Heptagenia pulla) some of which show a restricted distribution (Paraleptophelia adoptiva, P. ontario, Leucrocuta hebe and Stenacron interpunctatum heterotarsale), and also lentic species (Eurylophella verisimilis, Leptophlebia cupida, Cloeon simplex, C. rubropictum, Centroptilum album and Stenacron interpunctatum frontale). The headwater streams contain no distinct element, except perhaps Siphlonurus typicus, but rather the more resistant or dispersive species from the mainstream, mainly Ephemerellidae and Leptophlebiidae. The lower reaches of the mainstream are characterized by the addition of a few typical river species, Serratella sordida and Epeorus vitreus. Lacustrine communities are less diverse, comprising mostly the lentic species from the streams plus a distinctive element (S. i. canadense, Callibaetis ferrugineus and Hexagenia limbata occulta). Only L. cupida colonizes the bog lake, and no species occur in the beaver ponds. Most congeneric species are either spatially or temporally segregated. The sections of the mainstream produce an average of some 1000 adult mayflies/m2 per yr; other streams are less productive and the lakes even less so (< 100/m2). The seasonal succession of the species and the emergence patterns of the dominant species are illustrated; a classification of emergence patterns is attempted on the basis of the present data and of other recent studies.																			0008-4301	1480-3283					1982	60	11					2828	2840		10.1139/z82-362	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z82-362													WOS:A1982PT15900038
J	ANDREWS, CB; ANDERSON, MP				ANDREWS, CB; ANDERSON, MP			THERMAL ALTERATION OF GROUNDWATER CAUSED BY SEEPAGE FROM A COOLING LAKE	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Groundwater temperatures in the vicinity of a 200-ha power plant cooling lake in central Wisconsin [USA] were monitored in the field for 1 yr and the response of subsurface temperatures to seasonal changes in lake and air temperatures was simulated by a mathematical model. The cooling lake, in use since May 1975 when a 500 MW [megawatt] electric generating unit began operation, loses water to the groundwater system at a rate of 2 .times. 104 m3/day. The zone of thermally altered groundwater is confined to a relatively small area hydraulically downgradient from the cooling lake. The lake is situated in a groundwater discharge area and changes in subsurface temperatures at depths less than 6 m may have affected the vegetation in the thermally altered zone. The model, which couples equations describing groundwater flow with those describing heat transport in the subsurface, was used to simulate the seasonal temperature fluctuations within 7 cross-sections oriented parallel to the direction of groundwater flow away from the cooling lake. Simulated temperature patterns agreed well with field data but were very sensitive to the distribution of subsurface lithologies. Results from a predictive simulation suggest that when a 2nd 500-MW generating unit begins operation in 1978, groundwater temperatures will increase < 5.degree. C at distances > 15 m from the cooling lake. Results suggest that the potential for significant thermal alteration of surface water bodies located in groundwater discharge areas is slight.																			0043-1397	1944-7973					1979	15	3					595	602		10.1029/WR015i003p00595	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/WR015i003p00595													WOS:A1979HA90000011

GROWTH, CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION AND POTENTIAL FOR HARVESTING OF THE AQUATIC VEGETATION	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												The biomass of aquatic plant species and the standing crop of submerged species were estimated in Lake Moondarra from 1977-1979. In July 1978, the biomass of Salvinia molesta exceeded 53,000 tons fresh weight, with a density of 167 tons ha-1 (0.81 kg dry wt m-2). Hydrilla verticillata reached a maximum density of almost 3 kg dry wt m-2 and Potamogeton cripus more than double that density. Photosynthetic activity of a range of species was high, and was still detectable at water depths allowing only very low light penetration. Organic N concentrations were high (0.91-4.37 dry wt), and P (0.07-0.47% dry wt) appeared to be a limiting factor for growth of the aquatic plants. Heavy metal concentrations varied with species, location and season but, although generally higher than world-wide mean values (48 .mu.g g-1 Cu, 11 .mu.g g-1 Pb, 14.3 .mu.g g-1 Zn), were significantly less than those of aquatic macrophytes in heavily polluted environments. H. verticullata was more efficient than S. molesta in removal of N, P and Zn; for Cu and Pb the reverse was true. The potential for using this property of the aquatic plants and subsequent harvesting to remove nutrients and metals from the lake is also discussed.

NUCLEOTIDE-INDUCED PERTURBATIONS OF CARBON ASSIMILATION	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The addition of small amounts (0.2-10 nmol/l) of exogenous cAMP to natural phytoplankton communities in Lawrence Lake, Michigan, and Sangre Isle Lake, Oklahoma [USA], markedly altered in situ rates of C assimilation. On seasonal and depth-specific bases, cAMP alternately stimulated (up to 192%) or repressed (up to 88%) C assimilation rates. Structural analogs of cAMP elicited either no effect on C-assimilation or effects opposing or similar to those noted when cAMP was added, depending on the lakewater sample analyzed. Collectively, the data suggest that C-assimilation rates in situ may be conditionally dependent on the relative abundance of cAMP and perhaps other nucleotide derivatives in algal cells or lake water. Laboratory experiments on axenic cultures of Anabaena flos-aquae were consistent with the hypothesis that algae may take up dissolved cAMP and that endogenous and exogenous cAMP may perform opposing functions in C metabolism regulation in phytoplankton.																			0003-9136						1984	100	3					341	354																WOS:A1984SY14400004

At the deeper stations (> 7 m) in the lake, phosphate and silicate pore water concentrations generally reach maximum values in the 0-3 cm sediment zone (typically 50 and 400 .mu.g atoms .cntdot. l-1 respectively). These maxima are caused by the mineralization of reactive sediment material, that is continuously being redistributed towards the deeper areas in the lake. At the shallow stations (< 7 m) local phosphate and silicate pore water maxima are often found in the top 0-1 or even 0-1/2 cm layer. Mineralization of microphytobenthos cells probably plays a dominant role here. A light dependent nutrient depletion in the upper mm, or less, of the sediment must have occurred; an effect that could not be detected with the present interstitial water sampling technique, but has indirectly been shown to take place at a field station with high microphytobenthos primary production rates. Highly significant seasonal trends were found for the P, Si and NH4-N pore water concentrations in the top layer at the deeper stations. Seasonal variations at the shallow stations were virtually absent; light regime, not temperature, may be the dominant factor here.																			0077-7579						1984	18	3-4					312	336		10.1016/0077-7579(84)90008-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0077-7579(84)90008-5													WOS:A1984ASJ2800008

Snail activity, density and size were recorded over the 1.5-35.5 m portion of the water depth gradient at Cape Maclear, Malawi, in the southern part of Lake Malawi, during both cool-wet (1980, 1981) and warm-dry seasons (1981, 1982). Population parameters were quantified. A diel cycle of activity occurred for both species of Lanistes at all depths in both seasons. The population activity patterns and dynamics of these related species are hypothesized to: be independent of each other but correlated with microhabitat structure; and reflect food availability in one case (L. solidus) as well as a refuge from cichlid predation for recruits of both species.

One population, collected from a pond in Toronto, Ontario, [Canada] exhibited a significant linear relationship between the extent of lesions and the ovarian state. In a 2nd population, collected from Hamilton Harbor, Lake Ontario, there was no correlation between the high prevalence of oocyte atresia, or the ovarian state with the extent of the ulcerative lesions. In the Hamilton Harbor population there were no seasonal changes in the stages of egg development, frequency of mature ova, activity of the pituitary-gonad axis or gonadosomatic index consistent with gamete release. This apparent spawning failure of the Hamilton Harbor population was supported by the age distribution in the population (no fish younger than 4 yr of age were found), and probably accounts for the drastic decline in the capture success of goldfish at that site since 1978. This decline in capture success was correlated with the outbreak of a persistent epizootic of ulcerative disease, suggesting that either the lesions themselves caused the spawning failure, or that the spawning failure and lesion outbreak were both correlated with undetermined changes in the environment, possibly a deterioration in the water quality in Hamilton Harbor.

The Cladocera community, shifted from a complete dominance by Diaphanosoma sarsi, Ceriodaphnia cornuta, and Daphnia gessneri corresponding with the time of low water level to dominance and density by, Moina reticulata with the time of high water level period. The values of edible chlorophyll-a, particulate organic carbon (POC), and the carbon levels of the edible non-algal fraction showed a gradual increase with the entry of the water from the Solimoes River to the lake. The edible algal carbon did not vary markedly. It is evident that the non-algal contribution to the sestonic carbon content was greater than algal carbon by about ten times, indicating that non-algal particulate carbon accounts for the large amount of total POC. Nevertheless, there is not a condition of food limitation in the lake because the algal carbon always attained above 0.1 mg C/l.																			0065-6755						1992	12	2					155	168																WOS:A1992LK29100002

The values of the viable bacterial counts found in our sediment samples were typical for an eutrophic lake. The increase in the proportion of anaerobic to aerobic bacteria at 30-degrees-C observed in the sediment samples of Agno may reflect the depletion of oxygen concentrations in the water column. The genera Aeromonas, Pseudomonas, Bacillus and Clostridium, as well as strains belonging to the Coryneform-group, represented the major taxonomic groups of heterotrophic bacterial communities in the water-sediment interface.

At that time, the lake was stratified and the hypolimnion was anoxic. Zooplankton was collected at intervals of 3 hours at three different stations, situated along a transect from the littoral to the pelagic zone. The migrations of A. denticornis development stages were studied separately. The younger calanoid stages (nauplii, copepodite live in the upper layers, while older stages (copepodite IV-V and adults), concentrated at 4 m during day, show an upward migration during the night and a diurnal downward migration to depleted oxygen layers. The latter are more numerous during day at 8 m were oxygen concentration is low, exception for egg bearing females which tend to live most of the day around the 4 m layer where they find a combination of low light, high algal food and high oxygen content. Chaoborus larvae migrate to 4 and 6 m during night. The visual predator (1+) perch feed on the egg bearing females of A. denticornis during the day. Nevertheless, considering the stock, fish predation pressure is low. High density of Chaoborus larvae may be the cause for high Copepods consumption. The migration pattern of A. denticornis seemed to be a compromise between life in the oxygenated turbid layers and in the depleted oxygen layers to avoid predation by (1+) perch and by Chaoborus which fed in the upper layers of this eutrophic lake day and night alternatively. Except for egg bearing females, observations indicate that adults are adapted to live alternatively in depleted oxygen layer during day, and oxygenated upper layer during night avoiding predation pressure.

In Lago do Janauaca, P. squamosissimus reaches sexual maturity in one year at a mean standard length of 20.5 cm, while in the blackwater Lago Aruau, the fishes require 1.5 years and average only 19 cm in length. P. monti also becomes sexually mature at an age of one year in Lago do Janauaca, and its average standard length at that time is 18 cm. The main spawning period is at the beginning of the dry season while the water level is decreasing. It was demonstrated that both species spawn repeatedly at regular intervals determinated by the phases of the moon, P. monti biweekly during the the full and new moons and P. squamosissimus monthly during the new moon. From differences in the spawning period, a second population of P. squamosissimus was identified in the blackwaters of Lago Aruau. It enters the lake from the Rio Branco.																			0065-6755						1992	12	1					17	28																WOS:A1992JN10900003

An in situ procedure to measure the weight losses was developed that provides a simple means of obtaining quick estimates. Of the three substrates, water hyacinth showed maximum decomposition rates ranging from 4 to 11 daily percent of weight loss in the pond and from 1.1-6.3 in the lake. These values for cellulose ranged from 0 to 3.6 in the pond and from 0.1 to 3.5 in the lake. Weight loss of protein was smaller ranging from 0 to 3 in the pond and from 0 to 1.2 in the lake. Seasonal maxima developed during temperature maxima for hyacinth and during minima for model substrates with some deviations. Weight losses were higher in bottom water and at the sediment-water interface. Decomposition was compared and discussed with the measured physico-chemical environment and bacterial communities in the two water bodies as well as with weight loss magnitude known for other water bodies. Decomposition under these tropical conditions was much higher than in the temperate zone. This rapid decomposition has an important function in mineral recycling in nutrient deficient tropical waters.																			0003-9136					APR	1986	106	2					219	231																WOS:A1986C095000005

C) was determined by serological analysis of gut contents. Antisera prepared from 11 common potential foods were tested on Ouchterlony microplate assemblages against corixid gut contents. No consistent differences were seen between corixids collected from different lakes or at different seasons. Their realized feeding niches are similar but not identical; each instar fed somewhat differently. Diets of the two species when sympatric were markedly different from when they were allopatric. The realized niches appear to be restricted in sympatry, but both species concentrated overall on similar foods, suggesting that food was not limiting. However, the exclusion of C. explet from low salinity lakes may be a result of competition for food, in addition to habitat preferences and other biotic parameters.

The modifications observed in zoo-plankton populations were analyzed and related to concomitant changes noted in the population of M. terraesanctae (Kinneret sardine), which is the main predator of zooplankton. The cladocerans Diaphanosoma sp., Bosmina spp. and Ceriodaphnia spp. were preferential food sources for Mirogrex when compared with Copepoda. In 1973 and in the 1st half of 1974, the biomass and productivity of Cladocera were higher (30-170%) than the average for 1969-1972. This was accompanied by a continual increase of purse-seine catch-per-unit-effort of sardine up to to 1454 kg/boat-day during 1972-1976. Small and young Mirogrex fishes were more frequent in the 1974-1975 catches than in previous seasons. The increase of the Mirogrex population at the expense of the Cladocera caused a 26% decrease of productivity of the latter organisms compared to the interannual average (1969-1975). It also affected the age structure of the Copepoda population: the adult females became less abundant but they showed a higher fecundity.																			0030-1299	1600-0706					1977	29	1					166	174		10.2307/3543309	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3543309													WOS:A1977DW06800023

I - Dynamics of phytoplankton succession in the solar lake (Taba, Egypt)	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY					3rd Middle East Conference on Marine Pollution and Effluent Management	NOV 23-25, 1998	KUWAIT, KUWAIT					The seasonal and vertical distribution of planktonic algae in the Solar Lake (Taba-Egypt) and their relation to some aquatic environmental factors were discussed through the period (Sep. 1996-Aug. 1997). Surface water analysis showed that no remarkable changes were observed in nitrate, silicate and iron, while turbidity, salinity and chloride were changed according to the season. In water column profile, H2S, temperature and salinity showed clear variations between stratification and holomixis. Maximum salinity (199 parts per thousand) was recorded during stratification at 3-4 m depth. Stratification (Oct-June) appears clearly with changes in temperature (surface 16 degrees C, thermocline up to 53.3 degrees C and the bottom temperature around 47.7 degrees C). Cyanobacterial mats of the Solar Lake are classified into two layers, the upper layer was dominated by coccoide forms while the lower was dominated by filamentous forms. During the period of study, 39 algal species were identified among which were 17 species of Cyanobacteria, 18 species of Bacillariophyta and 2 species of either Chlorophyta or Dinoflagellates.

The organic parts of the muscles were washed with a mixture of magnesium oxide and magnesium nitrate according to the dry ash method and arsenic residues were measured by silver diethyl dithyocarbamate in a spectrophotometer. By analyzing the 120 fish samples, arsenic residues were calculated to be 0.009 - 0.347 ppm (average 0.051+/-0.046). In light of these results as the arsenic residues in grey mullets were below the level of 10 ppm, the accepted limit, it was concluded that arsenic intoxication poses no risk to human health.

E. fluviatile occupied mineral and organic substrates on the lower shorelines of stable channels and lakes that were flooded for 1 to 3 months during the growing season, and received 1 to 15 cm annual deposits of silty alluvium. The distribution of E. fluviatile in the tundra of the outer delta (north of 69 degrees latitude) was patchy and restricted to infilling inter-levee basins. Sexual reproduction was not observed during the study: E. fluviatile propagated and colonized new sites by the production of annual stems from underground rhizomes and dispersal of plant fragments during ice breakup flooding and muskrat grazing. Natural proliferation of stem fragments was observed, but the propagules did not survive.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				JUN	1988	4	3					383	394		10.1080/02705060.1988.9665187	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1988.9665187													WOS:A1988N559000013

Heterotrophic bacterioplankton growth and production rates were estimated in a tropical lake by various methods. Mean growth rates, determined by tritiated thymidine incoporation into DNA, frequency of dividing cells and increase in cell density varied between 0.013 and 0.014 (with a range of 0.006-0.026) h-1 corresponding to bacterial production of 1.16-1.22 (0.34-3.63) mg C m-3 h-1. 2. Heterotrophic bacterial production estimated from oxygen and inorganic carbon consumption in the dark were compared with these values. The oxygen method gave similar results, while values from dark carbon uptake were as much as 2.5 times higher. 3. Although the different estimates of rates of bacterial production showed different patterns, the existence of spatial (vertical) and temporal (diel and seasonal) variation was demonstrated. Bacterial production was 13-41% of the net primary production and 10-30% of gross primary production. 4. Bacterial grazing mortality rate was estimated from size-fractionation and metablic inhibitor experiments. Average grazing rates were between 0.34 and 3.77 mg C m-3 h-1 corresponding to 76-120% of the mean bacterial production rate. Organisms 1-12 .mu.m in size, possibly mainly ciliates, were implicated as important bacterial grazers.

Movement patterns (64% moved east initially with prevailing currents; 68% reversed direction one or more times), net movement rates (ave. = 4.7 km/d), water temperatures occupied (ave. = 10.7 C) and harvest rates by anglers (ave. = 23% of radiotagged salmonines) were generally similar among species and seasons. However, Pacific salmon (coho, Oncorhynchus kisutch and chinook, O. tshawytscha) moved against prevailing currents and were caught by anglers more often than brown troupt (Salmo trutta) and rainbow trout (O. mykiss, formerly S. gairdneri). The movement patterns and thermal habitats of salmonines in Lake Ontario generally were in the mid-range of those reported for conspecifics in other large lakes and the North Pacific Ocean.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				DEC	1989	5	2					197	204		10.1080/02705060.1989.9665229	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1989.9665229													WOS:A1989CJ56300010

It is connected to the ocean in its northern end through a long and narrow channel system, the Dutch Canal, which subdues all tidal motions in the lake; the oceanic mean tidal range is 0.5 m or less. Freshwater enters through a seasonal river, the Battulu Oya. Until recently, the lagoon was also intermittently connected to the ocean through a sandbar in the southern end. This opening allowed for a rapid exchange with the ocean, effectively counteracting large salinity and sea level variations in the lake area. Measurements of sea levels and salinities were carried out within the lagoon system from February 1993 to July 1994 while the southern opening was closed. The lake salinities varied from 5 to 46.5 psu and the sea level from -0.25 to +1.2 m relative to the ocean. Water and salt budgets indicated that periods of decreasing sea level resulted in a deposition of salt on the lake bottoms and its surroundings. The exchange of water through the Dutch Canal is driven by the sea level difference between Mundel Lake and the ocean. This difference is influenced by variations in the net freshwater supply and the oceanic sea level. A mean sea level difference of 0.12 m was estimated from variations in the salinity gradient within the channel. The average residence time vs the ocean amounts to a couple of months, prolonged because of a sill in the Dutch Canal. In order to reduce variations in salinity and sea level, and to increase water exchange, we suggest a reopening of the sandbar. A sluice at this site and in the Dutch Canal, and a regulation dam in the river Battulu Oya would make it possible to keep salinities and sea levels under control even during longer periods of rain or drought.

Three intact sediment cores collected from the near-shore region of the lake were connected to a system that simulated groundwater flow through lake sediments in a temperature controlled laboratory environment. The effect of sediment biogeochemical processes on groundwater chemistry was determined by evaluating changes in acid/base and metal chemistry for solutions entering and leaving the cores. Aluminum mobilization represented the most significant source of neutralization for each core and contributed up to 99% of H+ removal. Although the sediment cores were collected parallel to the shoreline and over a linear distance of only 0.3 m, significant differences in sediment chemistry were apparent and contributed to variations in the chemistry of water transported from the cores. For one core that exhibited retention of Al from the influent groundwater, retention of Pb by the sediment was similarly observed. Following acidification of this groundwater, Pb was readily remobilized. These results suggest that near-shore lake sediments may be effective at influencing seasonal variations in Al, Pb and base cations in lakes receiving groundwater inputs.

In 1969-1972 Lakes Hayes and Johnson were studied to determine the levels of phytoplankton productivity, how they varied seasonally in relation to mixing and the associated changes in nutrient levels, and how these cycles compared with those for polymicitc coastal South Island lakes and the dimictic lakes which were more extensively studied overseas. The relation of productivity to the seasonal and vertical distribution of phytoplankton species and crops was examined using the phytoplankton data for this period from Burns and Mitchell (1974). Replacement times for the phytoplankton crop ranged from 0.3-7.9 days, and were generally higher in Lake Johnson than in Lake Hayes. Specific loss rates by the phytoplankton were generally low during isothermal periods and highest when large flagellated cells declined. Specific loss rates were low while an Anabaena bloom developed, but increased at the end of the bloom. Approximate figures calculated for specific zooplankton grazing rates suggest that grazing may be a significant factor in specific phytoplankton losses.

J	JONSSON, B				JONSSON, B			DEMOGRAPHIC STRATEGY IN A BROWN TROUT POPULATION IN WESTERN NORWAY	ZOOLOGICA SCRIPTA												The individuals in the densely populated stock of brown trout Salmo trutta L. living in Lake Lone and Stranda River, are small, mature at an early age and have a relatively short life span. Such a demographic strategy appears favorable for populations having a large, but physically unstable spawning and nursery area, intense competition for food and little vertebrate predation except for human exploitation. For females, the age of sexual maturation appears largely dependent on growth-rate, size and survival-rate of the fish. Males do not appear to have the advantage of a corresponding large body size. They mature when smaller and at more varying ages than the females, although the 2 sexes have almost identical growth-rates. Sexually mature fish have higher condition coefficients than immature ones, which is probably an adaptation to ensure gonadal development and enhance the prospect of reproductive success. Mortality appears to be largely dependent on the age when the fish achieve sexual maturation. Most individuals seem to die after their 1st spawning season. Females show a delay of 1 yr in their sexual maturation relative to males. This adaptation gives protection to the females.																			0300-3256	1463-6409					1977	6	3					255	263																WOS:A1977EA94300010

Multivariate Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Group Analysis (HGA) were used to identify the parameters discriminating the origin of water from the Tibagi and the Primeiro de Maio River, after it has passed the mixing region. The study was conducted during the dry and rainy seasons in July 2002 and February 2003 at three depths and three sampling sites located 0, 5, and 10 km away from the mixing region. The statistical methods showed to be appropriate for identifying the contribution of each tributary in the water mixing site of a complex water system. The most important discriminating parameter was the absorbance relation A(253 nm)/A(203 nm), followed by the concentrations of Fe(III), Mn(III), and Ni(II). An anthropogenic interference was found in the reservoir due to high Ni(H) and orthophosphate concentrations caused by a nearby town sewage discharge. The interference was more important during the dry periods due to the lower dispersion of the pollutants. Urgent initiatives should be taken from the state government to build treatment stations for the wastewater of the small cities around the Capivara hydroelectric reservoir to prevent the drinking water quality from deteriorating.

The area chosen for study was considered to have a relatively uniform horizontal distribution of properties so that vertically acting processes should be more easily observed. Nevertheless, a preliminary examination of the combined physical and biochemical data collected from a ship anchored in mid-basin for three week-long episodes in 1979 and one in 1980 shows evidence of changes produced by the advection of water of differing quality. In this study, measured currents at depths of 10 m, 20 m, and 21 m are analyzed to provide timescales for the horizontal flushing and mixing of a mid-basin control volume of 10-km diameter. Knowledge of these timescales is useful in the design of biochemical experiments. Data from current meters, thermistor arrays, and meteorological buoys are used to construct a heat daily budget of a control volume in mid-lake. This study confirms the presence of horizontal variability in the distribution of temperature and transport processes that produce significant changes at timescales of less than a day. We examine several one-dimensional (vertical) models and one two-dimensional model (horizontal and vertical) by other authors that draw on Lake Erie data. The models are successful in tracking changes at seasonal timescales; deviations from observed daily averages at shorter timescales are attributed to a combination of transport processes and horizontal patchiness. The deviations do not appear to cause long-term discrepancies between the observations and the models, indicating that the patchiness acts as a random "noise" in an essentially homogeneous environment. The central basin of Lake Erie remains a preferred site for the study of a wealth of locally-acting processes. Finally, we discuss the limitations placed on "control volume" experiments by existing measurement techniques and by the transport processes and we make recommendations for improved experiments.																			0380-1330						1987	13	4					587	606		10.1016/S0380-1330(87)71675-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(87)71675-X													WOS:A1987M110000014
J	CUTHBERT, FJ				CUTHBERT, FJ			INTRASEASONAL MOVEMENT BETWEEN COLONY SITES BY CASPIAN TERNS IN THE GREAT-LAKES	WILSON BULLETIN												Colony-site use patterns were studied in Caspian Terns (Sterna caspia) nesting on five islands in northeastern Lake Michigan to address the following questions: (1) do individual terns frequent more than one colony site during a single breeding season; and (2) what are the factors that influence intraseasonal colony site movement in this population? Intraseasonal movements of terns between colonies in northeastern Lake Michigan were common. Birds that were not nesting were observed significantly more often at two or more colonies than nesting terns, and intercolony movement was precipitated by lack of a mate or nest site and by reproductive failure (e.g., nest destruction by storms or predators and investigator disturbance). Intercolony movement during courtship and following reproductive failures probably is intensified during periods of flooding or high water in the Great Lakes.																			0043-5643					DEC	1985	97	4					502	510																WOS:A1985AXL5500008

Evaluation of chemical indicators for tracking and apportionment of phosphorus sources to Table Rock Lake in Southwest Missouri, USA	WATER RESEARCH												This work evaluated the suitability of selected chemical species as indicators for tracking and apportionment of point and non-point phosphorus sources within the Table Rock Lake watershed in Southwest Missouri, USA. The species were evaluated with respect to their uniqueness to specific source types, their ability to be detected in both sources and receiving waters, and the consistency of their concentration ratios to phosphorus. Four sampling events were conducted at 15 sample locations in one year to collect water samples for measuring the concentrations of total and dissolved phosphorus, seven anions, and 19 major and trace elements. Current analytical methods were sensitive enough for quantification of most of the chemical species in both sources and the receiving waterbody. Due to the high seasonal variation of phosphorus concentrations in source samples, no chemical species had consistent concentration ratios to phosphorus across source types. However, several chemicals were found to be unique to specific sources; bromide ion can be used as a unique indicator for the effluent of the largest wastewater treatment plant in the watershed.

Considerable variations in the population of each species between sites and years were observed. Fluctuations in the populations were not always consistent from site to site or between species at the same site from one year to the next. As all sites were on the same stream and within 3 km of each other with only slight altitude differences climatic factors were not a major factor producing variations observed between sites. Also the previous years population level did not appear to be directly related to the following seasons population level. Apparently localized conditions at a site were exerting a marked influence on the larval simuliid population at each site.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1985	121	1					77	82		10.1007/BF00035232	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00035232													WOS:A1985ADD2900010

EPILITHIC PERIPHYTON RESPONSES	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Changes in inorganic N metabolism of a N2-fixing periphyton community [mainly Calothrix, Tolypothrix, Nostoc, Oscillatoria, Lyngbya, Glueocapsa, Anacystis, Chroococcus, Mongeotia, Zygonema, Cymbella, Tabellaria and Synedra] were measured following an epilimnetic addition of NH4NO3 (75-80 .mu.g N.cntdot.l-1) to N-deficient Castle Lake, California in Aug. of 1980 and 1981. In 1980 ambient concentrations of both ammonium and nitrate were reduced to pre-addition levels in 30 days while in 1981 these substrates were depleted in 16 and 26 days, respectively. Nitrogenase activity was not suppressed by the elevated DIN [dissolved inorganic N] concentrations and rates of N2 fixation were statistically similar during the pre- and post-addition periods. The results of bottle bioassays indicated that DIN levels > 700 .mu.g NO3- -N and 70-700 .mu.g NH4+-N.cntdot.l-1 were required to totally inhibit N2 fixation. Under normal growing season conditions of low DIN (< 15 .mu.g N.cntdot.l-1) N2 fixation is the major pathway for inorganic-N incorporation. At NH4+-N and NO3--N levels < 45 .mu.g.cntdot.l-1, these substrates were assimilated simultaneously with no apparent preferential utilization. The ratios of NH4+/NO3- uptake ranged from 0.66-2.46. Taken together, these results indicate that this periphyton community was N deficient.																			0003-9136						1985	102	4					425	433																WOS:A1985ADE2100003

ERRORS ASSOCIATED WITH ESTIMATING TRANSPORT ACROSS THE THERMOCLINE	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Errors associated with ignoring entrainment of hypolimnetic waters into the epilimnion in 2-box models were examined for dissolved O2. The effects of entrainment upon modeling and estimating the mass transfer coefficient across the thermocline were also analyzed. Use of Eulerian and semi-Lagrangian box models were contrasted. For epilimnetic dissolved O2, neglecting the upward transport of O2 by entrainment had a maximum error of 5%. A model for estimating the vertical transport coefficient, which used a heat budget for the hypolimnion and which included the entrainment process, was developed. For estimation of this coefficient, the temperature in the hypolimnion or in the thermocline was used; qualitative arguments were presented for selection of the thermocline temperature. Data suggested that the entrainment rate in Lake Ontario varied from 1-6 m/mo. and that values for the seasonal vertical transport coefficient were of the order of 0.05-0.1 m/day.																			0013-936X	1520-5851					1985	19	2					180	185		10.1021/es00132a012	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es00132a012													WOS:A1985AAT8100016

The temporal and spatial distribution of gizzard shad larvae (D. cepedianum) in Lake Cark Blackwell (LCB), Oklahoma is described to provide a basis for future efforts at sampling larvae of this important forage fish in reservoirs. Larvae were sampled with a net (mouth 0.20 m2) towed in front of a boat at night at depths of 0 (surface), 3, 5 and 7 m between April and July 1977. Wind direction and velocity, cited by other workers as decisive in determining fish larval distribution, were related to patterns of larval abundance. Larvae were captured by the gear at a length of .apprx. 5 mm, but were not captured after they reached slightly more than 15 mm .apprx. 10 wk later. Larval density was highest, .apprx. 100 m-3, during late May and early June. Larvae were captured near the surface at the outset and were apparently passively distributed by winds. The rest of the time they were most abundant at 3 m, near the compensation point, suggesting maintenance of a preferred position in the water column. Estimates of larval shad density taken offshore were the same as estimates nearshore in areas of the lake with either very high or low densities. The dendritic configuration of the lake basin precluded prediction of horizontal or vertical patterns of distribution of shad larvae. Accurate estimates of density will be possible only by intensively sampling all areas of the lake throughout the season. Stratified random sampling programs for shad larvae are not now reasonable for dendritic lakes such as LCB.																			0003-0031	1938-4238					1983	109	1					23	33		10.2307/2425511	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2425511													WOS:A1983PZ77800003

Offshore stations (7) and stations in the New Orleans Marina complex (3) were sampled seasonally. Offshore stations formed a transect from the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway to the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal (I.H.N.C.). A west to east gradient of increasing salinity and salinity stratification was evident. Faunal differences among stations were assessed using indices of diversity, biological dominance, pollution and station homogeneity. The fauna of the marina stations had a low species diversity and was dominated by annelids, indicative of a stressed environment. The fauna of stations near the I.H.N.C. were similar to the marina stations. Moving westward from the I.H.N.C., species diversity increased and the fauna became dominated by mollusks. Stressful conditions associated with the intrusion of water from the I.H.N.C. into Lake Pontchartrain appeared to be responsible for the faunal differences observed.																									1983	7	3					247	254																WOS:A1983RW64700007

The loss of dry matter and nutrients from both fresh and dried material enclosed in litter bags was studied. The pattern of loss of dry matter was diphasic. Loss was more rapid from dried than from fresh material, half the mass being lost in 18 and 28 days, respectively. Nutrient loss followed an exponential pattern. N, P and Mg were lost more rapidly from dried than from fresh material while rates of loss of Na, K and Ca were similar. The significance of Cynodon decomposition in the functioning of the floodplain is assessed from estimates of the above- and belowground standing crop around 1 small lake before and after submergence. Decomposition of plants growing in seasonally inundated areas of the floodplain may contribute significantly to the productivity of the system, but the extent of the contribution can be greatly influenced by the flooding regime. The completion of the Pongolapoort dam upstream of the foodplain will alter the natural flooding pattern, effecting a reduction in floodplain productivity, unless a program for flood release can be initiated.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1982	97	2					119	126		10.1007/BF00011965	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00011965													WOS:A1982PW50600003

[Canada]. Laboratory studies indicated clear differences between low and high-altitude populations with respect to larval growth, timing of metamorphosis, size at metamorphosis and the incidence of neoteny. Field studies indicated that low-altitude neotenous females became sexually mature at a length of 7.1 cm (snout to vent length, SVL); but owing to th4e shorter seasons within higher altitude lakes, neotenous females required more seasons to attain sexual maturity. High and low-altitude males attained sexual maturity at 7.4-cm SVL, but a few smaller, sexually mature males were discovered within the high-altitude lake. Neotenous females reproduced annually within the low-altitude lake, but high-altitude neotenous females doe not reproduce during successive years.

Both species fish in oligotrophic freshwaters, susceptible to acidification. The number of breeding sites occupied by G. stellata has been reduced by almost 50% during the last 40-50 years. For G. arctica, there are no indications of significant declines in population size or reproductive success during the last 20 years. The different trends in numbers and production of young might reflect different susceptibility to the ecological changes in acidified lakes. G. stellata prefer fishing lakes with high abundance of Acerina cernua and salmonid and cyprinid fish, such as Coregonus albula and Rutilus rutilus. They also feed their prefledged chicks almost entirely on cyprinid and salmonid fish. G. arctica prefer fishing lakes with high transparency and, when feeding in groups, high abundance of Perca fluviatilis. Their young can be fed on aquatic insects as a supplement to the fish diet. Thus, G. stellata to a higher degree than G. arctica relies on fish which are susceptible to low pH, and G. arctica may also benefit from the increased abundance of aquatic insects in lakes with reduced predation from fish. Furthermore, high water transparency is important for the selection of lakes by G. arctica but not by G. stellata. In G. stellata, high contents of mercury in eggs can be related to the intake of fish in lakes affected by acidification.																			0018-8158					APR 1	1994	279						439	444		10.1007/BF00027875	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00027875													WOS:A1994NK39900041

All stages showed a pronounced diel migration. During daylight naupliar and copepodite instars were almost exclusively benthic in shallow areas (< 10 m). Copepodite V and adult stages were predominantly benthic even at 40 m. The diurnal vertical distribution pattern implies age-related differences in photosensitivity and a possible depth-regulatory mechanism, based on the existence of differential photosensitivity, is offered to account for day-depth control. Nocturnal vertical distribution, studied approximately fortnightly during 1970-71, showed no clear seasonal variation. Variations in pattern, most obvious in adult instars, correlated with prevalent lunar conditions. Nocturnal or midnight sinking was evident, particularly in post-naupliar stages. Dusk rise and dawn descent were performed at very low light intensities and paralleled changes in light penetration. Dawn descent was less rapid than the dusk rise. An ephemeral dawn rise was sometimes observed but was not a consistent feature of all stages. An endogenous rhythm of locomotor activity was recorded under laboratory conditions. Activity was low during daylight, increased sharply at dusk and then decreased through the night to reach daytime levels at dawn. The stimulus provided by changes in light intensity and/or endogenous activity changes can account for the dusk and dawn movements of P. hessei but a definitive identification of the direct migratory stimulus is not possible. Attention is called to a closer examination of the role of endogenous activity rhythms in vertical migratory behavior. The possible adaptive value of vertical migration to P. hessei is examined briefly.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1976	6	2					183	198		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1976.tb01603.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1976.tb01603.x													WOS:A1976BM81400011
J	Dawe, CE; Reekie, EG				Dawe, Christine E.; Reekie, Edward G.			The effects of flooding regime on the rare Atlantic coastal plain species Hydrocoytle umbellata	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												The hydrological regime on many lakes is changing through climate change, construction of dams, and land-use changes. We examined the effects of flooding regime on growth and development of the endangered semiaquatic species, Hydrocotyle umbellata L. (water pennywort), in a greenhouse experiment. Growth was twice as fast under dry, above-water (terrestrial) conditions as under flood conditions. Depth of flooding (15 or 30 cm) had little impact. Short-term floods at either the middle or end of the growing season were just as damaging as continuous flooding. The decrease in growth under flood conditions was largely due to a temporary reduction in unit leaf rate (growth per unit leaf area) rather than to a reduction in leaf area ratio (leaf area per unit mass). Flooded plants allocated more resources to the production of petioles at the expense of reproductive structures and to a lesser extent, belowground structures. They also produced fewer, larger leaves with more stomata on the upper than on the lower surface. These changes in structure were largely restricted to new leaves produced under flood conditions; most of the mature leaves produced in a terrestrial environment senesced upon flooding. Chemical analysis of tubers produced by plants grown under terrestrial conditions indicates that these structures function in carbohydrate storage. The likely impact of changes in hydrological regime on this endangered species is discussed in light of these findings.																			0008-4026					FEB	2007	85	2					167	174		10.1139/B07-008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/B07-008													WOS:000247094000006

The females were grouped in heifers (n=28), primiparous (n=22) and adult cows (n=38) during the rainy (n=32), dry (n=28) and intermediate seasons (n=28). The animals were in a farm at the Basin of the Maracaibo Lake, localized at 10 degrees NL, with bi-modal precipitation of 1200 mm, and 28-32 degrees C mean temperature. Cows were on pastures, especially guinea (Panicum maximum, Jacq). Estrous was observed at 4 hours (h) intervals with vasectomised bulls; it was defined as the time when the female accepted to be mounted, and was confirmed by the presence of a F-3 mature follicle, through rectal palpation. Ovulation time was considered at the moment when the F-3 follicle disappeared. Ovulation occurred 28.2 +/- 5.8 h from the beginning, and 14.4 +/- 3.3 h from the end of natural estrous, in cows with an estrous period of 13.8 +/- 4.6 h. There were no differences (P> 0.05) between breed predominance, age or parity, however, the ovulation time was later in Holstein (31.2 and 16.0 h) or during the dry season (31.1 and 15.7 h) and was earlier in heifers (24.3 and 12.7 h) than in primiparous (28.2 and 14.3 h) or adult cows (31.1 and 15.8 h) after the beginning and the end of estrous respectively.																			0798-2259					JUL-SEP	1998	8	3					259	264																WOS:000075274500009

The concentrations are also significantly high in the entrance and exist of the lake. Proportions are different between particulate metal and dissolved metal. Manganese concentrates in particulate phase, As concentrates in dissolved phase, other metals such as Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd, Ni and Hg frequently migrate between particulate phase and dissolved phase, which can be attributed to seasonal and regional factors. Upon comparison of the concentration coefficient of suspended particulate matter (SPM) and water phase among different water bodies in the world, the metal concentration ability is placed in the middle in Dongting Lake water. The log (K-d) values indicate poor correlations against SPM concentrations.																					978-0-415-45136-9				2007							1463	1466																WOS:000252215500308

Over the same period, CO2 flux halved at S. Maria delle Mole (16.8 tonnes/day in 2000 and 8.3 tonnes/day in 2006). Also the quantity Of CO2 dissolved in the deep waters of the Albano crater lake decreased by one order of magnitude in the period 1997-2006. The high CO2 flux values in 2000 could represent the "tail" of a strong degassing episode recorded at Colli Albani in 1995 and related to local earthquakes. The following decrease Of CO2 flux could reflect a permeability decrease caused by hydrothermal calcite precipitation favored by PCO2 reduction in the deep source .					; Tarchini, Luca/AAN-6002-2021	Tarchini, Luca/0000-0001-6045-0802; 															978-0-415-45136-9				2007							199	202																WOS:000252215500039

However, is not yet a trivial task due to the inherent ecosystem complexity and, unfortunately, the scarcity of pristine, unaltered systems. The high mountain lakes are ideal ecosystems for developing tools to detect the environmental changes. Thus, the small lakes of Sierra Nevada National Park are singular ecosystems with great ecological and scientific values in the context of Mediterranean area. These lakes have communities adapted to extreme environmental conditions, with marked seasonal changes.

J	Kuczynska-Kippen, N				Kuczynska-Kippen, Natalia			Interactions of con-generic Lecane species (Rotifera) within different macrophyte patches in a shallow lake	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The research on the distribution of species of the Lecane genus among different types of macrophytes (including rushes, nymphaeids and two zones of submerged macrophytes) in comparison with open water was carried out for three years in a shallow lake (Lake Budzynskie, western Poland; an area 17.4 ha, maximum depth - 2.7 m and a mean depth - 1.4 m) in order to determine the possibility of their competition and of co-existence. The distinct species of submerged macrophytes create separate vegetation beds and patches in the lake. The size of a particular macrophyte bed did not exceed the area of 5 m. Zooplankton samples were collected between 1997 and 1999 (from April to October, at about 2-week intervals) in the shallow part (approx. 1 m deep) of a lake. Nymphaeids were only sampled during the 1998 and 1999. Samples were taken at each site using a plexiglass core sampler (0 50 mm). Subsamples of a volume of about 1.5 1 from the surface layer (0-1.5m) were sampled from randomly chosen places within each macrophyte patch. Six Lecane species were analysed (Lecane bulla (Gosse), L. closterocerca (Schmarda), L. flexilis (Gosse), L. furcata (Murray), L. luna (Muller) and L. lunaris (Ehrenberg)). L. bulla dominated at most of the examined stations each year. Detailed seasonal analysis of the abundance of particular species of the Lecane genus in most cases revealed the replacement character of their occurrence. The sudden increase in the numbers of one species caused a simultaneous decrease of another within the same macrophyte stand. A distinct replacement pattern was observed for L. bulla, which was replaced by L. closterocerca or L. luna and for another two pairs of species (L. closterocerca with L. furcata and L. flexilis with L. luna). At the same time, pairs of species such as L. closterocerca-L. lunaris (statistically positive correlation was found in the case of Chara bed - r(s) = 0.70; P = 0.007), L. flexilis-L. furcata (within Typha - r(s) = 0.58; P = 0.048) and also L. luna-L. furcata (in the Myriophyllum bed - r(s) = 0.80; P = 0.001) exhibited a similar pattern of seasonal changes without, however, revealing the exchange occurrence between each other. The pattern of species replacement within a genus is an example of the competitive exclusion of closely related species. The nature of the seasonal distribution of species of the Lecane genus, replacing each other over a period of time, may be connected with the niche overlap of particular species, which results in time segregation. Exploitative competition cannot be excluded when describing such behaviour.

Interannual water level variations in Lake Izabal, Guatemala, Centroamerica, using radar altimetry, and its relationship with oceanographic features - art. no. 67430L	REMOTE SENSING OF THE OCEAN, SEA ICE, AND LARGE WATER REGIONS 2007	PROCEEDINGS OF THE SOCIETY OF PHOTO-OPTICAL INSTRUMENTATION ENGINEERS (SPIE)				Conference on Remote Sensing of the Ocean, Sea Ice, and Large Water Regions 2007	SEP 17-18, 2007	Florence, ITALY	SPIE				It is well known that ocean-atmosphere dynamic affects the weather conditions over the continents and the ocean itself. The hydrologic cycle is driven by climatic parameters like precipitation, temperature, evaporation, winds and humidity. Hence, the river's water discharges and lake water level variations are impelled by climatic conditions also. Lake Izabal is the largest one in Guatemala; its main tributary is the Polochic River. Its level is related to the Polochic Rivers runoff and therefore to the precipitation/evaporation over its catchment area. The Lake Izabal water level fluctuations are driven by the annual cycle of rainy and dry seasons. In this study the ENVISAT RA-2 Geophysical Data Records orbits over the lake, coupled with in-situ measurements are used in order to determine and characterize the lake level fluctuations. The precipitation records over the lake's catchment area are also analyzed. In addition, some relationships of the lake level interannual variations with the climate indexes of Southern Oscillation Index SOI and the Tropical North Atlantic NATL were investigated. The main result is that the abrupt lake level rise in July 2006 is correlated to an abnormal precipitation in June 2006. Theoretically, this was forced by "La Nina" Southern Oscillation events during early 2006.					del Rosario, Jose/AAU-2288-2020; Gomez-Enri, Jesus/G-2726-2010; Gómez-Enri, Jesús/G-2726-2010	Villares Duran, Maria Pilar/0000-0002-4946-8072; Gomez-Enri, Jesus/0000-0001-6053-5160; 													0277-786X		978-0-8194-6901-4				2007	6743						L7430	L7430		10.1117/12.737793	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.737793													WOS:000253268500015

Integrated soil fertility management and poverty traps in western Kenya	ADVANCES IN INTEGRATED SOIL FERTILITY MANAGEMENT IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA: CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES					Biannual Meeting on Advances in Integrated Soil Fertility Management in Sub-Saharan Africa - Challenges and Opportunities	MAY, 2004	Yaounde, CAMEROON					Based on agro-climatic conditions, the highland districts around Lake Victoria in western Kenya should be a food surplus area. In practice, they are heavily dependent on food imports, whilst national poverty surveys consistently show them to be amongst the poorest in the country. At the root of this problem are high population densities and, therefore, small land holdings, and limited access to markets. As a result of continuous cropping with very little investment in soil fertility replenishment, the soils have become severely depleted. Many poor households in these districts are now caught in a "maize-focused poverty trap", whereby their first agricultural priority is to provide themselves with maize for home consumption, yet yields are low and returns are insufficient to support investment in either organic soil fertility enhancement technologies or inorganic fertilizers. Thus, despite that the majority of average household puts large portions of its land under maize during both cropping seasons, it is still unable to feed itself for several months of the year. In addition to the problem of low soil fertility, continuous cropping of maize has also led to an endemic infestation of the striga weed throughout these districts, further depressing maize yields. To invest in soils, most households (unless they have a reliable source of non-farm income) need to diversify into higher value crops than maize. However, the combination of small land holdings and existing maize deficits mean that they will only plant other crops if they can simultaneously raise their maize yields. Achieving this requires that a number of conditions must be in place. Firstly, households must be linked to markets, so that they can identify higher value cropping opportunities and be able to market their crops once they have grown them. In the western highlands, most producers are only familiar with local markets (where opportunities are limited) and they can initially only offer small quantities of produce, which reduces their attractiveness to potential buyers. Secondly, they need technical knowledge, on best cultural practices for the new crops and, critically, on how to manage their natural resource base, so as to increase their yields both of maize and of the new crops. Thirdly, they need to be able to access good quality seeds of crop varieties that are both suited to their local production conditions and are demanded in the market-place. Finally, most will also need access to credit, so as to be able to acquire inputs for more intensive maize production. This credit can then be repaid out of the sale of the additional crops later in the year. Critically, all these conditions need to be in place within their local area before poor households can hope to shift from a maize-only production system to one that delivers enhanced food and cash, whilst simultaneously enhancing the soil fertility on which future production depends. This paper reports the experience of a DFID-funded action research project that, since 2001, has been exploring the potential for coordinated development interventions to enhance livelihoods through the promotion of integrated soil fertility management in collaboration with national and international institutes and extension services. Experiences with the provision of technical advice, the development of a community based credit scheme for agricultural inputs, initial steps towards linking farmers to new markets and making new seeds available to producers are reviewed and constraints identified, along with initial indications of the impact that coordinated service provision could have on agricultural production and livelihoods. Finally, the over-arching challenge of how to coordinate the provision of these services on a sustainable basis is considered.					; Vanlauwe, Bernard/ADL-7146-2022	Ndufa, James K./0000-0003-4878-1937; 															978-1-4020-5759-5				2007							1061	1075		10.1007/978-1-4020-5760-1_104	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4020-5760-1_104													WOS:000251577700104

The research of the influence of farming on the outflow of phosphorus by a drainage network was conducted in 2005 and 2006 in the catchment area of Dobskie Lake. The research object is situated in the area of the Mazurian Lakeland, in the village of Doha. Agricultural areas surrounding the village are used by an agricultural farm named Dobrol, which specialises in pig husbandry. During the 2-year research period, it was noted that the amount of phosphorus flowing by the drainage network depended most of all on atmospheric conditions, season and intensity of agricultural exploitation of the area.																			1898-617X						2007	1	1-2					221	225																WOS:000253275900036
S	Sako, A		Sarkar, D; Datta, R; Hannigan, R		Sako, Aboubakar			Geochemical cycling of trace and rare earth elements in Lake Tanganyika and its major tributaries	CONCEPTS AND APPLICATIONS IN ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY	Developments in Environmental Science											Fe and Mn and light rare earth elements (LREE) were used to evaluate the biogeochemical factors affecting trace element distribution and cycling in Lake Tanganyika, East Africa. Dissolved trace elements were measured in samples from the lake and its three major tributaries (the Ruzizi, Malagarasi and Lufubu rivers) by ICP-MS. The river waters were relatively trace element-and REE-enriched compared to the lake waters. Ce-anomalies varied among the rivers and within the lake. Normalized REE patterns of the lake waters to the average upper continental crust were more similar to those of the Ruzizi River, which might be due to the relatively high pH values in the two systems. Hydrodynamics, Fe, and Mn coating and biogenic activity appeared to be the major biogeochemical factors that affect horizontal distribution of trace elements in the lake. Vertical fractionation of LREE was greater in the Southern Basin than the Northern Basin. The high-trace element and REE concentrations near the surface in the Southern Basin might be due to upwelling in this basin during the dry season. The coincidence of Ce/Ce* and Sm-UCC/Yb-UCC maxima with those of Fe and Mn (60 m) suggested that Fe- and Mn-oxyhydroxides were responsible for the vertical distribution of trace elements in Lake Tanganyika. The occurrence of nutrient profile minima at 60 m also suggested that trace elements and LREE cycling may be enhanced by bacterial reduction process. This study highlighted the importance of riverine inputs, Fe, Mn and LREE geochemistry and hydrodynamics in spatial abundance, and cycling of trace elements across Lake Tanganyika.

There was no evidence of any fish entrainment probably because of the location of the entrance to the water intake system.

Of these, 43 spp. were new records from Antarctica. All the Protozoa were cosmopolitan and with few exceptions of small size (< 150 .mu.m). Flagellates and ciliates showed the greatest species diversity but flagellates and amoebae dominated numerically. Cluster analysis identified differences in species composition between lake populations and pool populations. Despite the wide range of trophic status evident within the 2 groups of systems, population composition was remarkably similar within each group. Seasonal fluctuations, both in major groups (flagellates and rhizopod amoebae) and individual species, were linked with fluctuations in numbers and activity of algae and bacteria. A large proportion of the rhizopod population was always encysted; flagellate cysts normally constituted less than 5% of the total population. Flagellates are the most important protozoan group in these polar freshwater systems and constitute a potentially substantial grazing component.																			0007-0262						1984		62					67	81																WOS:A1984SC44000006

Whitefish hosted the following 19 genera, 18 of which were in cisco with generally lower intensity levels: [Tetracotyle intermedia, Proteocephalus exiguus, P. filicollis, Diplostomum spathaceum, Triaenophorus crassus, Metechinorhynchus salmonis, Cystidicola farionis, Discocotyle sagittaria, Raphidascaris sp., Cyathocephalus truncutus, Crepidostomum farionis, Ergasilus nerkae, Salmincola extumescens, S. extensus, Argulus canadensis, Spinitectus gracilis, Piscicola milneri, Diphyllobothrium sp., Neoechinorhynchus cylindratum, Pomphorhynchus bulbocalli and Contracaecum brachyurum]. Parasites exhibited definite patterns of abundance with host age and season, the primary causes being dietary and behavioral. No differences in parasite abundance existed between host sexes. Ranking of cisco parasites was significantly different between 2 sampling sites while whitefish parasites did not differ. Whitefish and cisco from sites 40 miles (64 km) apart had significantly different abundances of T. intermedia but not T. crassus. An increase in the abundance of copepod-vectored cestodes with a concomitant decrease in abundance of amphipod-vectored parasites is predicted after flooding and diversion.

A clear seasonal periodicity in relative abundance could not be proved for any of the diatoms in spite of a variation in the irradiance from about 8-10 cal.cm-2 day-1 in June-July to 0.1-0.2 cal.cm-2 day-1 in February. The diatoms were living on a yearly PAR-irradiance of only 1000 cal.cm-2 year-1, which is 2.2% of that at the lake surface. The seasonal fluctuations in CO2 and pH in 11.25 m subsurface depth are shown by diagrams. Diatom inferred pH is compared with measured pH.																			0107-055X						1994	14	3					345	360		10.1111/j.1756-1051.1994.tb00618.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1756-1051.1994.tb00618.x													WOS:A1994PH75300017

Out of 15,324 household heads interviewed, 42.8% got their water from taps throughout the year and during the dry season the remaining 58.2% got their water from rivers, streams, boreholes, ponds, roof catchments and one or two other sources. In the wet season three times as many households use roof catchment and fewer households use rivers and streams and boreholes. Only 21.9% were dissatisfied with their supply in the dry season the main reason being dirty water and insufficient quantity. These findings indicate a need to expand the provision of piped water into the rural communities and promote roof water harvesting in the lake basin. Roof catchment would provide safe water in areas without piped water, and as reserve water in those with piped. The safety of water from roofs made of natural and traditional materials, such as grass and palm leaves (makuti) need to be assessed.																			0012-835X					JAN	1994	71	1					39	41											8055763					WOS:A1994NP10000010

In the short term, heavy straw accumulation may reduce grain yields by smoothering seedlings; in the long term, the balance of nutrients in a lake may be affected. An aquatic weed harvester was used to remove standing straw from part of a wild rice stand at the end of the growing season. Compared to the control plot, grain production increased twofold in the following year. However, straw production also increased significantly and may exacerbate the problem in future years. Decomposition bags containing chopped and unchopped straw were submerged in a lake to assess the rate of straw breakdown: complete decomposition may require 3 yr. Decomposition occurred most rapidly during the early part of each growing season. No difference was noted in rates of decomposition or nutrient release between the chopped and unchopped straw. Reduced light levels under straw loadings up to 5000 kg ha-1 in laboratory trials did not affect seedling development. However, seedling survival was severely reduced under artificial straw loads and none survived straw additions equivalent to 5000 kg ha-1.																			0008-4220					APR	1991	71	2					337	345		10.4141/cjps91-048	http://dx.doi.org/10.4141/cjps91-048													WOS:A1991FV39100004

Communities of Tubificidae and Lumbriculidae were used to characterize sampling stations. These results were analyzed with factorial correspondence analysis. Differences in worm communities due to microdistribution and seasonal variation inside location were small compared with differences between sampling stations. Locations from a previous study classified as polluted and not polluted by chemical and biological criteria were entered into the analysis as reference stations. Distance on the factorial plots between studied and reference stations indicated their pollution level. Positions of worm species around sampling locations allowed these to be classified as indicators of pollution level. Since 1962 pollution has modified worm communities between the 150 and 310 m isobaths. Deep water stations, where O2 is low, have a fauna similar to shallow water stations near the sewage outfall of Vidy. Tubifex tubifex is present in the most polluted conditions. Stylodrilus heringianus is an indicator of unpolluted conditions. Potamothrix vejdovskyi, P. heuscheri and P. hammoniensis can be used to indicate a gradient of increasing pollution.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1978	57	3					241	247		10.1007/BF00014578	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00014578													WOS:A1978EM80500006

Only 5 desmids were perennial, performing cell divisions in a frozen lake at PAR at only 5 cal cm-2 day-1, below ice-cover. The greatest number of desmids per 100 ml lake water was found in September; it never exceeded 150. Owing to a concentration of free CO2 of only 0.02 mM 1(-1) and a HCO3- concentration of 0.002 mM 1(-1) the densities of desmid cells were often smaller than 1 cell per 100 ml lake water. A density of 1 cell per 1 ml was attained only by Staurastrum longipes, a desmid showing temporal variation. The relation of the compound phytoplankton quotient to two components of the CO2-system is discussed.

Comparative analysis of the energy flows in the ecosystem of a small eutrophic lake during three vegetation seasons (balance model)	ZHURNAL OBSHCHEI BIOLOGII												Seasonal energy flows were calculated, based on a simulation balance model, from unique data collected during three vegatation seasons, 1986-1988, in the ecosystem of the Lake Bolshoy Okunyonok. Leningrad province. The model is based on principles developed by G.G. Winberg's school of production hydrobiology and was described in detail in an earlier work (Kazantseva, 2003). Analysis and comparison of the results showed that certain regularities of energy transformation processes in any lake ecosystem are apparent in spite of natural differences determined by differences in the environment properties and the levels of development of the ecosystem components. For instance, the extreme importance of the bacteriadetritus element in the food chains of water-body was confirmed. Broad spectrum of food and considerable changes in food composition during a vegetation season were clearly shown for most hydrobionts. The degree of consumption was estimated for the production of the organisms at each trophic level. It was shown that all the consumers eat away ca. 50-60 per cent of the production of the forage phytoplankton, 90 per cent of the production of non-predatory benthos, and 20-50 per cent of the production of the other trophic groups during a season. The proposed coefficient of energy transformation, CET(s, k) = P-s(k)/P-k, where P-s(k) in the production of the consumers created by consuming the source k, and P-k is the production of the source itself, proved to be more stable than the generally accepted coefficient q = P-s/P-1.

Influenza virus isolates were detected in tracheal and cloacal swabs from sentinal ducks and from healthy pelagic birds. Influenza A virus epidemics with different subtypes in an influenza season beginning in July/Aug. occurred approximately monthly. According to serological population studies in wild pelagic birds, some influenza A virus epidemics were related to fowl plague virus (Hav1) and swine influenza virus (Hsw1). It is possible to recognize epidemics among wild birds by sentinels and periodic serological observations of wild pelagic bird populations. One isolate from sentinel ducks [A/duck/Potsdam/81 (Hav8 Nav5)] had a previously undescribed combination of the surface antigens.																			0174-3031						1982	253	3					297	304											7170852					WOS:A1982QB32900002

The dynamics of phytoplankton pigment characteristics of Lake Teletskoye	HYDROBIOLOGIA					3rd Symposium on Species in Ancient Lakes	SEP 02-07, 2002	Quincy, WA					Photosynthetic phytoplankton pigments were investigated in the surface layer of the pelagic zone of Lake Teletskoye during ice-free periods in 1998-2000. Pigment characteristics were also monitored at the lake outflow, the Biya River, from July 1998 till September 2001. Processes of lake phytoplankton development and functioning are closely represented at the river site, as are changes of pigment composition that follow dynamic regularities. On the basis of seasonal fluctuations of pigment concentrations, five phases in planctonic algal development were revealed. Comparisons of phytoplankton seasonal dynamics in this deep oligotrophic lake with those of different lake types of the temperate zone were considered. The trophic status of the pelagic zone and outflow at the Biya River indicated by chlorophyll a content corresponds to ultraoligotrophic-oligotrophic conditions. The relationship between green and yellow pigments classifies Lake Teletskoye with water bodies of "carotene" type. The low values of pigment index indicate an active physiological state of microalgae over the whole year. A weak linear relationship between chlorophyll a content and temperature, as well as lack of correlation with mineral nitrogen and silicon, testify to a complex interdependence resulting from synchronous effects of abiotic and biotic factors. The development of phytoplankton in the lake is limited by extremely low concentrations of dissolved reactive phosphorus and silicon.

There is no selectivity for host sex. Female mites do not reside in smaller bivalves. The incidence of infection and host loading increases with bivalve length. No evidence was found for territoriality of females within the host or for seasonal variations in abundance of either males or females. Only 1 male mite resides in each infected host. Incidence of infection increases with host size up to 5 cm and then remains stable at about 52%. A positive male-female association occurs during the warm water period but not after the water cools. The sex ratio is 1.60 females:1 male. The teleiochrysalis occurs in the siphons during July at a density approximately 2.5 times that of the adults. Eggs are laid from late May until early July in the mantle tissue of most available hosts. The eggs hatch the following June and the larvae leave. Nymphs are found periodically except when teleiochrysalises are present.

The lakes differ in their trophic state and pollution level. Epicarditis was found more often than myocarditis (22 % in perch and 18.4 % in roach vs 16.1 and 5.4 %, respectively). Most cases of epicarditis found in perch were chronic (86 %), but only a minority of those in roach were so (24 %), the others being acute, subacute or subchronic. Myocarditis was nearly always chronic in both species. No relationship was found between the stage or degree of inflammation in the fish and the pollution level in the lake, and all stages of inflammation were found at all seasons with no significant seasonal trend in their prevalence, nor was any relationship found between the prevalence of inflammation and the size of the fish in any of the lakes. Myocarditis and epicarditis occurred independently of each other in roach, but their joint occurrence in individual fish differed significantly from the random in perch, showing a positive correlation. Macrophage centres were found in 16 % of the epicardium specimens and 24 % of the myocardium specimens from perch and in 8.7 and 7.8 % from roach, respectively, as well as in the bulbus arteriosus and atrium of both species.

J	GEORGE, DG				GEORGE, DG			THE SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION OF NUTRIENTS IN THE SOUTH BASIN OF WINDERMERE	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												The vertical and horizontal distribution of electrical conductivity, soluble reactive P (SRP), total P, NH3-N and NO3-N in the South Basin of Windermere is described and related, where possible, to spatial variations in phytoplankton and zooplankton. For most variables, the maximum range of horizontal variation on a single day was greater than the maximum range of seasonal variation measured at a single station over a full year. Horizontal variations in SRP and NH3 were particularly high, with coefficients of variation often exceeding 100%. The errors associated with sampling at a single station were most pronounced when local accumulations of zooplankton or phytoplankton occurred in the lake. Horizontal variations in conductivity were primarily influenced by the discharge of treated sewage effluent into the central region and the mass transport of water from the more oligotrophic North Basin. Occasionally, more widespread variations in conductivity appeared to be related to spatial variations in photosynthetic activity. The major factor influencing the horizontal distribution of SRP was the discharge of treated effluent into the central region. Despite the intensive recycling of P, SRP concentrations were nearly always 10-30% higher near the sewage works than elsewhere in the basin. On a few occasions, significant horizontal differences in SRP concentration were also detected within downwind accumulations of crustacean zooplankton. Horizontal variations in total P were produced by spatial differences in SRP concentration or by local accumulations of phytoplankton or zooplankton. Horizontal differences in NH3 concentration appeared to be produced, both by the effluent discharge and by the turbulent transfer of nutrients from sediments in shallow water. Observations of effluent movement and dispersion demonstrate that wind-induced water movements tend to recirculate nutrient-rich water in the central region and limit mixing along the axis of the basin. The statistical implications of nutrient heterogeneity are discussed in relation to sampling strategy and the possible effects of persistent nutrient concentration gradients on phytoplankton patch formation are assessed.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1981	11	5					405	424		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1981.tb01273.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1981.tb01273.x													WOS:A1981MJ90100002

Recently, a once diverse submerged macrophyte flora has, in most broads, been replaced by large phytoplankton populations. This change has been attributed to increased nutrient loadings.

A reduction in the P loading is recommended as the best method of restricting phytoplankton populations in these broads. An equation relating P loading, flushing rate, mean depth and retention coefficient to mean standing P concentration is used to predict the reduction in P loading required to limit phytoplankton populations and permit the re-establishment of submerged macrophytes.																			0020-9309						1981	66	2					171	202		10.1002/iroh.19810660204	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19810660204													WOS:A1981LT82800002

CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Chemical properties of suspended matter are presented for the 1980 ice-free season in Castle Lake. The algal and non-algal components of the seston were estimated by regression analysis of particulate C (PC), particulate N (PN) and particulate protein N (PPN) on chlorophyll. Algal and non-algal PC and PN existed in about equal proportions in the epilimnion, but that the respective non-algal proportions were .apprx. 2 and 5 times greater in the hypolimnion. Respiratory electron transport system (ETS) activity per unit chlorophyll was high in the bottom waters suggesting that the non-algal PC, PN and PPN were not refractory materials, but instead represented an accumulation of organic matter with associated bacteria that had settled into deep water. That over 3 times as much PPN was associated with PN in the deep water, relative to the 0-5 m layer, corroborated this conclusion. PC:chlorophyll and PN:chlorophyll ratios were used in conjunction with chlorophyll specific assimilation rates of C and N to show that the turnover of algal C and N were, on the average, in equilibrium during 1980 and were fairly uniform in both the epi- and hyolimnion. A comparison of the algal PC:PN ratios to literature values indicated that the shallow and deep-living phytoplankton were growing at .apprx. 33 and 80%, respectively, of their maximum specific growth rate. The deep-living phytoplankton were, on the average, an actively growing assemblage and owed much of their existence to their close proximity to a deep-dissolved inorganic N (DIN) pool.																			0003-9136						1983	97	3					373	388																WOS:A1983RA07600007
J	DEVAUX, J; ALEYA, L				DEVAUX, J; ALEYA, L			A NEW APPROACH TO ANALYZE THE LACUSTRINE PHYTOPLANKTON COMMUNITY STRUCTURE	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Seasonal periodicity of phytoplankton was studied in oligo-mesotrophic Lake Pavin and eutrophic Lake Aydat (Massif Central, France), respectively over 1983 and 1984 - 1985. Weekly samples were taken from both-lake euphotic zones. An attempt was made to present a new approach contributing to the understanding of the ecosystem functioning through the coupling of phytoplankton community structure, rank-frequencies diagrams and adjusting models to field observations. We calculated the specific diversity index (H), established the rank-frequencies diagrams and adjusted our results to models by considering phytoplankton specific biomasses relative to the whole integrated euphotic zones of both lakes (i.e. 0 - 20 m and 0 - 4 m weighted mean specific biomasses, respectively for Lake Pavin and Lake Aydat). The rank-frequencies diagrams were used since no diversity index is known to distinguish stage 2 from stage 3, i.e. the stages described by MARGALEF (1968). In Lake Pavin, the (1 - 2 - 3) succession stages were well delimited, the phytoplankton community structure was overall suitably described by the MANDELBROT model. The phytoplankton community of Lake Aydat appeared to be constantly juvenile and permanently immature. Several oscillations (i.e., stage 2 - stage 3 - stage 2), without a return to the pioneer stage 1, were observed over the seasonal succession of species. The grazing pressure exerted on phytoplankton was advanced to explain such oscillations through fluctuations of coefficients beta and gamma of the MANDELBROT model. The apparant paradox relative to a quasi permanent immaturity of phytoplankton communities evolving in eutrophic ecosystems could be interpreted in terms of robustness and elasticity of the system. Furthermore, we suggest that stage 1' (i.e., described by FRONTIER (1977)) and stage 3 must be fused in one stage which would correspond to the dynamic equilibrium of the community. Lastly, among the existing models describing the community structure of ecosystems, the MANDELBROT model seemed at present the less mistakable tool for that purpose.																			0003-9136					OCT	1993	128	3					287	308																WOS:A1993MF27200003

Their percentage composition by species in sediments is integrated over habitats and seasons. Under stable conditions the relative frequency distribution of species corresponds to the MacArthur broken-stick model, so that marked departures from the predicted distributions indicate perturbations in the system. Lakes differ greatly in their capacity to buffer the effects of external changes. Cladocera can also indicate fluctuations in lake level, the changing effectiveness over time of size-selective predation, and broad patterns of climatic change through invasion and extinction of species. The remains of dipterous larvae (chiefly Chironomidae) are not only much less abundant than Cladocera but also have a much greater taxonomic uncertainty. The profundal taxa provide clear insight into changing conditions in the hypolimnion over time and of the long-term readjustments and changes in the total fauna and their environmental correlates. Rhizopods, neorhabdocoeles and rotifers, although barely studied to date, give promise in helping interpret past conditions.																			0008-4301	1480-3283					1976	54	12					2208	2226		10.1139/z76-253	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z76-253													WOS:A1976CR83800017

The results showed, that Daphnia controlled free-living HNF in the clear-water stage in June and under the conditions of an Asterionella bloom in August as well as in November. Effects on particle-bound flagellates (78% of HNF biomass in August) and decreasing picoplankton biomasses suggest that besides the predominating direct effects also indirect mechanisms were responsible for the strong influence of Daphnia on HNF.																			1434-2944	1522-2632					1998	83				SI		401	408																WOS:000078647300055

Regression analyses of these data were used to differentiate and quantify newly produced planktonic particulate matter (zooplankton + phytoplankton + bacteria) and different types of resuspended particulate matter (organic, inorganic). Resuspended particulate matter was frequently dominant in the water column (yearly mean: 59 % of suspended particulate matter), and resuspended particulate organic matter ranged from 11 to 99 % of suspended particulate organic matter (yearly mean: 41 %). The high amount of resuspended particulate matter originates from erosion/transportation bottoms which are located at water depths above 16 m and which cover 93 % of the lake area. Resuspended particulate matter was significantly related to diatom biomass but not to any other type of planktonic biomass. Consequently, the seasonal variations in the amount and distribution of diatoms can be explained by the hydrodynamic processes which affect the amount and distribution of resuspended particulate matter while seasonal variations in the amount and distribution of other planktonic biomass need further explanations, like active swimming, floating and grazing resistance.

NF was positively correlated to heterocyst density, cell numbers of nitrogen fixing algae and nitrate (NO3-) concentrations. Nitrogen fixation was best described by density of nitrogen fixing algae and nitrate concentration in a stepwise multiple linear regression. Apparently, high concentrations of ammonium + ammonia (NH4+) reduced NF to nil during July and early August. A decrease in NH4+ concentration was probably responsible for an increase in the density of Anabaena spp. during late August and an increase in rates of NF. The seasonal contribution of NF to the N budget was 1268 kg N2 or 1.3 kg N Ha-1. However, the percentage contribution was only 1.5%.

Short-term (4 h) uptake experiments showed seasonal changes in the size distributions of organisms taking up inorganic C, glucose C and orthophosphate in the lake water. In a time-course experiment of 48 h (Jan. 1976) most, but not all, of the photosynthetic activity (average 72%) and a similar fraction of chlorophyll (72%) were associated with organisms retained on 3 .mu.m Nuclepore filters (retention on 0.4 .mu.m filters was 100%). About 90% of the organisms that assimilated glucose passed through 3 .mu.m filters. Photosynthetic C fixation, dark C uptake and heterotrophic uptake of glucose C accounted for 99, 1 and 1%, respectively, of the total net C assimilated during the first 6 h. Radioactive P showed an initial rapid uptake into particles, which was not affected by light or dark. This methodology has a wide potential for elucidating the flux of nutrients into various components of the microplankton and in characterizing different aquatic environments.																			0095-3628	1432-184X					1977	3	4					279	288		10.1007/BF02010736	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02010736								24233665					WOS:A1977EP85700002

This relationship was particularly pronounced in a shallow bay where sediment P decreased with lake phytoplankton growth and increased with their decline. Studies were undertaken to identify inorganic P components responsible for these changes where changes occurred. Release of P from sediments during periods of maximal biological productivity in the shallow bay waters was due primarily to reductions in inorganic P mineral components soluble in NaOH (0.1M) and citrate-dithionite, suggesting that P associated with hydrated Fe oxides was the principal soucre of P to the overlying waters and to the biota. Increases in sediment inorganic P, which occurred when phytoplantkton growth diminished, where due principally to increases in P mineral components soluble in NH4F, indicating that resorbed P was F-exchangeable and/or associated with crystalline and amorphous Al-P components. Changes in the form of sediment P which occurred in the lake and in laboratory equilibrium studies, indicated that conversion of resorbed NH4F soluble-P to NaOH (0.1M) and citrate-dithionite soluble-P, must be a relatively long term (> 2 yr) process. Taken together, the NH4F, NaOH (0.1M), and citrate-dithionite fractions accounted for approximately 85% of the seasonal variance in total inorganic P which occurred at all sampling locations in the lake system.																			0047-2425	1537-2537					1977	6	1					100	104		10.2134/jeq1977.00472425000600010022x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1977.00472425000600010022x													WOS:A1977CW11200022
J	DANELL, K				DANELL, K			POPULATION-DYNAMICS OF MUSKRAT IN A SHALLOW SWEDISH LAKE	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												Some aspects of reproduction and the predation pressure by foxes were studied by regular surveys of a population of muskrats (Ondatra zibethica zibethica (L.)) in a northern Swedish lake, where they exclusively inhabited houses. A population increase, peak and subsequent decrease were observed. The breeding season lasted about 110 days. The number of litters per house was usually 1, but 2 and even 3 litters did occur. The mean litter size was 4.8 and the 1st litter was the largest. During the different phases of population change no apparent difference occurred in the reproductive variables. During years in which voles (Microtus and Clethrionomys spp.) were abundant, the predation pressure of foxes on muskrats was low and high muskrat population gains were recorded. When voles were scarce, the predation pressure was high and muskrat gains were low, i.e., a parallelism between the muskrat and the vole cycles existed and also a time-lag between them, the muskrats reaching their peak numbers 1 yr after the vole population peak. A vole-fox-muskrat cyclic relationship is proposed.																			0021-8790	1365-2656					1978	47	3					697	709		10.2307/3665	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3665													WOS:A1978GA16100004

A total of 47 taxa were identified but 90% of individuals were represented by 7 taxa (Candona rawsoni, Cytheromorpha fuscata, Pisidium spp., Amnicola limosa, Harnischia curtilamellata, Procladius freemani and Chironomus sp.). The spatial and temporal dynamics, dispersion patterns and life cycles of these abundant species are described. The net production was 5.05 kcal/m2 per yr for the only carnivorous species (P. freemani) and 28.53 kcal/m2 per yr for non-carnivorous species. The gastropod A. limosa and the chironomid Chironomus sp. may be the most important contributors to the total biomass and net production of the community.

In the permanent pond (surface area = 396 m2, maximum depth = 0.7 m) the population was bivoltine and iteroparous; in the temporary pond (surface area = 1042 m2, maximum depth = 0.9 m) the population was usually univoltine and semelparous. Growth and biomass were assessed as total organic C and total N to provide estimates of productivity and seasonal changes in C:N for each generation. Productivity (non-respired assimilation = growth + reproduction; N-R.A. = G + R) was 6939 mgC .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. yr-1 (3858 and 3353 mgC .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. yr-1 for each generation) and 1661 mgC .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. yr-1 for the permanent and temporary pond populations respectively. The average standing crop biomass (B) was 606.8 mgC .cntdot. m-2 (357.5 and 249.3 mgC .cntdot. m-2 for each generation) and 231.9 mgC .cntdot. m-2 with overall productivity:biomass ratios of 11.4 and 7.2 for the permanent pond and temporary pond populations, respectively. Respiration rates were converted to C equivalents (respired assimilation = R.A.) and used to evaluate the components of total assimilation (T.A. = R.A. + N-R.A.) and the efficiency of partitioning this energy to N-R.A. for G and R. When expressed as a percentage, the production efficiencies (100 .times. N-R.A.:T.A.) were 50.4 and 62%, and the reproductive efficiencies (100 .times. R:N-R.A.) were 26.4 and 18% for the permanent and temporary pond populations respectively. The reproductive efficiencies for populations of these viviparous clams are greater than those for most oviparous mollusks. The comparative information on the energetics of these populations, does not completely fit any theoretical consideration of reproductive effort or life-history strategy. These data are discussed in relation to selection for population success in temporary ponds.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1985	126	1					35	48		10.1007/BF00008385	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008385													WOS:A1985ANT3800006

The results were related to measured environmental variables. Samples for the seasonal study were taken every 4 weeks and fixed immediately upon removal from the lake and samples for the diel study were fixed ''in situ'' at depth. There was little difference in general ultrastructure of cells during the diel study or during the period of rapid growth but greter changes were apparent following encystment and prior to encystment. Most changes were observed within the chloroplasts, pyrenoids and storage products. Changes in chloroplast structure were shown to be related to the light conditions being experienced by the cells. Starch and lipid occurred in varying proportions depending on the stage of the life cycle. Starch and associated pyrenoid clusters varied with irradiance level over the 24-h period.																			0142-7873	1464-3774					1985	7	2					263	278		10.1093/plankt/7.2.263	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/7.2.263													WOS:A1985AFD3900009
J	LANG, C				LANG, C			THE OLIGOCHAETE COMMUNITIES OF THE SUBLITTORAL AS INDICATORS OF LAKE GENEVA EUTROPHICATION	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Tubificid and lumbriculid worm communities of the sublittoral area (40 m deep) of Lake Geneva (Switzerland) were used as indicators of the eutrophication level in 1977 and 1982. To do this, worm species were classified into 3 groupings corresponding to their increasing resistance to eutrophication: oligotrophic species, mainly Stylodrilus heringianus and Peloscolex velutinus; mesotrophic species, mainly Potamothrix vejdovskyi; eutrophic species, mainly P. hammoniensis and P. heuscheri. Inputs of organic C by rivers and primary production in the lake were higher before the 1982 survey than before the 1977 survey. Accordingly, numbers of individuals per m2 of mesotrophic and eutrophic worm species were higher in 1982. In 1982 contrary to 1977, the percentage of mesotrophic species in the community became higher than that of eutrophic species. This latter change reflected perhaps a seasonal effect. In both surveys, oligotrophic species were scarce and their abundance was the same. In 1982, total worm density and biomass decreased from the eastern to the western part of the lake; on the contrary, the relative density of oligotrophic species increased. The gradient of organic inputs created by the Rhone River explained these differences. The effects of the sampling gear and of the season on the validity of the 1977-1982 comparison were assessed.																			0003-9136						1985	103	3					325	340																WOS:A1985AGV2800004

RESPIRATION AND EXCRETION	MARINE BIOLOGY												The respiration and excretion (ammonia and phosphate) of Eurytemora velox, a brackish copepod from temporary lakes of the south of France, we studied in 1978-1979 in relation to food ingestion, temperature and salinity. Suspensions of Tetraselmis maculata were used as food. Respiration was closely dependent on the quantity of the ingested food, displaying a linear relationship with a strong positive-slope coefficient. In most cases, the temperature effect on respiration and excretion was well described by a power-type equation (M = a bT, where M = metabolism and T = temperature) over a rather large temperature range. In some experiments, metabolism curves displayed a maximum at 20.degree. C. The metabolism-temperature curves differed between successive experiments, depending on season and/or sampling area, perhaps as a result of different acclimatization processes developing in individuals from different generations and/or among geographically isolated populations. Salinity variations significantly affected respiration, but not excretion. Respiration increased in individuals placed in hypo- or hyper-salinity conditions for a period of 24 h. This inability for complete metabolic regulation is unexpected in a species from a habitat subjected to variable salinity, and may have resulted from a too short acclimatization time in the experiments.																			0025-3162	1432-1793					1986	93	1					127	136		10.1007/BF00428661	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00428661													WOS:A1986E683200014

Results of greenhouse and field studies indicated that the fungus was responsible for the waterhyacinth decline. Infection was initiated on waterhyacinths in Lake Alice on the University of Florida campus during Sept. and Oct., 1974. A combination of conidia and mycelia was applied to the plants. When the inoculum level was increased by a 2nd similar spray application the disease spread rapidly. Browning of the waterhyacinths in the test pool was augmented in the later stages of the test by below-freezing temperatures.

They are the principal predators in the pelagic and benthic fish communities. Data are presented on distribution, growth, length-weight relationships, condition, reproduction and food in the Lates spp. After a post-larval pelagic phase, each Lates sp. spends 1 yr in littoral weeds. Thereafter, L. mariae adopts a benthic habitat moving into deep water, L. microlepis becomes exclusively pelagic and L. angustifrons occurs from the littoral to near the limit of the oxygenated zone. Cycles in breeding correspond with seasonal maxima in clupeid prey, and changes in growth rate within a year are probably related to physiological cycles rather than to variations in the physical environment. Salient morphological and ecological adaptations are discussed. Local abundance and vagility of Lates stocks seem related to basin morphometry and depth of the oxygenated layer. L. microlepis has the greatest vagility. The Lates appear highly susceptible to intensive fishing by purse-seines, and have been fished-up in the SE arm in Zambia and in the Burundi sector where only small populations remain. With reduced predation, clupeid biomass has increased. The change to dominance of small species may be accomplished rapidly in Lake Tanganyika under such conditions of exploitation. However, the type of species successions well known in large temperate lakes are unlikely to occur because of the high degree of specialization in these fishes. A simplified pelagic community is foreseen, consisting almost entirely of clupeids and Luciolates, in which the total fish biomass will be determined above some intensive level of fishing and from year to year by the environmental factors controlling survival of young and planktonic food supply. Quantitative equilibrium between the few species will be determined mainly by gear selectivity and total fishing stress, and the community may be sufficiently robust by reason of its rapid turn-over rates to permit a largely empirical approach to management.																			0022-1112	1095-8649					1976	9	3					235	+		10.1111/j.1095-8649.1976.tb04676.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1976.tb04676.x													WOS:A1976CC59800004

After harvesting with traps at maximum sustained yield (MSY) for 3 yr, fishing effort was increased 4-fold in 1 lake, West Lost, for 2 successive seasons, while in North Twin Lake it was not changed. In West Lost yields were stable during MSY; yields increased with overexploitation, but growth and recruitment declined. Distortions occurred in the age composition of the catch. In North Twin this pattern was repeated except that in 1975 the catch dropped drastically even though fishing effort had not been increased. Because of declining recruitment, North Twin was actually overfished by about 20% in 1974 and greatly overfished in 1975. Decreased recruitment in both lakes can be attributed to 2 factors: a decreased survival of hatchlings in both lakes due to a decline in nursery habitat; as a consequence the stock-recruitment relationship was altered; and an increase in the density of age I (subadult) females due to the selective fishery for males; as a result density-dependent mechanisms lowered that survival of females from age I-II, producing fewer spawning adults. However, the high density of these age II females at age I decreased the egg production/adult female. The changes in the productivity of the lakes for crayfish during the period of exploitation were related to loss of microhabitat for hatchlings. This change in productivity offset the benefits of MSY management and resulted in a drastic drop in stocks when deliberate overfishing took place. West Lost gave good yields prior to its certain collapse. Yields in weight were an unreliable indicator of the impact of the fishery.																									1977	34	11					2056	2066																WOS:A1977EB57200006

Absorption of photosynthetically active radiation was related primarily to concentration of non-chlorophyllous particulate material (tripton) with dissolved organic material (gilvin) and particulate chlorophyll being of lesser importance in influencing light climate. Lake waters were characterized by selective attenuation of red (650-700 nm wavelength) and blue (400-500 nm wavelength) quanta with depth. Though most photosynthetically active radiation in Lake Wellington was removed in the 1st 1 m of depth, phytoplankton biomass was higher than in Lake King which had more available light. Vertical mixing, resulting in periodic exposure of phytoplankton to surface light levels, is suggested as a mechanism whereby the relatively high phytoplankton biomass of Lake Wellington is maintained.																			0067-1940						1984	35	5					517	524																WOS:A1984TF44300003

Al content decreased in Ca-rich lakes near the coast, but also with increasing organic content of the lakes. Seasonal variation was pronounced in the most acidic lake. Al concentration seems virtually independent of pH, suggesting that it is in the form of organic complexes, at least in the 2 most colored lakes. Precipitation processes affecting fish metabolism in the acidic lakes with high Al content may have caused the frequent lack of success in liming lakes in this area. Humic acidic lakes with organic complexed Al still carry considerable fish biomass.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1982	94	3					217	221		10.1007/BF00016402	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00016402													WOS:A1982PM78900003
J	LEWIS, DSC				LEWIS, DSC			PRELIMINARY COMPARISONS BETWEEN THE ECOLOGY OF THE HAPLOCHROMINE CICHLID FISHES OF LAKE VICTORIA AND LAKE MALAWI	NETHERLANDS JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Comparisons were made between data collected by HEST in the Mwanza Gulf of Lake Victoria and that accumulated from Lake Malawi by the Fisheries Research Unit of the Malawi Fisheries Department. Although the sampling programs differ, the data available are sufficient to show many similarities between the ecology of the 2 spp. In each lake, distribution and abundance of species were strongly influenced by both depth and bottom type, though the degree of association with the substrate varies between species. Well marked and comparable trophic groups were present in both lakes though in Lake Malawi even species with highly specialized trophic mechanisms were facultative feeders. This has not been demonstrated in Lake Victoria. A gradation from discrete breeding seasonality to continuous breeding appears to be a feature of the haplochromines of both lakes. Seasonality may be related to food supply or other factors such as weather conditions. The most notable difference between the 2 spp. was many species from Lake Malawi have restricted distributions wtihin the lake; there is, as yet, no evidence for this in Lake Victoria.																			0028-2960						1981	31	4					746	761																WOS:A1981MX86200006

Fecundities estimated for 65 fish taken in Oct. ranged from 3230 eggs in 1 medium-size bloater (241 mm long) to 18,768 in the longest (305 mm). Estimates on lengths and weights of the parental fish were regressed to provide a quantitative basis for evaluating long-term changes in reproductive potential. The resulting rectilinear regression on weight accounted for 75% of the total variation in fecundity.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1978	107	6					785	789		10.1577/1548-8659(1978)107<785:FOTBCH>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1978)107<785:FOTBCH>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1978GF96200004
J	MCPHERSON, JG				MCPHERSON, JG			STRATIGRAPHY AND SEDIMENTOLOGY OF THE UPPER DEVONIAN AZTEC SILTSTONE, SOUTHERN VICTORIA LAND, ANTARCTICA	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS												The Aztec Siltstone is a redbed sequence deposited on a broad, low-lying alluvial plain during Late Devonian times in southern Victoria Land, Antarctica. It outcrops between the Mawson and Mulock Glaciers and is the uppermost formation of the Taylor Group, the lower of the 2 Beacon Supergroup subdivisions in southern Victoria Land. The formation consists largely of fine- to medium-grained, well sorted quartzarenite, greyish red (10R 4/2), grey (N5) and greenish grey (5G 6/1) siltstone and claystone. Minor lithologies include carbonaceous siltstone, limestone and intraformational conglomerate. Conchostracans, fish fossils, plant fragments and gypsum lenses were also present. Fining-upwards cycles with the characteristic channelling, intraformational conglomerate, crossstratification and horizontal stratification were common in the formation and indicate deposition from shallow, high sinuosity (tortuous), meandering streams that migrated laterally across a broad alluvial plain. Laterally accreted channel and vertically accreted overbank sediments were represented by sandstone and the finer-grained lithologies, respectively. Levee and crevasse-splay deposits were also represented. Other floodbasin deposits include lacustrine sediments from pluvial ponds and ox-bow lakes and palustrinal sediments from the backswamps. Prolonged subaerial exposure of the overbank sediments promoted soil development in some, characterized by a compositional and textural similarity to modern soils, calcrete (caliche), vein networks, burrowing and root horizons. Reddening of the deposits also took place during subaerial exposure, influenced by soil processes and a hot and seasonally wet and dry (savanna) climate. The hiatus represented by soil development and reddening was probably in the range 4000-10,000 yr.																			0028-8306	1175-8791					1978	21	6					667	683		10.1080/00288306.1978.10425198	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288306.1978.10425198													WOS:A1978GS74800001

Accumulation of metals in plants varied from species to species, and was affected by the metal concentration in the sediment and marshwater in a complex way. Variations in metal uptake by the same species growing in different plant communities were noticed. M. heterophyllum and algae Chara sp. accumulated larger amounts of metals (except for Zn) than the other plants. Metal concentrations in roots of T. latifolia, L. salicaria and P. cordata were higher than those in the aboveground biomass.																			0003-9136						1978	84	1					87	108																WOS:A1978FW85600006

Total protein content was high (26-57 mg/ml), acid phosphatase ranged between 1.9 and 6.3 mM/h/mg protein and lactic dehydrogenase levels were undetectable. Total lipid content in the secretion averaged 80 mg% and ranged from 75-87 mg%. Triglycerides were just detectable, varying from 2-8 mg% and phospholipids ranged from 9-11 mg% (average 10 mg%). Cholesterol content was high, measuring 12, 19, 26, 36 and 70 mg% for 5 samples of secretion. Field observations indicated that stress triggered liberation of temporal gland secretion. Among 116 elephants collected in Uganda, secretory activity of their temporal glands was more frequent during dry (probably more stressful) than during wet seasons. Among 62 elephants driven by helicopter to roadways for collection in Kruger National Park, 23 driven relatively far and fast were in prominent musth; most of those driven slower and shorter distances showed no evidence of musth. The matriarchal leader of an elephant family near Lake Albert, Uganda developed very prominent temporal gland activity after 1 h and 45 min of vigorously defending 3 of her family members. Chemical individuality of cholesterol levels in temporal glands of 5 adult bulls suggested a pheromone-producing function which served for individual recognition by the African elephant. Direct observations of wild elephants suggested that the temporal gland functions as a scent gland helping to recognize other members of the group or to find them.																			0025-1461	1864-1547					1976	40	3					437	451		10.1515/mamm.1976.40.3.437	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/mamm.1976.40.3.437													WOS:A1976CX87700007

We describe here characteristics of the frequent flight activity of murrelets observed at Coates Lake, 6 km from the west coast of the Queen Charlotte Islands, British Columbia. Most flights between the lake and the ocean occurred within 30 minutes of sunrise and sunset. Bidirectional flights occurred during both periods. Morning flights were often circular over the lake and included frequent vocalizations while evening flights trended to be unidirectional and silent. We observed repeated use of characteristic flight paths through the old growth forest around the lake during particular time periods (+/- 5 minutes) on successive nights. Some of these flight paths terminated at particular trees; we observed single birds or pairs of murrelets in trees on fifteen occasions. One of these is interpreted as a mating event while others appear to represent feeding flights from the ocean to presumed prefledglings in the trees. Since nesting sites of this species are largely unknown, our observations suggest that the high fidelity of flight paths can be exploited to locate potential nesting trees.																			0008-3550					JUL-AUG	1990	104	3					439	444																WOS:A1990FA22500014

This was the only known source of the arsenic. Levels of total arsenic in the sediments and waters were determined quarterly over the course of one year. Sediments were extracted for water soluble and total extractable arsenic fractions and partitioned into four species: monomethylarsonic acid (MMAA), dimethylarsinic acid (DMAA), arsenite [As(III)], and arsenate [As(V)]. In Union Lake at a shallow sandy sediment site, As (V) predominates. In organic sediments, As (III) or (V) predominate depending upon the dissolved oxygen content of the overlying waters. The oxidation state of the arsenic was affected also by the seasonal lake cycles of stratifying or mixing.																			1093-4529	1532-4117					1987	22	3					209	237		10.1080/10934528709375345	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934528709375345													WOS:A1987H969900001

No clear seasonality was observed in either the prevalence and intensity of infection or in the level of maturation and the length of P. umblae in both fish species, with points to a continuous invasion and maturation of these trematodes. The prevalence and intensity of P. umblae infection was highest in the middle-sized whitefish. Similar results were obtained when the mean number of worms per fish and the level of overdispersion (S2/.hivin.x) are plotted against the length of the fish. With regard to vendace the prevalence and intensity of infection per infected fish and per fish studied increased as the fish length increased: only the variance-to-mean ratio remained constantly low. Overdispersion indices (S2/.hivin.x) revealed that in the whitefish P. umblae is more overdispersed than in vendace when studied using data from seasonal periods with size-groups as homogeneously infected as possible. The negative binomial distribution gave a good fit in the case of vendace and with one exception also for whitefish, and the values of parameter k are well within the limits and most often found in parasitological studies.																			0015-5683	1803-6465					1987	34	2					145	155											3596393					WOS:A1987H296900008

The phytoplankton analysis was conducted using the Utermohl technique. The mean percent biomass at each station indicated Diatomeae (59-77%) and phytoflagellates such as Chrysophyceae (4-21%) and Cryptophyceae (7-19%) as the dominant contributors. Seasonal variations of biomass ranged from 0.2 to 0.35 g .cntdot. m-3 with a single peak during stratified conditions. Diatomeae dominated throughout the period of investigation followed by Chrysophyceae and Cryptophyceae. Biomass composition by size revealed the dominance of ultraplankton (5-20 .mu.m) which contributed 29-68% to the total biomass Species such as Fragilaria crotonensis, Tabellaria fenestrata, Synedra acus var. radians, Cyclotella comta and Cyclotella bodanica made substantial contributions during the unstratified and stratified conditions. Ultraplankton contributed overwhelmingly to the primary productivity as measured by carbon-14 uptake. The contaminant bioassays with single metals, metals in combination and a mixture of metals demonstrated that the ultraplankton''s carbonassimilation was inhibited significantly, revealing their sensitivity to contaminants. Phytoplankton ecology of the Channel appears to be affected by tributary inflows, industrial/municipal inputs, and short flushing rates. However, statistical treatment of the ultraplankton biomass showed correlations with temperature and nutrients. Based on phycological and limnological characteristics, the Channel appears to be oligotrophic. The chlorophyII/biomass ratios and Activity Coefficient (P/B) align it with the most oligotrophic Lake Superior in its metabolic efficiency.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN 20	1988	163						119	134		10.1007/BF00026924	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00026924													WOS:A1988P512800010

The transparency was then recorded to a minimum value of 6 m from values of 15-17 m in the beginning of this century. The P loading had increased from 50-200 tonnes from 1940-1967. The phytoplankton biomass was recorded to 0.3 mm3 l-1 in 1967 as a growth season mean value. In these circumstances a purification program was agreed upon which included biological-chemical treatment of sewage water in the whole drainage area. These measures were completed in 1974. In 1971 the phytoplankton biomass had decreased and the phytoplankton community of eutrophic species were successively replaced by oligotrophic species.

J	SCHOENBERG, SA				SCHOENBERG, SA			SHORT-TERM PRODUCTIVITY RESPONSES OF ALGAE AND BACTERIA TO ZOOPLANKTON GRAZING IN 2 FRESH-WATER LAKES	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												The specific productivities of algae and bacteria were measured in short-term (4 day) experiments consisting of enclosures with natural or reduced zooplankton biomass. Experiments were repeated five times over a season in each of two lakes that differed in the background concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Algal biomass as estimated by chlorophyll .alpha. was suppressed in enclosures with ambient grazer levels in six of ten experiments and enhanced in one experiment. Distribution of chlorophyll among net and nanoplankton was not significantly affected by grazing. Relative to enclosures with reduced zooplankton, normal grazer biomass (97-466 .mu.g l-1 dry weight) enhanced specific algal productivity in only one of five experiments in the low DOC lake and had no effect in all five experiments in the high DOC lake. The main effects of grazers on algae was through removal of biomass rather than through indirect changes in turnover rate. Between experiments, bacterial density was either unaffected, or mildly enhanced (4-87%) in enclosures with ambient macrozooplankton compared to those with reduced levels. Bacterial productivity and turnover estimated by incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA showed different responses across experiments; increasing, declining or remaining the same with grazer minipulation. This variability was not related to differences in dissolved primary production or to background DOC between lakes or experiments. Comparison of bacterial productivities based on thymidine incorporation rates with changes in cell densities indicated that control of bacterial loss processes by macrozooplankton is more important than control of growth rates.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				JUN	1990	23	3					395	410		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1990.tb00283.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1990.tb00283.x													WOS:A1990DK24300001

Global warming threatens to become catastrophic and is thus an urgent scientific and social problem. The last century of the past millennium was marked by an exceptional growth of global air temperature which became 0.6 degrees C higher than at the end of the Little Ice Age (1550-1850). Wan-ning was especially rapid after the 1960s, with a linear trend of 0.20 degrees C per decade (global) and 0.29 degrees C per decade in the Northern Hemisphere (Grusa et al., 2001). The past decade was the warmest over the millennium, and 1998 was the globally warmest year. Arctic ice sheets in warm season have reduced in surface area for 10-15% and have become 40% thinner for the past 50 yr. Mountain glaciers in Asia have been reducing and permafrost has been degrading. Scientists are not unanimous about the prospects, some believing that warming-related global change can speed up and cause regional- and global-scale socioeconomic ill effects, and others considering the problem ambiguous and poorly understood; the latter opinion is that prediction has even increased in uncertainty lately instead of being resolved (Boehmer-Christiansen, 2000). Prediction for global change and its short-term consequences is difficult because the changes are driven by sophisticated interplay of numerous climate controls and feedback mechanisms, while the available field and modeling data remain insufficient. The relative contributions of natural and cultural effects to the ongoing warming have not been so far constrained unambiguously.

Land subsidence evolution and controlling mechanisms near Mexico City: environmental planning and management	GEO-ENVIRONMENT AND LANDSCAPE EVOLUTION II: EVOLUTION, MONITORING, SIMULATION, MANAGEMENT AND REMEDIATION OF THE GEOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT AND LANDSCAPE	WIT Transactions on Ecology and the Environment				2nd International Conference on Evolution, Monitoring, Simulation, Management and Remediation of the Geological Environment and Landscape	JUN 06-08, 2006	Rhodes, GREECE	Wessex Inst Technol, Complutense Univ, Municipal Rhodes, Technol Educ Inst Kavala, WIT Transact Ecol & Environm				Mexico City is situated in the Basin of Mexico on a highly compressible lacustrine aquitard that overly highly productive aquifers of both volcanic and sedimentary origin. This aquitard contributes with regional recharge through leakage to the underlying alluvial-pyroclastic regional aquifer, from which about 50m(3)/sec are pumped to supply water for the Metropolitan Area of Mexico City, to nearly 25 million inhabitants. The extensive lacustrine Chalco Plain in the southeastern part of Mexico City is underlined by an aquitard up to 300 m thick. This area was a shallow lake until the 1940s when it was drained for agricultural use and human habitation. In the middle 1980s, when major groundwater extraction began with the onset of the Santa Catarina Well Field in the middle of the Chalco Plain, subsidence of 2 m occurred between 1984 and 1989, causing a shallow lake to form and gradually expand. Land subsidence in the central part of the Chalco Basin has increased to 0.4 m/yr since 1984 and by 1991 total subsidence had reached more than 10 In at present. The rapid land subsidence in this area is causing the accumulation of meteoric waters during the rainy season resulting in extensive flooding of farmland and potentially urban areas. Three different stages of lake growth were identified: (i) ponding (1984-1989), (ii) lake formation (1990-1993), and (iii) bifurcation (1994-present). In this last stage, the local presence of a basalt layer in the middle of the Santa Catarina Well Field is causing differential consolidation and forming a local topographic elevation that permits the development of two separated lakes. Since the middle of the 1990s, the new lake conditions are permitting the,growth of few aquatic native plants and arrival of different species of migratory birds: therefore, environmental planning and management for the southernmost end of the Basin of Mexico is proposed through the development of a series of connected artificial lakes to control urban growth, to improve environmental conditions of the MAMC, to develop ancient agricultural production systems such as the floating gardens or "Chinampas" and recreational facilities with proportional benefits to the social and economical sectors.																			1743-3541		1-84564-168-X				2006	89						205	214																WOS:000238905000021

Temperature seems to be the primary factor influencing copepod body length in the Keban Dam Lake, but the various species differ markedly in their response. Calanoid copepods (Arctodiaptomus osmanus and Acanthodiaptomus denticomis) showed a more definite trend of size variation with temperature than the cyclopoid copepod, Cyclops vicinus. Differences in metabolic rate, longevity, and specialization of calanoid and cyclopoid copepods could explain their different responses to temperature.

Using Taihu Lake, China as a case study and multi-temporal MODIS images as data resources, this paper focuses on developing and applying MODIS algorithms to detect the changes of Suspended Sediment concentration in Taihu Lake. Field survey data and MODIS images are acquired in different seasons. Using linear regression and nonlinear regression, send-empirical models for these seasons are developed respectively by relating field data to different MODIS hand combinations. And then, the changes of SS concentration in different seasons are determined and evaluated by applying these models to corresponding MODIS images. The study result shows that multi-temporal MODIS image data is suitable to monitor such change.

From values of sex ratio, spermatophore and egg production, fecundity, and reproductive rates, 2 well-differentiated periods were established in the breeding season of the population: a 1st period of maximum reproductive activity, at the beginning of the breeding season (before freezing of the lake), characterized by more males than females, a high rate of production of spermatophores and, generally, a low production of eggs and a low reproductive rate; and a later period, following the thaw of the lake, and in which the population is composed mainly of nauplii and copepodids. Females dominate over males. Reproductive activity measured by the ratios of spermatophores per female is very limited. Conversely, a high production of eggs and a high reproductive rate (most females are ovigerous) are observed. Mechanisms which determine both periods and their possible adaptive value are discussed.

J	Nichols, SA				Nichols, SA			Seasonal and sampling variability in some Wisconsin lake plant communities	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												One of the first steps in assessing long-term changes in aquatic plant communities is to establish how much variability is inherent in sampling the same community on two or more occasions and how much variability is caused by sampling at different times during the same growing season. To better define seasonal and sampling variability, this study examined the maximum depth of plant growth, the proportion of open area in the littoral zone, species number, and diversity from early and late sampling dates during the same growing season for 46 Wisconsin lakes. Floral similarity and community similarity were also examined. Criteria based on the 75% quartile and the lower confidence limit suggest that changes greater than 0.8 m in maximum depth of growth, 13% in proportion of open area, 4 for species number, and 0.04 for diversity are more than expected from seasonal and sampling variability, Floral and community similarities less than 0.70 are also mole than expected. These criteria were used to assess changes in a limited number of lakes where plant sampling was done at a three-year interval.																			0270-5060					JUN	1997	12	2					173	182		10.1080/02705060.1997.9663524	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1997.9663524													WOS:A1997WZ07300001

We monthly collected water samples of both water bodies from July 2003 to June 2004. The baiting method was used to gain an insight into the specific seasonal occurrence of aquatic Oomycetes. Some species show a seasonal periodicity. Nine of 11 species of Saprolegniales isolated from the two water bodies, and Leptomitus lacteus (Roth) C. Agardh, one of the two species of Leptomitales, were already documented on fish according to references. Additionally, 7 of 10 species could according to references already be detected on fish species present in the two water bodies. Simultaneous measurements of limnological-chemical parameters were done during the sampling of water for the isolation of aquatic Oomycetes. The results of some measurements, concerning the river Fulda, were additionally compared with the predetermined guideline values and limit values of water bodies of fish of the "Cyprinid region".

Although point sources are discharged after secondary treatment, there has been a steady deterioration of lake water quality. Removal of point sources alone may produce no measurable improvement in the lake condition because of nonpoint sources. So the objectives of this paper are to quantify the nonpoint sources and to assess the impact to the lake. Nutrient inputs from point sources are unlikely to have been altered significantly, but nonpoint nutrient inputs have great monthly variation. Contribution of nonpoint sources to the external input of total phosphorus is almost 67% in the wet season and 19% in the dry season. Assuming that a substantial nonpoint source reduction is made by the Hoedong Lake basin, we attempt to estimate the effect of the lake water quality by mass balance equation. The nonpoint source impact to Hoedong Lake water quality is more than 60% in the wet season.																			0273-1223						1993	28	3-5					137	142		10.2166/wst.1993.0412	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.1993.0412													WOS:A1993MA14800016

This report describes the breeding migration and characteristics of spawners from the Carp River, an eastern Lake Superior tributary 70 km north of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. Movement into the stream began at dusk each evening in 1983, seemingly in response to decreasing light levels. Nightly catch numbers varied through the 1983, 1984, and 1985 runs with date, river discharge, wind-generated turbulence, and water temperatures, although the influence of these factors differed wtih sex and season. Spawners varied in size through the runs each year but not in the same fashion. Spawner size and condition varied yearly in apparent response to prey abundance. Gonad maturation was complete on stream entry more often in males than in females, though this difference was less pronounced further upstream or after time spent in the river. Degree of secondary sexual character development, complete on stream entry in both sexes, differed in even- and odd-year spawners in relation to condition. The recovery rates of spawned-out males and females did not differ. Tagged fish wandered from the Carp River at a rate of at least 7%, many to spawn in adjacent streams. Despite between-year differences in some parameters, much of the breeding ecology of these fish remains comparable to that of anadromous pink salmon.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				APR	1990	68	4					684	693		10.1139/z90-100	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z90-100													WOS:A1990DF40400009

The stream stock consisted largely of the 1983 and 1982 year classes, with fish reaching mean lengths of 7.0 and 11.6 cm at one and two years of age. The size and biomass of the stream stock at the beginning of 1983 and 1984 were estimated to be 120 and 125 (1.20 and 1.25 fish m-2) and 1.41 and 0.69 kg (14.1 g m-2 and 6.9 g m-2) respectively. Annual stream production ranged from an estimated minimum of 2.49 kg (24.9 g m-2) to an estimated maximum of 4.59 kg (45.9 g m-2). Both downstream and upstream movements of 0+ juveniles were recorded. The adult spawning stock was estimated at 79 males and 32 females, a sex ratio of 2.5:1, with most spawners belonging to the 1980 yearclass. The average size of the lake stock over the year was estimated to be 1650 (229 fish ha-1) or 250.8 kg (34.8 kg ha-1). The 1980 yearclass was predominant; there were few fish older than five years. Seasonal variations in netting catches suggested movements to and from the littoral region. Growth in the lake was moderately fast, with fish reaching mean lengths of 21.7 and 27.2 cm by three and four years of age. Fish entering the lake after one year appeared to grow faster than fish which remained in the stream for two years. Annual production in the lake was estimated at 136.7 kg (19.0 kg ha-1). The total angling catch for the season was estimated to be 62.6 kg (8.7 kg ha-1).																			0378-1909	1573-5133				AUG 30	1986	16	4					279	293		10.1007/BF00842983	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00842983													WOS:A1986D965100008

Prairie ponds and lakes, primarily of glacial origin, comprised 75 and 68%, respectively, of the total area and number of wetlands in South Dakota. Stock ponds comprised 14% of the area and 21% of wetlands, and dugouts 1% and 12% of the wetland area and numbers, respectively. Semipermanent wetlands and stock ponds contained proportionally more pairs of most species than other wetland categories. Densities of blue-winged teal (Anas discors), pintails (A. acuta), northern shovelers (A. clypeata), and green-winged teal (A. crecca) declined sharply on semipermanent wetlands and stock ponds during the 1974 drought.

Sediments were contaminated by gold mining wastes, deposited in the lake between 1941-1949. Concentrations of total Hg, Cu, Pb and Zn were high near the mine, averaging 440 .mu.g/kg and 85, 30 and 115 mg/kg, respectively; they decreased rapidly beyond this distance and were near background levels 2.1-3.0 km from the mine. Algal communities in zone of heaviest contamination consisted of 63 species, the most common of which were Anomoeoneis vitrea, Pinnularia brebissonii and Cymbella spp. There were more taxa (111-132) at stations situated 1.1-3.0 km from the mine and the main species included several forms of Achnanthes, Fragilaria and Navicula. Epipelic densities in the zone of heaviest contamination were only about 50% of those recorded at other stations; seasonal growth patterns of the flora were generally similar throughout the lake. Mine wastes may have a long-term impact on epipelic algae in northern environments. Effects of heavy metal pollution on epipelon in subarctic lakes were similar to those in temperate zone systems. No species or group of species could be designated as indicators of heavy metal contamination.																			0043-1354	1879-2448					1981	15	1					97	105		10.1016/0043-1354(81)90189-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(81)90189-5													WOS:A1981KY04900016

Salamanders were benthic and ate Gammarus almost exclusively. Trout were mainly limnetic and in May-June consumed mainly Chaoborus larvae and Gammarus, switching almost entirely to Gammarus in July and Aug. The considerable overlap in diet and only partial segregation in time (season) and space indicate a potential for competition for food. This is probably minimized by differences in mouth size and the plasticity of feeding by trout.																			0008-3550						1981	95	2					129	132																WOS:A1981LP68900001

The variation among lakes reflects watershed character and watershed interaction with atmospheric deposition. Acid lakes had the highest concentrations of sulfate (5-10 mg/l). Principal components analysis separated lakes based on degree of acidification, nitrogen level: water color, and sulfate concentration. For example, nitrogen levels were higher in neutral lakes than in acid lakes, and sulfate concentrations were negatively related to water color. In contrast, phosphorus levels were comparable among lakes suggesting low retention in watersheds. Mineralized iron was dominant in acid lakes and provided a sink for phosphorus, whereas iron was mostly complexed with organics in neutral lakes. Acid-clear lakes displayed little annual and seasonal fluctuation in water chemistry and that was primarily defined by precipitation; whereas neutral lakes showed much annual and seasonal variability in chemistry due to a greater watershed influence on atmospheric deposition. Results suggest that the influence of atmospheric deposition on lake water chemistry is directly related to the degree of coupling between a lake and its watershed.

Growth rates were determined by analysis of length frequency data from trawl catches. The breeding season for each species was determined by monthly examination of the gonads, and fecundity determined by egg counts from ripe ovaries. Lengths at maturity were calculated from the proportion of mature fish during breeding seasons. Natural mortality rates were determined from length frequency data from an unfished area of the lake. Values of the growth constant K ranged from 0.487-0.671. The ratio of length at maturity to asymptotic length varied from 0.56-0.82. Growth parameters are compared with those of other cichlids. Most species mature in their 3rd yr. Fecundity was proportional to the square of the length in 4 of the 5 spp. The species studied appeared to produce only 1 batch of eggs per breeding season. Instantaneous natural mortality rates ranged from 0.92-1.69.																			0022-1112	1095-8649					1977	10	4					385	398		10.1111/j.1095-8649.1977.tb04070.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1977.tb04070.x													WOS:A1977DC97100007

After a period of dormancy induction followed by a period of dormancy at low temperatures, all seedlings were grown a 2nd season in a uniform greenhouse environment. Three bud types were recognized based on 1st-season bud dissections and confirmed by 2nd-season shoot analyses. Type 1 buds consisted of a proximal zone of stem units bearing primary needles and a distal zone of stem units bearing scales. Type 2 buds, with a basal whorl of long-shoot primordia, were typical of 2-yr-old buds. Type 3 buds were polycyclic. They were essentially a type 2 bud superimposed on a type 1 bud. Short-shoot activity was more prevalent in type 2 and 3 buds than on type 1 buds the 1st season suggesting that bud morphology may be established early during seedling development. Type 1 buds were unaffected by temperature, but the frequency of type 2 buds decreased and that of type 3 buds increased in the high compared with the low temperature environment. The frequency of type 1 and 2 buds differed among provenances; type 2 buds increased slightly from north to south within the study range. Significant differences in bud types were also found among the families examined.

Two periods of mortality were revealed. The first occurred in all lakes during the first 60 days of residence in the lakes and resulted in the mortality of 60-90% of the numbers of fish stocked. The 2nd period occurred in about 20% of the lakes and was due to low O2 levels following the collapse of a bloom of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae. Rainbow trout are close to their physiological upper tolerance levels in these lakes. Possible environmental and biological causes of mortality during the 1st period are discussed.																									1976	33	4					647	655		10.1139/f76-080	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f76-080													WOS:A1976BL39800001

Seasonal fluctuations of populations appeared to be correlated with lake levels, not with local rainfall. Results of biting, resting and nectar-feeding catches at various points across the forest floor indicated that diel activity patterns of man-biting were related primarily to the proximity of resting female A. implexus and only secondarily to the influence of environmental variables. Latent effects of moon phase on day-time man-biting activity patterns support this view. Blood-meal identifications showed that the great majority of blood-fed females resting in forest had fed on cattle, indicating that they left the forest at night. This was confirmed by direct catching from cattle outside forest, while the virtual absence of A. implexus resting near these bait animals, together with the fact that man is very seldom attacked away from forest, indicated that different kinds of host selection strategy were involved. The diel activity pattern of biting on cattle taken into forest was then found to be very different from that on man. Age-grading studies helped to substantiate these differences. Hourly sampling of A. implexus arriving at representative resting sites in forest indicated an exodus of most of the adult mosquito population from forest at dusk and a return shortly after sunrise. The 2 basic host selection strategies evidently involved active or (in effect) hunting flight, mainly outside forest with a tendency to restrict choice to most strongly attractive hosts, and passive or opportunistic attack from rest, in which some of the unfed females sheltering may be activated by the proximity of a host which need not be strongly attractive. The latter situation was investigated further through analysis of short-term day-time patterns of attack on man in forest which are postulated to be a function of mosquito response delay (involving both resident and incoming elements of the sheltering population), which in turn determines depletion rates (involving only the resident element available at the time of the host''s arrival). In A. implexus the response delay appears to vary according to time of day. Anomalous results are finally re-considered and it is concluded that the different patterns of active and passive host selection could arise from a single circadian rhythm of responsiveness, with flight characteristics and day-time inhibition modulating responses to specific and non-specific host stimuli in different ways.																			0007-4853	1475-2670					1976	66	4					587	+		10.1017/S0007485300010695	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007485300010695													WOS:A1976CU03000005

J	Stallsmith, BW; Ebersole, JP; Hagar, WG				Stallsmith, BW; Ebersole, JP; Hagar, WG			The effects of acid episodes on Lepomis sunfish recruitment and growth in two ponds in Massachusetts, USA	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The effects of transient acidity on the recruitment of Lepomis sunfish were examined in two ponds in Plymouth County, Massachusetts with on-site monitoring systems. One pond had low buffering capacity and was sensitive to acidification and acid spikes, the other had better buffering with no acid spikes. Pond pH was continuously monitored over 3 years. 2. Young-of-the-year (YOY) sunfish were collected and through otolith analysis aged in days since larval metamorphosis. Day-classes were constructed from these age data. The YOY swim-up day-class distribution was more irregular with pronounced gaps in Maquan Pond than in the better-buffered Furnace Pond. 3. The poorly buffered pond, Maquan, experienced irregular acid spikes, defined as a sudden lowering of pond pH from about 6.6 to below 5.3 for an hour or more. These spikes were associated with rainfall (P < 0.005). Acid spikes were not found at Furnace Pond. 4. The occurrence of acid spikes and diminished day-classes from expected swim-up values were significantly associated, based on pooled data from 3 years at Maquan Pond. 5. Transient acid spikes at Maquan Pond appear to harm Lepomis YOY at the vulnerable stage of metamorphosis, when their gills become fully functional and exposed to the environment. 6. Growth rates of Lepomis YOY were also studied. Length-age and weight-length growth relationships were examined for differences in instantaneous growth coefficients between years and between ponds. Length-age instantaneous growth coefficients ranged from 0.0114 to 0.0176 over five pond-years. The slowest growth rates were in a warm, dry spawning season with the earliest average metamorphosis date.																			0046-5070					DEC	1996	36	3					731	744		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1996.00124.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1996.00124.x													WOS:A1996WA16200022
J	EPP, RW; LEWIS, WM				EPP, RW; LEWIS, WM			METABOLIC RESPONSES TO TEMPERATURE-CHANGE IN A TROPICAL FRESHWATER COPEPOD (MESOCYCLOPS-BRASILIANUS) AND THEIR ADAPTIVE SIGNIFICANCE	OECOLOGIA												Metabolic rates of M. brasilianus from Lake Valencia, Venezuela, were determined at several temperatures spanning the environmental range (22-28.degree. C). The QO2''s (O2 consumption/unit weight) of all Mesocyclops stages from Lake Valencia are higher than most but not all QO2''s from temperate copepod species that have been studied. The QO2 is essentially static through naupliar development and shows a sudden jump between N[nauplii]6 and C[copepodite]I, which probably results from the major change in morphology and behavior at this point in the life history. QO2 declines steadily between CI and adult stages. Acclimated copepodite and adult Mesocyclops show a decreasing metabolic rate with increasing temperature (i.e. Q10 < 1.0) over the temperature range 26-28.degree. C. This is the range of temperatures normally encountered during the daily vertical migration when the lake is thermally stratified (April-Nov.). Since vertical migration would result in a compromise between a fully acclimated and an acute response, a nearly constant metabolic rate or a slight decline in metabolic rate in the warmer water would be expected in field populations. The metabolic rate of Mesocyclops is not reduced when it moves into deeper (cooler) water, as would be predicted by certain energy-based hypotheses that have been used to explain vertical migration. In contrast to the low Q10.apprx. between 26-28.degree. C, copepodites and adults have very high Q10 values in the range 22-26.degree. C. This indicates an adaptive decrease in metabolic rate which is thermally programmed to coincide with the cooler temperatures that are encountered during the mixing season (Dec.-March), when a drastic change in ecological conditions occurs in the lake. Nauplii show evidence of the same seasonal response but without the superimposed plateau at high temperatures, which they would not need because they are weak migrators. Nauplii show a plateau at the lowest temperatures suggesting a fixed metabolic reduction at the onset of mixing and metabolism not altered with declining temperature. The change in QO2 with temperature generally supports the hypothesis that all Mesocyclops stages are adapted to hold a high, constant metabolic rate through the diel cycle but experience a seasonal reduction in metabolic rate in response to major ecological changes in the lake at the time of seasonal mixing.

These differences in the food niche are likely to contribute to the co-existence of the 2 spp. in this habitat. Seasonal changes in the relative abundance of diatom genera in the habitat greatly influenced the gut contents of N. pseudobtusa; however, these changes had less influence on those of C. diastrophus. This and the highly selective nature of the gut contents of C. diastrophus suggests that the 2 spp. have different feeding strategies. C. diastrophus actively seeks out certain diatom genera in preference to other food items, while the unselective gut contents of N. pseudobtusa are more typical of an opportunist feeder.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1979	9	3					199	204		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1979.tb01503.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1979.tb01503.x													WOS:A1979GW23800003

Elodea and Lagarosiphon were sampled again in March 1973, July 1974 and Aug. 1974, to provide data on variability within a single stand and change in element content during different seasons and different stages of growth. Surface water, plankton and sediment samples were also collected at each sampling site in Nov. 1972 and were analyzed for the same range of elements.

Families of this species were observed in Lake Xiloa'', Nicaragua, during part of the breeding season. Young fry (less than 5 days free swimming) could be induced to follow a variety of "dummy" parents when their own parents were restrained at a distance. Older fry fled the dummies in the same manner as they fled predators. Two laboratory experiments were conducted to further analyze the responses of convict cichlid fry to parental dummies. Responsiveness to dummies increased over time within a test and over repeated tests. Preferences were weaker in the older, less responsive fry, but were generally in the same direction as in younger fry. For all ages and for most dummy pairs there was a a significant interaction between training condition (preferred vs. non-preferred dummy) and preference. Experience with a single dummy also resulted in a general increase in responsiveness to the 2 dummies in the preference test. The present results are discussed in terms of selection pressures presumed to operate on natural populations of C. nigrofasciatum and also in terms of research on imprinting in precocial birds.																			0005-7959	1568-539X					1978	65		1-2				138	+		10.1163/156853978X00242	http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/156853978X00242													WOS:A1978FB04600009

The reduced state of the phosphorus discharged from the works has led to the dominance of the dissolved phosphorus pool by low molecular weight orthophosphates which are analytically detectable as soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP; 60% of total phosphorus pool). Seasonality in the in-lake total phosphorus pool is regulated by a combination of abiotic and hydrological processes; biotic processes appear to play a minor role. Mass balance calculations indicate that between 62 and 77% of the annual total phosphorus inflow load is retained within the impoundment each year.

Residence time trends for Ca are seasonal when compared to conservative behavior, with biologically induced calcite precipitation the main removal mechanism. Residence times for Fe and Mn are long, with bottom sediment resuspension and anoxic regeneration being the most important contributors. Residence times for K are long, with terrestrial organic decomposition and sediment resuspension being likely explanations. Mg, Na and Cl are found to be conservative in Acton Lake. As the same processes controlling elemental residence times in Acton Lake may also affect residence times in other lakes, the results from this study may be extended to predict residence time behavior in other systems. For example, residence times for Fe and Mn may be generally long in shallow, eutrophic lakes. Residence times for Ca may be seasonal and short in temperate, eutrophic lakes where the ratio IAP/Ksp exceeds 1. Na and Cl should behave conservatively in most lakes. In lakes where bottom sediment resuspension is important in affecting lake chemistry, residence times for many toxic trace metals may be long, possibly affecting water quality.

Increase of weight was obtained from length growth on the basis of a length-weight relationship. By comparing the growth parameters of the von Bertallanfy equation and data from the literature, a hypothesis is formulated that ring formation should occur at the transition from a dry to a rainy season, and that 2 rings a year should be formed.

J	RYBAK, M				RYBAK, M			SOME ECOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF ARTIFICIAL CIRCULATION ON THE PHYTOPLANKTON	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Studies were carried out in Lake Mutek (Mazurian Lakeland) on the effect of artificial aeration and destratification upon quantitative changes in the phytoplankton. These studies were carried out in 1977-1983. Two different methods of aeration were used. Low intensity mixing resulted initially in a 2-fold, and later on in a 4-fold increase of the phytoplankton biomass. Increase of phytoplankton biomass during lake aeration was due to the development of Ceratium hirudinella. Use of a highly effective air-compressor caused an inhibition of algal development, so that biomass dropped to levels noted in the control year. The effect of aeration depended on the ratio beween lake area and effectiveness of the aerator. Only intensive mixing of the water masses resulted in an inhibition of the development of algae. The effect of artificial destratification was also reflected in changes of the species structure, seasonal succession of the algae, and physiological state of the phytoplankton. Artificial circulation stimulated development of algae characterized by relatively high specific weight, i.e., most of all of Pyrrophyta, Bacillariophyceae and some species of Chlorophyta. Various aspects were discussed of the use of direct aeration as a technical method of lake restoration.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1985	122	1					89	96		10.1007/BF00018963	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00018963													WOS:A1985AEM3400010

A total of 88 species comprising 66 Rotifera, 7 Copepoda and 15 Cladocera were collected and identified during the course of present investigation. Zooplankton assemblage exhibited a type of seasonality closer to a temperate situation yet the species diversity and limnetic species composition reflected the characteristics of tropical or subtropical water bodies. The littoral zone harbored a greater variety of organisms than the limnetic zone in both the lakes. The qualitative similarity index (QSI) reflected a higher degree of similarity between the 2 lakes. QSI worked out between different zones displayed a higher degree of similarity (0.96) between the limnetic zones, as compared to littoral zone (0.82) of the 2 lakes. A succession of rotifer species with the march of the season was also discussed. A well defined correlation of 2 parameters, temperature and food, with the total zooplankton species was found in the 2 lakes. The differences in the organic enrichment of the 2 lakes seemed to influence their species composition.																			0003-9136						1985	102	3					387	403																WOS:A1985ABX1600010
J	Suzuki, N; Kitahara, T				Suzuki, N; Kitahara, T			A management policy for the scoop nets fishery of ayu population in Lake Biwa	FISHERIES SCIENCE												The purpose of this paper is to determine the optimal landing in weight of ayu Plecoglossus altivelis in the scoop nets fishery. First, we define a price function of the landing in weight, taking into consideration its variation within a fishing season. Next, we determine a cost function in a short term, which is the variable cost, through interviews with many fishermen at Lake Biwa. Here, the cost does not mean the opportunity cost. Then, we derive an optimal control problem to determine the landing in weight that maximizes the profit (the landing in value terms minus the cost) subject to some constraints, using the discrete maximum principle. A comparison between the optimized and the real fishery shows that the real fishery is more costly than the optimized one and hence, in spite of larger landings in weight, the total profit of the real fishery is less than the optimized one. This means that the scoop nets fishery is competitively operated.

J	Yoo, JM; Jeong, EJ				Yoo, Jung-Mon; Jeong, Eun-Joo			Temporal and Spatial Variability of the TOMS Total Ozone; Global Trends and Profiles	JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN EARTH SCIENCE SOCIETY												Using monthly total ozone data obtained from a Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) onboard the Nimbus-7 and Earth Probe satellite, this study examined the trend in the total amount of global ozone during two periods: from 1979-1992 [Early period] and 1997-2002 [Laker period]. The Annual average of total ozone during the Early period was globally reduced by about 10 DU compared to the amount during the Latta-, except in some areas between the equator and 20 N. Global trends of total ozone showed a decrease of -6.30 DU/decade during 1979-1992, and an increase of 0.12 DU/decade during 1997-2002. Its enhancement during the Latter period was especially noticeable in tropical areas. The EOF analyses of total ozone from this period indicated signs of temporal/spatial variability, associated with the phenomena of Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO), Quasi-Triennial Oscillation (QTO), El Nifio Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and volcanic eruption. Seasonal profiles of tropospheric ozone in the tropics obtained from ozonesondes, showed the spatial pattern of zonal wavenumber one. Overall, this study may be useful in analyzing passible causes in the variations of stratospheric and tropospheric ozone.																			1225-6692	2287-4518				APR	2005	26	3					199	217																WOS:000437557700003
J	HART, RC				HART, RC			TEMPERATURE TOLERANCES AND SOUTHERN AFRICAN DISTRIBUTION OF A TROPICAL FRESH-WATER SHRIMP CARIDINA-NILOTICA (DECAPODA, ATYIDAE)	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Laboratory estimates of median time of survival (MTS) were used as an index of the temperature tolerance of the warm-water shrimp C. nilotica. Tolerance to high (.gtoreq. 30.degree. C) and low (.ltoreq. 10.degree. C) temperature was examined in seasonally acclimated shrimps from subtropical Lake Sibaya [South Africa]. The MTS decreased rapidly at > 30 and < 10.degree. C. The MTS temperature response curve predicted a range for activity extending between 11-11.5.degree. C and 31.5-32.degree. C. This tolerance range broadly matches the span of environmental temperatures which shrimps are likely to experience within their geographical range, implying that distribution may be temperature related. The physiological restrictions implied by the anomalously low upper tolerance limit may be circumvented by avoidance behavior (e.g., diel offshore migrations) in suitable habitats.																			0254-1858						1983	18	2					67	70																WOS:A1983QP03000004

The contribution of surface runoff was small (10-30%), that of precipitation was significant (50-80%) for only 2 lakes with a large surface area, that of river input by the Jorke River was 15-85% for lakes situated at lower levels (15-85%), and that of direct input of pollution (sewage, trout culture) exceeded 80% in 2 polluted lakes, being thus several times higher than the critical P loading according to Vollenweider. In a shallow eutrophic lake a significant input of internal loading was found. The thermic, mictic and O2 conditions were compared as well as the chemical composition of bottom sediments, and the seasonal variation in Ptot in waters.																			0070-9557						1983	31	3					539	585																WOS:A1983SX48900002

No temporal or spatial differences in the average concentrations of dissolved Cu, Ni, Al and Fe were observed between May-Sept. Mn and Zn showed significant seasonal variations with Mn having distinct concentration maxima in both basins during Sept. This behavior was attributed to net release of Mn and Zn from the bottom sediments. Phytoplankton activity was important in causing large increases (1.8-5.4-fold the concentrations in May) in particulate elemental concentrations during the bloom periods. The removal of Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn from the water column was mediated by the decay of plankton populations.																			0048-9697	1879-1026					1983	30	SEP					99	109		10.1016/0048-9697(83)90005-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0048-9697(83)90005-0													WOS:A1983RL16500005

Territorial behavior effectively prevents bachelor groups from using high quality food resources in recently burnt areas and in certain zones of the shoreline community. To overcome the effects of the dry season on available food resources, waterbuck practiced a divergence in habitat selection from grass species in woodlands, to hydrophytic plant species along the shoreline of Lake McIlwaine [Zimbabwe].

Sediments were analyzed for nitrate reductase activity and the accumulation of nitrogenous gases in samples incubated in the laboratory. Changes in the concentrations of inorganic N species in the water column and the release of gas bubbles into gas traps suspended above the sediment were also measured. Sewage effluent entered the lake via the main inflow and fecal bacteria were used as tracers to map the path of the river (and effluent) accross the lake. The main river flow was west of the island in the center of the lake and across the smaller of the 2 main basins. A preliminary study indicated that this western basin was the site of most active denitrification and this was confirmed in the following year when a seasonal survey showed that deoxygenation, nitrate reduction and ammonium accumulation was more advanced at this site. This basin was the only area where consistent discharge of N and CH4 from the profundal zone was observed. The nitrate reductase assay demonstrated that the sediment was the major site of denitrification, and that activity in the water column was higher in the anoxic hypolimnion than in the euphotic zone. Gas evolution from incubated sediment samples was analyzed by GLC and indicated that maximum denitrifying activity occurred below the mud surface in oxidized sediments. There was reasonable agreement between the enzyme assay and the GLC technique, but neither predicted events in the field satisfactorily. Viable, most probable number (MPN) counts of denitrifying bacteria had similar limitations. A bimodal seasonal pattern of nitrate reductase activity was observed at 4 sites during thermal stratification, but this could not be explained fully. The major site of denitrification was identified and it was calculated that the N2 gas discharged was equivalent to .apprx. 54% of the nitrate removed from the water column.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1980	10	4					341	359		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1980.tb01207.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1980.tb01207.x													WOS:A1980KC70900003

The seasonal trend in the standing stock of urea in the central water column, together with the ratio of urea vs. total inorganic N in the euphotic zone from March 12, 1977 to July 25, 1978, are presented. The possible importance of bacterial decomposition of dead phytoplankton as a urea source in natural waters is demonstrated by this study. At times, a highly significant correlation between the vertical profile of urea and vertical distributions of other chemical and biological parameters which also were measured was found. An apparent in situ utilization of urea by phytoplankton is suggested on the basis of vertical profiles of urea and other chemical and biological parameters.																			0020-9309						1980	65	3					445	454		10.1002/iroh.19800650314	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19800650314													WOS:A1980KY83000009

Using capture-recapture methods, data on population changes and breeding of six murid species were obtained. At the beginning of the study, populations of Lophuromys flavopunctatus and Praomys jacksoni were higher during the mid-annual dry season (june-September), but later fluctuated with rainfall. Breeding coincided with rainfall in all species but in Praomys jacksoni and Oenomys hypoxanthus breeding occurred in both wet and dry months. The growth rate of laboratory reared Praomys jacksoni and Lemniscomys striatus was comparable to that in the forest within the 20-60 g weight ranges. The growth rate of Lophuromys flavopunctatus in the laboratory was lower than in the forest. Nonsignificant differences in growth rates were observed between individuals of different litters of the same species. Except in L. striatus, testicular descent in males occurred at an earlier age than vaginal opening in females. The average litter size ranged from a high of 4.5 for L. striatus to a low of 2.7 for O. hypoxanthus.																			0266-4674					MAY	1992	8		2				153	167		10.1017/S0266467400006271	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0266467400006271													WOS:A1992HT82900002

Concurrent estimates of gross assimilation and ecosystem respiration were based on in situ determinations of CO2 exchange. Total net primary productivity (TNPP) was 348 mg C m-2 day-1. Productivity of macrophytes (61% TNPP) was greater than that of epipelic algae (26% TNPP) and phytoplankton (13% TNPP). Gross assimilation (547 mg C m-2 day-1) exceeded ecosystem respiration (377 mg C m-2 day-1). The P/R [production/respiration] ratio was estimated at 1.45, indicative of a potential accrual of organic C at the rate of 169 mg C m-2 day-1, net ecosystem production. Annual efficiencies of assimilation and growth in the pond were estimated at 0.42 and 64.0%, respectively. Laboratory determination of photosynthesis of Juncus balticus, the dominant macrophyte, were used to interpret seasonal photosynthetic patterns observed in situ. The seasonal distribution and productivity of the algae are discussed. Macrophyte productivity and ecosystem metabolism estimates were examined.

It receives contaminated brackish water from Lake Edku and heavily polluted wastewater from Tabia Pumping Station UPS). Water samples were collected seasonally from this bay at four stations and at seven depths from the surface microlayer (SML) to the sediment water interface layer (SWIL) for investigating the effects of SML and SWIL on the distribution of nutrient species in the rest of the water column; middle water layer (MWL). Contrary to dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), particulate nitrogen (PN) and dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP), the annual means of nitrate, nitrite ammonium, reactive phosphate, particulate phosphorus (PP) and reactive silicon in the SML were higher than the corresponding means in the SWIL, confirming that contribution of these nutrient species from the SML to the MWL was more than that from the SWIL to the MWL, which gave intermediate annual means. These data suggest that most of the nutrient species in the bay originated from the allochthonous (land-based) sources; brackish Lake Edku water and TPS wastewater floating over the surface bay water rather than from the autochthonous sources; decomposition of organic remains and release from the bay sediments.																			0749-0208					SPR	2005					42		394	399																WOS:000230629600045
J	Marcus, MG; Brazel, AJ				Marcus, MG; Brazel, AJ			Environmental effects on radiation fluxes during the pre-monsoon, 4,170-5,525 m, Annapurna region, Nepal	MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT												This paper addresses the net radiation balance as it is affected by high elevation, topography, and variable surface materials and surface conditions in the Annapurna region of central Nepal. Emphasis is given to shortwave radiation components. Heat flux data were collected during the pre-monsoon period at four sites north of Annapurna Himal at elevations of 4,170; 5,019; 5,200; and 5,526 m. Results from this and other investigations of radiation in the Himalaya confirm remarkably consistent high transmissivities with low atmospheric turbidities. Seasonal cloudiness, elevation, and solar position appear to be the primary cause of changing global radiation in the region. Beam/diffuse ratios, in addition to expected cloud effects, are strongly influenced by slope, aspect, and surface material. For example, wall-originated diffuse radiation represented 15% of total global radiation at the 5,019 m Tilicho Lake site. Changes of local weather at Tilicho Lake, accompanied by snow flurries and subsequent snow melts, resulted in constantly changing albedos and highly variable longwave and net radiation values throughout most days.																			0276-4741					AUG	1996	16	3					221	234		10.2307/3673945	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3673945													WOS:A1996VK46100007

The mean density was 3103 org m-2 and it was found that Campsurus was unevenly distributed in the lake instead higher densities were in areas with a high content of organic matter. It was not possible to identify cohorts because all size-classes obtained their maximum density at the same time, and because reproduction was continuous all year around. However, emergence was highest during the rainy season. The size-frequency distribution shows that the number of nymphs in the older classes is low indicating that mortality is higher than in the younger classes. The production of Campsurus was 46.15 g m-2 y-1 which is the highest average on record. The annual turnover rate was 11.8 and 5.91 for the cohort. This high production is only possible when the nymphal density is high and development time short. Since the physical-chemical composition of the water in the interfase sediments-water has been changing in recent years the nymphs density has decreased considerably leading to lower production.																			0001-5504	0375-8370					1986	37	5					572	579																WOS:A1986J503200017

The houses were built in or very close to the water, and were constructed with the plant material available near the house site. Most houses were found in about 0.3 m of water and they were often situated on locally house site. Most houses were found in about 0.3 m of water and they were often situated on locally elevated points. The spatial distribution of inhabited houses during the peak year was random in late June, but contiguous in late Oct. The shallow sedge belt was most utilized in May and June, but was to a large extent abandoned later on, when the deeper water horsetail belt became well stocked. In late Oct. the outer bulrush belt was exploited, although only to a minor extent, as during other parts of the year. Utilization of bulrush was determined by the seasonally-prevailing water depth rather than population size. The water horsetail belt was utilized increasingly in late Oct. with the increase in the muskrat population, but only up to a certain level, after which the sedge belt was utilized instead.																			0022-541X	1937-2817					1978	42	3					540	549		10.2307/3800816	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3800816													WOS:A1978FN08300011

Both prey and predator populations inhabiting rocky areas in Lake Jiloa, Nicaragua, shift to deeper water during the dry season when luminance is greater. Predator and prey populations are also deeper over bright sandy areas than over rocks. Predators, during the middle of the day, attack prey significantly less in water above 3 m than in water between 3-12 m, but there is a significant increase in the number of attacks occurring above 3 m at twilight. The predator becomes more active, and the prey disappear into holes at twilight.

J	HART, BT; CURREY, NA; JONES, MJ				HART, BT; CURREY, NA; JONES, MJ			BIOGEOCHEMISTRY AND EFFECTS OF COPPER, MANGANESE AND ZINC ADDED TO ENCLOSURES IN ISLAND BILLABONG, MAGELA CREEK, NORTHERN AUSTRALIA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Three large plastic enclosures (5 m diam, volume 40 m3) were used to study the effects of copper, manganese and zinc. on the phytoplankton community in Island billabong, a floodplain billabong (waterhole) situated in the Magela Creek in tropical northern Australia. Copper was added to one enclosure, and manganese and zinc to another, to give initial concentrations around ten times the normal wet season Values. The enclosures and the billabong were monitored over a ten week period towards the end of the dry season, with the enclosures allowed to stabilise for four weeks before the metals were added. The control enclosure adequately simulated the temperature and pH changes in the billabong. The trends in conductivity, dissolved oxygen and major ion concentrations were similar in the enclosure and the billabong, with the minor differences observed attributed to either epiphytic growth on the enclosure walls (influenced dissolved oxygen, pH and bicarbonate concentration) or ingress of sulphate-rich groundwater into the billabong (influenced sulphate concentration and conductivity). Major differences in both the composition of species and the size of the phytoplankton populations were observed between the three enclosures and between the control enclosure and the billabong. This variability reflects the great natural variability in the phytoplankton communities in tropical lentic systems, and means that enclosures are unlikely to adequately simulate the biological communities in the billabongs. The control enclosure appeared to simulate quite well the longer term changes in total concentration and speciation of the three metals (copper, manganese & zinc) in the billabong. The mean concentrations of copper and zinc were similar in the two systems, although the mean concentration of manganese in the billabong was almost double that in the enclosure, possibly due to ingress of manganese-enriched groundwater. Particulate forms dominated the speciation of copper and manganese. There was considerable short term variation in both total metal concentration and speciation in both the enclosure and the billabong. This variability appears to be a feature of these small tropical waterbodies. The added heavy metals were found to have minimal detrimental effect on the phytoplankton community in each metal-loaded enclosure. The high natural variability in the phytoplankton community in these tropical systems will make it difficult to separate natural changes from those caused by low level contamination from mining operations should this occur. All three metals were rapidly removed from the water column, so that by the end of the six week period, only ca. 5% of each added metal remained in the water column. Association with the particulate matter (phytoplankton. abiotic particulate matter and MnO(x) in enclosure 2) followed by sedimentation was the major removal pathway. Epiphytes growing on the enclosure walls appeared to have a minor influence (< 10% of the total amount of metal added) on the removal of the added metals. For copper, uptake by phytoplankton followed by sedimentation was the major (65 %) removal process. Manganese and zinc, added together, were found to influence each other. The major manganese removal process (60%) was rapid (ca. 3 days) involving bacterial oxidation and sedimentation of the MnO(x) formed. This material appeared to have little influence on the behaviour of zinc, possibly because other particulate matter competed more effectively for the zinc. A further 30% of the added manganese was removed via initial adsorption to other particulate matter, possibly phytoplankton. Approximately one third of this adsorbed manganese (10% of the total added) appeared to undergo delayed oxidation some 8 days after the initial additions, and the heavier particles settled out more rapidly. This path was responsible for removing the major amount (ca. 60%) of the added zinc. We hypothesis that the sorbed zinc inhibited the bacterial oxidation of the manganese. A further 25% of the zinc was removed in association with a 'burst' of phytoplankton activity. The occurrence of bursts in the phytoplankton activity, when populations can increase verv substantially and then decrease again, all within the space of a day, appears to be an important mechanism for removing copper and zinc from the water column in these tropical water bodies.																			0018-8158					MAR 6	1992	230	2					93	134		10.1007/BF00006129	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006129													WOS:A1992HN79900003

The derivation of the functional groups consists of a classification of phytoplankton primarily based on taxonomy with some refinements by easily accessible properties and an aggregation of these classes into five functional groups based on an analysis of seasonal Occurrence in three lakes. The calibrated model qualitatively represents the pattern of the functional groups shown in the data from Lake Zurich. It was shown that modelling of observed functional groups in Lake Zurich is possible, as well as modelling of total algae. The sum of the biomasses of all functional groups is more robust to changes in kinetic parameters than the biomasses of the groups. Thus, the division of total biomass into functional groups makes the model results more sensitive to kinetic parameters. This indicates higher prediction uncertainty with respect to functional groups than with respect to total biomass. Light intensity and edibility are the most important influence factors in the model. Also sedimentation velocity turned out to have a large influence on the model results.																					90-77381-22-8				2005							256	261																WOS:000235515700040

Pollen records from these basins register climate variability with high precision as the sites are located halfway between the glacial-interglacial position of the upper forest line. Chronological control of the lacustrine sediments comes from C-14 ages and orbital tuning: maxima in the records of swamp forests (Alnus) correspond with low water level stands in the lake and coincide with minima in precession. Events were tuned with a 3 kyr time lag. Selected groups of pollen, indicative of temperature, precipitation, seasonality, and dryness index provided the time series and showed that climate change is orbitally forced. Different types of spectral analysis were applied. Precession in particular has an impact on all components of the ecosystem. Periods of > 19 kyr, between 12-15 kyr, 8-12 kyr, 2.5-8 kyr, and 1-2.5 kyr were evaluated. Higher frequencies are explained as harmonics and combination tones of Milankovitch forcing. The observed changes in climate are of regional importance in their direction, nature and timing, but also have global significance.

The pH of the water was alkaline, and the electrical conductivity was high. The total hardness was also high, followed by chlorides, bicarbonates, sulphates, and aluminum content was low. The analysis of variance of spatio-temporal variations of different water quality characteristics-pH, electrical conductivity, total hardness, carbonates and bicarbonates, chlorides, sodium, iron, fluorides, boron, aluminium, silicates, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, ammonia nitrates, phosphates, potassium and sulphates showed significant variations. Further, Inductive Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICPOES) analyses of water and sediment of the littoral zone of the lake depicted the state of 22 elements, including the toxic heavy metals namely mercury, cadmium, lead and arsenic, the concentrations of which were much higher than those of the ISI, ICMR and WHO standards for drinking water. The concentration of many of these elements, including that of heavy metals, were significantly high, at the site of the lake receiving the municipal raw sewage compared to other sites, clearly showing the municipal sewage to be the prime cause of pollution of the surfacewater of the lake. The textural composition of the surface sediment at different sites of the littoral zone of the lake showed its loamy nature. The spatio-temporal variations of different sediment characteristics also showed significant differences which also indicated that the site of the lake receiving the municipal sewage possessed higher concentrations of different elements and heavy metals compared to other sites of the lake. Human activities like Ganesh-idol immersion have increased the chemical pollution of the lake. Recurrence of fish kills were also recorded in the lake.

Tools for Integrated Basin Flow Management at Lower Mekong Basin Floodplains	MODSIM 2005: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING					International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM05)	DEC 12-15, 2005	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA					Integrated Basin Flow Management (IBFM) approach has been proposed by Mekong River Commission (MRC) to balance the economic and social developments, and maintenance of productive, healthy ecosystems in the Mekong Basin. The IBFM approach needs analytical tools to be used in solving real management problems. Mathematical models, in this case hydrological, hydrodynamic, and water quality models, are among those tools. While such models are useful in themselves, their full potential is only realised when linked with social, economic and policy issues. This paper focuses on the estimating impacts of the development scenarios on natural resources and on socio-economy with the help of mathematic modelling. The work presented here is part of the WUP-FIN project, complementary project for Water Utilization Programme under MRC. WUP-FIN focuses on developing and implementing hydrological, environmental and socio-economic modelling tools for the Lower Mekong Basin impact assessment. The Mekong River is one of the largest rivers in the world having a catchment size of 795,000 km(2) and average flow of 14,500 m(3)/s (Mekong River Commission, 2003). The river is shared by six countries (from upstream): China, Myanmar, Lao PDR, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. The four latter countries form the Mekong River Commission which, following the MRC 1995 agreement (Mekong River Commission, 1995), was established to agree an equitable and sustainable use of water resources in the lower Mekong Basin (LMB). The Lower Mekong Floodplains is very complex system of rivers, channels, dykes, embankments and large areas of floodplains. In order to be able to simulate this system comprehensively, including the different hydrodynamic conditions and water quality calculations into the same model, a hybrid 1/2/3 D model system is needed. Here 3D EIA Flow Model for floodplains (Koponen et al., 2004) is coupled with 1/2D channel model. The focus is in two target areas in the LMB floodplains: Tonle Sap Lake and floodplain (Cambodia) and Mekong Delta (Vietnam). The following development scenario indicators have been used in the project: Flood characteristics: duration, area, arrival time, depth Dissolved oxygen Total suspended solids and net sedimentation Dry season water quality One of the main aims of the modelling in the project is to assess the possible impacts of upstream developments, especially the hydropower dams and reservoirs, on lake's ecosystem. The main impacts of the development will most probably be the changes in hydrological regime reducing the water level during floods and reducing the area of the inundated habitats. The upstream reservoirs may trap significant part of the sediments as well. This may impact such ecosystem productivity among other impacts, as bank erosion etc. The approach for integration between socio-economy, ecology and hydrology can be carried out with two different methodologies that are based on data and modelling, and on experience and knowledge. The context of the integration consists of geographical area and of a specific analysis tool (GIS) coupled with the model results (Nikula, 2005). Ecology acts as a connecting factor between socio-economy and hydrology.

Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and ultraviolet (UV) absorbance was measured for the filtrated water of each samples. DOC concentration and SUVA (specific UV absorbance) of biodegradation analysis samples were determined around 50 days after the incubation. In the Fukui paddy fields, DOC concentration varied seasonally from 1.1 to 10.1 mg.Cl-1, showing higher concentration in heavy runoff of non-agriculture period in April. However, DOC concentration variation did not always correspond to rainfall. The Obadake paddy fields also showed a similar pattern with Fukui paddy fields. The daily DOC discharge per area in Fukui (up), Fukui (down), Obadake (south), Obadake (north) paddy fields influent from paddy fields were 0.02, 0.0161, 0.0135 and 0.0027 kg.a(-1).day(-1), respectively. These differences resulted from differences in agricultural types and customs of farmers according to paddy fields and fields. Also, SUVA (an indirect means to evaluate humic substances (hydrophobic fraction)) of the studied influent waters from paddy fields were generally lower than the influent waters from crop fields. The non-biodegradable DOC accounted for 50.2 - 98%, 46.8 - 85.5% of the total DOC in the paddy fields and crop fields.																			0273-1223	1996-9732					2005	52	12					233	241		10.2166/wst.2005.0470	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2005.0470								16477991					WOS:000235273600027

CYBIUM												Feeding, habits of the catfish Parailia pellucida (Schilbeidae) in three rivers of Ivory Coast. The diet of Parailia pellucida has been studied for the first time in Ivory Coast. This study is part of a large investigation programme concerning the pollution level of Aby lagoon, and Bia and Tanoe rivers, located in the South-East of the country. These waterways cross plantations of banana, pineapple, coffee, cocoa and palm tree, and are not polluted by chemical fertilisers and insecticids. Fishes were caught with monofilament gill nets in three stations (Tanoe, Soumie and Ehania) during April, June and October 2001. A total of 132 specimens (70-108 mm SL) were captured, and 92 stomachs contained food. Chironomidae larvae, Ephemeroptera and Elmidae constituted the main prey. The feeding habits were investigated with respect to rivers, fish size and seasons. Only an influence of rivers was detected. Diet of P. pellucida was similar in Tanoe and Soumie rivers, with an important amount of Ephemeroptera (24.72% of IRI in Tanoe and 21.31% in Soumie). The presence of Ephemeroptera indicated that these rivers were well oxygenated. These results are confirmed by the oxygen concentration measured in the stations, which ranged from 13 mg/l to 6-7 mg/l from rainy to dry season. Therefore, given the Ephemeroptera presence and the oxygen level, the pollution level was judged not frightening in these rivers.																			0399-0974	2101-0315					2005	29	4					355	362																WOS:000234993300006

Using Taihu Lake, China as a case study and MODIS images as data resources, this paper focuses on developing and applying MODIS algorithms to detect the changes of chlorophyll a concentration in Taihu Lake. Field survey data and MODIS images are acquired in different seasons. Using linear regression and nonlinear regression, semi-empirical models for these seasons are developed respectively by relating field data to different MODIS band combinations. And then, the changes of chl-a concentration in different seasons are determined and evaluated by applying these models to corresponding MODIS images. The study result shows that multi-temporal MODIS image data is suitable to monitor such change. Its high temporal resolution is advantaged in this research.																					0-7803-9050-4				2005							4535	4538																WOS:000237237606002
J	UHLMANN, D				UHLMANN, D			EVALUATION OF STRATEGIES FOR CONTROLLING EUTROPHICATION OF LAKES AND RESERVOIRS	INTERNATIONALE REVUE DER GESAMTEN HYDROBIOLOGIE												Compared to deep, aphotic layers of the ocean, continental waters are often disequilibrated with respect to the proportion of P. Taking an average composition of C106N16P1 as a reference quantity, the seasonality of the dimensionless N and P concentration can serve as a basis to characterize the in-lake conditions with respect to a deficiency or an surplus of a particular nutrient and to a seasonal shift between P- and N-limitation. Excess nitrate from agricultural watersheds with high application of fertilizers and intensive rainfall may represent a hypolimnetic concentration of chemical O2 as high as 20 mg/l or even more. In this connection, nitrate may function as a buffer against eutrophication and not as a eutrophicating agent. Excess nitrate may become harmful if drinking water supply is the principal use of the water. The significance of water hardness as a factor influencing the permissible P loading is also discussed. A flow card is presented which illustrates the sequence of decisions required to identify the principal nutrient sources and to select the most efficient control variable for a particular water body. As management alternatives, control of excess N and of P are discussed separately for point and diffuse sources, and the conditions are specified under which external control measures should be supplemented or even replaced by internal control.																			0020-9309						1982	67	6					821	835																WOS:A1982PY37100004

The temperature of the river water increases by about 3.degree. C from Lake Kariba to the sea, and with an average pH of 7.8 the water is slightly more alkaline than Kariba Dam water. The river is well oxygenated with no sign of H2S. Transparency is generally very low and changes are mainly determined by the floods of local tributaries. The overall average total alkalinity is 55 mg/l-1 CaCO3, with no regular seasonal variation, average concentrations of chloride and sulfate are, respectively, 5.4 mg/l-1 Cl- and 5.3 mg/l-1 .**GRAPHIC**. Ammonia and nitrate concentrations show a clear seasonal variation with, respectively, minimum dry season and maximum wet season average values of about 0.05 mg/l-1 and 0.3 mg/l-1. The overall average concentration of nitrite is 0.004 mg/l-1. Orthophosphate in the river is mostly affected by Lake Kariba, though other sources are also of some importance. Maximum average concentrations of about 0.4 mg/l-1 .**GRAPHIC**. were recorded during the dry season after the overturn of Lake Kariba. The concentration of dissolved metals is mainly determined by the outflow of Kariba and by the Shire River, with only K and Mg apparently affected by the outflow from Lake Kafue. The water quality of the Middle Zambezi is mainly determined by the Kariba Dam, with the Kafue Dam playing a minor role. At the time of the pre-impoundment survey, the main impact on water quality of the Lower Zambezi came from the Shire River. With the addition of yet another large reservoir on the Zambezi, in the form of Cabora Bassa, together with the appreciable effect of tributary rivers on the lake, and the likely increased impact of the Shire River on the now more regulated river, the quality of the Lower Zambezi is expected to alter considerably, with concomitant ecological changes.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1977	7	3					187	206		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1977.tb01668.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1977.tb01668.x													WOS:A1977DM87200001

J	Chen, CTA; Wann, JK				Chen, CTA; Wann, JK			Factors regulating the distribution of elements in the sediments of a seasonally anoxic lake in tropical Taiwan	TERRESTRIAL ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCES												Sixteen metals, both total and acid-leached, and their binding formations were quantified for the sediment column of the seasonally anoxic Great Ghost Lake. Since marked variation in the content of organic matter plays a major role in regulating the distribution of metals in sediments, this study provided insight into the relationship between organic matter and metals in a naturally anoxic water environment. Metals, Al, Cs, Mg, Rb and V, had significant negative correlations with total carbon content (TC) and occurred less often in mobile fractions. These findings indicate that these metals came from lithogenic sources and did not change much during early diagenesis. As a result, signals of these elements, whose origins can be traced back to long-range transport dust, were better preserved. Acid-leached contents of Cs, Mg and Rb also had negative correlations with TC, while both total and acid-leached As and Cd had good positive correlations with TC. Large portions of both As and Cd, were observed in mobile fractions (especially As) and came from organic sources and/or were incorporated into organic matter during early diagenesis (especially Cd). Long-term variations in redox conditions of the lake were induced by climate changes and might have influenced distributions of Sr and redox-sensitive Mn and V in mobile fractions. In addition to natural processes, enrichment of Pb and Cd near the core top was from anthropogenic aeolian sources. Finally, recent aeolian fluxes of Al, As, Ba, Br, Ca, Cd, Ce, Cl, Cr,.Cs, Cu, Er, Eu, Fe, Ga, Gd, K, La, Lu, Mg, Mn, Na, Nd, Ni, Pb, Rb, Si, Sm, Sr, Ti, Tm, V, Yb, Zn and Zr were estimated and large amounts of micronutrient Fe (similar to 60 mu g cm(-2) yr(-1)), of aeolian origin, was also noted.

Oligotrophication after a nutrient reduction in a shallow sand-pit lake (Creteil Lake, Paris suburbs, France): a case of rapid restoration	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												A limnological study was performed out, over 8 years from 1979 to 1986, in a shallow recently created sand-pit lake, Lake Creteil (Paris suburb, France). The lake is mainly supplied by phreatic waters. Typical of shallow waters, thermal stratification which occurred from May to October was intermittently broken by wind, leading to high seasonal fluctuations and allowing a reoxygenation of the total water column. The interannual development of the lake was characterized by a regular increase in transparency (from 1 m in 1979 to 2.7 m in 1985) which was partly due to not only stabilization of the bottom sediment and the banks, but also to a reduction of the biological component. A decrease in chlorophyll a concentrations resulted from nutrient diversion of domestic inputs collected through the rainwater pipe coming into the lake. The rapid restoration of water quality shows that this small artificial lake is very sensitive to human interventions.

Weekly samples were taken from January to December 1989. Parameters of population structure (total density, and densities of eggs, juveniles, and adults) and changes in body size were studied in relation to some environmental factors. Multiple regression models were used to analyze density and body size variations to evaluate the effects of temperature and food on growth of the two populations. The statistical models showed a significant influence of temperature and food on the seasonal patterns of density and body size of both species. In comparison with previous years, in 1989 a sharp decrease in the average body size of D. galeata was observed; this was determined primarily by the scarcity of food, rather than by predation. On the other hand, B. longirostris increased in size, being favoured by its feeding flexibility and by the composition of phytoplankton, which was made up mainly of small-sized algae; Bosmina thus became numerically dominant over Daphnia.						sebastiani, paola/0000-0001-6419-1545													0373-4137						1992	59	4					427	435		10.1080/11250009209386704	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11250009209386704													WOS:A1992KP36400013

Besides total phosphorus (TP), the sediments were analyzed for dry weight (DW), organic matter by loss on ignition (LOI), and Kjeldahl (KjN). The hydrochemistry of the area is strongly influenced by the man-made water regime. Although TP varied greatly (0.01-7.78 mg . g-1 of DW), the morphometry of the area affects the horizontal TP distribution. This impact could be attributed to sediment nature and water velocities. Sediments at inflow/outflow locations exhibited higher mean TP contents (0.86 mg . g-1 of DW) than sediments from the central lake areas (0.42 mg . g-1 of DW). The TP contents increased from sandy to peaty sediments and were highest in muddy sediments. Generally, TP contents decreased with depth. There was a slight seasonal TP variation. A significant interrelation of all variables studied was found for all sediments. The unexpected low correlation between LOI and TP is probably due to the occurrence of P-poor substances next to P-rich fresh organic matter. The horizontal TP distribution is reflected in different correlations of lake sediments and the rest of the samples.

Cultured biwa salmon showed slight changes in these components of the muscle during body silvering. Although cultured amago salmon parr showed seasonal fluctuations in the components, the smolts did not show definite difference as compared with the parr in early smolting season. On the other hand, wild biwa salmon displayed a marked difference in the lipid class composition and fatty acid composition between the parr in the river and the silvery fish in the lake. In silvering biwa salmon, depletion of 16:1, 18:2n6, 18:3n3 and increase in 22:6n3 of nonpolar lipids were observed, the pattern being similar to the marine fish lipid. Since no change was seen in cultured biwa salmon, differences in the lipid class and fatty acid compositions between the parr in the river and the silvery fish in the lake in wild biwa salmon seem to be related to differences in their feeding habit and/or in swimming activity.																			0021-5392					DEC	1991	57	12					2313	2320																WOS:A1991HB71100023
J	CARLSSON, S; LIDEN, K				CARLSSON, S; LIDEN, K			CS-137 AND POTASSIUM IN FISH AND LITTORAL PLANTS FROM A HUMUS-RICH OLIGOTROPHIC LAKE 1961-1976	OIKOS												Results of a 15 yr long-term study of the concentration of 137Cs from fallout in some species of fish and littoral plants in a humus-rich oligotrophic lake are presented. High concentrations of 137Cs were detected in the different species studied. This is in agreement with the general observation that organisms in oligotrophic lakes have higher concentrations of the radionuclide than in lakes of other limnological types. The maximum values of the concentration of 137Cs were found in 1964 or 1965 depending on the species studied. Since then the concentration of the radionuclide decreased and in 1975 it was 20-30% of the maximum value. A seasonal variation in the concentration of 137Cs in fish was noted with the highest value during the 1st quarter of the year. This is explained by the strong temperature dependence of the excretion of 137Cs. No seasonal variation in the concentration of K is seen in fish. The plant species Equisetum fluviatile and Carex rostrata have seasonal variations in the concentration of 137Cs and K, with the highest values at the beginning of the growing season. In the various species of fish studied a relationship was derived between the concentration of 137Cs and the size of the fish. The results are discussed in terms of changes in feeding habits and changes in the excretion of the radionuclide. The concentration of 137Cs in fish followed a trophic level increase. The concentration is increased by a factor of 2 between each level.																			0030-1299	1600-0706					1978	30	1					126	132		10.2307/3543533	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3543533													WOS:A1978FK62400016

Reproductive organs were examined from males and females. May 1972-May 1974; reproductive condition of females was noted during a CMR [capture-mark-release] study, Aug. 1974-July 1976. Breeding seasons (conceptions and births) occurred between Aug. and early Jan. (4-5 mo.) in the first 3 yr and between Sept. and March (7 mo.) in the last year. Second-year females produced 3 or 4 litters in short seasons, 4 or 5 litters in the long season and up to 20 offspring/season. First-year females produced 1 litter in short seasons and 1 or 2 litters in the long season. Mean litter size was 4.56 (2-6). Ovarian follicles were largest in Sept. and smallest in May. Small, inactive CL [corpora lutea] persisted in parous females until May. Placental scars were present in all sampled months. Vaginae remained closed during the non-breeding season. In mature males testes and epididymides contained sperm from July-March. Vesicular, prostate and preputial glands were enlarged and secretory from Sept.-Dec. Testes were smallest and least developed in May and June. Males were divided into 5 categories depending on age and overall reproductive condition. Sexual maturity was reached in the breeding season of birth by some males (33%) and females (13-88%). More females matured early when population density was low. Food abundance and quality may have been important variables in regulating the timing of the breeding season.																			0310-7833						1980	7	3					385	402																WOS:A1980KX43000009

The seasonal dynamics, dispersal pattern and site preference of the nematode were studied. Both larvae and adult worms were present in the perch throughout the year. The abundance of C. lacustris was non-seasonal, but seasonal cycles were found in the numbers of larvae and of gravid females. C. lacustris showed a tendency to an increase in mean intensity with the size of perch. The frequency distribution of the nematode followed the negative binomial at different times of the year and in different length groups of perch.

J	Limberger, R; Fesl, C; Schagerl, M				Limberger, R; Fesl, C; Schagerl, M			Phytoplankton community structure in a Danubian backwater system: Response to environmental factors	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Abiotic variables and phytoplankton composition were studied at an impounded part of the River Danube and at three backwaters upstream of Vienna. One of the backwaters was frequently connected to the Danube, whereas the other two sites were isolated with the exception of two flood events. Analysis of community stability revealed a pronounced change in the community structure at the flood pulses. The strongest impact was detected at the backwater that usually showed the highest differences to the main channel. Cluster analysis based on species abundance estimations resulted in a separation of the sites and detected similarities between the Danube and the permanently connected backwater. An Indicator Species Analysis was used to identify species indicative of the groups defined by the cluster analysis. A Detrended Canonical Correspondence Analysis was applied for examination of the relationship between the indicator species and the environmental factors. Connection and isolation, respectively, seemed to be important factors for the separation of sites and for the distribution of species. In times of isolation, seasonal variations of the environmental factors and, at one site, enhanced nutrient supply due to shallowness became determining factors.					; Schagerl, Michael/AAC-3356-2021; Michael, Schagerl/AAC-3356-2021	Limberger, Romana/0000-0002-9421-7520; Schagerl, Michael/0000-0002-8277-7205; 													0003-9136					OCT	2004	161	2					181	198		10.1127/0003-9136/2004/0161-0181	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2004/0161-0181													WOS:000225221000003
J	Stewart, KM				Stewart, KM			Revisiting the Senga 5a fish fauna, Upper Semliki River, Democratic Republic of Congo	ARCHAEOFAUNA												In the mid-1980s, excavations were conducted at the archaeological site of Senga 5a, located along the Semliki River in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire). The site had attracted interest after initial survey and excavation because of its Oldowan-appearing lithics and Plio-Pleistocene-aged fauna. In the final season of the Senga 5a excavations, the site geologists concluded that Senga 5a was not formed in situ in the Pliocene, but had been redeposited by the Holocene-aged Semliki River. However, conflicting with this interpretation was a large vertebrate fauna, primarily fish, in the eastern section of the site, which appeared to be a coherent Pliocene-aged fauna, associated with Pliocene artifacts. In this paper, the author compares the taxonomic composition of the Senga 5a fauna with that of other fish faunas from the Upper Semliki River and Lake Edward, ranging in age from Pliocene to Holocene. The resulting analysis indicates the Senga 5a fish fauna is a cohesive Middle to Late Pliocene-aged fauna, with no later intrusive fish. Further investigation of the geology and the invertebrate and vertebrate faunas as well as the artifacts is needed to develop a site formation history of Senga 5a that is consistent with all of the evidence.																			1132-6891					OCT	2004	13						145	154																WOS:000227982000011
J	Hustler, K; Marshall, BE				Hustler, K; Marshall, BE			The abundance and food consumption of piscivorous birds on Lake Kariba, Zimbabwe-Zambia	OSTRICH												About 40 species of piscivorous birds have been recorded on Lake Kariba (Zimbabwe Zambia) but only 26 were observed during this study, carried out in 1986-87. The Reed Cormorant Phalacrocorax africanus was the most numerous and made up 51.4% of all the birds seen, followed by the Whitewinged Black Tern Chlidonias leucoptera (26.7%), and the Darter Anhinga melanogaster (10.8%). Several species roosted or bred in the drowned trees which project above the lake surface but gently sloping shores were the most important feeding grounds. Relatively few birds were seen on steeply sloping shores or in open water. There was a distinct pattern of seasonal abundance, with birds being most numerous in the rainy season (November-April). The relative abundance of some fish species also was greatest during this period. There was a positive relationship between the numbers of some bird species and the relative abundance of these fish. The mean density of piscivores (0.05 ha(-1)) was low compared to some other African waters. This is attributed to the fact that Lake Kariba is relatively deep and its shoreline is mostly steep. The mean population of 25 000 birds consumed less than 1000 t of fish per annum, compared to almost 40000 t taken by the commercial fisheries. A considerable portion of the birds' diet was fish that were not taken commercially.																			0030-6525					MAR	1996	67	1					23	32		10.1080/00306525.1996.9633777	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00306525.1996.9633777													WOS:A1996VJ58300004

No evidence was found of seasonal changes in the composition or absolute levels of the benthic invertebrate density and biomass, though local changes occurred in some species which were attributed to swarming behavior or larval settlement patterns. Comparison of the benthic fauna at 9 sites showed considerable similarity over the whole lake. Multivariate analysis on the sample data showed that an inshore/offshore difference accounted for 30-40% of the total variation between samples. This difference may be related to the texture and stability of the substratum. Comparison with the literature shows that the Lake George benthos is an extreme type, but one that is represented in other inter-tropical African lakes.																			0952-8369	1469-7998					1977	181	JAN					95	111		10.1111/j.1469-7998.1977.tb04572.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7998.1977.tb04572.x													WOS:A1977CU52000008

Factors contributing to this condition may be that the moderately sized lakes of this study are deep relative to their surface areas, highly stained by humic substances, of very low conductivity and contain little dissolved CO2. Standing crops of phytoplankton are very low, never exceeding 600 mg/m3. Chrysophyceae are dominant over all other classes of algae in both biomass and numbers, comprising .apprx. 50% of the fresh weight throughout the season. The abundance of micro-flagellates implies a large surface area to volume ratio and the ability to move are an advantage in a nutrient poor environment. Much of the phytoplankton present may grow heterotrophically and energy additions from the terrestrial environment may be extremely important to the productivity of northern lakes when photosynthetic production is not significant.																			0020-9309						1979	64	1					89	98		10.1002/iroh.19790640108	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19790640108													WOS:A1979HH33000005
J	HAERTEL, L				HAERTEL, L			NUTRIENT LIMITATION OF ALGAL STANDING CROPS IN SHALLOW PRAIRIE LAKES	ECOLOGY												Environmental control of algal standing crops in 2 non-stratified prairie lakes in South Dakota and Minnesota, USA, was investigated by season for 3 yr. Multiple regression analysis was performed using chlorophyll a concentration and cell counts as dependent variables. In both lakes physical factors (light temperature, wind stress and rainfall) were more frequently correlated with changes in algal standing crops than were N and P. Both lakes indicated occasional positive correlations with N. The correlations were greater in the deeper lake. P was positively correlated during 1 season in the deeper lake, never in the shallower lake. Multiple regression analyses using concentrations of NO3, NH3 and orthophosphate as dependent variables and physical factors, algal abundance and zooplankton abundance as independent variables showed positive correlations between increases in orthophosphate and NO3 and prior rainfall and wind stress. NH3 showed strongest correlations with wind stress. The correlations between wind stress and nutrient levels are assumed to result from recirculation of nutrients released at the sediment surface by circulation of the water column and by direct stirring of sediments in shallow water by wave action. The more extensive direct stirring of sediments in the shallower lake is assumed to partially account for the much higher levels of nutrients observed. Depth of lake relative to depth of wave action determines to what extent the sediments of a shallow lake are subject to direct stirring.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1976	57	4					664	678		10.2307/1936181	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1936181													WOS:A1976CD42700004

The overall female to male ratios in T. rendalli and P. sarana were 1.1:1.0 and 1.5:1.0, respectively. Considerable deviation from the mean ratio was attributed to their spawning behavior and migrations. In the larger size groups in T. rendalli males were dominant while the reverse was observed in P. sarana. Both species breed throughout the year, with well defined peaks in the case of P. sarana which were coincidental with the main rainy seasons. Both species are multiple spawners, fecundity ranging from 760-6160 in T. rendalli with length and weight varying from 18.8-25.8 cm and 126-380 g, respectively.

Two series of experiments, employing 50 adult animals, involving changes in oxygen tension in the water and changes in salinity. Normal leech neurons exhibit finely granular orange fluorescence uniformly distributed throughout the cytoplasm, with a perinuclear rings of especially strong fluorescence. After exposure to anoxic (0% O2), hypoxic (20% O2), or hyperoxic (200% O2) conditions at 20.degree.C for 1-15 days, the orange cytoplasmic fluorescence is no longer uniformly distributed; the redistribution is generally toward the periphery, leaving the perinuclear zone without RNA fluorescence, but irregular zones of cytoplasm devoid of RNA also occur not as a gradient. Leeches exposed to salinigy of, or greater than, 2.5 ppt for 15 days exhibit similar changes. These alterations are confirmed by electron microscopy. Seasonal fluctuations in oxygen tension and salinity of lake water affect the distribution and abundance of organisms. The acridine orange method provides one measure of stress to the nervous system in freshwater invertebrates that might be applicable to ecological studies as well as to metabolic studies of individual animals.

The validity of this index of N-assimilation in field studies was tested by a comparison with the coupling of distributions of inorganic nitrogen uptake rate based on C-14 incorporation into proteins and the amino acids to protein ratio together with several abiotic and biotic parameters. The potential GS activities recorded during the seasonal succession of phytoplankton (characterized by the dominance of diatoms) were in the same order of magnitude of those reported from the very poor literature on this subject. Over high N-NO3- availability, the potential GS activities recorded were close to indirect estimations of N-uptake rates. During nitrogen depletion, high potential GS activities (which coincided with a development of small diatoms) were recorded suggesting that cell metabolism adapted to N-nutrient constraints. In addition, potential GS activity evolved concomitantly to other indicators of N-uptake and N-status. However, N-assimilation rates based on the enzymatic approach were lower than those obtained through indirect isotopic determination of uptakes rates. We suggest therefore that GS was not the unique pathway of ammonium assimilation in field populations.																			1015-1621						1996	58	2					103	119		10.1007/BF00877110	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00877110													WOS:A1996VL55200002

Roth	VERHANDLUNGEN DER GESELLSCHAFT FUR OKOLOGIE, VOL 26					25th Annual Meeting of the Gesellschaft-fur-Okologie	SEP 11-16, 1995	DRESDEN, GERMANY	Gesell Okol				According to literature seedlings or juvenile plants of Calamagrostis epigejos (and a lot of other clonal growing species) are very rare under field conditions. Nevertheless in various experiments we found high to moderate germination rates in seed material collected from different populations. In consequence not germinability but seedling establishment seems to be the bottle-neck in the population development. Therefore, we investigated at which field sites establishment takes place and which adaptations to this limiting phase in the lifecycle can be found. Field investigation: The search for seedlings and juvenile plants of Calamagrostis epigejos in the field was successful exclusively on both open and continuously damp microsites like edges of lakes with changing watertable. Thus the germination and establishment process of this "all sites plant" seems to be confined to very special sites. Results of experiments: Juvenile plants of similar age (seeds from one population) raised under identical conditions show large differences between individuals (individuality), e. g. with respect to maximum height and total number of tillers. Additionally, a special season dependent plasticity was found: There were stated great differences in percentage of stolon weight (given the same total weight) as well as in relation of the number of axial tillers (of first order) to total dry weight depending on germination dare. These findings are discussed as adaptations to the difficulty of early establishment. A fine balance between the investment into organs of photosynthesis and space keeping (first filler and axial tillers of first order) and into space capturing organs (spacers and fillers at the end of spacers) is postulated.																					3-437-25058-2				1996							765	773																WOS:000075264500101

The total number of fungi found was 67, among which Hyphomycetes predominated. Frequency of occurrence, density and importance index show that complexes of fungi are formed according to the trophic state of lakes. Aquatic Hyphomycetes are more significant in oligotrophic and dystrophic lakes. At stages of leaf litter processing in lakes there are three groups of fungi: aquatic hyphomycetes, zoosporic and terrestrial fungi.

J	NOLTIE, DB				NOLTIE, DB			DIFFERENCES IN BREEDING LAKE-SUPERIOR PINK SALMON (ONCORHYNCHUS-GORBUSCHA (WALBAUM)) ASSOCIATED WITH VARIATION IN THYROID HYPERPLASIA	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha (Walbaum)) from eastern Lake Superior exhibit various degrees of thyroid hyperplasia. A link between goitrogenesis and growth is suggested by the increased prevalence of large lesions among large fish of both sexes. Despite males being larger than females, however, lesion prevalence did not differ between the sexes. More large lesions occurred among late migrants, especially males, indicating a seasonal increase in hyperplasticity. Delayed stream entry occurred in overtly lesioned fish of both sexes, evidence of a possible inhibition of maturation. Males and females differed in condition (weight-at-length) with lesion severity. Females with overt lesions showed reduced secondary sexual character development, more so than males. The pre- and post-spawning testis characteristics of males generally did not differ with lesion size, although the testes of spawned-out males with large lesions did have higher water contents. In females, the reduced water content of eggs in severely lesioned individuals was evidence of delayed maturation. Enlarged livers occurred in badly lesioned females, but not in males. In neither sex did severely lesioned fish exhibit shorter breeding life-spans. In overview, this study demonstrates that a wide range of effects is associated with differences in the severity of thyroid hyperplasia exhibited by Lake Superior pink salmon, these also being mediated by apparent differences in physiology between the sexes.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				DEC	1988	66	12					2688	2694		10.1139/z88-394	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z88-394													WOS:A1988T032500013

The numerical density of the Cladocera, Cercopagis pengoi and Cornigerius meaticus was studied according to month, season, and stations in this lake, which is a coastal lake of the Black Sea. Average densities were determined as 3789 ind/m(3) for Cercopagis pengoi and 8771 ind/m3 for Cornigerius meaticus. The maximum level of C. pengoi was in May at 20degreesC and for C. meaticus this occurred in September (18degreesC). The densities of these two species vary greatly, depending on temperature.																			0011-216X	1568-5403				JUN	2004	77		6				669	681		10.1163/1568540041958554	http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1568540041958554													WOS:000224342500002

The closed part of the lake, used for controlled fishing was well protected; the open part was subjected to considerable human activities [uncontrolled fishing, waste disposal]. The variation in the physicochemical parameters in the open lake were different from those of the closed lake in that there was distinct seasonal variation in DO [dissolved oxygen] which was not evident in the closed lake and there was direct relationship between diurnal variation of CO2 and pH instead of an indirect relationship in the closed lake. The variation in pH, electrical conductivity, bicarbonate, free CO2 and chloride between 1976 and 1978 had a similar pattern in the 2 parts of the lake.																			0020-7233	1029-0400					1983	21	3-4					243	250		10.1080/00207238308710082	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207238308710082													WOS:A1983RV51700004

J	HALAND, A				HALAND, A			HOME RANGE USE AND SPACING IN MALLARD ANAS PLATYRHYNCHOS BROODS	ORNIS SCANDINAVICA												Spacing and home range use of 7 mallard broods were studied in a small lake (5.8 ha) during 1977 and 1978. The broods were well spaced with a various degree of overlap in home range use, which increased with increasing age differences between broods. Increasing overlap with increasing age was found between 2 broods of the same age. Marked individual variation in home range use was found. No distinct, defended brood territories were found, but all broods showed preference for certain sections of the shoreline. The 2 largest broods used more space than the others, and brood hatched late in the season used less space than early ones. Regarding age, no distinct pattern in home range use was found, but 3 broods used the same general areas during their growth period. Spacing pattern also seem to be influenced by other broods present and the female status as a dominance hierarchy seem to exist. Loafing sites, commonly reused, were near preferred feeding areas. Interactions between broods were infrequent. Interbrood competition for invertebrate food during early stages of life may be the ultimate factor regulating spacing. Adaptive value of spacing in mallard broods, spacing mechanism and proximate factors involved are discussed.																			0030-5693						1983	14	1					24	35		10.2307/3676247	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3676247													WOS:A1983QH30800003

Visual examinations for ear lesions and evaluations of ear scrapings were used to assess the prevalence of mites in sheep that were live-captured or killed during the hunting season. The prevalence of psoroptic scabies in live-captured sheep for the years 1979, 1980 and 1981 was 25, 25 and 0%, respectively, and was higher in rams (1979, 65%; 1980, 100%) than in ewes (1979, 11%; 1980, 0%). The severity of ear lesions was also greater in the males. The prevalence in harvested rams was 23%, 44%, and 7%, respectively, for the years 1979-1981. The severity of the ear lesions was highest in 1980. Lesions were confined to the ears. An aerial census of bighorns in the Black Mountains during May of 1981 showed a 38% decrease in total observations from the previous year and a drop in the ewe/lamb ratio from 0.52 in 1980 to 0.29 (P .ltoreq. 0.01) in 1981. In the Lake Mead area, there was a population census decline of 33% in 1981 and a non-significant decline in the ewe/lamb ratio from 0.46 to 0.40. The population decline in 1981, and the increased prevalence and severity of psoroptic scabies in the 1980 survey in both areas were believed to be related to the high bighorn population densities in 1980 and the prevailing drought.																			0090-3558	1943-3700					1983	19	4					342	344		10.7589/0090-3558-19.4.342	http://dx.doi.org/10.7589/0090-3558-19.4.342								6644933					WOS:A1983RS66700010

Salinity was determined in 71 sample-points corresponding to 42 lagoons, lagunes and connection channels, in the area between Itapeva Lagoon and Peixe Lagoon, through measurements and collections with longitudinal and daily (seasonal) profiles, from November 1978 to March 1980. Concomitantly molluscs were collected and other abiotic parameters were measured. In order to verify the interrelationship between Littoridina distribution and salinity, laboratory bio-assays were carried out, with the collected and acclimatized individuals being submitted to several concentrations. Particular methodological procedures were developed. The present work shows the importance of salinity on biogeographical interpretation of freshwater and brackishwater molluscs distribution in Rio Grande do Sul coastal region, using field surveys combined to laboratory autecological tests, and demonstrates the possibility of utilizing the studied species molluscs as salinity bioindicators.																			0065-6755						1984	9	1					127	146																WOS:A1984ALD3800010

Eighteen territories along a marshy shoreline were occupied by groups of 2-4 donacobius. Each group contained a mated pair and 0-2 helpers, apparently offspring produced during 1-2 preceding breeding seasons. Helpers participated in nest surveillance, territorial displays and feedings nestlings. Displays occurred at territory boundaries and consisted of loud duetting by the pair or group. Breeding coincided with the rainy months, Oct.-April, and peaked in Nov.-Jan. Clutch size was always 2. Egg and nestling periods each lasted 17-18 days. No correlation was demonstrable between group size and overall fledging success. Trios accounted for all cases in which both young successfully fledged, whereas pairs never fledged more than 1 young. Annual survivorship of breeding adults averaged 71%. Cooperative breeding in donacobius is associated with limited opportunities for acquiring breeding territories, as in many other cooperative breeders. The relatively short period during which young serve as helpers (and the resulting small family sizes), however, suggests that at other times or places breeding territories are more readily available to young.

Seasonal distribution of the zooplankton followed an uniform pattern throughout the backwater. Zooplankton in the Kadinamkulam Backwater is composed of foraminifers, coelenterates, nematodes, rotifers, chaetognaths, polychaetes, cladocerans, ostracods, amphipods, copepods, decapod larvae, insect larvae, bivalves, tunicates, and fish eggs and larvae. Among these, rotifers, copepods and copepod nauplii are the major components which form the bulk of the zooplankton (nearly 98%). A distinct regional variation is discernible in the dominance of zooplankton components. Copepods constitute the dominant group near the barmouth and middle portion of the backwater, while rotifers are dominant in the upper reaches where freshwater influx was relatively high. Factors influencing seasonal variation and distribution have also been discussed.

Field collections of adult and juvenile gizzard shad were conducted to determine the prevalence and seasonality of neoplasms and site specificity of neoplasm-bearing fish. Overall neoplasm prevalence for adult gizzard shad was 22.1%; no juveniles exhibited neoplasms. Neoplasm occurrence did not appear seasonal. Neoplasm-bearing gizzard shad were found at all three sampling sites within Lake of the Arbuckles with similar neoplasm prevalence rates (Guy Sandy Creek 22.1%, Rock Creek, 17.9%, and Buckhorn Creek 22.4%). No gizzard shad (juvenile or adult) collected from Lake Carl Blackwell, Oklahoma, the reference site, exhibited neoplasms. Water, sediment, and shad liver tissue from Lake of the Arbuckles and the reference site were analyzed for total recoverable metals (cadmium, chromium, copper, nickel, and lead, by graphite furnace atomic absorption). Chromium, copper, and nickel were found in the water samples at concentrations of >1 to 8.6 mu g/L. Low concentrations (>1 to 13.6 mu g/g wet weight) of all the metals were found in the sediment and liver tissue from both sites. Heavy metal contamination does not appear linked to neoplasm occurrence. To determine if a nonbacterial infectious agent was responsible for tumor formation, cell-free neoplasm homogenates were injected into healthy rainbow trout. Neoplasms were not transmitted into rainbow trout. The etiology of these neoplasms remains unknown.																			0730-7268	1552-8618				OCT	1995	14	10					1781	1787		10.1002/etc.5620141019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/etc.5620141019													WOS:A1995RV70900019

This hypothesis is being tested by means of fine resolution diatom and other microfossil analysis after the method of Simola (1977). Even where the laminations are faint and disrupted, it appears that seasonal signals from algal blooms are preserved. Organic geochemical analyses of sediments from Ellesmere show that the uppermost layers contain abundant organic matter (over 17% total dry matter) and that the extractable lipid fractions from different horizons exhibit clear compositional differences. These are produced by temporal changes in the organic inputs to the sediments, and also by diagnetic effects. The elastic and organic content of the cores also provides evidence for lake level variations in this area over the last 250 years.																			0018-8158					MAY 31	1991	214						279	292		10.1007/BF00050962	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00050962													WOS:A1991FX93500038

Therefore, we assessed the horizontal and seasonal differences in the abundance and size structure of zooplankton in a small (43 ha) South Dakota impoundment. We collected zooplankton samples from vegetated, edge, and non-vegetated areas using a 1.5-m integrated tube sampler in May, June, and July 2001. Overall, Cyclopoida and Daphnia were more abundant in the vegetated area, but Calanoida were more abundant in the non-vegetated areas. Size differences were also found, but differences were inconsistent among months and habitat classifications. We also quantified the number of samples required to obtain a 20% coefficient of variation of the mean abundance of zooplankton species among months and habitat categories. The results of our study illustrate the importance of implementing a sampling design that accounts for the spatial variation in zooplankton.

INORGANIC CARBON UPTAKE	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Net inorganic C uptake was examined for algal periphytic communities on Potamogeton richardsonii, P. praelongus and P. zosteriformis in a shallow lake. Nuclear track autoradiography was used to examine uptake for individual taxa comprising the communities. Net uptake rates per unit cell surface area were strongly correlated during the season for certain algal taxa, particularly diatoms, on the same macrophyte. The correlated taxa formed a different correlation cluster for each macrophyte. Although several of the same algal taxa appeared in the correlation clusters for different macrophytes, the behavior of a given taxon was only rarely correlated on different macrophytes. Each cluster behaved as an independent unit. Such organized behavior may be important in algal succession. Principal component analysis of the species-time uptake matrix isolated 3 main principal components that accounted for > 95% of the seasonal variation on all 3 macrophytes.																			0003-9136						1982	94	3					341	371																WOS:A1982PS07100006

Initial conclusions attributed the collapse to lake manipulation, but intensive life-history studies indicated that the cause was a series of cold years immediately following diversion. A simple model relating air temperature during the open-water season to Hexagenia abundance was successful in predicting burrowing mayfly abundance in the lake. This indicated the significance of temperature in regulating these populations, which are near their northern limits of distribution in Manitoba. The difficulty in discriminating between natural ecosystem variability and anthropogenic effects during the course of an environmental monitoring program is illustrated by this study.																			0044-7447					MAY	1991	20	3-4					139	142																WOS:A1991FR88100010

A pronounced seasonal fluctuation in the cell density of purple nonsulphur bacteria (Rhodopseudomonas palustris) was observed in the middle depth transition zone between oxic and anoxic layers with a peak density of 700 cell . ml-1 in October 1986. Associated with cell density increase, concomitant considerable decrease in the concentration of DOC, in particular of the DOC fraction with molecular weight less than 1,000, was observed in this transition zone. Laboratory culture experiments suggest that the development of Rh. palustris in the transition zone of oxic and anoxic layers could be due to the occurrence of Mn in so appreciable concentration to sustain its growth. Results of experimental cultures and observations suggest that around one third of the DOC decrease in the transition zone accounted for the growth of Rh. palustris.																			0003-9136					MAY	1991	121	3					307	317																WOS:A1991FW59000004

Fish comprised 76% of the total diet volume, insects 22%, and earthworms 1%. By frequency of occurrence, fish appeared in 61% of the individual samples, insects in 64%, and earthworms in 5%. Frequency and volumetric data are provided for each major taxon. Changes in diet were noted as the breeding season progressed. In May, June, and July, fish constituted 56%, 72%, and 84%, respectively, while for the same 3 mo. insects accounted for 2%, 28%, and 16% of the volume. Earthworms contributed 26% of the total May volume but declined to 1% in June and nothing in July. Food types in samples were indicative of aquatic, aerial and terrestrial foraging. Food habits are discussed in relation to gull population dynamics on the Great Lakes. Dietary differences were noted between gulls nesting at mainland and offshore sites. Fish accounted for 69% of the volume at Rogers City and 88% at Ile aux Galets; insects contributed 30% of the total volume at Rogers City and 11% at Ile aux Galets. There was a greater diversity of food items in the Ile aux Galets samples as well as a larger percentage of food of aquatic origin. The periods of peak abundance of the 3 fish species [Alosa pseudoharengus, Perca flavescens, Pungitius pungitius] in the samples roughly coincided with the respective spawning seasons.																			0043-5643						1976	88	4					621	631																WOS:A1976CW41400009

The grass Panimum repens played a major role in impala nutrition, increasing in the diet through the dry season to attain a wet season maximum. Condition indices (kidney fat index and bone marrow fat index) indicated that the food resource was not limiting during the study. Differences in these indices between sexes were explained in terms of reproductive demands. Foraging efficiency of adults (as measured by acceptable food abundance) declined in the cool dry season, and corresponded to a raised browse component in the diet. In the wet season, animals devoted less of their foraging time to feeding. Diet composition and foraging efficiency were related to the nature of the Panicum resource, which was controlled by water level changes. The findings are matched against current ideas on optimal foraging.																			0379-4369	1996-8477					1985	15	2					41	48																WOS:A1985AJQ3000001

Interstitial water was obtained by the centrifugation-filtration method. Temporal variations were observed over the entire 15 cm sediment depth interval examined in all 4 locations evaluated. Interstitial reactive P (IRP) levels in Lake Mendota ranged 0.014-1.67 mg l-1 at the 5-6 m water column depth and 1.20-5.75 mg l-1 at the 18-19.5 m depth. IRP levels in Lake Wingra ranged 0.029-2.15 mg l-1 at 3.5 m and 0.191-3.96 mg l-1 at 2 m. Variations in interstitial P were attributed to variations in oxidation state of Fe as influenced by O2 transport and reduction rates.																			0043-1354	1879-2448					1977	11	12					1041	1047		10.1016/0043-1354(77)90004-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(77)90004-5													WOS:A1977EH26700004

LAKE CHEMISTRY AND TRITIUM MIXING STUDY	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The study of vertical mixing in Lake Tahoe [California, Nevada USA] by temperature and oxygen measurements is limited to the top layer of the lake, since vertical gradients are extremely small at greater depth. Below 200 m the temperature gradient is about -1.6 .times. 10-4.degree. C m-1, with little or no seasonal variation. A tritium profile was taken at a midlake station in 1973 together with samples for measurements on lake chemistry. O2, nitrate, total inorganic C and pH showed the effects of photosynthetic activity to a depth of about 80 m, well below the thermocline; average planktonic composition was calculated from these data. Silicate and carbonate alkalinity profiles were essentially uniform, showing that biological removal is negligible in comparison to the rate of vertical mixing. Essentially no variation in tritium concentration with depth was observed. Tritium measurements and input estimates in Crater Lake were used to calculate tritium concentration in Lake Tahoe between 1954-1973 and to estimate a ratio in tritium input of 32% precipitation to 68% vapor exchange. The tritium profile gives strong evidence for at least occasional complete mixing of Lake Tahoe. The last complete mixing may have occurred in March 1973 and at least 1 other such event took place between 1964-1968.

J	Stauber, K				Stauber, K			Cost-effective use of visitor-use exclosures for the rejuvenation of Ammophila breviligulata on Minnesota Point, Minnesota	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												There are many obstacles to sand dune restoration and erosion control along Lake Superior's Minnesota Point in Duluth, Minnesota. Most have human origins. This restoration project combined inexpensive visitor use exclosures, an ongoing public-awareness campaign, and propagated/rejuvenated state-listed beach grass in a plan that proved to be both cost-effective and successful. The project involved coordinated annual tree plantings, fencing installations and maintenance, and debris removal. Wooden boardwalks and dune bridges were incorporated with an immediate, measurable benefit. The results of this work are visible using historic and annual photographic comparisons. Chronic problems include vandalism to structures and planted areas, wind erosion, and seasonal climate variations. These variables affected the success/failure ratio of transplanted or introduced vegetation, as did incompatible methodology, lack of water, and suitability of plant material. Other problems were bureaucratic or political, including overlapping city and state jurisdictions and a complex permitting process. Concerns about threatened and invasive beach grass species, public access and overuse, and diminishing Great Lakes dune habitats makes this type of restoration project a priority.																			0885-8608					FEB	2004	24	1					32	35																WOS:000189318300004

The Dean Hall site consisted of a collection of tidal creeks with intertidal, emergent vegetation and large fluctuations in submersed habitat due to tide. The Bonneau Ferry site was lacustrine, dominated by submergent vegetation, and fluctuated very little with the tide. We found 34 total species. Most were a species of Centrarchidae (41%) or an estuarine migrant (27%). Abundance and species richness varied among months, with a peak in April and June. Differences in fish community structures were noted between wetlands with Dean Hall generally containing a more specious, but variable, community whereas Bonneau Ferry contained a more stable fish community with slightly fewer species. Moreover, the Dean Hall fish community tended to be predominated more by Centrarchidae species whereas Bonneau Ferry contained more estuarine migratory species. Our results fill a void in the understanding of fish communities in southeastern U.S. wetlands by targeting the large-bodied fishes and add to the understanding of seasonal diversity in these systems. Moreover, our results underscore the need to study a diversity of wetland types to best discover fish community dynamics within a river system.					; Long, James/C-5999-2009	McManus, Michael/0000-0003-4200-6446; 																			2004							174	186																WOS:000235161800018

Now there are more than 800 impoundments and few unregulated stretches of river. Reservoir construction increased the amount of aquatic habitat in the state, while dramatically changing most of the original habitat. These altered environments present challenges and opportunities to fishery managers charged with maximizing recreational fishing. Water level, flow, thermal regimes, and nutrient dynamics typically reflect human needs for flood control, water supply, and electrical power rather than natural weather patterns or seasonal cycles. Texas Parks and Wildlife Department has used propagated Fishes to meet the challenges of these altered systems while diversifying fishing opportunities in Texas. Management of these environments necessitated decisions regarding the use of native sport fishes or fishes that were not native to the state but may, because of their habitat requirements or life histories, be more functionally suited to the newly created environments. This agency has created successful and in many cases extremely popular sport fisheries with the use of such fishes as Florida largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides floridanus, northern largemouth bass M. s. salmoides, smallmouth bass M. dolimieu, channel catfish Ictalurus puncratus, striped bass Morone saxatilis, palmetto bass (white bass Morone chrysops x M. saxatilis), walleye Sander vitreus, rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, and red drum Sciaenops ocellatus. As this agency continues its work to maintain healthy aquatic ecosystems and fishing opportunities with increased demand, we expect that the use of propagated fishes may become even more important in the future. This paper discusses the various altered environments we have been charged to manage, the consideration of various sport fishes for these environments and the resulting sport Fisheries created through our use of native and nonnative fishes.																			0892-2284		1-888569-69-7				2004	44						177	187																WOS:000228130200015

From May to early July, coho (117-210 mm total length) were found inshore and in the epilimnion offshore and ate mostly winged flies, ants and beetles. In lake July and Aug. they were primarily captured in the metalimnion and selected some underyearling cisco (C. artedii) and numerous large, rare zooplankton. The latter included Chaoborus punctipennis larvae and pupae, Leptodora kindtii and Holopedium gibberum. Coho were captured mainly inshore in Nov. and consumed some underyearling cisco and adult hemipterans. Native cisco (129-260 mm) fed on small seasonally abundant zooplankton. Copepods (chiefly Cyclops bicuspidatus thomasi) reached peak abundance in May-June and Oct.-Nov., when they were the most important items in cisco stomachs. Cladocerans (especially Chydorus sphaericus, Bosmina longirostris and Daphnia spp.) reached peak abundance between June and Aug. and were then the most abundant items eaten by cisco in the metalimnion. Rotifers, which reached peak abundance in June, were rarely eaten by cisco.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1976	105	5					607	614		10.1577/1548-8659(1976)105<607:FHAPSO>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1976)105<607:FHAPSO>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1976CQ06300007

Organisms of these types were obtained from all sources tested. Twenty-four pure cultures were isolated, all of which were gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria exhibiting a considerable diversity of metabolic capability. Isolation of these obligate and facultative sulfur-oxidizing chemolithotrophs from the stromatolite and mat habitats indicates the possibility that these rod-shaped bacteria contribute to the oxidative phase of the sulfur cycle in these habitats, in addition to oxidation by phototrophs or Beggiatoa. Only four of the pure cultures could grow without salt, but all 24 showed significant halophily, some tolerating 3 M NaCl. Three novel isolates of NaCl-dependent, thiosulfate-oxidizing, aerobic and denitrifying obligate chemolithotrophs are described. In addition, a facultatively heterotrophic halophilic strain growing either methylotrophically on methylamine or chemolithotrophically on thiosulfate aerobically or with anaerobic denitrification was found.																			0149-0451	1521-0529				JAN-MAR	1991	9	1					41	49		10.1080/01490459109385984	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490459109385984													WOS:A1991HM54000004

In spite of the fluctuations in glucose uptake rate the estimation of the daily glucose uptake rate from a single sampling conducted at 10.00 h is justified. The same applies also for the primary production. Routine bi-weekly determinations of primary production and glucose uptake rate were conducted from Oct. 1976-July 1977. No correlations were found between glucose uptake rates and ambient concentrations of ATP, chlorophyll and glucose. The glucose uptake rate showed 2 distinct seasonal patterns: the period which was dominated by the Peridinium (Jan.-April) and the rest of the year. In the former period the percentage of glucose-C utilized out of the C formed in the water column by the photosynthetic activity, fluctuated between 1 and 9%, and in the latter period fluctuated between 5 and 37%. The yearly average was 11.1%, SD 9.8.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1979	9	4					329	338		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1979.tb01517.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1979.tb01517.x													WOS:A1979HC33500005
J	JACKSON, UT				JACKSON, UT			CONTROLLED SPAWNING OF LARGEMOUTH BASS	PROGRESSIVE FISH-CULTURIST												The spawning period of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) was greatly extended by the manipulation of water temperature. Adult bass removed from natural populations before spawning and maintained in creek water at ambient temperatures (9.5-19.5.degree. C), spawned within 1.5-11 days after being stocked directly into ponds with higher ambient temperature (average 23.degree. C). Spawning occurred in groups of fish stocked from 10 June to 6 Sept.-a significant extension of the average spawning season for northern populations. Upward temperature shock to stocked fish averaged 7.degree. C. Fecundity, percentage fertilization and percentage hatch were unaffected by the holding and stocking procedures. Some male and female bass spawned more than once under the thermal regime employed. Despite their origin from lake populations, stocked bass readily spawned in small ponds, demonstrating both the importance of temperature increases in inducing spawning and the adaptability of individual bass to new environments. Temperature-controlled spawning provides a means of scheduling bass reproduction in relation to not only favorable weather conditions but also the demand for young bass and the efficient use of manpower and facilities. The spawning concentration into short periods can also reduce the potential for cannibalism among bass fry by reducing age-related size differences.																			0033-0779						1979	41	2					90	95		10.1577/1548-8659(1979)41[90:CSOLB]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1979)41[90:CSOLB]2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1979GV99100016

Principal components analysis indicated that the backwater plankton community differed from that of the lake and was associated with the difference in H+ concentration. The species characteristic of the backwater stations were Mesocyclops edax, Diaphanosoma leuchtenbergianum, Diaptomus pallidus, Daphnia parvula and Tropocyclops prasinus mexicanus. Bosmina longirostris was the most abundant and common species in the lake during the study period. A seasonal change at the 3 lake stations in the crustacean community from one dominated by Cyclops bicuspidatus thomasi, Paracyclops fimbriatus poppei and Eucyclops agilis to dominance by B. longirostris and C. vernalis occurred. This seasonal change was coincident with increases in both in vivo fluorescence and H+ concentrations. The differences between the lake and backwater communities and between the early and late season communities of the lake stations were highly significant according to a discriminant analysis of the data.																			0003-9136						1979	85	4					465	481																WOS:A1979HC08200005

The determination of N gas evolved from 15N-labeled nitrate is based on the principle of isotope dilution. The gas evolved is spiked with unlabeled dinitrogen and the 15N-enrichment of the resulting gas mixture is measured by optical spectrometry. The amount of nitrate reduced to ammonia and organic N is determined simultaneously. Measurements on sediment from a shallow Danish lake indicated 1st order kinetics of denitrification with respect to nitrate concentration. Great seasonal variation of rate constant was found with maximum value in late Aug. This variation is probably governed by the pattern of accumulation of decomposable organic matter in sediment. Calculation based on measured rate constants and nitrate concentrations during the year indicate that approximately 10% of the total N loading of the lake is denitrified.																			0043-1354	1879-2448					1979	13	5					461	465		10.1016/0043-1354(79)90039-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(79)90039-3													WOS:A1979GU68400007

The lake is fed seasonally by waters of the Negro River, a blackwater river with low levels of nutrients and suspended solids (7 g m(-3)). However, some investigations have established that Lake Cristalino has a high sedimentation rate (0.4-0.5 cm year(-1)) similar to those in the alluvial floodplain lakes of the Amazonas River (suspended solids 200-300 g m(-3)). Sediment cores were taken during the low-water period and the trace-element composition and the natural radioactivity in the lake were examined. The results show a core (31 cm length) relatively uniform in concentrations of trace elements (Br, Ce, Co, Cr, Cs, Eu, Fe, Hf, La, Sc, Sm, Ta, Tb, Th, Yb and Zn), and the presence of Cs-137 in the first half. Concentrations of trace elements in Lake Cristalino sediments were not correlated with concentrations in the sediments of its parent river, the Negro River, or with concentrations in soils of the local area. However, significant correlation was found between the sediments of the lake and those of the Amazonas River. On the basis of these results, and water-level data at Manaus port, it is concluded that the lake occasionally receives variable amounts of sediment from the Amazonas River.

The study area is located in the south of the Mendoza province (Argentine). In 1980 it was declared a faunistic reserve and it constitutes a genetic bank of worldwide importance. This site represents a special environmental area for wild life, and it covers a diversity of habitats which can support many types of resident migratory species. Nearby of the occidental coast of this shallow body of water, there are many active oil fields. Contaminants from oil spills can enter the lake from river inflows, from runoff and from adjacent lands influenced by water body dynamics. Within the lake, contaminants are transported by convective currents, disperssive processes and many other complex phenomena that finally kill sensitive individuals or disturb nesting zones. Due to the scale and seasonal variability of the lake perimeter, the numerical simulation models are calibrated and updated by the use of satellital images. The final goal is to predict ecological impacts of petroleum contamination and to evaluate remediation actions proposed to overcome these impacts.																			0266-9838						1995	10	4					241	249		10.1016/0266-9838(95)00016-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0266-9838(95)00016-X													WOS:A1995UC28100002

Except in rare instances, such values must be drawn from existing surveillance data which may not reflect sampling strategies pertinent to the issue at hand. In particular, the time variant and nonlinear relationships between discharge and both suspended sediment and sediment-related parameters such as P cannot be captured in detail by surveillance data. Nevertheless, such data collected routinely by the Ontario [Canada] Ministry of the Environment accurately reflect the relative loadings both in terms of unit and total yields in 5 basins where detailed suspended sediment data are available. Although surveillance data underestimate the absolute values of suspended sediment loads calculated from detailed sediment information, these data do capture the relative monthly and seasonal contributions to annual suspended sediment load. A comparison of 3 methods for calculating annual unit and total loadings of suspended and solute components from surveillance information indicates that annual mean data convey information which is not significantly less adequate than monthly aggregations of data.																			0008-4077	1480-3313					1977	14	7					1555	1565		10.1139/e77-133	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/e77-133													WOS:A1977DP02300006

Calculated net primary production was near 0. Macrophyte net primary production was measured by harvesting the maximum biomass, and above ground values were between 420-1325 g ash free dry weight m-2, while below ground values were between 2480-8570 g ash free dry weight m-2. The reed swamps were mapped on aerial photographs, and the composition of the macrophyte vegetation was determined. A comparison of macrophyte vegetation in 1944 and 1972 showed a reduction in species diversity, especially of submerged species.

THE TIMING AND SUCCESS OF BREEDING ON 2 NEARBY LAKES ON THE SOUTHERN TABLELANDS OF NEW-SOUTH-WALES	AUSTRALIAN WILDLIFE RESEARCH												The breeding of black swans on 2 nearby lakes, 18 km apart, was documented over a 5-yr period. The lakes differed in physiography and in botanical features. The numbers of swans breeding and the timing of breeding differed markedly between the lakes and coincided with gross differences and changes in observed abundance in aquatic plants important as food for swans. Important factors affecting the selection of nest sites were social factors, security, the presence of an adequate substrate and materials to construct a nest and ease of access to water. within each breeding season the timing of laying often differed among nesting colonies on the 1 lake, apparently reflecting an influence from social factors in synchronizing breeding within a colony. Breeding success was poor, due evidently to failure of cygnets to survive in the 1st weeks after hatching and to desertion of eggs in nests. Failure of food supplies may be the main cause. The reproductive strategy of the black swan appears to be essentially opportunistic; the female is capable of laying repeatedly over an extended period, so that eggs are often produced at times that do not necessarily predict suitable conditions for either the survival of cygnets or even the completion of incubation.																			0310-7833						1982	9	2					261	275																WOS:A1982NX70300009
J	DUFOUR, P				DUFOUR, P			THE NATURAL AND HUMAN FRONTIERS OF THE EBRIE LAGOON SYSTEM - INCIDENCES ON THE HYDROCLIMATE	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The hydrology of the brackish and tropical lagoon Ebrie (Ivory Coast) is dominated by large exchanges with its boundary ecosystems: atmosphere, continent, ocean and human community. Allochthonous water input is equivalent to 20 times the volume of the lagoon basin. But it is spatially and temporally heterogeneous. The eastern regions are dominated by continental water flows, the central region is influenced by ocean and human wastes, while the western regions are relatively isolated from those different sources. Temporal variabilities of the exchanges contrast the hydroclimate which is characterized by a succession of 4 seasons. Small variations of 1 of the boundary ecosystems can lead to great perturbations of the lagoon climate, which explains considerable interannual differences. Lagoons and lakes are distinguished by a large difference of intensity of their exchanges with their boundary ecosystems.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1982	94	2					105	120		10.1007/BF00010889	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00010889													WOS:A1982PL80900001

No significant difference was observed in the annual yields of fish in the 3 habitats. Three of the 9 major families, however, gave higher yields in selected habitats. Characidae and Cichlidae were most abundant in the shore and surface and Bagridae in the shore and bottom. Catches of the Cichlidae in the surface were limited to areas where the mean depth was below 7 m. Analysis of variance showed no significant difference in the overall yields of fish among sampling areas located within the major strata of the lake. Although a general trend was observed in the seasonal yields of fish, with higher yields during low water, the variations were not significant either for the overall annual yields or among sets. The implications of these findings in relation to the mode of life of the major fish species and the stability of the fish population are discussed.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1978	58	3					233	244		10.1007/BF02346958	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02346958													WOS:A1978EX53300003

Sexual differences in size and morphology existed in all species. Sex ratio varied with species and season. There were more females than males in the population. Size at maturity varied from species to species, with the males attaining maturity at a slightly lower length than the females. Breeding condition was attained mainly during the rains in Eutropius niloticus, Schilbe mystus and Siluranodon auritus and in the dry and rainy seasons in Physalia pellucida. Spawning occurred once during the breeding season in E. niloticus and S. mystus and more than once during the prolonged breeding season in P. pellucida. Condition factors did not show any correlation with gonad maturation.

J	GUZKOWSKA, MAJ; GASSE, F				GUZKOWSKA, MAJ; GASSE, F			THE SEASONAL RESPONSE OF DIATOM COMMUNITIES TO VARIABLE WATER-QUALITY IN SOME ENGLISH URBAN LAKES	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Five diatom assemblages and their corresponding site groups were associated with the urban lakes. When treated as a single dataset, DCA and PCA grouped these diatom assemblages along an environmental gradient from circumneutral, dilute waters to strongly alkaline, concentrated, nutrient-rich waters. When treated as individual datasets, 75% of the known variance was explained by the first axis of DCA in all five diatom assemblages; this indicated the existence of a strong primary environmental gradient. The PCA results showed that the identity of this primary environmental gradient can be different for each assemblage. The statistical analyses showed that the physico-chemical gradients were continuous and not discrete. Nevertheless, fine-scale analysis can identify smaller, more precise species and site groups. Two types of species response could be identified within most subassemblages in the urban lakes: the first was a quasi-seasonal response and was characterized by a gradual rise to a peak relative abundance of one dominant or several co-dominant species which could be sustained for a period of weeks before a gradual decline. A quasi-seasonal response was sometimes interrupted by a storm response. The storm response was characterized by a sudden increase in the relative abundance of one or more diatom species following a storm, after which the species declined to pre-storm abundances within 7 days. The effects of urban runoff on the water quality of urban lakes can override the effects of true seasonal factors such as water temperature and day length on the relative abundance of species.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				APR	1990	23	2					251	264		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1990.tb00269.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1990.tb00269.x													WOS:A1990DA17800009

Phytoplankton, predominantly centric diatoms, living in upper hypolimnetic waters (50-100 m) at near light compensation depths, were markedly stimulated photosynthetically following additions of both, inorganic and organic nutrients. Synergistic effects following additions of silica and Fe, and of Fe and NTA [nitrilotriacetic acid], were most marked in comparison to untreated controls at these lower depths. An evaluation of spatial and temporal bioassay results, in view of the calcareous nature of the lake, suggests strongly that co-precipitation, nutrient adsorption onto the surfaces of monocarbonates, and the availability of suitable organic chelators regulate the pelagial phytoplankton photosynthetic potential in Lake Ohrid.																			0003-9136						1976	77	1					1	21																WOS:A1976BG19000001

J	WESTLAKE, DF				WESTLAKE, DF			COMPARISONS OF PLANT PRODUCTIVITY	BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS												The definitions, methods, standards and conversions needed to make significant comparisons are discussed. The selected criterion is the maximum average annual net productivity of organic (ash free) matter that can be attained over a large area. The net production is available for consumption after the plant has satisfied its respiratory needs. It is particularly important to correct aerial yields to total productivity by including underground material and to convert gross photosynthesis to net before making comparisons. Tabulated data include some conversion factors and the biomass and productivity of selected communities expressed in different ways. In the temperate zone the most potentially productive type of community is reedswamp (30-46 metric tons/ha/year). Coniferous forests and perennials under intensive cultivation may produce 25-40 tons/ha, while deciduous forests, uncultivated terrestrial herbs and cultivated annuals are less productive (10-25 tons/ha). In the tropics, rain-forests, reedswamps and perennials under intensive cultivation may produce 50-80 tons/ha and cultivated annual plants 25-35/tons/ha. The productivity of the phytoplankton of fertile oceans and lakes ranges from 1-9 tons/ha year, but only tropical or polluted waters exceed 3 tons/ha/year. Submerged macrophytes in freshwater may produce 4-7 tons/ha in the temperate zone, 13-21 tons/ha in the tropics. In the sea they may produce 25-33 tons/ha and 30-40 tons/ha respectively. Algae cultivated in sewage can produce up to 45 tons/ha, more in mineral media with carbon dioxide supplied. If plants could maintain their maximum seasonal productivity throughout the year, the annual production in the tropics might be 150 tons/ha. Otherwise, given a good soil structure and ample nutrients, there are 3 main ways of increasing useful yields; irrigation, use of plants maintaining an active cover all the year, and development of techniques to exploit new plants or parts of plants not normally harvested.																			1464-7931	1469-185X					1963	38	3					385	+		10.1111/j.1469-185X.1963.tb00788.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-185X.1963.tb00788.x													WOS:A19637250A00005

The walleye moved parallel to the shore and did not show a diel on-shore and off-shore movement pattern. Submerged projections on the lake bottom such as rock bars or spits tended to serve as boundaries of the ranges within which the test fish moved. Large movements of tagged fish coincided with extensive periods of heavy cloud cover and precipitation. Wind speed and direction also appeared to influence fish movement especially when the fetch was large. Marked daily changes in water temperature and dissolved O2 concentration did not occur and, thus, had little effect on the movement of test fish. There were slight seasonal changes in the extent of the daily movement of test fish, but the depth ranges shown by the tagged fish did not change greatly for each season.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1977	106	2					163	169		10.1577/1548-8659(1977)106<163:MOWSVI>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1977)106<163:MOWSVI>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1977DG03800007

Color and mesh sizes of gill nets, fishing in seasonal concentrations of fishes and baiting gill nets were tested to identify single and combined factors which enhance efficiency of nets for a variety of objectives in Elephant Butte Lake, New Mexico [USA]. Catch rates of 1-5 spp. of game, forage and commercial fishes [carpsucker, carp, smallmouth buffalo, channel catfish, walleye, white bass, large-mouth bass, sunfish, and gizzard shad] were significantly different (P < 0.10) in nets of any of 9 colors than they were in white nets. Seasonal differences occurred between multifilament and monofilament nets. Stretch-meshes ranging from 5.1-15.2 cm were selective for all species and the 3 groups of fishes. Selectivity changed linearly in 10.2-, 12.7- and 15.2-cm meshes; catches of commercial fish increased and those of game and forage fishes decreased with increasing mesh size. Concentrations of several species changed seasonally between upstream, middle and downstream thirds of the lake. Catch rates of commercial fishes in certain areas were 3 times those in other areas during certain seasons and averaged about twice as high during a year. Eighteen organic substances were tested as bait to attract fishes to the vicinity of gill nets. Most baits attracted several species, repelled several, or both. Investigations of selective harvest of river carpsucker and of all commercial fishes revealed that combinations of brown nets, 10.2-, 12.7- and 15.2-cm stretch-meshes, and fishing in seasonal concentrations of carpsucker and smallmouth buffalo resulted in catch compositions of 80-85% commercial fish. Tested and potential combinations of color, mesh size, fishing in seasonal concentrations and baits are discussed to show effects on selectivity and efficiency of gill nets and to demonstrate use of results for designing netting schemes to achieve various objectives.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1977	106	1					43	56		10.1577/1548-8659(1977)106<43:EOCMSF>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1977)106<43:EOCMSF>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1977CV88900005

In Ghana, a country with ail expanding population and high potential for economic growth, agriculture is an important resource. The high intensity seasonal rainfall coincides with the early growing period of crops such as maize, yam and cassava. Agricultural plots are very susceptible to high erosion rates, especially when on steep sided valleys in the region around the south of Lake Volta. Thus, accurate prediction of soil erosion is a necessity. The accuracy of soil erosion models is largely determined by the availability and quality of the sediment yield data used for calibration. A conceptual model based on the CALSITE model is being developed to run in the GRASS GIS package for use in Ghana. The model is being tested on a 14 km(2) basin southwest of Lake Volta, where streamflow, rainfall, soil moisture and sediment transport data were collected during September 2000.																			0144-7815		1-901502-42-2				2003		283					96	102																WOS:000189482300010

The recaptures by recreational fishing in boat and professionnal fishing with nets were evaluated for a batch of 15 900 one year old domestic brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) stocked in April 1988 (mean total length: 177 mm). They were respectively 3.8% (33 kg/1 000) for the professional fishing and 1.0% (20 kg/1 000) for the recreational fishing. In relation with a high growth rate, most of the catches have been realized quickly, at the end of the 1988 fishing season and at the beginning of the 1989 fishing season. The recaptures by professional fishing have been evaluated for a batch of 10 000 domestic brown trout (mean total length 179 mm) in comparison with a batch of 10 800 rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss W.) stocked in Lake Bourget in May 1990 (mean total length of 219 mm). The recapture rates were evaluated at 3.2% (20 kg/1 000) for the brown trout and 7.0% (42 kg/1 000) for the rainbow trout. For the rainbow trout, most of the catches have been realized very quickly during a short period at the middle and at the end of the 1990 fishing season. For the brown trout, most of the catches have also been realized during a rather short but later period (end of the 1990 fishing season and beginning of the 1991 fishing season). The stockings in May with one-year-old trout sustained effectively catches of lake dwelling trout in lake but with a rather poor return rate and in taking some ecological and sanitary risks. This suggests to mobilize the management efforts for the natural production of a renewable trout resource in Lake Bourget system.																			0767-2861						2003		369					1	16		10.1051/kmae:2003019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/kmae:2003019													WOS:000221764400001

We are studying frost boils that formed in lacustrine sediments in the Galbraith Lake area, north of Alaska's Brooks Range, and the heat transfer and phase change dynamics that maintain these features through seasonal cycles. These frost boils are distinctly visible at the ground surface, and are silty-clay upwellings that penetrate the surrounding organic soil. Sensors were installed in a vertical plane from the frost boil's center outward to measure soil temperature, thermal diffusivity, liquid water content and thermal conductivity. The temperature field, water content and thermal properties during freezing and the concomitant changes in ice content are examined and discussed with respect to frost boil mechanics.

Many of these perturbations, with periodicites ranging from similar to5 min to. several hours and horizontal scales of a few ten's of km to several thousands km, are due to freely propagating buoyancy (or acoustic-gravity waves), and forced tidal oscillations. Optical observations of the spatial and temporal characteristics of these waves in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) region (similar to80-100 km) are facilitated by several naturally occurring, vertically distinct nightglow layers. This paper describes the use of state-of-the-art ground-based CCD imaging techniques to detect these waves in intensity and temperature. All-sky (180degrees) image measurements from Bear Lake Observatory, Utah are used to illustrate the characteristics of small-scale, short period (< 1 hour) waves that are most frequently observed at MLT heights including a particular set of ducted wave motions, possibly associated with mesospheric bores. These results are then contrasted with measurements of mesospheric temperature made using a separate imaging system capable of determining induced temperature amplitudes of much larger-scale wave motions and investigating night-to-night and seasonal variability in mesospheric temperature.																			0277-786X	1996-756X	0-8194-4664-5				2003	4882						122	133		10.1117/12.463369	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.463369													WOS:000182689200015

The sediment transport model was modified to include optional shear stress, erosion, and deposition process algorithms. The model was validated against seasonal time-series of suspended sediment concentration and used to make six-month simulations of suspended sediment concentration for certain observed or proposed geometric configurations.																					0-08-044046-0				2003							1535	1539																WOS:000184938200372

Water samples were taken from rivers and lakes in the Greek territory. For each river two sampling locations were established, one near the border and one at the estuary region, in order to determine possible transfer of pesticides from neighbouring countries that the rivers studied cross before they enter Greece. For each lake samples were taken from two sampling points as well. The pesticides determined were belonging to different chemical groups, the organophosphorus and the organochlorine group. Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) followed by Gas Chromatography techniques with Nitrogen Phosphorus Detector (GC-NPD) and Electron Capture Detector (GC-ECD) were used for the monitoring of the selected pesticides and their transformation products. The obtained results showed which are the most commonly encountered pesticides, the mean concentrations and the stations that they occurred. Some of the studied molecules exhibited a continuous presence while other exhibited a sporadic occurrence related to agricultural and irrigation practices.

Chemical data indicated that the Pouto group lakes (Kanono, Waingata, and Parawanui) did not possess significantly higher nutrient levels than the Kai-iwi group (Taharoa, Waikere). Preserved phytoplankton from Lakes Kanono and Parawanui was mainly diatom-dominated; that from Lakes Waingata, Taharoa and Waikere consisted almost entirely of desmids and dinoflagellates. Evidence for increasing eutrophication in Lake Kanono came from the presence, though in small quantities, of the diatom Fragilaria crotonensis and blue-green algae including Microcystis aeruginosa and Aphanizomenon flos-aquae. Some lesser-known algae are described and illustrated. Several new records were made for the freshwater algal flora of New Zealand [Capartogramma crucicula and Phormidium rotheanum].																			0028-825X	1175-8643					1980	18	2					299	320		10.1080/0028825X.1980.10426927	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0028825X.1980.10426927													WOS:A1980KC39200015

SEASONAL-CHANGES IN THERMAL AND DISSOLVED-OXYGEN CHARACTERISTICS	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												The stratification characteristics of Lake Moondarra (24.degree.34''S, 139.degree.35''E), a man-made lake in northwestern Queensland, were studied. The lake approximates the warm polymictic type in which no persistent thermal stratification ever develops. During the cooler months, thermal stratification breaks down during the night; in the warmer months, the intense rainstorms prevent the establishment of a persistently stratified water column. The shallowness of the lake relative to its surface area and the prevailing environmental conditions ensure that extensive periods of O2 depletion do not develop in the water column. A strong and prolonged period of thermal stratification, with subsequent serious effects of the availability of dissolved O2 in the deeper layers, would only arise if, in a particular year, there were no significant rainstorms.

Heterogeneity in the horizontal and vertical dimension was studied in detail and the scale of variability was compared with within-sample and between-sample errors, and with seasonal fluctuations. Variability was greater in the sediment samples, and the coefficient of variation of samples taken at a single site was often as large as that between sites in a transect across the lake. Although this was not an exhaustive survey, the values provided should allow rough estimates to be made of the number of samples required to achieve a given level of precision in future investigations.																			0021-8847						1980	49	1					127	135		10.1111/j.1365-2672.1980.tb01050.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.1980.tb01050.x													WOS:A1980KK82200013

This lake is highly eutrophic, containing rich concentrations of nutrients, but the temporal distribution of phytoplankton was generally related to the variations of light and temperature. The effects of light and temperature are perhaps modified by nutrients, particularly when N and P are present in surprisingly low concentrations. The effect of mechanical disturbances in the artificial lake also has a significant effect on the growth of phytoplankton and indirectly on consumers, especially fish.																			0020-9309						1980	65	2					269	282		10.1002/iroh.19800650213	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19800650213													WOS:A1980KD54700006

For better utilisation of the natural resources, a study was conducted to determine the influence of the lake on the availability of soil water to plants along the lakeside slope. Two methods, one gravimetric and the other neutronic, were used to evaluate soil water content and its variation with time. Five access tubes were placed along the slope and were monitored during the study. The infiltration rate determined at three of the measuring sites was higher in the top soil layers than in the deeper soil layers. Drainage and redistribution data show a juxtaposition of two infiltration kinetics, the first being exponential and the second linear. The, extrapolation of the second kinetic (slow) to the start of drainage gave, for the first 600 mm of soil, field capacities of 154, 184 and 163 mm for sites T1, T3 and T5 respectively. These differences were specifically related to the porosity of the sites under study. An analysis of the soil water profiles showed that the soil moisture near the lake was always higher than the permanent wilting point. The influence of the lake was not apparent during the long rainy season because of the steady decline of the water table. The water availability then depended upon the rainfall distribution and the specific characteristics of each of the sites, especially soil texture and structure. A linear relationship was found between soil moisture estimated by the neutronic and the gravimetric methods with correlation coefficients ranging from 0. 80 to 0. 96. The data also showed that the neutron probe method did not systematically underestimate the soil moisture of the top layers. This response seemed to be associated with the fraction of coarse sand. As soil moisture increased, data from the neutron probe method converged toward the gravimetric data regardless of the site.																			0262-6667					APR	1994	39	2					95	108		10.1080/02626669409492727	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626669409492727													WOS:A1994NH79000001
J	ELLIS, CMA				ELLIS, CMA			BIOLOGY OF LUCIOLATES-STAPPERSI IN LAKE TANGANYIKA (BURUNDI)	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The predator L. stappersi (Centropomidae) is an important component of the pelagic fishery in Lake Tanganyika, Burundi, and an effective competitor of man for the valuable stocks of endemic clupeid [Stolothrissa tanganicae and Limnothrissa miodon] fish. Annual landings of Luciolates (400-1200 metric tons) vary widely, but the average catch has declined only slightly during 20 yr of purse-seine fishing. The major seasonal catch occurs in Jan.-April and includes predominantly mature fish; juveniles are taken year round but mainly in Aug.-Oct. Adults mature at around 210 mm fork length, and the period of maximum gonad development is Jan.-April. Eggs and fry are planktonic. Growth was not estimated reliably but length-frequency progressions suggest average rates of 5 mm/mo. for fish smaller than 100 mm, and 9 mm/mo. for larger fish. The maximum size of Luciolates is about 450 mm, but most mortality occurs by the time fish reach 350 mm. A cohort contributes to the fishery for 3-5 yr. Young fish eat zooplankton but after they grow past 130 mm they take clupeids almost exclusively. Form-and-function analysis helps characterize Luciolates as a swift predator. The species spends most of its life in the upper 30 m of offshore waters and can be attracted to light sources. The Burundi population may recruit from outside territorial waters.

Naupliar stages of C. microstaphylinus and P. schmeili were previously unknown; for the other 4 spp. earlier authors reported 5 naupliar stages. These species apparently all have 6 morphologically distinct naupliar stages, recognizable as clear modes in size distributions of larvae collected from the lake. Number of naupliar stages in C. staphylinus was confirmed by following development of isolated individuals. A survey of all available data on larval development in harpacticoids suggests that in marine and freshwater harpacticoids the normal number of naupliar stages is 6, as in cyclopoid and calanoid copepods. In the natural populations each naupliar stage had invariable patterns of setation and spinulation that were unaffected by varied rearing conditions. However, body size, lengths of setae and numbers of spinules were somewhat variable, and rearing experiments showed them to be dependent on temperature and other environmental conditions. Species identification was possible at all stages; the most useful single diagnostic feature seemed to be the armature of the prehensile terminal spine of the antennal endopodite.

Planktonic algae apparently formed the diet of nymphs < 4-6 mm and of larger nymphs if their preferred diet of periphytic algae was in short supply. Both depth distribution and individual size of the nymphs were closely related to the distribution of periphytic algae. Depth distribution patterns of the nymphs revealed a peak between 2-4 m below the surface. The dimensions of the nymphs and the duration of the aquatic stages (3-4 mo.) in Lake Kainji correspond closely with results obtained elsewhere, as does the mean percentage of males in the population (28% .+-. 10%). Seasonal fluctuations in the sex ratio were apparently caused by variations in the intensity of predation.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1979	67	2					161	172		10.1007/BF00126715	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00126715													WOS:A1979HY12600008

Mist treatments were applied only on days of relatively high evaporative demand, and irrigation frequency was determined by soil moisture tensiometers. In seasons of relatively low soil moisture stress the mist effects masked those of irrigation where the treatments were combined, but in seasons of high soil moisture stress and high evaporative demand the mist and irrigation effects combined to give the best yields of prime grade fruit. Both irrigation and misting reduced water stress and their effects were additive in this respect as well as on cropping; this supported the concept that environmental and physiological (cropping) stresses are additive, the reduction of environmental stress permitting the tree to withstand a higher cropping stress, and vice versa. Misting increased fruit bud production, decreased fruit set/100 flower clusters, and increased fruit number per tree but did not affect fruit size or relative trunk growth rate. Irrigation increased fruit size and relative trunk growth rate but not fruit number per tree. Both mist and irrigation improved fruit quality by reducing rough russet and fine cracking. Misting with lake water practically eliminated bitter pit, but this advantage was offset by a deposit of CaCO3 on the fruit that could be removed by dilute citric acid solution. Misting with pure water also reduced bitter pit significantly in 2 yr out of 3 without apparently improving the Ca level in the fruit or affecting fruit size. Irrigation consistently reduced soft rots. The relative effectiveness of misting and irrigation could not be compared in terms of the amount of water used because individual trees were misted and each application of mist was dispersed very rapidly away from the treated trees.																			1462-0316	2380-4084					1979	54	1					1	11																WOS:A1979GL59100001

Determinants of phytoplankton growth are investigated. The mean yearly areal standing crop and primary productivity were 94.2 mg/m2 chlorophyll a and 127.2 mg C/h per m2, respectively. Annual production was 557 g C/m2. High non-algal light attenuation resulting from wind-induced turbulence accounted for 58.3% on average. Growth of the phytoplankton was not nutrient-limited. Irradiance, temperature and turbulence were the factors that controlled growth.																			0020-9309						1979	64	5					643	659																WOS:A1979JD42800004

The isolated heterotrophic, nitrate-reducing bacterial flora were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Throughout the year 8 population cycles of nitrate-reducing heterotrophs occurred simultaneously at both horizons, which related to changes in the nitrate and dissolved O2 content of the water. Nitrite producers were most numerous during the isothermal and early thermally stratified periods of the lake water, particularly when the nitrate content was rising. The qualitative analyses indicated seasonal variation in the bacterial populations isolated on the culture media and the dominant taxonomic groups could be related to the nitrate and dissolved O2 content of the lake water. Pseudomonas, Moraxella/Acinetobacter, Flavobacterium/Cytophaga, Aeromonas and Enterobacteriaceae were the principal taxonomic groups in the Grasmere heterotrophic, nitrate-reducing flora. Aeromonas with, possibly, Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae are implicated in lowering the nitrate content of Grasmere water at 20 m depth when it becomes anoxic.																			0021-8847						1979	46	3					507	520		10.1111/j.1365-2672.1979.tb00850.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.1979.tb00850.x													WOS:A1979GY77700014

Analysis of the historical data has produced statistically (P .ltoreq. 0.05) homogeneous zones for a variety of surveillance parameters. In the present study, weekly sampling within one of the zones was performed at multiple depths. Analysis of the chlorophyll a, total phosphorus, and nitrate + nitrate nitrogen data indicated that differences as great as 20% can occur between samples taken at one metre versus a zero to twenty metre integrated value. Comparison of various monthly scenarios obtained from the weekly samples indicate that not only are the estimates and the description of seasonal cycles altered, but spurious trends can be established. Annual differences in mean concentrations as great as 35% can occur due to sampling artifacts.

Parallel photosynthetic 14C-fixation assays were also made. As well as the seasonal cycle of N2-fixation dependent upon the summertime presence of the heterocystous cyanophyte Anabaena oscillarioides there were other fluctuations in fixation rate. For each assay occasion the N2-fixation rates through the water column were strongly correlated with light attenuation and less so with heterocyst numbers. Inorganic nutrient nitrogen and temperature had little influence. The relationship between N2-fixation, light, and heterocysts was variable with time, and was interpreted as being influenced by small scale vertical changes in physiological environment, particularly of the light field. Approximate estimations suggested that N2-fixation was not a major contributor to the lake''s daily nitrogen requirement (0.03-2.0%) nor to the total annual nitrogen budget (23-24% of the supply from the surface influent), in spite of the occasional occurrence of high fixation rates at some water depths.																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1985	19	2					139	150		10.1080/00288330.1985.9516080	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1985.9516080													WOS:A1985ARE2200003

Commercial and recreational fishermen in Louisiana must abide by a 279.4-mm minimum total length restriction during a year long season. A total of 10,226 channel catfish were caught in 1,033 net days during both phases of the study. In Phase 1, 25.4-, 28.6-, and 31.8-mm (bar) mesh hoop nets were fished. For all channel catfish total lengths, the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of the hoop nets in Phase 1 increased with the decrease in mesh size of the hoop nets. There was no significant difference in the CPUE of lengths >279.4 mm among all 3 mesh sizes. CPUE of lengths <279.4 mm for the 25.4-mm mesh net (6.6) was significantly greater than the 31.8-mm mesh net (0.2). In Phase 2, 25.4-mm mesh hoop nets were altered with placement of 2 different size escape rings to provide 3 more variations of hoop nets. The total catch CPUE Of the hoop nets in Phase 2 decreased with an increase in the size of the escape rings and with an increase in the number of escape rings placed in the tail of the net. The only significant difference found in the CPUE of lengths >279.4 occurred between the 25.4-mm mesh net with 4 large rings in the tail (10.3) and the 31.8-mm mesh net (4.6). The CPUE of lengths <279.4 mm in the 31.8-mm mesh net (0.3), the 25.4-mm mesh net with 8 large rings in the tail (8.2), and the 28.6-mm mesh net (8.4) were significantly less than the 25.4-mm net with small escape rings (20.3). There were no significant differences between the 28.6-mm mesh net and the 25.4-mm net modified with large rings. The total catch of the 31.8-mm mesh hoop net consisted of only 7.7% channel catfish with total lengths less than or equal to 279 mm. Sixty-nine percent of all channel catfish caught in the 25.4-mm mesh hoop net were less than or equal to 279 mm total length. The addition Of escape rings to the 25.4-mm mesh net reduced its catch of lengths less than or equal to 279.4 mm by 22% in the most successful of the modified nets, the 25.4-mm mesh net with 8 large rings in the tail. This study shows that hoop net regulations could be used to Selectively harvest length groups of channel catfish.																									1994							542	549																WOS:A1994BJ69M00064

It is concluded that the fauna is different in many respects from that of similar habitats outside Australia.																			0067-1940						1966	17	2					177	+																WOS:A19668675000005
J	LEAN, DRS				LEAN, DRS			PHOSPHORUS KINETICS IN LAKE WATER - INFLUENCE OF MEMBRANE-FILTER PORE-SIZE AND LOW-PRESSURE FILTRATION	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												Radiotracer kinetics using carrier-free 32P-PO4 were conducted on samples of water from Heart Lake, Ontario [Canada]. Results obtained using 0.45 .mu.m membrane filters were compared with those for 0.1 .mu.m at vacuums of 400 mm Hg and to those for 0.45 .mu.m filters using very low-pressure (4 mm Hg) filtration. The difference between 0.45 and 0.1 can reach 8-20% of the total radioactivity during the 1st 10 min of the experiment. After 60 min the fraction removed by 0.1, but not 0.45 .mu.m filters, declines to only of the total radioactivity, but this may represent as much as 50% of that which goes through 0.45 .mu.m. The low-pressure filtration techniques provide similar results to those for normal filtration when kinetics were monophasic. Later in the season, the low-pressure method was shown to provide confusing artifacts that were explained by the hypothesis that tiny filaments extend from the surfaces of some species of aquatic algae and bacteria and are often dislodged during filtration.																									1976	33	12					2800	2804		10.1139/f76-332	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f76-332													WOS:A1976CM60200013

Texas. With the frac-pack technique, operators have fracture-stimulated six wells (new drills and workovers) in the past 3 years as part of an overall facility upgrade, Gas is injected daily into the Frio formation (5,500 ft) of the field and withdrawn at high rates during peak demand periods. A strong waterdrive can "water-out" production at the end of peak-season gas withdrawal, The water recedes when withdrawal is ended and injection restores gas volume and pressure in the reservoir. The paper presents frac-pack installation techniques, performance comparison of conventional methods and frac packs. and completion-technique selection to achieve high production efficiency. New wells that were completed with frac packs in 1994 have yielded rates up to 100 MMcf/D each with approximately 500 psi drawdown pressure, In 1995, a well capable of producing at 25 MMcf/D with a gravel pack was recompleted with a frac pack, which increased its rate capacity to 49 MMcf/D. Because of the performance of the first three wells, three more wells were completed with frac packs in 1997. The frac-pack completion bus proven superior to other sand-control methods of providing high-rate deliverability in the West Clear Lake field. Frac-pack completions have, in general, provided a two-fold increase in the daily production rate, Frac-pack completions and recompletions can be applied in gas-storage wells where high production rates and sand-control measures are necessary for the life of the well. This paper provides guidelines and results associated with frac packing by Demonstrating the importance of selecting completion techniques that will provide high-efficiency production from gas-storage wells. Presenting case histories of frac-pack-stimulated gas-storage well performance over a relatively long time period. Comparing well performance of conventionally completed and frac-pack-completed gas-storage wells producing at high rates.

The carbon excretion rate varied from 0.01 to 0.5 mg C .cntdot. m-3 .cntdot. h-1 and depended primarily upon the rate of its photosynthetic assimilation. The carbon excretion rate varied generally between 2 and 5% of photoassimilated carbon and exceptionally exceeded 6%. These values were underestimated from part of heterotrophic reassimilation. The study of the carbon balance over 24 hours has shown that night excretion represents less than 10% of losses due to respiration. Heterotrophic activity measured by 14C glucose assimilation exhibited seasonal variations following the same general pattern as excretion. The quantity of phytoplankton excretion products appeared to be superior to the needs in organic compounds of heterotrophic organisms in the trophogenic layer.																			0036-7842					OCT 15	1986	48	1					18	33																WOS:A1986E506500002
J	ERNST, DEW				ERNST, DEW			COMMENTS ON FLUOROMETRIC CHLOROPHYLL DETERMINATIONS IN THE FIELD	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The in-vivo-chlorophyll-fluorescence of algae at 680 nm is quenched by the electron transport chain of photosynthesis. Hence the potential turnover of the chain can be estimated by observing the fluorescence difference between the blocked (with CMU) and unblocked chain (.DELTA.FCMU). The fluorescence of the blocked chain (FCMU) should give a measure for the total chlorophyll-a content. These correlations were tested in a limnocorral-experiment in August 1980 in lake Steinhuder Meer [West Germany] (shallow, .hivin.z = 1,35 m, eutrophobic) with a particularly designed field fluorometer and found to apply rather good: FCMU versus total chl-a: r=0.95, .DELTA.FCMU versus primary productivity over total quantum flux: r = 0.83. The results do not cover changes in physiological state or species composition as would be expected between different regions, seasons or lakes. Colony forming algae show deviations due to selfabsorption. The fluorescence methods require calibration by classical method, however, they are simple, quick, and cheap and apt for automatization.																			0003-9136					OCT	1986	107	4					521	527																WOS:A1986E774900006

The passage period depended on temperature and was from 10 h at 22.6.degree. C to 108 h at 4.0.degree. C. On the average, the food weight in fish caught in particular seasons of the year ranged from 0.02 g (0.02.permill. of fish body weight) at the end of Sept. to 28.47 g (32.54.permill. of fish body weight) in June. The diurnal food ration calculated according to the modified equation of Bajkov (1935) was between 0.03.permill. (in Sept.) and 117.13.permill. (in June) of fish body weight. The feeding intensity of silver carp generally increases with the temperature rise and decreases with its drop. During the year the fish consumed .apprx. 8800 g of food each, of which > 90% was consumed during the 3 warmest months of year. Feeding coefficients calculated on the basis of the estimated food rations and body weight of fish increase fluctuated between 7.89 and 24.65. The coefficients obtained for the period between the fish stocking and mid-Aug. (19.19) and between the fish stocking and the end of Sept.

J	CANTRELL, MA				CANTRELL, MA			BILHARZIA SNAILS AND WATER LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS IN A TROPICAL SWAMP	OIKOS												The snail, Bulinus globosus (Morelet), intermediate host of the [human] biharizia parasite, Schistosoma haematobium, is common in the marginal swamps of Lake Chilwa, Malawi. Most snails live in the marsh on the periphery of the Typha swamp; an unstable habitat which is seasonally inundated during each rainy season when the shallow lake expands. Water level fluctuations are important in affecting the distribution and abundance of B. globosus. When the lake rises, snails move actively with the advancing margins along canoe channels cut by fishermen and disperse into the marsh to lay eggs on lily leaves (Nymphaea sp.). Later in the year, the lake recedes and the high juvenile mortality is related to mating of marsh plants and low levels of dissolved O2 in the water. Eventually, snails are confined to the deeper canoe channels which act as reservoirs from which colonization of the marsh occurs during the next rainy season. Heavy rains delay the recession of the lake and improved juvenile survival leads to the large increases in snail numbers observed periodically.																			0030-1299	1600-0706					1981	36	2					226	232		10.2307/3544451	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3544451													WOS:A1981LG65700014

Lake Hoare and Lake Fryxell are located on opposite sides of, but share drainage from, the same piedmont glacier. Lake Fryxell is the more eutrophic of the 2 lakes. The polyurethane foam (PF) substrates were initially colonized by autotrophic Sarcomastigophora which were succeeded by Ciliophora. Colonization data were fitted to the MacArthur-Wilson model. Of 15 in situ colonization field experiments in these lakes, 11 agreed with the MacArthur-Wilson model. Artificial substrates placed on benthic algal mats in Lake Fryxell possessed more protozoan taxa at equilibrium than sponges from any other habitat. Late season limnetic PF units in Lake Fryxell were colonized faster and had the best fit to the MacArthur-Wilson model in comparison with any other site. The limnetic community is a greater source pool for potential colonizers than previously recognized in these non-turbulent polar lakes. Lake Hoare PF units had fewer total taxa at equilibrium than sponges from similar habitats in Lake Fryxell. Colonization rates were slower in both lakes and had fewer taxa at equilibrium in comparison with temperate lakes. Differences in equilibrium values and colonization rates between these Antarctic lakes and temperate lakes can be explained by the smaller pool of protozoan taxa, lack of water turbulence within these permanently ice-covered high latitude lakes and the constant cold temperature. Antarctic lakes, as aquatic habitats subjected to unusual stresses caused by the high latitudinal climate, provide valuable laboratories for the study of unifying ecological concepts.																			0003-0023						1982	101	4					353	367		10.2307/3225754	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3225754													WOS:A1982PR99800006

Seasonal change in the particulate organic constituent was evident. High values of the concentration of the particulate organic constituents were found in the samples from July-Sept. of 1979 and March-April of 1980 when Microcystis aeruginosa and diatoms bloomed, respectively. Low values were observed in between these seasons. Sephadex gel-filtration of the water extractable organic materials of the particulate samples was followed by further chemical analyses; there was indication that the accumulation of reserved carbohydrates consisting of only glucose occurred in the particulate samples of the blooming periods of diatoms and blue-green alga, which were calculated to be low values of POC/chlorophyll a. Both of the diatoms and blue-green alga found in March-April of 1980 and July-Sept. of 1979, respectively, are regarded as active growing cells. Seasonal changes in the organic composition of the particulate matter are discussed with the environmental factors of inorganic nutrient concentration and intensity of solar radiation received in this lake at the time examined.

J	SWEENEY, DW; LAMM, FR				SWEENEY, DW; LAMM, FR			TIMING OF LIMITED IRRIGATION AND N-INJECTION FOR GRAIN-SORGHUM	IRRIGATION SCIENCE												When subsurface irrigation sources are lacking in humid and subhumid regions, high yearly precipitation may allow for storage of surface water in farm ponds and lakes for irrigation. Irrigation at selected growth stages may avoid critical stress for crops with some drought tolerance, such as grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]. Because grain sorghum is responsive to N, injecting fertilizer N through the irrigation system also may improve production. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of timing of limited-amount irrigation and N fertigation on grain sorghum yield; yield components; grain N content; and N uptake at the 9-leaf, boot, and soft dough stages. The experiment was conducted from 1984 to 1986 on a Parsons silt loam (fine, mixed, thermic, Mollic Albaqualf). The experiment was designed as a 6 x 2 factorial plus two reference treatments. Six timings for irrigation were targeted at the 9-leaf (9L), boot (B), soft dough (SD), 9L-B, 9L-SD, and B-SD growth stages. N application systems were either 112 kg N ha-1 surface-banded preplant or 56 kg N ha-1 preplant and 56 kg N ha-1 injected through the irrigation at a rate of 28 kg N ha-1 per 2.5 cm of irrigation. Two reference treatments included were one receiving N but no irrigation and one receiving neither N nor irrigation. In 1984, irrigation generally increased grain sorghum yield by nearly 1 Mg ha-1. However, yield was not affected by selection of irrigation timing, N application method, or the interaction of the two factors. This was partly because early irrigations increased kernels/head, whereas later irrigations increased kernel weight. Above average rainfall during the growing season, especially just prior to the 9-leaf, boot, and soft dough growth stages, resulted in no irrigations in 1985. In 1986, yield was increased by early (9-leaf) irrigations as compared to soft dough irrigations. Early irrigations resulted in higher kernels/head; however, rainfall after the soft dough irrigation may have masked any treatment effect on kernel weight. As in 1984, N application method did not affect grain sorghum yields, even though yield was reduced to less than 3 Mg ha-1 with no N nor irrigation. In both 1984 and 1986, N uptake at succeeding growth stages appeared to respond to irrigations made at previous growth stages. Injecting half of the fertilizer N through the irrigation system did not affect N uptake compared to applying all N preplant. The lack of response to fertigation may be related to the low leaching potential of the soil used in this study.																			0342-7188					SEP	1993	14	1					35	39																WOS:A1993MB59300006

Species abundances in weekly samples taken from June-Dec. 1976 from the 3 sites were ordinated. Paths through species space describing temporal changes in community structure indicated that the tube B community oscillated around some average composition and was dominated by small zooplankton, whereas those from tube A and the tarn changed quite distinctly through the season and had higher predator densities. The observed differences in seasonal cycles could be related to variations in the intensity of predation, the quality of food for herbivorous zooplankton and the dynamics of nutrient input. The importance of considering time variation in lake properties, particularly in assessing lake responses to stress and in typing lakes for experimentation or management, is emphasized.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1980	69	1-2					139	146		10.1007/BF00016543	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00016543													WOS:A1980JM32400017

C. erythrocephalus Muls. and C. solitus Weise are junior synonyms of C. distigma (Klug). C. rufoplagiatus sp. nov., allied to C. distigma, is described from the shores of Lake Victoria, and the Oriental species C. nigritus (F.) is recorded from the African mainland for the 1st time. C. distigma is found in the savanna and steppe areas of Africa and C. schioedtei in the forest and adjoining zones. Comparative studies suggest that, although C. schioedtei has a higher fecundity, it is not displaced by C. distigma as, unlike the latter, it is unable to breed under hot dry conditions. Comparison of host records for these 2 spp. show that C. distigma is not restricted to feeding on Diaspididae, as is C. schioedtei, but that otherwise the range of hosts and associated plants is similar for both species. The potential of these species and C. nigritus for use in biological control is discussed and it is suggested that C. schioedtei is only suitable for trial in tropical areas without a dry season, but that C. distigma and C. nigritus may be useful under a wider range of conditions.																			0007-4853	1475-2670					1977	67	2					259	270		10.1017/S000748530001107X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S000748530001107X													WOS:A1977DP11400007

In 1976, incubation attention of 2-egg and 3-egg clutches started early and late in the season was measured with a 20-pen event recorder. Chlorinated hydrocarbon residues [e.g., DDE and polychlorinated biphenyls] in eggs were assessed in 2 yr. Nest density was greater, clutch initiation more synchronized and hatching success higher at 1 of the colonies. Hatching success and fledging success were independent of clutch size but early nesters were more successful than late nesters. Differences in hatching success between 2-egg and 3-egg clutches were a function of time of clutch initiation such that the clutch size with the greater proportion of its nests in the early period had a higher hatching success. The reproductive success of the Lake Erie colonies was intermediate among rates reported for other Great Lakes colonies but below those of most eastern North American or European colonies. There were no significant differences in the incubation attention between 2-egg clutches and 3-egg clutches or between early and late 3-egg clutches. Most clutches were incubated greater than 95% of the time although clutches incubated less than 75% realized the same hatching success.

The diet was analyzed from stomach contents using the frequency of occurrence, numerical and gravimetric methods. Fish sex affected occurrence, number and weight of food items. The relative importance index (RI) indicates that diet varied seasonally. There was also a noticeable switch from insectivorous habits in small fish (less than 18 cm) to herbivorous feeding habits in larger fish. The ability of the fish to evolve trophic strategies that ensure optimum foraging despite seasonal changes can account for its success in the lake.																			0034-7744					MAR	2002	50	1					233	238											12298250					WOS:000177384200028

The mean annual composition of the phytoplankton assemblage by number for the study period was 33% cryptomonads, 24% diatoms, 16% chrysophytes, 16% blue-green algae and 10% green algae. Phytoplankton biomass was low throughout each year (range, 0.09-0.66 g/m3), resembling values previously reported from Lake Superior. Pennate diatoms contributed 60 to 80% of the total biomass from Dec. to April and in July. Phytoflagellates consisting of chrysophytes and cryptomonads accounted for 35% of the biomass throughout the 2-yr study.																			0380-1330						1983	9	4					523	529		10.1016/S0380-1330(83)71925-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(83)71925-8													WOS:A1983RS94500009
J	FULTON, W				FULTON, W			QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE VARIATION IN THE MACROBENTHIC FAUNA OF THE ORIGINAL LAKE AND NEW LAKE AREAS OF GREAT LAKE AND ARTHURS LAKE, TASMANIA	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Faunal variation between sample sites in Great Lake and Arthurs Lake, using both qualitative and quantitative data, was analyzed. Cluster analysis and principal coordinates analysis showed that the fauna of the original lake areas of both lakes is distinct from the fauna of the newly flooded areas. Closer relationships exist between the faunas of the old level of the 2 lakes than between the faunas of the old and new levels within either lake. The distinction is not attributable to depth but may be of the old and new levels within either lake. The distinction is not attributable to depth but may be influenced by substrate differences. The effects of abnormal fluctuations in water level on benthic fauna are discussed. Biomass variation between the sample sites was examined in relation to component species groups. The sites at the old level were dominated by oligochaetes whereas chironomids contributed most to the sites at the new level. Consistent seasonal peaks were evident in the biomass at sites at the new level but not at sites at the old. The mean annual biomass levels (wet weight) for Great Lake (13.9 g m-2) and Arthurs Lake (35.9 g m-2) are compared with recorded values for other Australian and overseas lakes. Biomass levels of Australian lakes in general are also discussed.																			0067-1940						1983	34	5					787	803																WOS:A1983RM94700008

Bass from opposite shores (Susquehanna = west, Northeast = east) were tagged from 1991-1993 and tracked for 4-15 months (1991-1995) depending on battery life. Mean home range of Susquehanna bass (246 ha, N = 16) was larger than non-migratory Northeast bass (119 ha, N = 18) but the difference was not significant. Mean home range (2140 ha) of 4 migratory Northeast bass that made an annual spawning migration across the Bay was significantly different than the mean home ranges for the Northeast, Susquehanna, and pooled groups (178 ha). Mean home range for all groups (119-2140 ha) was much higher than home range sizes reported in the literature for freshwater lakes and impoundments (0.01-21 ha). Our results suggest that observed differences in home range sizes between freshwater and tidal systems are related to tidal influence and/or some correlate in the habitat. As opposed to freshwater systems that generally provide a relatively stable and predictable environment, largemouth bass in tidal systems are influenced by daily, lunar, and seasonal tidal fluctuations, seasonal and weather related brackish water influx, and seasonal and storm event related freshwater inflow.																									2002							17	25																WOS:000189400700002

Eleven wellfields are operated as an integrated system using a set of simulation - optimisation - demand (S-O-D) models giving priority to minimisation of environmental impact while reliably meeting municipal water demands subject to a set of regulatory and transmission constraints. This management program, Optimised Regional Operations Plan (OROP), has been in effect since January 1999 and is used to produce a prioritised production schedule for 172 wells in 11 inter-connected facilities on a bi-weekly basis. The OROP database is updated as data become available from various sources including the agency's environmental and hydrological monitoring programs, the national weather service rainfall stations, and water production information; some of which are automatically relayed through a Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. The main components of the Integrated Surface and Groundwater (ISGW) modeling programs (HSPF and MODFLOW) are public domain codes that have gained widespread acceptance within the water resources/environmental engineering community, However, a substantial portion of the computer codes that communicate information across the two models were independently developed and tested. In addition, the unique hydrologic conditions of west-central Florida including a seasonally high water table which responds quickly to hydrologic inputs, numerous environmental features such as wetlands and lakes, and highly variable rainfall, coupled with the use of emerging technologies provide a recipe for contentious debate as to the adequacy of ISGW. Among the issues to resolve and develop consensus are preferred methods to represent various hydrologic processes, data interpretation and representation, model conceptualisation, model refinements, various operational constraints and a whole host of other issues related to ecosystem protection that are included in a work plan to be addressed in order for the S-O model to gain acceptability by the stakeholders. OROP implementation has brought to light many interesting issues in model application and acceptability that merit consideration in large-scale water management operations. This paper will present the modeling framework and discuss the underlying real-world data and technical issues in order to improve communication and understanding among the parties involved. Recommendations are also made for model development and application that improves chances for operational acceptability and institutional support for implementation.																			1568-1238		1-4020-0600-4				2002	8						185	199																WOS:000177207900010
J	Katayama, S				Katayama, Satoshi			Coexistence of resident and anadromous pond smelt, Hypomesus nipponensis, in Lake Ogawara	FISHERIES SCIENCE												Pond smelt, Hypomesus nipponensis, inhabit fresh, brackish, and oceanic waters, and support substantial commercial fisheries in Japanese lakes. Pond smelt in Lake Ogawara, northern Japan, display a bimodal body length distribution during the spawning season, despite being 0+ fish. Analyses of otolith microstructure and microchemistry were utilized to discriminate anadromous from resident individuals, and revealed that individuals smaller than 60 mm SL were resident, those between 60-80 mm were mixed resident and anadromous, and those larger than 80 mm were anadromous. Intensive research on the reproductive ecology identified spawning localities in the lake and inflowing rivers. Although only anadromous fish spawned in inflowing rivers, spawners in the lake were a mixture of anadromous and resident individuals, suggesting that anadromous and resident spawning groups share a common spawning ground. These fish spawn during almost the same period from mid March to early May. Therefore, reproductive isolation does not appear to occur, and genetic differentiation has not been found through isozyme and mtDNA analyses. The anadromous and resident life history styles appear to be ecological variations within a single population. Lastly, qualitative and quantitative contributions of migratory and non-migratory pond smelts to the next generation were examined and heterogeneity in the life history of this population was discussed.																			0919-9268						2002	68			1			33	36		10.2331/fishsci.68.sup1_33	http://dx.doi.org/10.2331/fishsci.68.sup1_33													WOS:000207780600005

They are poisons and can be particularly dangerous when misused and/or applied without card. Although certain characteristics of pesticides are well known, their final characteristics after they reach a waterbody ire extremely difficult to estimate. Regarding the soil and water environment, it is necessary to conduct both a field study and laboratory analysis. Such a study has been performed in the catchment area of Dalyan Lagoon, Turkey, joining the Mediterranean Sea, that was selected as the pilot region, The input of pesticides, transport in soil and transfer to the water environment together with their probable impacts on water quality are determined by conducting detailed field surveys and water residue analyses. Within the scope of the study, the behavior and fate of pesticides both in soil and water are investigated in detail. Water residue experiments are conducted on four sets of water samples representing the seasons of the year 1999-2000 for the pre-selected 6 pesticides. Two sets of water samples (surface and bottom) are taken from the 16 stations along the lagoon channel-and two lakes within the catchment area. The results and findings show the significance of the use of pesticides as they exist in the water environment around and/or slightly above the limits stated in the national current regulations except dichlorvos which presents very high values compared to its tolerance limit. Of particular interest, the results are used to enlighten the farmers and the public and increase awareness of pesticides as contaminants in valuable coastal waters.

J	ORTH, DJ				ORTH, DJ			COMPUTER-SIMULATION MODEL OF THE POPULATION-DYNAMICS OF LARGEMOUTH BASS IN LAKE CARL BLACKWELL, OKLAHOMA	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The computer simulation model described predicts year-class strength, production and yield of largemouth bass (M. salmoides) populations. It is an age-structured, deterministic model with numbers, average weights and lengths, biomass, yield in weight and numbers, and gross and net production as state vectors. Mortality from egg to age 1 is estimated by a multiple regression equation. Water level during spawning and water level fluctuation since the end of the previous growing season are predictor variables. Predictions of year-class strength, production, and yield compare favorably with estimates made in previous studies on Lake Carl Blackwell. Sensitivity analysis indicates that predictions of production, yield and catch (numbers) are most sensitive to variation in rate of mortality from egg to age 1. Growth rates of the younger age-groups are next in importance in predicting production, yield and catch. The model may be useful for predicting year-class strength, population trends and the response of largemouth bass populations to minimum length limits, water level fluctuations or manipulations and supplemental stockings.

P. tenuis ate significantly more snails when D. polychroa was absent. In the field, interspecific competition for snails between these 2 triclad species was a more powerful process than any social feeding by P. tenuis on snails captured by D. polychroa. Feeding on snails as a group by P. tenuis and P. nigra in the habitat where the 2 triclads co-existed was of a similar magnitude and this was also true of their feeding on the common snail species and genera. Approximately 10% of the triclads gave a positive reaction to snail antisera. Feeding on snails by P. nigra in the 3 habitats lacking D. polychroa was similar in extent and did not differ from that of P. tenuis. P. nigra would be similarly affected by the presence and absence of D. polychroa as shown for P. tenuis. No definitive seasonal pattern was detected in the incidence of feeding upon snails by either Polycelis spp. but this may have been obscured by seasonal changes in the detection period of snail antigens due to temperature effects. There was some evidence that such feeding increased during the period when small snails were present in the population.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1979	9	4					357	367		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1979.tb01520.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1979.tb01520.x													WOS:A1979HC33500008

Cloud-free data were acquired during the months of May and December 1989. An image processing approach and regression model were used to convert the grey-level digital numbers of the APT imagery into temperature values. A third-order polynomial equation was successfully used to convert the digital numbers into temperature values with a high coefficient of determination (r2 = 0.98). The satellite-derived temperatures for Lake Okeechobee were correlated with ground-truth temperature measurements (r2 = 0.74). The results of this study indicate that APT data are capable of being converted into lake surface temperatures with acceptable accuracy. Results of paired t-test and variogram analyses indicate that the temperature uniformity of the lake varied with the season, space, and time of day.																			0143-1161					MAY 10	1993	14	7					1325	1337		10.1080/01431169308953959	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431169308953959													WOS:A1993LM52200005

This species is also a notorious weed of disturbed habitats. Life history parameters of clones from 24 Irish populations of R. repens from ruderal, marsh and turlough (temporary lake) habitat types were measured in an experimental garden across a growing season. Mother rosettes with a greater number of leaves produced a greater amount of primary stolons. Ramet production was higher in plants that produced a greater number of secondary and tertiary stolons. Growth and production of vegetative and sexual offspring did not vary with habitat types from which the clones were derived. High variability was evident between clones for all parameters measured. The extent and success of colonization by this species is therefore highly dependent on the productivity of the initial pioneer.

Spawning occurred in late May and early June; the average length of the season was 25 days. Females spawned only about 50% of their ova; large ova were shed during spawning and smaller ova were retained and resorbed by late July or early Aug. Maturation of new ova for the following year''s spawning began in early Aug., when only primary oocytes were present in the ovaries. The number of ova produced by fish of a given length declined progressively from 1969-1971. Fecundity was more directly related to length than to age of fish. Condition factors for both sexes were highest in Nov., remained high through May, declined after spawning and reached an annual low in Aug. Percentages of total weight contributed by gonads were highest in May and lowest in Aug. for both sexes. Percentages of total weight contributed by mesenteric fat were highest in Aug. and Sept. and lowest in June.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1977	106	1					67	76		10.1577/1548-8659(1977)106<67:RCAFOW>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1977)106<67:RCAFOW>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1977CV88900008

J	BERMAN, T				BERMAN, T			LIGHT PENETRANCE IN LAKE KINNERET	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The characteristics of light penetrance in Lake Kinneret, Israel, were observed from 1970-1973. Light measurements were made concurrently with those of algal speciation and biomass, chlorophyll .alpha. concentrations and primary production. Vertical extinction coefficients of green light (filter VG9), the most penetrating spectral component, ranged from 0.15 (Aug. 1970) to 0.93 ln [log normal] units m-1 (April 1970), reflecting the large differences between algal standing crops in non-bloom and bloom seasons. During the dinoflagellate bloom (Peridinium cinctum f. westii) from Feb.-June, the increment of extinction coefficient per unit increase of chlorophyll .alpha. concentration was 0.006 ln units mg-1 m2. The uneven vertical distribution of algae at this period caused irregularities in the depth curves of light penetrance. At other times, when the phytoplankton cells were more homogeneously dispersed with depth, regular light penetrance curves were observed; however, as previously noted (Rodhe, 1972), attenuation of algal photosynthetic activity often appeared to be regulated by the blue spectral component (filter BG 12).

This is due to the fact that the loss of Nile flood water flowing into the lake was compensated for by excess drainage water. This water is fertile. The concentrations of the nutrient salts, being high, varied within a very limited range before and after the cessation of Nile flood. However, the range of chlorosity was changed. In 1963-1964, it was 0.9-18 g Cl/l compared to 0.7-15.3 in 1967 and 0.5-12.0 in 1973. The non-excavation and blocking of the lake-sea connection during the last periods hindered the free water exchange between the sea and the lake causing these variations of chlorosity. The seasonal and annual variations of chlorosity are controlled mainly by the invasion of sea water into the lake driven by the prevailing wind. Because of the shallowness of the lake, water temperature is correlated to air temperature by 2 equations.																			0003-9136						1978	84	3					339	367																WOS:A1978GF15300003

Although almost all species were found to feed on a variety of foods, with consequent dietary overlaps, quantitative analysis of the results showed that distinct preferences for specific food types considerably ameliorated the effects of such overlaps. Partitioning within the major food categories, differences in relative population sizes, spatial and temporal differences in feeding and shifts in diet following inputs of seasonally occurring foods, all tended further to reduce effective competition between species. The results are discussed in the broader content of colonization of the Pongolo system by a tropical fish community in circumstances where the principles of island biogenography may be expected to apply.																			0254-1858					OCT	1988	23	4					356	369																WOS:A1988R827700016

The results include the vertical and seasonal changes in the concentration of DCHO, seasonal change in the standing stock of DCHO, seasonal change in the ratio of DCHO/DOC and correlation. The concentrations of DOC, ammonia, reactive phosphate, Chl-a and seston were positively and nitrite and nitrate were inversely correlated with the concentration of DCHO at p = 0.01 level. The present study has confirmed that the combined effect caused by primary producers, secondary producers and decomposers controls the vertical and seasonal changes in the concentration of DCHO in the lake. Among them especially heterotrophic bacteria having two faces as suppliers and consumers of DCHO seem to be key organisms determining whether it occur net production or net consumption of DCHO at a given time, and in consequence, determining in situ concentration of DCHO.																			0003-9136					JAN	1986	105	3					299	319																WOS:A1986A051800004

Although year to year comparisons were made on a qualitative level due to the limitations in the data, some consistent seasonal features of the spatial distribution were evident. The location of zones of higher concentration were attributed to proximity to large urban areas and lake currents. The contribution of fecal coliforms to the total coliform concentration was examined with the conclusion that, at the low total coliform concentrations (.ltoreq. 30/100 ml) observed in much of the lake, there is no relationship between the 2 concentrations but, over a broader range, fecal coliforms increase with total coliform concentrations and, at very high total coliform concentrations (.gtoreq. 1000/100 ml), fecal coliforms are always present. The analysis demonstrates the value of examining observed and fitted distributions to compare subsets of a large collection of data and a clustering procedure which is generally applicable to data consisting of counts.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1984	111	2					133	146		10.1007/BF00008626	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008626													WOS:A1984SQ38000008
J	YUAN, HW				YUAN, HW			POSSIBLE EVIDENCE OF DOUBLE-BROODING IN COMMON TERNS (STERNA-HIRUNDO) AT ONEIDA LAKE, NEW-YORK	COLONIAL WATERBIRDS												Double-brooding is not common in the Laridae. Only three species in this family have been reported to double-brood: Silver Gull (Larus novaehollandiae), Common Black-headed Gull (Larus ridibundus), and Common Tern (Sterna hirundo). I present seven instances of double-brooding by Common Terns at Oneida Lake, New York, in 1988 and 1989. Ten chicks hatched from six of the second broods, and six of them survived greater-than-or-equal-to 10 days. The higher frequency of double-brooding in 1988 may have been due to abundant food supply and fair weather. Each double-brooded pair except one had their second brood on a different island than their first brood. I think this is because vegetation on the first island became tall and dense, and was not suitable for nesting late in the breeding season. My results support the idea that double-brooding may be a viable reproductive strategy for Common Terns.																			0738-6028						1993	16	1					83	87		10.2307/1521560	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1521560													WOS:A1993LJ07200011

Electrofishing at other locations along the Illinois shoreline produced no marked fish, indicating that fish were not moving along the shoreline and out of the sampling area. The size of the electrofishing samples did vary with season and fewer fish were caught in July and August, suggesting that they did move into deeper water. On the basis of the difference between the Petersen and Schnabel methods, mortality of fish was small. The maximum likelihood measurements of population size were 1042 for 1998 and 1227 for 1999 and recruitment of fish less than 200mm for 1999 was 75%.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				JUN	2001	16	2					317	319		10.1080/02705060.2001.9663816	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2001.9663816													WOS:000169035500017

Pike hosted 18 spp. of metazoan parasites [Proteocephalus pinguis, Tetraonchus monenteron, Triaenophorus crassus, Contracaecum brachyurum, Diphyllobothrium sp., Raphidascaris sp., Triaenophorus nodulosus, Centrovarium lobotes, Crepidostomum farionis, Piscicola milneri, Cyathocephalus truncatus, Metechinorhynchus salmonis, Spinitectus gracilis, Ergasilus luciopercarum, Glaridaeris catostomi, Salmincola extensus, Argulus canadensis] and glochidia larvae T. monenteron and P. pinguis made up over 84% of metazoan parasite numbers. Some parasite species exhibited definite patterns of abundance with host age and season resulting from changes in host diet and behavior. No differences in parasite abundance existed between host sexes. Ranking of parasite abundances was significantly different between 2 sampling sites only 2 km apart as a result of intermediate host distribution. Impoundment could change pike parasite levels. An initial decrease in parasite numbers could be followed by a rapid increase.

This supply of the vitamin to the photic zone was accompanied by increasing biomass of Dinoflagellates, Bacillariophyta and Chlorophyta. The decrease in the vitamin concentration, followed by an increase, is correlated with a decline and subsequent rise in the algal biomass, respectively.

J	WHITE, E; DOWNES, MT				WHITE, E; DOWNES, MT			PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT OF NUTRIENT LOADS ON LAKE TAUPO, NEW-ZEALAND	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Lake Taupo is an oligotrophic lake of 612.4 km2 and 97 m average depth, situated in a catchment of 2849 km2 on the Central Volcanic Plateau of the North Island of New Zealand. Annual loads of reactive P and inorganic N were estimated from aerial, surface stream and groundwater seepage sources. The specific surface load for P of 0.189 g .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. y-1 suggests a mesotrophic status, but the N load of 1.073 g .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. y-1 fits the observed oligotrophic condition of the lake. The overall ratio of N to P in the inputs was only 5.68:1. Most of the P is derived from natural sources, and in general greater quantities leave wooded land (covered with native forest, pine plantations, and scrub) than leave mostly pastoral areas. The major N loads originate from 1 part of the catchment. Substantial variations in nutrient loadings and ratios in surface flows occur seasonally, with variations in flow rates and between sub-catchments. Obvious associations between sub-catchment nutrient loads and vegetative cover were not found. The low ratio of N to P in inputs to the lake suggests that N may prove to be an important growth-limiting nutrient. Variable climate is likely to affect nutrient ratios and loading estimates for lakes without major sources of man-made pollution.																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1977	11	2					341	356		10.1080/00288330.1977.9515681	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1977.9515681													WOS:A1977EG17900010

The black bullhead preyed upon a wide range of food sources in the limnetic, littoral and benthic zones and seasonal differences in diet occurred in response to availability of prey species. The total food volume in stomachs of 558 black bullheads (143-304 mm total length) comprised about 32% planktonic crustaceans, 25% chironomids, 27% fish, 9% crayfish, 2% filamentous algae and 5% miscellaneous organisms. Planktonic crustaceans made up 94.4% and chironomids made up 5.6% of the volume of food ingested by 220 young-of-the-year black bullheads. Black bullheads were most selective for the largest cladocerans available, Leptodora kindtii, Daphnia pulex and D. galeata mendotae, and for Chironomus spp. pupae. Black bullheads were least selective for Diaphanosoma leuchtenbergianum, copepods and chironomid larvae. The black bullhead in Lake Poinsett was primarily a selective planktivore throughout its life history.																									1976	33	4					768	775		10.1139/f76-094	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f76-094													WOS:A1976BL39800015

Five sites in the study area were sampled by malaise traps and by netting about the head with an insect net. Comparisons were made of 4 community and 4 population parameters. No significant difference existed between the species richness of the community of flies sampled by each method, but malaise traps sampled the tabanid community with greater diversity and evenness than did netting. The species composition of the community trapped by each method differed substantially. Hybomitra and Tabanus were sampled in significantly greater numbers by malaise traps while netting favored the dominant Chrysops species. Seasonal niche breadths, seasonal ranges and seasonal distributions were measured concordantly by each sampling method. Neither trapping method should be used alone in studies concerning the entire tabanid community, but can be used effectively together.

Fish were trained to feed at a disk lit with 'orange-yellow' light. Their ability to discriminate this training colour from others was then tested. Fish from a stream population were more accurate than those from a lake population and females more accurate than males. We cannot be completely sure the fish discriminated on colour rather than perceived brightness, though we tried to control for the latter. There were no significant differences in the times taken to perform the tests. We suggest the different visual environments in the two habitats have selected for different visual abilities. As males and females spend most of the year in shoals together, it is argued that the difference between males and females has evolved because of the females' need to discriminate between males' sexual displays during the breeding season. The results show that a fish's sex and perhaps its population of origin should be considered in tests of visual ability.																			0005-7959					AUG	1992	122		1-2				78	87		10.1163/156853992X00318	http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/156853992X00318													WOS:A1992KE40000006

Based on this data, diffusive fluxes, sedimentation and net burial rates have been calculated and yearly and seasonal mass balances were established. The lake sediment appears to be an efficient sink for As but not for Sb. Under average conditions, only 1% of settling As undergoes recycling, whereas 60% of Sb is released into the deep water and half of the released Sb mixes into the epilimnion. A flood event in 1994 resulted in an extensive sedimentation of As and Sb. Flux calculations indicate that Sb is readily recycled whereas As is deposited in the sediment resulting in an enriched layer.

J	Güss, S				Güss, S			Cyclo-stationary maximum cross-covariance analysis for exogenously forced environmental systems	ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL STATISTICS												The response of an ecological system to external forcings shows marked seasonality and complex time delays. In order to take seasonality into account, the assumption of stationarity inherent in most statistical models for time series is replaced here by more flexible cyclo-stationarity. To describe the dominant modes of the cross-covariance structure of the system and the forcing, temporal (orthonormal) patterns are derived. They are estimated by a singular value decomposition of the cyclo-stationary sample cross-covariance matrix. These patterns allow to formulate a prediction scheme for the system once the forcing is known. The method has comparatively little tendency for multi-collinearity, so that it is well applicable also for multivariate settings and shorter data records. The method is illustrated for an aquatic ecosystem with distinct phases of a biological succession.																			1352-8505					DEC	2000	7	4					385	404		10.1023/A:1026523632608	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1026523632608													WOS:000165638100004

Absolute and relative population estimates of 8 spp. [Hydraena britteni, H. palustris, Limnebius aluta, Helophorus strigifrons, Hydrobius fuscipes, Anacaena limbata, Enochrus coarctatus, E. testaceus] were compared by means of regression analysis, the relative estimate being considered as the dependent variable. Only 3 statistically significant correlations were found, but a correlation always seemed to exist and the relative estimates are considered as crude estimates. To obtain better ones when studying several species in 1 habitat much work is required, and then the advantages of the simple relative method disappear. The different sizes of the species were evaluated as sources of errors affecting the relative estimates. The estimates of the smaller species were more affected than the larger ones. Relative population estimates would gain much if compared with independent absolute estimates. This seems to have been done rarely with invertebrates in aquatic habitats. Behavioral extraction methods might be applied to several aquatic animal groups in eulittorals and littorals, saving much time compared with mechanical methods or hand sorting.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1976	6	2					81	87		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1976.tb01593.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1976.tb01593.x													WOS:A1976BM81400001

The drifting of the larvae increased markedly at night and showed a definite diel periodicity with maximum numbers usually in the early hours of the night. Seasonal peaks in the density of larvae in the drift frequently occurred in months when adults, and especially pupae, were present. Most drifting larvae were in the 4th and final instar, and their drift rate usually increased when they were searching for suitable pupation sites.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1977	7	4					403	407		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1977.tb01688.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1977.tb01688.x													WOS:A1977DS27400011

Data are given on the food of lake trout of legal size (17 inches or longer) by year, season, and depth of water, and on the relation between food and size among smaller lake trout. Fish contributed 96.7 to 99.9% of the total volume of food in the annual samples. Ciscoes (Coregonus spp.) were most common (52.2 to 87.5% of the volume) in 1950-53 and American smelt ranked first (65.6% of the volume) in 1963. Insects ranked second to fish in occurrence (9.6% for the combined samples) and crustaceans followed at 3.9%. The greatest seasonal changes in the food of lake trout were among fish caught at 35 fathoms and shallower. The occurrence of Coregonus in the stomachs increased from 34.6% in Feb.-March to 71.1% in Oct.-Dec. Smelt were in 76.9% of the stomachs in Feb.-March but in only 2.2% in Oct.-Dec. Cottidae, Mysis relicta, and insects were most common in the July-Sept. collections. Crustaceans (mostly Mysis and Pontoporeia) comprised more than 70% of the total volume of food for 4.0- to 7.9-inch lake trout but their importance decreased as the lake trout grew larger. As the lake trout become larger, the importance of fish grew from 4.4% occurrence at 5.0-5.9 inches to 93.9% at 16.0-16.9 inches. Smelt were most commonly eaten by undersize lake trout.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1965	94	2					169	+		10.1577/1548-8659(1965)94[169:FOLTIL]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1965)94[169:FOLTIL]2.0.CO;2													WOS:A19656983500007
J	Székely, BE; Székely, HZ				Székely, BE; Székely, HZ			Organization of the environment and natural methods for wastewater treatment in Hungary	ICID JOURNAL												Hungary is concerned in an increased degree by the environmental problems arising all over the world since our country is about to join in EU. Analysis of the present situation of purification of waste-water and sludge treatment in Hungary shows that, in the future, the greatest problem is sewage treatment of small communities (capacity < 1000 m(3)/d). If both the waste-water is biologically decomposable and the environmental conditions make it possible, to apply natural purification method is reasonable. The following systems for natural purification of waste-water are in operation in Hungary: 1. Waste-water purificatory lakes Capacitiy of Hungarian systems is between 150 and 10 000 m(3)/d, their purification efficiency is satisfactory but is considerably influenced by seasonal variations. Their planning parameters depending on the environment should be made more accurate. 2. Rooting zone purificatory systems Method for waste-water purification using uliginal plants, developed by Kitchkuth, tends to be used in Hungary also. Th first equipment was established in Kaconlak in 1995 which has 260 inhabitants. Purification efficiency of the equipment is 85 % referred to BOl(5). 3. Waste-water utilization systems using poplars Gyula and Zalakaros can be shown as instances for purification of waste-water in soil. Purification efficiency of waste-water utilization systems using poplars is 90 - 95 % referred to BOl(5). 4. Waste-water utilization (irrigation) in agricultural areas A sewage irrigation system has worked in the waste-water purification settlement of Kecskemet town in a magnitude of..??...m(3)/d. Crops and ornamental plants has been grown in the area without damage of the environment. The settlement is not in use nowadays but it has social-economic reasons not technical. The GIS is an important resource in application of natural waste-water utilization methods and selection of the areas. As a summary it is to be said that there are experiments to apply methods for natural purification of waste-water in Hungary but in addition to the scientific background, environmental political and economic urging is needed to make them general.																			0971-7412					AUG	2000	49	3					87	101																WOS:000088955600006

The models have been used to simulate the dynamics of water quantity and quality at Batchawana Watershed, Canada, a sub-basin of the Turkey Lakes Watershed. The computed results are compared with observed data for a four-year period (Jan. 1981-Dec. 1984). The models exhibit a significant range in the ability to simulate the daily, monthly and seasonal changes present in the observed data. Monthly watershed outflows and lake chemistry predictions are compared to observed data. pH and ANC are the only two chemical parameters common to all four models. Coefficient of efficiency (E), linear (r) and rank (R) correlation coefficients, and regression slope (s) are used to compare the goodness of fit of the simulated with the observed data. The ILWAS, TMWAM and RAINS models performed very well in predicting the monthly flows, with values of r and R of approximately 0.98. The ETD model also showed strong correlations with linear (r) and rank (R) correlation coefficients of 0.896 and 0.892, respectively. The results of the analyses showed that TMWAM provided the best simulation of pH (E = 0.264, r = 0.648), which is slightly better than ETD (E = 0.240, r = 0.549). and much better than ILWAS (E = -2.965, r = 0.293), and RAINS (E = -4.004, r = 0.473). ETD was found to be superior in predicting ANC (E = 0.608, r = 0.781) as compared to TMWAM (E = 0.340, r = 0.598), ILWAS (E = 0.275, r = 0.442), and RAINS (E = -1.048, r = 0.356). The TMWAM model adequately simulated SO4 over the four-year period (E = 0.423, r = 0.682) but the ETD (E = -0.904, r = 0.274), ILWAS (E = -4.314, r = 0.488), and RAINS (E = -6.479, r = 0.126) models all performed poorer than the benchmark model (mean observed value).

A phytoplankton assemblage collected from a nearby reference area of Georgian Bay was incubated in translucent polyethylene cages, with 10-mu-m mesh (1985) and 1-mu-m mesh (1987) "windows." The "windows" facilitated exchange of dissolved substances between the caged phytoplankton and the exterior water. Incubations were for 5-day periods in April, June, and August of 1985 for 4 days in June and August of 1987. Each incubation included three replicates. Although the phytoplankton species composition of the inoculum differed between years and between April, June, and August within a year, the response of caged phytoplankton was highly reproducible. In all cases, the biovolume of caged phytoplankton appeared to respond to the quantity and availability of nutrients in the ambient water (outside the cage) and highly significant positive correlations between phytoplankton biovolume and phosphorus were observed. Yields of caged phytoplankton per unit total phosphorus at the Penetang Bay incubation site were relatively constant seasonally and reflect the importance of a constant source of available phosphorus in treated sewage effluent. In contrast, phytoplankton yield per unit total phosphorus ranged over nearly two orders of magnitude at the Severn River site and was apparently related to seasonal changes in hydrology and associated changes in availability of phosphorus in land drainage.																			0380-1330						1992	18	1					3	10		10.1016/S0380-1330(92)71269-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(92)71269-6													WOS:A1992HP68100001

There was a modest 12% net increase in wetlands in impounded areas, but much of the wetland vegetation changed from seasonally flooded, nonpersistent and persistent emergents to shallow, open-water areas. An unimpounded, downstream reference area had drier plant communities, probably resulting from reduced flooding. The loss of shallow vegetated wetlands could have significant impacts on both water quality functions and waterbird populations. The overall project goal of increasing numbers and diversity of waterfowl was met, but waterfowl numbers and species composition changed more because of transplanting and nest-box programs than habitat modifications. Although impacts on birds of shallow wetlands such as rails and songbirds were not quantitatively assessed, it is likely that the numbers of such birds were reduced because their preferred habitats were reduced markedly. Use of smaller, lateral impoundments and increased management for emergents would diversify waterbird populations and increase dabbling duck production.																			0277-5212					DEC	1991	11	2					245	262		10.1007/BF03160852	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF03160852													WOS:A1991GW19800005

J	VOTH, RD; CHRISTENSON, DR				VOTH, RD; CHRISTENSON, DR			EFFECT OF FERTILIZER REACTION AND PLACEMENT ON AVAILABILITY OF MANGANESE	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Mn deficiencies are a serious problem in crop production on some high pH soils of the lake bed regions of Michigan and Ohio [USA]. Some fertilizers banded near the seed increase Mn availability. Several factors have been suggested to be responsible for this increased availability. A series of laboratory incubation, greenhouse and field studies were conducted to evaluate fertilizer reaction and Mn sources on availability of Mn to sugarbeets (Beta vulgaris L.), soybeans (Glycine max L.) and navy beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). The incubation study showed that fertilizer sources which produce an acidic reaction initially increase the level of DTPA (diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid) and 0.1 N H3PO4 extractable Mn in the soil contiguous to the fertilizer band. After 7 wk of incubation, H3PO4 extractable Mn levels were not significantly different for the various fertilizer treatments. The level of Mn extracted with DTPA after 7 wk for the fertilizer sources was: DAP [diammonium phosphate]-Urea .cntdot. KCl > control = MAP [monammonium phosphate]-Urea-KCl > NH4NO3-MCP .cntdot. KCl = (NH4)2SO4-MCP [monocalcium phosphate] .cntdot. KCl. The greenhouse study was conducted on a Tappan loam (Typic Haplaquepts) and consisted of a 24 factorial set of treatments with N sources of urea and (NH4)2SO4, N and P (MCP) placements of mixed and banded and Mn levels of banded Mn and no Mn. Banded MCP was as effective as banded Mn in increasing Mn availability (extractable and plant uptake). Banded Mn along with banded MCP was much superior to either factor alone. N source and placement had small and variable effects on Mn availability and were largely masked by the Mn and P placement treatments. Field studies were conducted on 7 soil types to test the effect of fertilizer and Mn sources and showed the following order of tissue Mn: MnSO4 = MnO (100 mesh) > oxysulfate (partially acidulated MnO) = Mn-EDTA = control. Tissue samples taken within 5 wk of planting had higher Mn concentration for a NH4NO3-MCP-KCl (acidic) fertilizer than for the urea-DAP-KCl (basic) fertilizer. However, when oxidation of the NH4-N in the basic fertilizer was more complete, the difference diminished. When Mn deficiencies occur early in the growing season, use of an acidic fertilizer in combination with MnSO4 or finely divided MnO would be helpful in elimination of the problem.																			0002-1962	1435-0645					1980	72	5					769	773		10.2134/agronj1980.00021962007200050019x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1980.00021962007200050019x													WOS:A1980KK65200018

Marked differences were noted in vertical distribution and diel migration of the four instars. Diel and seasonal changes in timing of ascent and descent of larvae appeared to be controlled by subsurface illumination. Results from observations of vertical migration of different instars held in experimental tubes housed in a darkroom corroborated those of the field. Complete, three-phase migration cycles were induced by artificially changing natural light intensity over the experimental tubes during midday. These and other experiments suggested that the diel vertical migration of the larvae was an exogenous rhythm controlled by light.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1966	11	2					164	+		10.4319/lo.1966.11.2.0164	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1966.11.2.0164													WOS:A19667752500003
J	Duckstein, L; Bogardi, I; Fogel, M				Duckstein, Lucien; Bogardi, Istvan; Fogel, Martin			An event-based stochastic model of phosphorus loading into a lake	ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES												In most lakes, phosphorus (P) is the nutrient controlling the trophic state. Thus, for effective control of eutrophication, the uncertainty in P-loading should be encoded as a probability density function (pdf). Specifically, the pdf of P-loading Y from non-point agricultural sources is sought by means of an event-based stochastic model. P-loading events are triggered by precipitation events (X-1, X-2, T), in which X-1 is the rainfall amount, X-2 the duration, and T the interarrival time between events. (X-1, X-2) are dependent random variables, while T is assumed to be exponentially distributed. The precipitation event causes runoff, which carries dissolved P into the lake with a concentration C-1 and sediment yield, Z, which carries fixed or sorbed P into the lake in a fraction C-2 of Z. Seasonal loading of P is calculated by adding random numbers of random variables. The model accounts separately for dissolved P and sorbed P. Explicit expressions are given for the mean and variance of each type of P-loadings. The case study of a subwatershed of Lake Balaton, Hungary, is used to illustrate the methodology. Precipitation data, empirical rainfall-runoff-sediment yield relationships and a small number of observations of events are used to calibrate the model and estimate the means and variances of loading per event and per season. Then a simulation method is used to estimate complete pdf of these random variables. Use of the model for alternative methods of controlling P-loading is briefly discussed, as well as the economics of control.																			0309-1708					DEC	1978	1	6					321	329		10.1016/0309-1708(78)90013-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0309-1708(78)90013-1													WOS:000208565300003

There was insufficient time for pike to have colonized beyond the lower reaches of the River Derwent, and the Kirkham Priory to Malton gorge in its partly downcut state proved a barrier not just to the pike, but to the prey species which had to penetrate into and become established in the Derwent headwaters and the lake at Star Carr, before the pike could become established. This combination of circumstances resulted in the absence of pike in the Vale of Pickering during the occupation at about 9000 years BP.																			0305-4403	1095-9238					1978	5	1					85	89		10.1016/0305-4403(78)90020-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0305-4403(78)90020-1													WOS:A1978EX07800006

The facility is about 30 feet (similar to 9 meters) above the Kuskokwim River shoreline on shallow permafrost. The active-layer generally varies from 3 to 6 feet (similar to 1 to 1.8 meters) in depth. The top of permafrost ranges from 3 feet (similar to 1 meter) to over 50 feet (similar to 15 meters) below ground surface. Terrain features include sparsely vegetated tundra with low vertical relief, and areas with depressions occupied by shallow lakes. Fuel-spill secondary-containment is a regulatory requirement as well as an industry standard practice. Our containment design uses a natural permafrost barrier combined with synthetic and soil lining systems to prevent release of fuel to the surrounding environment. Ditch and culvert drainage networks divert surface-water to a catchment basin. Dewatering wells located in the tank farm pump ground-water to the catchment basin. The basin is pumped free of collected, sheen-free, water as needed; or as seasonal conditions permit. A water balance of precipitation, recharge, and pumping in the facility area were calculated Weather records, surface- and ground-water pumping data, and site hydrologic data provide input for the water balance. Dewatering analysis indicates it is better to remove recharge from the containment area by surface pumping. This reduces the requirements for ground-water dewatering wells. Controlling drainage and concentrating runoff to central collection points improves surface pumping efficiency.

The increasing use of woody perennials in agricultural fields, living snow fences, windbreaks, and riparian areas has important watershed management implications for agricultural watersheds in northwestern Minnesota. These changes in land use could lead to reductions in annual water yield, annual flood peaks, and dry season flows, with reduced non-point source pollution of streams, lakes and ground water. Where woody crops become an important part of a watershed, we expect a reversal of hydrologic changes on agricultural lands that have resulted from wetland drainage and extensive annual cropping that has taken place over the past century.																									2000		13					339	342																WOS:000089528000053

Cyanides were also determined spectrophotometrically after distillation from the acidified samples, and complexation in moderate acidic solution with barbituric acid. The dynamic ranges were 0 - 100 mug L-1 for total phenols and 0 - 30 mug L-1 for cyanides. The above methods were applied in the analysis of river, lake and stream waters collected from Northern Greece. The seasonal and spatial variation of concentrations was evaluated by two-way ANOVA. Background levels (4 - 12 mug L-1 for total phenols and 0.3 - 3 mug L-1 for cyanides), were found in almost all surface waters, with some exceptions.

A dam raised the lake level by 3 m. The water was diverted primarily to the Nelson River system and its hydro stations. The increased water level changed the character of SIL. Flooding inundated the forest around the lake and the biomass that was flooded began to decompose. This study has two parts. First, we develop estimates of the flooded biomass and outline some consequences of the flooding. About 4,500 metric tonnes of biomass entered the water of one small bay of SIL. Secondly, we review the project and emphasize the need for comprehensive planning involving environmental and social scientists.																			1180-4009					JUN	1991	2	2					217	226		10.1002/env.3770020207	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/env.3770020207													WOS:A1991HE81200006

Significant declines in shorebird numbers were noted between 1967-1971 for species that fed at pools on the beach, but not for species that fed along the interface between the beach and Lake Erie. It is suggested that a change in Lake Erie''s water level was the most important factor causing the variations in shorebird numbers at Long Point.

EVALUATION OF APPROACHES FOR CORRECTING HISTORICAL COLORIMETRIC DATA	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL												Historical colorimetric sulfate data are known to be biased high and cannot be used as reliable SO42- concentrations for scientific interpretation. They need to be corrected. The various approaches for correcting these data were discussed and evaluated. A simple and direct approach was found to be satisfactory. To correct historical colorimetric data, data sets are first categorized and grouped together based on geographical locations and seasonal variations of dissolved organic carbon (or color) of a specific site, river, lake (or groups) which have similar amounts and nature of organic matter. For each group, the colorimetric and chromatographic sulfate values are then obtained and related by an equation, which is used to convert the corresponding historical values to "true" sulfate values.																			0160-4120	1873-6750					1987	13	3					261	270		10.1016/0160-4120(87)90138-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0160-4120(87)90138-3													WOS:A1987K687500005

The relations between these variables and their responses to seasonal changes in water temperature were analyzed. A close relationship in seasonal patterns of algal primary production and bacterial secondary production was observed, with the estimated rates of bacterial production similar to that obtained by other authors in eutrophic lakes. Bacterial production was 17 to 46% of the primary production, thus, at 60% assimilation efficiency, the bacterioplankton would consume 28 to 77% of the total fixed carbon.

Results showed that in Cancun trihalomethanes occurred always in chlorinated samples. Incidence and concentration of trihalomethanes were related to repeated chlorination, water supplies and rain season. In Guadalajara, for similar concentrations of residual chlorine, trihalomethanes production was associated to the water source being increased specially in water from Chapala lake and Lerma-Santiago River.

The forest edge formed a distinct ecological barrier rarely crossed by species on either side of it. Catches were concentrated in daylight hours, in 2 peaks, a morning peak at 09.00 h and an afternoon peak at 16.00 h (sun-time) for all birds combined, although there were slight species differences. Most bird species were sedentary in a fixed home-range, and covered lateral distances of up to .apprx. 300 m. No movement between the different forests was recorded. The most common birds such as bulbuls were often caught at heights between 0.6 and 1.8 m above ground, but the upper limit of their vertical range was not determined. The bi-modality of flight activity may be intrinsic, even though it may be correlated with such extrinsic factors as light and radiation. On a month to month basis, the numbers of birds caught reflected breeding and molt activity. This was best shown by the pygmy kingfisher, taken in higher numbers towards the end of the 1st rainy season when a majority of the birds caught were young and many birds were molting the remiges. Higher numbers of olive sunbird were found during the 2nd rainy season, at a time corresponding to a general molting of remiges. The bulbuls showed fluctuations in numbers caught that were matched by an equally fluctuating pattern of molt. The role of food as a possible limiting factor in bird breeding is discussed.																			0019-1019	1474-919X					1976	118	1					1	13		10.1111/j.1474-919X.1976.tb02007.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1474-919X.1976.tb02007.x													WOS:A1976BF93400001

Microcrustaceans were most abundant in the reservoir and densities in the tailwater decreased progressively downstream. Three seasonal abundance peaks were observed in the reservoir, the highest in March-April and moderate ones in June and Dec. Fewest microcrustaceans were collected in late July and Aug. in both the reservoir and tailwater. Rotifer densities were similar in the reservoir and in the immediate tailwater; densities usually declined progressively with distance below the dam. Densities were highest in Jan. and Feb. and decreased during the rest of the year; in some months no rotifers were collected. The decrease in abundances of microcrustaceans and rotifers downstream from the dam was attributed to predation, physical destruction and lack of suitable habitat. Most water released from Barren River Lake was from the lower levels of the reservoir. During stratification (May-Sept.), releases were from the hypolimnion, which normally harbors few living zooplankters. The highest abundance of zooplankton in the tailwater than in the hypolimnion suggested that water and associated organisms were also being withdrawn from higher levels in the reservoir. When the reservoir was unstratified, densities of zooplankton were usually lower in the tailwater than in the reservoir.																			0270-5060	2156-6941					1982	1	6					651	662		10.1080/02705060.1982.9664086	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1982.9664086													WOS:A1982PT75500011

Exclosures 1-milacre in size were the primary method of study. Carp significantly affected the total abundance of vegetation in both years. The effect was greater at higher carp population levels. A definite selective effect was noted on chara and leafy pondweed; sago and crlspus appeared to be least affected by carp activity. Vegetation was most affected early in the growing season when plants were young and delicate. Chara recovered very well within 2 months after carp were removed. Carp retard growth of chara types primarily by feeding on them; on pondweed types the uprooting of vegetation during feeding activity is probably the most important influence.																			0022-541X	1937-2817					1967	31	1					181	+		10.2307/3798375	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3798375													WOS:A19678876100023

The lagoon is a channel billabong lying in the old bed of the Fitzroy River. It has a relatively small, shallow and elongated basin. Seasonal variations in water temperature, light regime, oxygen concentration, pH and conductivity suggest that the lagoon exhibits a warm monomictic pattern of thermal stratification rather than a continuous warm polymictic one. The annual heat budget was 3294 calories cm-2 year-1. Maximum work of the wind was 238.8 g-cm cm-2, and maximum stability was 34.5 g-cm cm-2. Despite the apparently low stability of stratification, the lagoon remained thermally stratified for much of the year. Analysis of wind-distributed heat suggested that slow mixing was taking place even during periods of relatively high stability, although this mixing was insufficient to reoxygenate the hypolimnion, which remained anoxic for much of the year. Yeppen Yeppen Lagoon is likely to prove eutrophic, and it is suggested that primary productivity will be high because a large volume of the lagoon's water is well lit and a large sediment surface area is in contact with the epilimnion. Notes on the biota of Yeppen Yeppen Lagoon are also given.																			0067-1940						1991	42	3					309	325																WOS:A1991FQ36500007

The Llangorse crannog is an unique example of an Irish monument type constructed in Wales. The combination of artefact dating, dendrochronology and historical sources suggests it was constructed in the late 9th century by the king of Brycheiniog and destroyed in AD 916 by a Mercian army. 2. Wave erosion, seasonal water level fluctuations, root growth, and tourist activity all pose a serious threat to the site where anaerobic conditions have preserved timbers, artefacts (including unique cloth finds and bone), and environmental indicators which are currently unique in Wales and of international historical importance. 3. Only a small part of the site has been archaeologically investigated and management strategies to preserve the site without conflicting with other environmental interests are still under consideration. 4. The archaeological investigation of Llangorse crannog has provided an opportunity to study the early medieval environment of the lake, including rates of erosion and colonization by vegetation of the island. 5. The vulnerability of the crannog is discussed, and strategies for conservation reviewed.

Additional data were obtained on the Tenghiz lake (the north-east Kazakhstan). The numbers of nest populations varies from several dozens to 20 000 pairs. The nature of the habitats chosen by Larus cachinnans can modify the spatial structure of their populations. The nest distribution can be random, regular or contagious. The average minimal distances between the nests vary from 2,6 to 10,2 m. In unstable coastal habitats there are clusters of 10 nests (from 7 +/- 2 to 9 +/- 3). With the higher mortality of the younger ("third") chicks in the broods part of them survive successfully the critical period (the first two weeks after hatching). The chances of all chicks in the brood to survive become more or less equal since they are distributed among individual refuges.																			0044-5134					DEC	1990	69	12					92	105																WOS:A1990FG22200010

Average P level in the lake increased steadily to a peak in 1979, and even 1981 in the case of P content in the trophogenic layer. Since then, reduced external inputs related to the delayed effects of phosphorus removal from waste waters initiated many years previously has led to a decrease in P level, and resulted in present stabilization and even improvement in water quality. Long-term changes in zooplankton abundance correspond quite closely to eutrophication level changes. After increasing since the 1960s, maximum zooplankton biomass was recorded for the first time in 1971; a second main peak appeared in 1981 together with the highest eutrophication level. Over the last seven years, zooplankton abundance has decreased continuously, while water transparency has decreased and phytoplankton production has remained at a high level.																			0018-8158					NOV 22	1990	207						31	36		10.1007/BF00041437	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00041437													WOS:A1990EW45800004

Bimodality developed in lengths of juveniles, but adult lengths formed single modes or very weak double modes. Monthly modal progressions of juveniles indicated growth series originating in March and Dec. Each year one age-group dominates the catch, becoming most abundant early in the calendar year, the reproductive season. After the spawning period, catches decline sharply, either from spawning-related mortality or behavior which makes the year class less vulnerable to exploitation. Adults grow at about 0.7 cm/mo. Sexually ripe adults appeared in purse-seine catches year-round, but more females appeared in advanced maturity in Nov.-Feb. and Aug.

This situation is discussed in relation to environmental factors, fish predation and the supply of detritus from the surrounding Typha swamp, to illustrate the relative stability of the zooplankton populations in periods between lake recessions.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1979	66	1					7	15		10.1007/BF00019133	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00019133													WOS:A1979HQ28500002

J	GODDARD, SV; BOARD, VV				GODDARD, SV; BOARD, VV			REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF RED-WINGED BLACKBIRDS IN NORTH CENTRAL OKLAHOMA	WILSON BULLETIN												During the 1965 breeding season the reproductive success of red-winged blackbirds was studied on 8 ponds and 2 small lakes located in 2 north-central Oklahoma counties. A few males were already on territory when observations were initiated on April 8th. Density of males on the study areas generally varied inversely with the size of the cattail nesting cover. Four females were known to paired by April 17th. The nesting peak occurred during the third week of May. Cattails furnished sites for over 90 per cent of the nests. Generally, redwings built a new nest when they attempted to renest. However, on 5 occasions, a nest was used for 2 nesting attempts. This occurred early in the nesting season and only once on any pond. Eight hundred and twenty-one eggs were laid in 243 active nests for an average clutch size of 3.4. Hatching success was 38.9 and young were fledged from 24% of the eggs. Sixty-five nests fledged one or more young, giving a nest success of 26.7%. Egg or young removal and nests tipping over were the major reasons for nest failure. Egg loss exceeded mortality of the young. The high nest densities in a limited area would make it possible for a single factor to destroy a large number of nests. Nesting success was higher for nests initiated prior to June 1st. Average clutch size was greater in early nests. Nests in old cattails were more successful. Over 50% of the nests were constructed less than 2 feet above the ground or water. Nesting success was higher for nests in lower situations and decreased as nest height increased. Approximately two-thirds of the nests were constructed above ground or above water that was less than 10 in. deep. Nesting success was greater as the depth of the water below the nest increased.																			0043-5643						1967	79	3					283	+																WOS:A19679984000003

Indeed, there are documented cases of both animal and human intoxication. Data obtained from field observations and laboratory experiments demonstrate a correlation between the development of the cyanobacterial population and the level of phycotoxin present in the water, though it should be noted that not all cyanobacterial blooms are toxic. The development of cyanobacterial populations is described by a dynamical model which accounts for factors that include algal growth, degradation, and light-driven buoyancy under the assumption of an isothermal, calm, and nutrient-abundant lake. A semiempirical mathematical model for water-column toxicity is developed and is used in conjunction with an improved result for the density of the cyanobacteria population obtained from the dynamical model. Light transfer through the water column, light absorption, the implication of the differentiated attenuation of light by the water, and its diurnal effect on the cyanobacteria population is considered. The result of which is a plausible description of the seasonal development of cyanobacteria populations and of the toxicity within the water body.

According to Clarke (1924) and Livingstone (1963) the proportions of the major ions have the following ranks: cations Ca2+ > Mg2+ > Na+ > K+ and anions HCO3- > SO42- > Cl- > NO3-. These ranks are characteristic for polar rivers and central mountain rivers. In all the other hydrological regions the ranks differ. The average conditions for Sweden are: cations Ca2+ > Na+ > Mg2+ > K+ and anions HCO3- > SO42- > Cl- > NO3-. The variations in the water flow are of importance.

Destratification occurs in the reservoir and is probably seasonal. Destratification results in toxic and deoxygenated waters as well as nutrient replenishment from the hypolimnion and could cause sudden mass fish and zooplankton mortality and consequent algal blooms. The reservoir is naturally oligotrophic with phosphate as a limiting factor and the high nutrient loading of the auxiliary water intake from a nearby river, Buloh River, is the cause of eutrophication in the reservoir.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1980	70	1-2					11	24		10.1007/BF00015484	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00015484													WOS:A1980JT81700002

The proposed model calculates the wetland removal efficiency and total outflow phosphorus (TPout) concentration as a function of the soluble and nonsoluble reactive phosphorus (SRP and NSRP respectively) while considering the accumulation mechanisms. The observed and predicted TPout concentrations compared reasonably which suggest that empirical models can be adapted to estimate the phosphorus removal efficiency of the marsh wetlands. The results also indicate that TPout concentrations decreased exponentially with time through the wetland and decreasing the surface hydraulic loading rate of the system would increase the removal efficiency of phosphorus. It was observed that about 78% of the total phosphorus and 77% of the soluble phosphorus content within the water column was removed with about 19% of the total phosphorus removed within the first 5 days (13% of the system detention time).																			1093-4529						1999	34	2					405	422		10.1080/10934529909376844	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529909376844													WOS:000078993200012

In general, the trace element concentrations show significant seasonal changes in these dissolved trace elements and the changes appear to be linked to the seasonal snow cover and its effects. However, not all trace elements vary in the same way. For instance, Mn and Mo concentrations appear to be controlled by flushing and ventilation of an alpine lake whereas U follows the flushing of DOC from the soils. Furthermore, ratios of alkali metals are found to have the potential to reveal seasonal changes in weathering and/or vegetative processes.																					90-5809-073-6				1999							123	125																WOS:000082439800029

These include the potential radiological impact on biota and human health, their use as tracers for studies of environmental processes, and for dating environmental records in natural archives such as lake sediments. Radionuclides are present in ecosystems through the decay of primordial radionuclides, of the earth by cosmic rays, and releases of artificial radionuclides from nuclear weapons tests and installations. Fundamental to their use in any of the close studies is a clear understanding of any natural cycles governing the presence of radionuclides in particular systems. The presentations are concerned with radionuclides in aquatic ecosystems. The first dealt mainly with models of the transport of the fallout radionuclides Pb-210 and Cs-137, their concentrations in the water column, uptake by biota or transfer to the sediment record. The results are being applied to studies of the fate of pollutants including trace metals and organic chemicals. The second dealt with the bioaccumulation of a range of natural radionuclides in fish in the Kaven River, India. Calculations of the maximum possible radiation dosage to the local population by consumption of the fish showed it to be well below the maximum possible limits. Dating lake sediments by Pb-210 and Cs-137 has played a major role in studies of recent environmental change. Two posters focused on the value of Cs-137 records in dating very recent sediments. The first reported results from two lakes in the Yunnan-Guizhou plateau, southwest China. Mean sedimentation rates determined from the Cs-137 records are in good agreement with the determined by Pb-210. Comparisons were made with two lakes from alpine Europe. The second reported results from a tropical lake in Mexico. Discrepancies between the Pb-210 and Cs-137 methods were attributed to disturbances to the Pb-210 record. Catchment basin studies explored two themes, the fate of fallout radionuclides as pollutants, and on their use as tracers of soil erosion. A study of Chernobyl fallout on alpine posters in Germany found that Cs-137 is still concentrated in the upper 5cm of the soils and may constitute a long-term source of radiation exposure in dry periods. The short half-life radionuclide Be-7 is being used to study seasonal changes in soil erosion in the Karst region of southwest China. Differences in the speciation of Be-7, Cs-137 and other radionuclides are being used to study erosion processes in detail. A fine poster reported on a possible link between radiation dosage from Rn-222 exposure in houses and the incidence of cancer.					; Wan, GJ/A-3648-2009	Appleby, Peter/0000-0002-6945-1841; 															90-5782-041-2				1999							369	379																WOS:000084441600043
J	Suzuki, N; Kitahara, T				Suzuki, N; Kitahara, T			Net profit and marginal net profit in the scoop net fishery of ayu population in Lake Biwa	FISHERIES SCIENCE												Many studies on fishery management assume that the objective of the fishery management is to maximize their economic rent and the fisherman operates to maximize their respective net profits. In order to confirm these assumptions, this paper tries to evaluate the net profit and the marginal net profit of the scoop net fishery in Lake Biwa, which is a main fishery for ayu Plecoglossus altivelis. Here, the net profit is defined as the landing in value terms minus the operating cost. This paper calculates the net profit per boat and the marginal net profit per boat using two cost functions. One includes only the variable cost, and the other is the opportunity cost including the estimated family wages. The net profit and the marginal net profit have the negative value specially at the end of the fishing season of the scoop net fishery, using a cost function including the estimated family wages. This does not support the above assumptions. This suggests that the fisherman's behavior depends not only on the net profit but also on other factors in the scoop net fishery. This is due to the less adjustability of labor power in the fishery. Under this economical condition of the fishery, it is difficult to maximize the economic rent as an objective of the fishery management.																			0919-9268					DEC	1998	64	6					939	943		10.2331/fishsci.64.939	http://dx.doi.org/10.2331/fishsci.64.939													WOS:000078792700018

The development of the reproductive organs and the life history of this species under laboratory conditions are described. The life history of L. hoffmeisteri has been followed under field conditions in 6 localities: 3 rivers, 2 lakes and a pond. The life history varies according to local conditions. Breeding may take place throughout the year or be strictly seasonal or show seasonal peaks in activity. The young may take from 6 months up to 2 years to attain maturity, and may breed in their first or second year. It is suggested that differences between the duration of the breeding period in different habitats are related to their productivity. In unproductive habitats the time of greatest breeding activity is related to temperature. The ability of L. hoffmeisteri to adapt its life history to local conditions and its consequent increased breeding potential is considered to have contributed directly to its widespread distribution and abundance.																			0030-1299	1600-0706					1966	17	2					158	+		10.2307/3564940	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3564940													WOS:A19668670600005

These "jellies" are an unusual, macroscopic planktonic algal community in the lake, made up mostly of blue-green algae (Microcystis, Anabaena, Chroococcus) with some green algae (e.g. Spirogyra) and pennate diatoms (e.g. Navicula) rather epiphytic on the mucous jellies of the blue-green algae. Water content was high (98.2% mean, range 97.5-99.5%). Ash, protein and fat had values of 41.7 (39.0-46.2%), 16.9 (15.6-19.4%), and 2.0 (1.7-2.1%) respectively. Crude fibre and carbohydrates were high (25.8% and 12.4%). The levels of phosphorus and nitrogen were rather high, so were the major cations whose order of dominance (Ca > K > Mg > Na) differed from that of the lake water. Macronutrients increased in their concentrations during the rainy flood season while the reverse was the case with the micronutrients. Diagenesis of the endogenic minerals rather than anthropogenic factors are thought to be the reason for the seasonal changes in the ionic concentrations. Possible uses of the algal jellies are discussed as well as their control options.																			0020-9309						1990	75	3					413	420		10.1002/iroh.19900750310	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19900750310													WOS:A1990FK77300009

On the pretext that a natural reproduction could no longer occur, the former size limit ensuring the ripening of the trouts was abandoned and rainbow trouts were heavily stocked to compensate the decline of the autochthonous trout population. Finally also spawning ground of poorer importance were neglected and the catches dropped from 12,000 kg to 3,000 kg within 30 years. Different measures applied in the last years to restore the declining autochthonous trout population are obviously successful: - three-year-closure for the trout-selective angling, - determination of a size limit and of closed seasons considering the reproduction of far and of short-distance migrating trouts, - rearing of parental stocks, - stockings done in tributaries instead of lake, - suppression of rainbow-trout stockings, - abolition of migrating barriers. Increasing catches of trouts in the commercial fishery as well as reestablished migrations in some accessible tributaries point to a progressing restoration.																			0767-2861						1990		319					167	172		10.1051/kmae:1990002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/kmae:1990002													WOS:A1990FP30500002
J	WHYTE, RS; HARTIG, JH; HOPKINS, GJ				WHYTE, RS; HARTIG, JH; HOPKINS, GJ			DECREASING CHLORIDE TRENDS OBSERVED AT LAKE ERIE MUNICIPAL WATER INTAKES	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Using available chloride data collected from seven municipal intakes drawing water from Lake Erie, linear trend analyses were performed to elucidate trends between the late 1960s and the early 1980s. Both seasonality and autocorrelation of the data were considered. Seasonality did not appear to significantly affect the trend. By removing the effects of autocorrelation more efficient estimates of the regression parameters were obtained and the achieved level of significance was considered valid. A decreasing chloride trend was found for all municipal intakes examined in this study. The rate of chloride decrease ranged from 0.47 to 0.88 mg/L/yr (mean: 0.7 mg/L/yr). This decreasing chloride trend in Lake Erie is believed to be the result of reduced loadings resulting from point source controls and the cessation of certain industrial operations which historically discharged high chloride loadings. Such evidence is important because of the concern for increasing chloride concentrations in Lake Erie over the past 20 years.																			0380-1330						1990	16	2					233	240		10.1016/S0380-1330(90)71416-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(90)71416-5													WOS:A1990DL43700004
J	FELLEY, JD				FELLEY, JD			NEKTON ASSEMBLAGES OF THE CALCASIEU ESTUARY	CONTRIBUTIONS IN MARINE SCIENCE												Nekton was sampled monthly by trawl in Calcasieu Lake, a chenier-plain estuary in southwestern Louisiana, from October 1983 to August 1986. Additionally, nekton was sampled monthly by seine in Calcasieu Lake and in three tributaries of the estuary from September 1985 to August 1986. For each sample, number of individuals and total biomass of each species were recorded and individuals of commercially-important species (penaeid shrimps, Brevoortia spp., sciaenids) were weighed and measured. Nekton assemblages of Calcasieu Lake were identified by detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), performed separately on data from trawl samples and from seine samples. Both analyses demonstrated the importance of seasonal changes in species composition in the estuary. Additional patterns in species composition were specific to each data set. DCA of trawl data identified a group of species that was regularly sampled and a group that was sampled sporadically. Analysis of seine samples identified an assemblage characteristic of marshy shorelines and one characteristic of open shorelines. In all seasons, penaeid shrimps, sciaenids and Brevoortia patronus were among the most important forms in the estuary. These species appeared as postlarvae or small juveniles, and grew to adult sizes within the estuary. While in the estuary, several of these species moved into freshwater tributaries of the estuary. These tributaries comprise an important nursery area for many estuarine species.																			0082-3449					DEC	1989	31						95	117																WOS:A1989DN33000008
J	WOLFERT, DR				WOLFERT, DR			AGE AND GROWTH OF WALLEYE IN LAKE ERIE, 1963-1968	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Age and length distributions are given for 6764 walleys Stizostedian vitreum vitreum (Mitchill) sampled during 1963-1968 form commercial landings of walleyes representing discrete populations in the eastern and western basins of Lake Erie [USA, Canada]. In the eastern basin, where all catches were made with gill nets, age-groups III and IV predominated in samples from large-mesh nets and age-group I in samples from small-mesh nets. In the western basin, where nearly all walleyes were taken in trap nets, age groups I and II predominated in 1963-1965, and II and III in 1966-1968 (after the legal commercial size limit was raised from 330-394 mm). Study of 5082 walleys from the 2 basins showed that at any given age during the first 3 yr of life, females were longer than males and, on the average, fish from the western basin were longer than those from the eastern basin. The greatest difference in growth of fish of the same sex for the 2 basins was apparent at the end of the 1st yr of life, when fish from the eastern basin were only about half as heavy as those from the western basin. After the 2nd yr, relative growth in weight of fish in the eastern basin improved: the weight of females exceeded that of females in the western basin by the end of the 4th growing season and weights of males in the 2 basins were about equal by the end of the 6th growing season.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1977	106	6					569	577		10.1577/1548-8659(1977)106<569:AAGOTW>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1977)106<569:AAGOTW>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1977EF41500008

Several major scientific results evolved from this program. An energy budget and a water budget were calculated for the lake during the IFYGL period. Lake-wide and nearshore circulation patterns were described and showed great seasonal variability. Substantial ecological changes are occurring due to additions of enriching and polluting substances. Results of the program are being synthesized with the help of mathematical models in order to provide the predictive capabilities needed to aid in the working out of management decisions.																			0044-7447	1654-7209					1978	7	3					106	112																WOS:A1978FF95100004

J	LAWLER, GH				LAWLER, GH			FOOD OF PIKE ESOX LUCIUS IN HEMING LAKE MANITOBA	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												The stomach contents of 29, 447 northern pike (Esox lucius) captured mainly in gill nets at Heming Lake, Manitoba, between 1950 and 1962 were examined. The food consisted almost exclusively of fish: trout-perch (Percopsis omiscomaycus) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens). Other fish included common suckers (Catostomus commersoni), spottail shiners (Notropls hudsonius), sticklebacks (Eucalis inconstans and Pungitius pungitius), pike, burbot (Lota lota), whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), tullibee (Leucuhthys sp. ), yellow walleye (Stizostedion vitreum), cottid (Cottus cognatus), and darters (Etheostoma nigrum). Among invertebrates were crayfish, mayflies, dragonflies, caddis-flies, and leeches. Ducks, small mammals, and frogs formed an insignificant part of the diet. Seasonal variation in food content and annual variation in the degree of feeding were evident. Trout-perch were important as food items in May and June, the spottail shiner in July, the yellow perch in August and September, and stickleback between October and March. Coregonine fishes, important in the life-cycle of Triaenophorus carassus but of minor importance as pike food, occurred in higher concentrations in October. There appeared to be annual differences in the degree of feeding, possibly related to differences in temperature. The frequency of empty stomachs from pike caught by angling and in gill nets was approximately the same. No obvious differences were noted in feeding habits of male and female pike, but there were some minor differences in the food of pike from shallow and deeper water habitats. Over an 11-year period of intensive fishing, there did not appear to be any unusual changes in the food habits of pike. The size of the prey is related to the size of the pike. There is a marked increase in the number of small perch, trout-perch, and spottail shiners consumed by pike of increasing size. The possible effects of the predator (pike) on other prey species is discussed. Relative abundance and seasonal availability appeared to determine the incidence of prey consumed. The reduction in the average size of the pike appears to have had some effect on the survival of other species of fish.																									1965	22	6					1357	+		10.1139/f65-120	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f65-120													WOS:A19657175400004

J	Hall, KR; Tschirky, P; Turcke, DJ				Hall, K. R.; Tschirky, P.; Turcke, D. J.			Coastal Wetland Stability and Shore Protection	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The size and number of coastal wetlands have been rapidly declining over the past century. Only in the past two decades, have people began to understand the complex environmental and biological benefits of these fresh water marshes. Recently, bioengineering techniques have been adapted as an integral functioning part of shore protection schemes. The bioengineering approach makes use of natural methods and materials, not only to provide suitable protection from wave action but also to enhance the environmental conditions at a site, primarily through habitat and species diversification. Constructed wetlands are prime examples of additions to shore protection schemes that provide ancillary benefits such as water quality improvements, provision of a buffer zone, and a rich, biologically diverse sanctuary for terrestrial and aquatic species. The wetland plants, themselves, provide increased erosion resistance of the soil mass in which they are planted and can reduce the wave energy levels reaching the shoreline in their lee. This paper describes certain aspects of a recent study undertaken to examine common Great Lakes emergent shoreline aquatic plants in order to assess their applicability for use in a bio-engineered shore protection scheme. The focus of most wetland studies has been related to biological aspects and to a lesser degree, to their hydrology. Little research has been conducted from a coastal science and engineering perspective, especially with regard to wave exposed shoreline vegetation. The study discussed in this paper consisted of a field investigations carried out over two growing seasons and in which the wave attenuation capabilities of a wetland were evaluated as a function of plant density and type, incident wave climate and time of year. Wave attenuation rates of 30 to 50 per cent were observed.																			0749-0208	1551-5036				SPR	1998					26		96	101																WOS:000486291200014

The degree of a metal induced inhibition of glucose uptake varied from lake to lake and from season to season, whereby the addition of legally tolerated concentrations of 10 .mu.g Cu/l and 200 .mu.g Zn/l inhibited glucose uptake in most samples significantly, as well as the simultaneous addition of all metals. The legally tolerated limit of 1 .mu.g Hg/l inhibited glucose uptake in Lake Lucerne [Switzerland] samples almost completely, but showed no effect in samples of Lake Baldegg. The equimolar toxocity sequence of heavy metals for heterotrophic microorganisms was determined as: Hg > Cu > Cd > (Zn, Pb). Glucose uptake of plankton sampled from metal polluted limno-corrals was less inhibited than that of the control plankton, when heavy metals were added to the samples singly or in combination. It is assumed that this effect is due to the natural selection of more resistant plankton species.

J	HARJULA, H				HARJULA, H			ANALYSIS OF ERRORS IN ESTIMATING PHYTOPLANKTON PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY AND CHLOROPHYLL A WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO LAKE PAIJANNE	ANNALES BOTANICI FENNICI												The errors in estimations of phytoplankton primary productivity and chlorophyll a concentration on a single day were analyzed from the data collected at Lake Paijanne, central Finland, on July 25 (site 570) and July 27 (site 810), 1977. Ristiselka (site 570) is considered to be mesotrophic and Asikkalanselka (site 810) oligotrophic. Errors in seasonal means of the same parameters were estimated from the data collected in 1975-1977 at Tehinselka (site 750) and Asikkalanselka. The collected data were analyzed with the nested analysis of variance to compute the components of variance, their relative magnitude and the relative accuracy of the obtained primary productivity and chlorophyll a estimates on a single day. The coefficient of variation of a single measurement of primary productivity on a single day was 15.9% at site 570 and 17.8% at site 810. The corresponding values of chlorophyll a were 15.4% and 11.5%, respectively. The analytical error of primary productivity comprised 64.8% of the total variance at site 570 and 50.6% at site 810 on the daily level. For chlorophyll a these values were 23.3% and 34.0%, respectively. Spatial and diurnal variations were relatively unimportant compared with the temporal variability in the estimation of seasonal means. For primary productivity the time component was 4 to 26-fold the space component, representing from 81-96% of the total variance on the seasonal level. For chlorophyll a the time component comprised from 63-91% of the total variance being 2 to 10-fold the space component. The potential sources of bias in present determination methods were elucidated and conclusions drawn on the design of sampling arrangements.																			0003-3847	1797-2442					1979	16	4					307	337																WOS:A1979JB35900004

P. pellucida, a small but abundant species, fed on small crustaceans and immature insects, while S. mystus, a larger but less common schilbeid, fed principally on fish, with insects as a supplementary item in its diet. The rare species, S. uranoscopus, was piscivorous. S. auritus, another small and rare species, is a herbivore feeding mainly on algae, th some crustaceans and immature insects taken as a source of animal protein. Preferential food selection by different length groups was found in S. mystus and P. pellucida. There were seasonal changes in the dietary items.

Consequently, global and regional temperatures, rainfall patterns and other climatic variables may be altered. The timing and magnitude of runoff, soil moisture storage, lake and river depths and water quality may also be affected. These possible changes could have serious implications for future global and regional water resources and their management. The availability and management of water in tropical areas are paramount concerns. With growing populations, mostly agrarian economies and mass migration from rural areas to urban centres, the demand for adequate and safe supplies of water has never been greater, especially in the over-populated capitals of these tropical countries. A persistent problem in water resources management for tropical areas is the lack of reliable information on the quality, quantity, and spatial and seasonal distribution of available water. Expected climate change may exacerbate the complexity of this problem. To this end, climate change scenarios from the General Circulation Model (GCM) of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) were used in conjunction with the Sacramento Watershed Model to assess possible climate change impacts on a major watershed in Jamaica. Preliminary studies show that the watershed is expected to become severely stressed. Adequate adaptation and mitigation strategies should, therefore, be considered.

BULLETIN DE LA SOCIETE DE PATHOLOGIE EXOTIQUE												Certain vaccines such as he amaril vaccine are highly recommended and even required from the traveller. Other vaccinations concern persons travelling in regions where they might be infected by pathogens not present in heir countries of origin. There exist vaccines which are available in certain countries but which are not (or not yet) allowed on the French market This is the case for the Japanese encephalitis (JE) and for he tick encephalitis (TE) of Central Europe. Details should be given about how the traveller can benefit from these vaccines, and about practical procedures to obtain them. The agents responsible are viruses transmitted by arthropods (the mosquito and the tick respectively). The variability of the risk and the seasons of transmission, variable from one region to another (especially as far as JE is concerned), have to be taken into account. Also the small risk of infection presently encountered and he small percentage of persons developing clinical syndromes after an infectious bite should be taken into consideration. practically speaking, vaccination against he Japanese encephalitis is recommended to those persons who plan to slay in an endemic or epidemic region for several weeks during the season of transmission, especially if a trip into rural areas is entailed. As far as lick encephalitis is concerned, infection can lake place in ail rural areas (meadows, clearings, underwoods...) of the Vosges and the zones east of them, especially in Central Europe, Russia and Siberia. While the decision is still justifiably pending as to whether to allow these vaccines on he market it is possible to obtain from the public health administration a temporary authorisation for their administration. Travellers should in any case be strongly advised to protect themselves against the bites of arthropods.																			0037-9085					NOV	1997	90	4					240	242											9479460					WOS:000071197600008

Potential rates of N2 fixation and MPN [most probable number] counts of N2-fixing bacteria correlated with each other and with decreases in dissolved O2 concentration. The results suggested that selective changes in the N2-fixing microflora took place during the period of thermal stratification. Neither light-dependent fixation, nor cyanobacteria could be detected in water column samples, and acetylene reduction was detected, for most of the season, only in samples of water and sediment to which a source of C and P was added. The possible role of the sewage effluent in suppressing N2 fixation is discussed.																			0021-8847						1980	49	1					143	154		10.1111/j.1365-2672.1980.tb01052.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.1980.tb01052.x													WOS:A1980KK82200015
J	AXELROD, DI				AXELROD, DI			DROUGHT DIASTROPHISM AND QUANTUM EVOLUTION	EVOLUTION												Restricted areas of greater drought probably were sites for quantum evolution of Cretaceous angiosperms as they radiated polewards from ever-wet rain forests. With only moderate tectonism and volcanism, local dry sites would appear on lee slopes and in intra-range valleys almost "instantaneously" (i.e. 0.5-2.0 million years). From an evolutionary standpoint they would be analogous to a new archipelago, or a string of isolated lakes. They would persist for fully 10 to 30 million years (or longer) before similar conditions spread out over the lowlands. New adaptive types could evolve there without leaving a record in accumulating deposits. Dry areas would have a diversity of potential habitats, be essentially free of competition, encourage the fragmentation and diversification of small to medium sized populations, cause geographic isolation, permit the establishment of founder populations with accompanying catastrophic selection, and enable new adaptive types to evolve at a rapid rate, leading to quantum evolution. Inasmuch as plants at the margins of rain forest were preadapted to some seasonal (monsoon climate) drought, strong selection for those capable of withstanding greater periods of drought would propel populations into these local drier areas which were, in essence, the emerging new vegetation zones that later shifted into the lowlands as dry climate expanded there. Plants adapted to longer periods of drought probably continued to evolve in local dry sites, sending, out waves of new taxa that were more highly adapted to the increasingly drier climates characterized by greater temperature extremes than spread out over the lowlands during the Cenozoic.																			0014-3820	1558-5646					1967	21	2					201	+		10.1111/j.1558-5646.1967.tb00149.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1558-5646.1967.tb00149.x								28556140					WOS:A19679504100001

JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												The investigation deals with the effects of nitrate and phosphate enrichment on phytoplankton productivity. Each nitrate and phosphate with two concentrations, 0.5 mg/l and 1.0 mg/l was added in the water samples separately and in combined forms to evaluate the seasonal changes in phytoplankton productivity. The limiting factors of productivity like carbon, light and temperature have also been taken into consideration. The effect of nutrient enrichment on productivity was not found upto the mark. However, t-test indicated significant differences in the productivity between the lakes. In both the lakes, the combinations of nutrients were found most effective to increase the productivity at almost all the times. Carbon did not show the limiting effect on productivity in any of the lake. Light in the Military Engineering Lake and temperature in the Sagar Lake were acting as limiting factors.																			0254-8704					JUL	1997	18	3					249	255																WOS:A1997XU84000009

Seven genera and 15 spp. of the family Corixidae [Palmacorixa buenoi, Trichocorixa borealis, Cenocorixa dakotensis, C. utahensis, T. verticalis, T. naias, Sigara conocephala, S. solensis, S. bicoloripennis, S. grossolineata, S. alternaria, Hesperocorixa vulgaris, Cenocorixa sp. Callicorxa audeni, C. tursalis] were collected. Estimated corixid population density increased from a mean annual standing crop of 4.7/m2 in 1970 to 17.6/m2 in 1971 and 56.9/m2 in 1972. The mean density of P. buenoi Abbott (19.8/m2) was about 5-fold greater than that of T. borealis Sailer (3.8/m2), which ranked 2nd in abundance; the 2 spp. combined represented 95% of the 3-yr mean standing crop (24.7/m2) of Corixidae in Lake Poinsett. Both of these species produced 2 generations each year, but P. buenoi overwintered primarily as 4th-instar nymphs and T. borealis overwintered as adults. Corixids were not prey species of the common littoral zone fishes, and fish predation had no known significant effects on corixid population dynamics. This lack of predation appeared to be primarily related to the fish species composition and to the high densities of more vulnerable prey.																			0003-0031	1938-4238					1977	97	1					198	208		10.2307/2424695	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2424695													WOS:A1977CW34200017

Four sentinel horses were exposed in an arid, upland region of the Atlantic drainage of Guatemala during Aug.-Oct. 1970, but no horse became infected. The epicenter region of the 1969 outbreak, in SE Guatemala and SW El Salvador, was studied during July 1970-Feb. 1974; no antibody developed in sentinel horses, sentinel hamsters did not die, mosquitoes yielded no virus, wild rats had no detectable VE virus HI [hemagglutination-inhibiting] antibody. Unexplained decreases in populations of wild terrestrial mammals possibly limited maintenance of VE virus. Mosquitoes were plentiful and present in the same species composition found at a focus of enzootic VE virus about 35 km NW of the epicenter region. In studies at 2 Guatemalan ranches near the epicenter, where horses died in 1969, VE virus infected sentinel horses along 1 of 3 lakes on 1 ranch during the wet season of 1972 but not during the dry or wet seasons of 1973; the titers of neuralizing antibodies in these 4 horses were higher against an enzootic strain of VE virus than against an epizootic strain. During 1970 and 1971, VE virus was isolated from sentinel hamsters exposed at a marsh on the other ranch, but Vero [African green monkey kidney cell culture] plaque characteristics were those of enzootic VE virus. The only epizootic activity of VE virus discovered in Central America in 1970-1975 occurred in Nicaragua between April and June 1972. Several hundred horses died, and N antibody, like that engendered by epizootic virus, was found in 2 young, unvaccinated horses. Whether this represented persistence of epizootic VE virus or reintroduction of virus is unknown.																			0002-9262	1476-6256					1976	104	1					60	73		10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a112274	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a112274								7139					WOS:A1976BX21200008

Tropical savanna grasses generally have higher protein contents at the beginning of the growing season than at the end when they become tall, coarse and unpalatable. The percentage of grass species utilized by game follow the seasonal changes in their protein contents; utilization being highest when the protein content of grass is optimum.

Sm. plantlets from a site in the English Lake District were compared with that of seeds of the closely related species, F. ovina L. The almost linear increase in dry weight of plantlets throughout the growing season was associated with an increase in their mineral nutrient content derived from the parent plant. Their amino acid and soluble carbohydrate content also increased markedly with size. The relatively high levels of free amino acids and soluble carbohydrates in viable plantlets contrasts with the generally low levels of these compounds usually found in mature seed of grasses. Viable plantlets contained 3-4 times the nutrient content of F. ovina seeds resulting principally from the larger dry weight of the plantlets. The growth and survival of plantlets is discussed in relation to the success of vivipary as a method of reproduction in arctic-alpine environments.																			0028-646X	1469-8137					1978	80	1					99	106		10.1111/j.1469-8137.1978.tb02268.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1978.tb02268.x													WOS:A1978EM46400010
J	Lee, DH; Croley, TE; Quinn, FH				Lee, DH; Croley, TE; Quinn, FH			Lake Ontario regulation under transposed climates	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												The implications of Lake Ontario regulation under transposed climates with changed means and variability are presented for seasonal and annual time scales. The current regulation plan is evaluated with climates other than the climate for which it was developed and tested. This provides insight into potential conflicts and management issues, development of regulation criteria for extreme conditions, and potential modification of the regulation plan. Transposed climates from the southeastern and south central continental United States are applied to thermodynamic models of the Great Lakes and hydrologic models of their watersheds; these climates provide four alternative scenarios of water supplies to Lake Ontario. The scenarios are analyzed with reference to the present Great Lakes climate. The responses of the Lake Ontario regulation plan to the transposed climate scenarios illustrate several key issues: (1) historical water supplies should no longer be the sole basis for testing and developing lake regulation plans; (2) during extreme supply conditions, none of the regulation criteria can be met simultaneously, priority of interests may change, and new interests may need to be considered, potentially requiring substantial revision to the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909; (3) revised regulation criteria should be based on ecosystem health and socio-economic benefits for a wider spectrum of interests and not on frequencies and ranges of levels and flows of the historical climate; and (4) operational management of the lake should be improved under the present climate, and under any future climate with more variability, through the use of improved water supply forecasts and monitoring of current hydrologic conditions.																			0043-1370					FEB	1997	33	1					55	69		10.1111/j.1752-1688.1997.tb04082.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.1997.tb04082.x													WOS:A1997WX81000007

In this period, 592 Common carp (Cyprinus carpio Linnaeus, 1758) were examined totally. The purpose of this study was to determine some reproduction features of the common carp such as the spawning season, fecundity, maturity age and sex ratio. The spawning took place from April-May to September-October. The common carp was established as a fractional spawner. Both the males and the females were found to attain maturity when two years old. Of 592 specimens, 311 were females and 281 were males. In the females and males, the ovaries constituted 0.131 to 20.142 % of the total weight of the fish, with an average of 2.092 %, and testes 0.030 to 8.770 %, with an average of 2.104 %. The ovarian eggs were found to be of different sizes. The most mature ova had an average diameter from 1.003 to 1.308. The number of ova per g ovary ranged from 603 to 1954 with an average of 1213. The fecundity varied considerably from individual to individual and ranged from 14656 to 575810 eggs, the average being 156197. The fecundity showed an increase with the increase in size of the fish. The number of ova per mm fork length and per g body weight 346 and 89, respectively. The various statistical relationships between fish lenght/weight and gonad weight and fecundity have been derived.

Of these the most important indirect regulations is control of the catching season. Lake Steinsfjorden is the most important crayfish locality in Norway accounting for some 25% of total harvest. Because the fishery is not licenced reductions in catching season is the principal method of regulation. We have studied exploitation, yield and stock structure of the heavily exploited noble crayfish Astacus astacus in Lake Steinsfjorden, S.E. Norway during 18 years. These data allow us to evaluate the effects of changes in the annual catching season. The study is based on catch statistics, mainly trap effort, and data from pre- and post- season test fishing in the period 1979-1996. In 1979, the length of the legal season ran from 7 August to 31 December. In 1981,the catching season was reduced from 6 August at 18.00 to 15 September in 1981. In 1989 the season was further reduced to two weeks and finally in 1995 to only 10 days. This short season regulation in combination with the national minimum size of 95 mm TL has proven successful in Lake Steinsfjorden. The short season is very easy to enforce. The management scheme allow females to spawn at least once before being caught. In addition females in the size interval 87-94 mm TL are allowed to molt and spawn in late August or early September without being exploited. Berried females are also protected. Males may molt twice between legal seasons and this implies a weight gain of approximately 35%. There is no need to limit number of fishermen or number of traps per fisherman. Yields have increased after the introduction of new regulations with a short season and may stabilize at approximately 2-2.5 kg ha(-1).																					0-9642382-3-3				1997							501	511																WOS:000090095400047

Members of this taxon have not been reported from natural habitats since the original descriptions. This study rediscovers the type species Paramastix conifera, periodically appearing in a hypertrophic lake and two eutrophic ponds. Abundance and ecological demands of this remarkable flagellate were investigated during a seasonal study of lake Heiligensee (Berlin, Germany). P. conifera is an aerobic flagellate which can cope with oxygen-depleted environments. For the first time the feeding behaviour of this flagellate is described. The flagellate attacks and devours its prey through an anterior papilla. Cell morphology was studied in living and protargol-stained cells. Paramastix conifera possesses two rows of flagella. Usually 6-8 basal bodies per kinety are arranged symmetrically around the papilla. Morphological similarities with the polymastigines and the hemimastigophoran flagellates are discussed.

More complete nesting ecology data were gathered during the 1982 nestling season. From 69 active nests, an estimated 2.2 young fledged per nest. Primary causes of mortality were sibling rivalry and premature first flights. Sibling aggression was greater than at other localities reported in the literature, perhaps due to the size of fish fed to the young. The population appeared to be healthy and increasing.																			0008-3550					APR-JUN	1988	102	2					237	241																WOS:A1988R211200006

Within 5 yr, the infection of burbot varied in the limits of 32-50%. Reproductive stages of the parasite were observed during all seasons. The infection of Ladoga smelt was relatively low (5-8%). The development of the parasite in the host was distinctly adapted to a definite season. In both species of fish the infection intensity increased with the increasing of body length.

In each woodland, sampling was restricted to a single site of 400 or 800 sq. m/ in area, samples being taken as 10 cm. cores. The dry weights of the organic matter per unit area and the contents of Na, K, Ca, Mg, P and N in the vegetation, litter and mineral soil were determined. In addition determinations were made of the pH of the organic matter and mineral soil, the ash content of the organic matter, the Si content of the vegetation and loss on ignition of the mineral soil. After examining the results statistically it is suggested that the surprisingly large spatial variability within each site obscures possible monthly differences in spite of the intensive sampling procedure followed. The application of the results to the general problems of sampling woodland ecosystems is considered.																			0022-0477	1365-2745					1963	51	1					97	112		10.2307/2257508	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2257508													WOS:A1963XM37100007
J	WHITTAKER, RH; FAIRBANKS, W				WHITTAKER, RH; FAIRBANKS, W			A STUDY OF PLANKTON COPEPOD COMMUNITIES IN THE COLUMBIA BASIN, SOUTHEASTERN WASHINGTON	ECOLOGY												Plankton samples were taken from 40 water bodies ranging from fresh to intensely saline and from lakes to temporary ponds. Samples were mounted on microscope slides in polyvinyl alcohol, which renders microcrustaceans transparent and makes possible determination without dissection, to permit population analysis. In lakes Diaptomus ashlandi and Epischura nevadensis were characteristic of oligotrophic, Cyclops bicuspidatus and D. novamexicanus of eutraophic fresh to mildly saline, and D. sicilus of moderately saline, conditions. Species distributions and community-types could not be correlated with concentrations of individual metallic ions. Productivity, as expressed in micro-crustacean standing crops, increased with increasing salinity in both lakes and ponds. Standing crops were almost twice as high in ponds as in lakes, but were low in most temporary ponds. Community classification and distributional relations of species were studied through quantitative measurements (coefficient of community and percentage similarity of samples, percentage co-occurrence and percentage similarity of distributions). A matrix and plexus for samples and community types, based on percentage similarities, gave 6 copepod community types which could be characterized by populations and limnological conditions. Percentage co-occurrence, which is interpreted as expressing relative distributional overlap, was used in a matrix and plexus for species distributional relations. Both treatments suggest a central complex of species and community types characteristic of eutrophic, fresh to mildly saline, stable water bodies, and species and community types departing from these in 3 directions of environmental extremity[long dash]oligotrophy, salinity, and seasonal instability. Distributional relations of copepod species are summarized. Copepods are excluded from high salinities; these are characterized by dense popjlations of single crustacean species[long dash]Moina hutchinsoni at 38,700 ppm and Artemia salina at still higher salinities.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1958	39	1					46	65		10.2307/1929966	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1929966													WOS:A1958WR62800008

Seasonal maxima for both littoral and limnetic zones are reported. Most population maxima are contributed mainly by 1 or at best 2 spp. Physico-chemical factors like temperature, pH, dissolved O2, free CO2, Ca, Mg and total alkalinity were studied and their influence on these rotifer species are discussed. On their thermal responses, the available rotifer species were classified as warm stenothermal, cold stenothermal or eurythermal.

SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SAUGETIERKUNDE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY												The buffalo population of the Akagara National Park and Mutara Hunting Preserve was studied. The buffalos were 1st counted in 1969 (Spinage, 1969; Spinage and Guiness, 1972) and showed a yearly increase of 1.77% up to 1976. Their number is estimated 7800 individuals. Single males represent 4% and 1st year young 16% of the total. Time and space of food resources affect the herd distribution by exploitation of different pasture types. Pastures with dominant Themeda and Hyparrhenia are used during their growth period. Rainy season feeding is concentrated on Sporobolus pyramidalis and Botriochloa insculpta in grassy plains; Panicum maximum and Chloris gayana, in wooded savannahs. Cynodon dactylon and other marsh-lake species are exploited during the dry season. Water supply is less important than protein availability for herd distribution. This is also influenced by inter-specific competition among herbivores. Hippopotamuses compete with buffalos on lakeshores during drought, while large concentrations of topi on the grassy northern plains force the ecological segregation of the buffalo into more wooded zones. In the park''s central area, the buffalo is predominant in biomass. Subpopulations (13) are distinguished, each influenced by environmental constraints: reduction of living space through competition with topi, zebra or other herbivores (north, north-central region); intra-specific competition during difficult periods (central region); and inter-specific competition with hippopotamuses (lake region).																			0044-3468						1979	44	2					111	127																WOS:A1979GW56300004

Much of the acid inflow is neutralized by bacterial sulfate reduction in the lake sediments. We developed a simple model to track the seasonal fate and mass transport of sulfate and alkalinity along the acidified arm. The loss of sulfate from the water column was characterized by a first-order decay reaction. A gain in alkalinity due to sulfate removal was also incorporated in the model. In addition, CO2 acidity and pH in the water column were calculated. The model was calibrated with data collected in 1983 and 1984.

J	GREEN, J				GREEN, J			ASSOCIATIONS OF ROTIFERA IN ZOOPLANKTON OF LAKE SOURCES OF WHITE NILE	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Plankton samples for rotifers were collected by means of vertical hauls with phytoplankton nets at 8 stations on Lake Albert during the course of a year. Similar hauls were taken from Lakes Kyoga, Victoria, George and Edward in Oct. and Nov. The rotifers found in the samples are listed and some estimates of their abundance and seasonal occurrence in Lake Albert are given. The most important planktonic rotifers are Keratella tropica and several species of Brachionus. Other species may also become locally or temporarily abundant; Lecane bulla becomes numerous in samples taken near vegetation after disturbance by rough weather, or where blue-green algae are abundant. The associations of rotifers at the stations on Lake Albert and in the other lakes have been compared by means of the Sorensen Index and the index of diversity. The highest diversity is found in situations with a high rate of flow, as the mouth of the Victoria Nile, where the extra species are non-planktonic forms swept into suspension by the current. This high diversity is associated with low numbers of individuals per unit volume. In Lake Albert rotifers are most consistently present and abundant at the mouth of the River Semliki, where the rate of flow is moderated by a large reed swamp. The middle of Lake Albert is poor in rotifers, and this may be related to the sparseness of planktivorous fish coupled with competitive elimination of the rotifers by larger crustacean zooplankters. The associations of rotifers in Lakes Kyoga and George are similar, and resemble one another more than they resemble the associations in their neighboring deeper lakes. The association in Lake Kyoga also resembles the associations found in water of a similar depth at the northern end of Lake Albert.																			0952-8369	1469-7998					1967	151		3				343	+																WOS:A19679124700006

The degree of infection may be correlated with the feeding of the fish on Asellus meridianus, the only known intermediate host of E. clavula in Llyn Tegid, although in the case of the pike of the size range examined, a secondary establishment of the worms is postulated. The percentage occurrence of male E. clavula was lower than that of female worms. The production of shelled acanthors by female worms may be correlated with the degree of concentration of E. clavula in the fish intestine; thus, in the eel, where maximum concentration was found, maximum production of shelled acanthors was also found. No seasonal periodicity of occurrence and maturation of E. clavula was observed, shelled acanthors were seen during all months except February and December, and the failure to find worms with shelled acanthors in these months is believed to be a sampling deficiency. The literature relevant to the distribution of E. clavula and to the seasonal periodicity of occurrence and development of Acanthocephala is reviewed. It is postulated that temperature may play a significant role in the seasonal periodicity of some Acanthocephala of fishes.																			0022-3395	1937-2345					1964	50	1					52	+		10.2307/3276027	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3276027													WOS:A19646322B00008

Two analytical techniques were used: a bathophenanthroline colorimetric method which produced total Fe data, and X-ray fluorescence which permitted separate determinations of dissolved and particulate Fe. Fe concentrations show marked seasonal variability. The total Fe transport during a 1 yr period in 1972-73 was about 6000 kg, or 0.2% of the total Fe content of Lake Tahoe. Most Fe in stream water of the Lake Tahoe basin results from erosion, producing a high predominance of particulate forms.

Species of Tabanus and Ancala were more abundant in open grassland than inside the edge of the lake-shore forest. Stomoxys nigra Macq. and S. calcitrans (L.) were equally numerous in both situations, whereas S. omega Newst. was most abundant inside the forest edge. Many species were caught during all months of the year. In both catching areas, there were seasonal rises in numbers of nearly all species between May and August and again in November or December, that is, towards the end of the rains and early in the dry seasons. At 1 of the 2 areas there was also a large increase in catch of a few species in April, in the middle of the main wet season. Diurnal activity of Tabanus and Ancala was greatest near the middle of the day, the exact timing of the peak varying with season. Four species of Haematopota exhibited morning and evening peaks with lower activity at midday, and a rather rare 5th species was apparently more active in the middle of the day. Three species of Stomoxys were also most active in the morning and late evening, but peak activity of a 4th species, S. calcitrans, occurred shortly after midday.

G. palpalis fuscipes and G. brevipalpis were caught in an area on the north-eastern shore of Lake Victoria in Uganda. Both males and females were classified into age-categories according to the degree of wear of the wings. Females were also classified into ovarian age-categories according to the exact or approximate number of ovulations that had taken place. All were examined for presence of infections with Trypanosoma. which were classified as vivax-type, congolense-type or brucci-type according to their location in the flies. The percentage compositions of the samples by wing-fray category were compared. The mean wing-fray category of females of G. palpalis fuscipes and G. brevipalpis was somewhat lower, and that of females of G. pallidipes somewhat higher, than that of the corresponding males. However, the figures for infection rate in females of all 3 spp. were higher than in the corresponding males, significantly so in G. pallidipes and G. palpalis fuscipes. and it seems probable that the mean age of females, at least of the 2 latter species, was greater than that of males. Among females, the range of calendar ages of flies in the various fray categories was wide. The physiological age-determination method, in which females older than about 42 days are classified into 4 age-categories, does not extend sufficiently far to give a reasonable pattern for the age-composition of any of the species at Lugala, and many of the individuals caught must have been more than about 80 days old. Seasonal fluctuations in mean wing-fray and in the proportion of old flies in the population were correlated with changes in infection rate of females of G. palpalis fuscipes but not of females of G. pallidipes. Among males of neither species were seasonal fluctuations in mean fray correlated with changes in infection rate, though among those of G. palpalis fuscipes the 2 varied similarly between June and Feb. Females of G. pallidipes and G. palpalis fuscipes about 31-42 days old had significantly fewer brucci-type infections than those over 42 days old, and either the developmental cycle in the field must normally be longer than that recorded in laboratory investigations or many of the flies must become infected when more than just a few days old.																			0007-4853	1475-2670					1967	57		3				459	+		10.1017/S0007485300050203	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007485300050203								6070494					WOS:A1967A269600016

Law enforcement officers observed 258 hunting parties for 419 hours. Of 94 hunting parties encountering canvasbacks, 41 (44%) shot at the ducks on 56 occasions, or 27% of 207 encounters observed, Based on a ratio estimator, there were 790 (95% CI = 376) attempts to shoot at canvasbacks on the Lake Onalaska study area during 1991 and 837 (95% CI = 390) during 1992. Mortality of canvasbacks, excluding crippling loss, was estimated to be 128 during 1991 and 166 during 1992. Thus, total canvasback losses may be higher than currently estimated on a flyway or national basis. This estimating technique offers a promising method for enumerating hunter take of protected and legal species.																			2328-5540					SPR	1996	24	1					132	139																WOS:A1996UG77900026

The breeding season is short and coincides with the main river floods. Females are larger than males and fecundity is extremely high. Like other Alestes spp. it is a very versatile feeder, and utilizes mainly insect alates from April-Nov., and chironomid larvae and pupae from Dec.-March. It is able to take advantage of periodic insect emergences and to utilize some plant material. Zooplankton and fish are not important food items. Condition factors appear to be related to spawning.

J	BERGERUD, AT				BERGERUD, AT			MANAGEMENT OF LABRADOR CARIBOU	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Population status, recruitment, and mortality statistics were analyzed for Labrador caribou (Rangifer tarandus) populations from 1958-63 to determine population trends. Two primary herds were recognized, the Mealy Mountain Herd in southern Labrador occupying a region between Paradise River and the south shore of Lake Melvile, and the George River Herd situated at the headwaters of the George River in northern Ungava. Census figures for the Mealy Mountain Herd were 2400 animals in 1958, 1900 in 1960, and 800 in 1963. March recruitment figures for the Mealy Mountain Herd for 6 years averaged 11 percent, calves/(calves plus adults). The average annual harvest in the 6 year interim was 539 animals. The mean annual mortality rate was calculated at 30-31% and the mean annual hunting mortality at 26-27%, 1958-63. The annual natural mortality of caribou alive in March was estimated at 6%. Calf mortality from birth to 9 mo. was calculated at 71%. Closed seasons were recommended for the Mealy Mountain Herd in 1959-60 and thereafter. However, public pressure prevented a closed season except in 1959-60 and 1965-66. Failure to manage the Mealy Mountain Herd on a sustained yield basis resulted from a failure to convince the public that the census figures were resonably accurate and that the population was declining. The George River Herd was estimated at 15,000 in 1958. March recruitment figures for 6 years were 11%. The annual kill by Labrador residents varied from 600 to 1100 animals. Evidence from several sources indicated that the herd increased from 1958 to 1963. The decline of Labrador caribou around 1900 is attributed to overhunting. The possibility of pristine population regulation through range overutilization and/or wolf predation is discussed and the latter is favored by the author.																			0022-541X	1937-2817					1967	31	4					621	+		10.2307/3797966	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3797966													WOS:A1967A167700001

The Vagavatn delta complex receive sediment through the rivers Bovra and Otta. The suspended sediment supply to the delta is subject to considerable seasonal variations and is measured to 155 700 tonnes/yr and 54 350 tonnes/yr in the two rivers respectively. The delta is composed of five individual units. The grain size of the topset deposits of the delta is subject to considerable downstream variations. Sedimentation rates in the frontal parts of the delta decrease from 1200 g/cm(2) day about 100 m from the river inlet to 30 g/cm(2) day, 6000 m downstream. The depositional processes and the properties of the particle bound material is decisive to the actual distribution of elements within each unit. The distribution of Ni and Zn is discussed as an example. Variations in Ni content is governed by the Ni content in the sediment sources whereas Zn content is also controlled by variations in the grain size. The deposition rate in the frontal zone is subject to considerable seasonal variations controlled by water discharge variations in the rivers. During peak floods the deposition of Ni and Zn reaches maxima of 60 mg/m(2) day and 33 mg/m(2) day about 1500 m from the inlet and decrease to less than 3 mg/m(2) day and 5 mg/m(2) day at a distance of 4500 m. Factors controlling the depositional pattern is discussed.																			0071-1128		3-510-47048-6				1996	47						113	119																WOS:A1996BH14Q00009

J	MCMILLAN, C				MCMILLAN, C			THE ROLE OF ECOTYPIC VARIATION IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE CENTRAL GRASSLAND OF NORTH-AMERICA	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												Investigations of the behavior of grasses in a transplant garden at Lincoln, Nebraska and in the greenhouse under various light periods, coupled with observations of behavior within the natural habitats, provided an evaluation of the role of ecoyptic variation in grassland distribution. Clonal material was studied from a longitudinal and latitudinal grid extending from Manitoba and Saskatchewan to northern Texas and New Mexico. Three general flowering patterns were displayed in the transplant garden. The 1st showed early flowering for clones from the northern and western communities and later flowering toward the south and east. This type was shown by Koeleria cristata, Bouteloua gracilis, B. curtipendula Panicum virgatum Schizachyrium scoparium, the Andropogon gerardi complex, Sorghastrum nutans, and Sporobolus heterolepis. The 2d flowering pattern presented earliest flowering of clones from southern communities, followed by somewhat later flowering from western and northern communities and latest flowering from easternmost communities. Only Elymus canadensis displayed this flowering trend. The 3d pattern of flowering was shown by Stipa spartea, S. comata, and Oryzopsis hymenoides. Here, flowering was simultaneous from all communities represented. The communities in a latitudinal transect from Devils Lake, N. D. to Ponca City, Okla. indicated selection for self-maintenance under the progressively longer growing season toward the south. Clones representing 6 species-populations at Devils Lake reached initial anthesis in the transplant garden over a 40-day span, those from Ponca City over a 125-day span. Communities along a latitudinal transect from Montana to Colorado displayed a similarity of response in the transplant garden. The mechanism of grassland distribution involves the intimate relationship of genetic gradients within vegetation coupled with habitat gradients, of which the selective influence of climate is paramount.																			0012-9615	1557-7015					1959	29	4					285	308		10.2307/1942132	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1942132													WOS:A1959WV72300001

This wetland, an extensive and important wildlife habitat located at the confluence of the Great Miami River and the Ohio River, is a region that has been and may in the future be impacted by industrial and commercial development. The present data suggest that Oxbow Lake and North Pond are strongly influenced by seasonal flooding patterns and resultant nutrient loading from the Great Miami River and the Ohio River, On the basis of physico-chemical and biological parameters, Oxbow Lake can be classified as a eutrophic to hypereutrophic system, while North Pond is mesotrophic to eutrophic.

J	MCCLEAVE, JD				MCCLEAVE, JD			HOMING AND ORIENTATION OF CUTTHROAT TROUT (SALMO CLARKI) IN YELLOWSTONE LAKE WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO OLFACTION AND VISION	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												In-season homing was exhibited by mature cutthroat trout (Samo clarki) displaced from spawning tributaries to Yellowstone Lake during late May to early Aug. 1964, 1965, and 1966. Of 1908 trout tagged and displaced from Clear and Cub creeks to 3 release points in the lake (1.55-7.95 km) and to the mouths of the streams, 614 (32.2%) homed, 119 (6.2%) strayed, and 28 (1.5%) were captured by anglers. Only slight differences in homing performance from various release points occurred, but there were differences among years and between streams. Adjusted mean homing times from the various release points ranged from 16 hr. to 155 hr., with an inverse relation between homing times and the distance to the release point apparent in 1 year. Blockage of the olfactory or visual sense did not affect the % of trout homing or straying. However, visual clues did increase the speed of homing, since homing times for blinded trout were much longer than for olfactory-occluded, control (anesthetized only), or non-anesthetized trout. A compass-type orientation occurred which was apparently not in response to visual or olfactory stimuli. A general east-northeastward (Clear and Pelican Creek trout) or northward (Cub Creek trout) orientation was exhibited by blind, anosmic, control, and non-anesthetized trout that were float-tracked from an open-water point. Blind and anosmic trout oriented as well as control trout. The directions of the home-streams, and orientation was not at a constant angle to the current directions or the sun azimuths.																									1967	24	10					2011	+		10.1139/f67-168	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f67-168													WOS:A1967A007600001

J	COULTER, GW				COULTER, GW			HYDROLOGICAL CHANGES IN RELATION TO BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTION IN SOUTHERN LAKE TANGANYIKA	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												A review of the hydrology and an account of hydrological changes in the southeastern arm of Lake Tanganyika between July 1960 and Jan. 1962 are given. Thermal stratification broke down here in July 1960 and 1961, and instability and vertical mixing persisted throughout each cool season until restratification in Sept. The distribution of dissolved oxygen in this period in 1961 indicated upwelling which, it is suggested, was caused by internal seiche movements. The effects of these movements may have been brought closer to the southern shore by a downward, northward tilt of the isotherms under strong southerly winds. A possible form of the seiche is discussed. Phytoplankton is more abundant in the large bays than in the open lake. In 1960 and 1961, phytoplankton maxima caused by local overturn occurred from July to Sept., and secondary maxima occurred in Nov.-Dec, caused either by a lifting of the thermocline or the effects of the first rains. Nitzschia spp. dominated the phytoplankton except in Nov.-Dec, when Anabaena increased considerably. Some effects of hydrological changes and plankton periodicity on the biology of the important sardines and Lates spp. are discussed.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1963	8	4					463	477		10.4319/lo.1963.8.4.0463	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1963.8.4.0463													WOS:A1963WU65700012

J	Ahn, YB; Cho, HB; Choi, YK				Ahn, YB; Cho, HB; Choi, YK			Effects of hydrogen ions on aquatic microbial populations in Korea	JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY												From July 1994 to March 1995, eighteen variables of physico-chemical factors including heavy metals, and of bacteria in the four reservoirs of Kyonggi-Do were investigated to examine the effects of acidic precipitation to bacterial population. The pH range in the study area is from 6.56 to 10.24, which also showed seasonal change extensively compared to other factors. The correlation analysis showed that pH has a significant positive correlation (mean 79%) with the microbial populations in Wangsong reservoir. By multiple regression analysis on all of the seasons and stations, good explanation was obtained for the variation in total direct count of bacteria (71% and 88%, respectively), and the plate count of heterotrophic bacteria (76% and 88%, respectively). In the surface water of Wangsong reservoir, the variation of total count of bacteria was affected by the S/O (soluble sugar/total organic matter ratio) value and the pH, and that of the plate count of heterotrophic bacteria was explained as 63% by pH. However, in other stations they were explained by the NO2, total organic matter (TOM), soluble sugar (SS), temperature, and dissolved oxygen as 21 similar to 91%. On the basis of the results, the bacterial populations on the media at pH 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0 were compared to determine the effects of acidic proceeding. AU the colonies grew the best on the media of pH 7.0, but started to decrease from pH 5.0.																			1225-8873					SEP	1995	33	3					184	190																WOS:A1995TT15100003

Surface disinfested seeds were plated on streptomycin-potato-dextrose agar and incubated at 24 .+-. 2.degree. C under continuous light. F. semitectum occurred in all of the samples and ranged 3-85%, and Phomopsis sp. (Diaporthe phaseolorum), which occurred in 9 samples, was more common in dry bean than in snap bean seeds. Occurrence of Rhizoctonia solani was up to 27% in snap bean and 4% in dry bean; Macrophomina phaseolina occurred up to 8% in dry bean seeds only. Seeds yielding these fungi did not germinate. Trichothecium roseum was isolated only from dry bean cultivars Rico Baio (8%) and Roxinho (70%). Colletotrichum dematium f. truncata occurred in 3 samples at 4-30%. F. semitectum and C. dematium f. truncata penetrated through uninjured snap bean pods inoculated with 2 ml of 104 spores/ml spore suspension of either fungus. Seeds removed from inoculated pods were discolored and yielded the respective fungus upon isolation.

The four bioassay treatments each conducted in triplicate were control (no nutrients added), +N (160 mu mol L(-1) NH4Cl), +P (10 mu mol L(-1) KH2PO4), and N+P (160 mu mol L(-1) NH4Cl and 10 mu mol L(-1) KH2PO4). The size fractionated (0.2-0.8, 0.8-3, > 3 mu m) contents of the carboys were analyzed after 7 d for alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) and chlorophyll-a content. Chlorophyll data suggested P deficiency in ammonium and control mesocosms and no P deficiency with phosphate additions. Pond water also was collected in June, August, October, and March for measurement of APA. In water from the pond, the greatest V-max of APA usually was associated with microorganisms in the size classes between 0.8-3 mu m. In mesocosm experiments, the N+P treatment increased V-max of dissolved and particulate associated APA in the 0.2-0.8 mu m size range and in dissolved form. The V-max of APA in the largest size-fraction (> 3 mu m) increased markedly with P deficiency (+N treatment) and decreased in the P-enrichment treatment. The patterns of APA and chlorophyll associated with different size fractions often varied independently among different treatments and seasons and not always as a function of P deficiency, indicating the difficulty of attempting to normalize APA to phytoplankton biomass or chlorophyll. The Michaelis half saturation constant of APA in the pond water showed no strong trends with varied seasons or size fraction.

Collections were made with a 1-m plankton net of 0.66 mm mesh, towed obliquely through various strata over bottom depths from 5 to 88 fathoms. Bloater larvae were scarce in early April, increased to maximum numbers in late June and early July, were scarce again by late Aug., and absent in mid-Oct. Hatching appeared to be at its peak about mid-June. The larvae were present in all areas where the lake was 10 fathoms deep and greater, but the majority (83%) were caught between 40 and 60 fathoms. Most were found near bottom, except during the April and early May collections. About 96% were taken from strata in which the maximum temperature was not more than 4.7 C. There was evidence that weak swimming ability of the larvae as well as water temperature influenced vertical depth distribution. A limited but definite upward vertical migration occurred at night.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1966	95	4					388	+		10.1577/1548-8659(1966)95[388:SADDOL]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1966)95[388:SADDOL]2.0.CO;2													WOS:A19668416400008

Using weekly data for dhe period 8 May 1986 to 12 October 1992, autoregressive time series models containing terms for tread and seasonality were developed for the average daily load at the head (FE) and mouth (NOTL) of the Fiver, as well as for the load radio and difference between the two sites. The estimated average load at the Fort Erie station decreased dramatically from 230 kg/day in 1986 to a roughly constant level of approximately 87 kg/day thereafter the lowest value of 74 kg/day being reached in 1992. At dhe Niagara-on-the-Lake station, daily load declined gradually throughout the measurement period from 110 kg/day in 1986 to 65 kg/day in 1992. Thus, by 1992, there was little difference (9 kg/day) in the loads at the two sites, suggesting that the major contribution of sediment lead to the Niagara River was from Lake Erie.																			0380-1330						1995	21	3					324	332																WOS:A1995RY62900006

The vegetation on that plot belongs to the Genisto-Callunetum illyricum association. In the continental part of Croatia this association is generally used for grazing and is occasionally affected by fires. Due to the fact that for at least 35 years neither pasture nor burning was recorded on plot No. 84, the association developed in an incomplete Aoristic composition, and bushlike type of vegetation succession started appearing. In 1989, however, sudden and unplanned grazing occurred, and the vegetation on that plot burnt on two occasions in 1990. In the first growing season following the lire the Aoristic composition did not change substantially but changes in the species cover values were identified, and nitrogen mineralization and nitrification in the soil were increased.																			1146-609X						1995	16	2					143	157																WOS:A1995TD80800002

In order of increasing pH, they were Pinnularia braunii, Nitzschia capitellata, Eunotia septentrionalis, Anomoeoneis brachysira, Eunotia exigua and Aulacoseira distans. Seasonal changes in the dominant species of attached algae were investigated in Lake Ohnumaike and Lake Mishakaike. However, clear seasonal changes could not be recognised. Species diversity was generally low with a range from 0.45 (Pond Katanuma) to 2.50 (Lake Akanuma). Correlation of species diversity with pH was calculated for each sample. The correlation coefficient (r) was 0.299 indicating a very small positive correlation.																					0-948737-35-2				1995							321	333																WOS:000071090600028

Feeding results in severely deformed terminals (witches'' brooms). Studies were conducted on natural, chemical and cultural control. Foliar-applied systemic insecticides provided excellent knock-down and 3-4 weeks of residual control. Although diazinon also provided good knock-down, its residual activity was shorter. Malathion provided suppression but did not protect plants from injury. A tree and shrub soap wash did not provide control. Oxydemeton methyl provided best results of soil-applied systemics. Of 385 aphidophagous predators collected, 85% were syrphid larvae. The remainder were Coccinellidae and Chrysopidae. About 140,000 aphids were examined microscopically without visual evidence of insect pathogens and with only one mummified (parasitized) individual. Dormant pruning of previously broomed terminals resulted in increased vegetative growth of the plants and larger early season aphid populations. There was no visible difference in pruned vs. unpruned plants at the end of the growing season.																			0090-0222					SUM	1986	19	2					91	100																WOS:A1986C125300008

Zooplankton, largely from the reservoir, was densest near the reservoir outflow and was reduced downstream. Some diurnal variation in abundance was noted in Jan. but not in July. Zooplankton was about fivefold more abundant in the tailwater in Jan. than in July; this difference was related to reservoir stratification and vertical movement of these organisms in the reservoir. During both sampling perioids, macroinvertebrate drift in the immediate tailwater was dominated by Chaoboridae, which were exported from the reservoir during the night. At the downstream station, macroinvertebrates were less influenced by the reservoir, and the nocturnal increase in densities and taxa was more typical of the drift in a natural stream. Macroinvertebrates were several times more abundant in July than in Jan.																			0270-5060	2156-6941					1982	1	4					383	393		10.1080/02705060.1982.9664057	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1982.9664057													WOS:A1982NN04200006

The efficiency of nutrient removal expressed as a mean for the whole site was estimated at 85% for P and 24% for N. An apparent seasonal difference in efficiency of P removal was attributed to lake level changes and the frequency that each soil horizon was either exposed to effluent or flushed with groundwater containing low concentrations of nutrients. The flushing was thought to provide a mechanism by which up to 80% of the effluent could eventually reach the lake. Examination of water within 20 mm of the lake bed showed high levels of P, N and coliforms, decreasing with distance from the shore.																			0028-8365						1977	20	3					255	263																WOS:A1977EX00300003
J	JOCQUE, R				JOCQUE, R			STUDY ON CLARIAS-SENEGALENSIS-VAL IN REGION OF LAKE KOSSOU (IVORY-COAST)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												C. senegalensis is the dominant silurid of the man-made lake Kossou and some smaller impoundments in the same region. Comparison of data spread over a 5 yr period starting from 1970, some months before the dam was completed, reveals that the density of C. senegalensis dropped to the original level that existed in the river after reaching a peak in the years following the damming. This phenomenon which coincides with the impoverishment of the lake waters, is explained by the fact that C. senegalensis has its optimal habitat in poorly oxygenated waters, rich in organic matter. It is able to colonize this kind of productive water thanks to the suprabranchial organ. In these optimal conditions it mainly feeds on aquatic insects and plankton. The fecundity of C. senegalensis may reach 200,000 ripening eggs per female. Reproduction occurs during the rainy season in flooded savannas. Growth rates are very high and the age determinations show that, in the region of Kossou, C. senegalensis reaches an average standard length of 620 mm (2.7 kg) within 3 yr. Literature data on other related species of the genus Clarias is compared. The position of C. senegalensis within this generic complex is discussed.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1977	54	1					49	65		10.1007/BF00018771	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00018771													WOS:A1977DH10800007

The collections and concurrent lake surveys were made during 1972-73. Soil and decaying plant particles appeared to influence the levels of dieldrin and .SIGMA.DDT taken up by largemouth bass. Strong correlations were observed between lake turbidity and true color and residue levels in the fish. Residue concentrations were also observed to vary between fish species, the seasons of the year and watershed land uses.																			0031-6156						1977	11	3					138	145											609512					WOS:A1977ER77200005

Five were recovered from South Island. At Lake Ellesmere, South Island, a cyclonic storm in April 1968 which altered the lake''s ecology caused a change in the swans'' dispersion. During 1956-68 and 1969-75, respectively, hunters returned 3950 and 745 bands, 83 and 78% of which were from within 10 miles (16 km) of the lake. Of the more distant recoveries, 72 and 73% were from the southeast of South Island. Most of the swans recovered from North Island were 2 yr olds. In 1969-75 more 1st- and 2nd-yr birds and fewer older birds were shot on Lake Ellesmere than during 1956 and 1968. This difference is considered the result of a shorter game season and poorer food supply at the lake in 1969-75.																			0310-7833						1977	4	3					289	299		10.1071/WR9770289	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WR9770289													WOS:A1977EC34500010

In Lake Wingra, fixation continues at moderate rates throughout much of the ice-free season. In Lake Mendota, the rate is normally zero throughout the ice-free season, but occasional, sometimes high, rates are observed. Auxiliary experiments on the effects of incubation time, added glucose, added combined nitrogen, light intensity, and temperature on nitrogen fixation in lake water are discussed. The effect of incubation time on the rate of fixation varies from time to time. Glucose had no consistent effect on nitrogen fixation in the dark, although stimulation was observed in some experiments. In the light, glucose appeared to inhibit fixation. The effects of added ammonia and nitrate were inconsistent. At times, various added concentrations, particularly of ammonia, increased rates of nitrogen fixation. Rates of nitrogen fixation varied with light intensity. The rate increased to a maximum at 3750 lux, then declined as the intensity increased further. Rates of nitrogen fixation increased at a constant rate with temperature in the range 16-30C.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1964	9	4					530	539																WOS:A1964WU66100010

One catchment underwent deacidification because of the artificial application of deacidified precipitation whereas the other catchment received unaltered acidic precipitation. Simulated results reproduce the observed seasonal dynamics in the concentrations of base cations, NO3-, Al, and H4SiO40 in soil discharges for both catchments. Simulated results also indicate that the export flux of base cations was decreased by 30% at the deacidification catchment in response to the decrease in acid deposition. However, simulated SO42-concentrations show decreases that are about 40% more rapid than were observed. Simulated organic acid concentrations were also substantially lower than those observed at the deacidification catchment, indicating that organic matter decomposition processes were not correctly simulated. Acid-base budgets for both 5 and 50-yr simulations indicate that acid displacement by base cations through ion exchange is the principal process delaying recovery of runoff alkalinity, whereas SO42- desorption has a minor role. Silicate weathering is the dominant acid-consuming process at both catchments. Criteria proposed here for assessing forecast reliability include reproducing seasonal dynamics in discharge chemistry, providing numerically accurate chemical concentrations when compared to monitoring data, and correctly predicting deacidification rate and extent. The ILWAS model generally meets these criteria, indicating that the model can produce a reliable forecast of the effects of acid deposition on the acid-base chemistry of surface waters given sufficient temporal data for confident optimization of the calibrated variables in the model.																			0049-6979					MAR	1994	74	1-2					29	63		10.1007/BF01257147	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01257147													WOS:A1994NK44600003

There was a distinctly higher incidence of nematode parasitism during warm months in both mature and immature hosts. The number of nematodes per infected host increased from a low during the 1st growing season to a high in the 4th season. There was then a progressive decline in nematode load per infected host in successive growing seasons until a low was reached in turtles over 10 years of age. It is suggested that these observations may reflect a reduced parasite tolerance to the lowered body temperature of the host and/or to physiologic changes which accompany seasonal body temperature changes in the painted turtles. It is possible that diminished infection rates and reduced nematode loads in older turtles could be the result of immune responses, and/or changes in feeding habits of the host which occur at the onset of sexual maturity. Observed changes in nematode populations were not paralleled by trematode infection rates.																			0022-3395	1937-2345					1967	53	4					818	+		10.2307/3276778	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3276778								6068191					WOS:A19679813300029

In this circumstance, the question immediately arises ''How stable is the linear programming (LP) solution with regard to regression issues such as sample size, magnitude of the error variance, centroids of the decision variables, and collinearity?'' This paper reports a simulation designed to assess the stability of the LP solution and to compare the effectiveness of ridge as an alternative to ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. For the given scenario, the LP solution is consistently ''biased.'' The amount of bias is exacerbated by small samples, large error variances, and collinearity among observations of the decision variables. The best regression criterion is a function not only of collinearity, but also of the magnitude of the error variance and the sum of the means of the decision variables relative to the right hand side of the stochastic constraint. In the application that motivated this research, the LP solutions were recommended fresh water inflows from Lake Texana into the estuaries of the Gulf of Mexico. The stochastic constraint estimates commercial fish harvest as a function of seasonal fresh water inflow. The historic data set used to estimate parameters of the constraint comprised rainfall data and fish harvest data prior to the construction of the Lake Texana dam, of necessity a small sample with collinear seasonal rainfall. It is not the authors' intent to solve this application, but rather to investigate through a simpler simulated system whether or not regression estimates in similar circumstances might introduce a systematic and predictable bias. The answer to this latter question is a qualified ''Yes!''																			0094-9655	1563-5163					1994	50	3-4					131	146		10.1080/00949659408811605	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00949659408811605													WOS:A1994PM70200001
J	THOMAS, JD				THOMAS, JD			ON BIOLOGY OF CATFISH CLARIAS SENEGALENSIS IN A MAN-MADE LAKE IN GHANAIAN SAVANNA WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO ITS FEEDING HABITS	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												This catfish becomes sexually mature when about 32 cm in length and once a year, after the onset of the major rains in April, or early May, they ascend the feeder stream of the reservoir to spawn in its flood zone. Spent fish soon return to the lake after spawning but smaller immature fish do not do so until September. Feeding intensity is low and with one exception the stomachs of the monthly samples were on the average less than half full. The suggestion of a slight increase in the amount of food consumed from August onwards appears to be correlated with a seasonal increase in standing crop and is followed later by an increase in condition factor. C. senegalensis is extremely euryphagous but it eats mainly midwater swimming organisms including fish such as Tilapia, zooplankton and insects, and organisms living on the surface of the sediment or swimming just above it. Animals from these habitats have a higher forage ratio than those living under stones, in the sediment or in shallow water or in vegetation close to the shore. Vegetation, adventitious food and detritus are of little consequence to C. senegalensis in Nungua lake and it is suggested that the latter is not exploited because the sediments are poor in organic matter. The euryphagous habits of C. senegalensis are shared by other Clarias species and this is reflected in several anatomical adaptations concerned with feeding. Seasonal changes in the dietaries are very slight because the catfish do not exploit phytophilous species to any great extent even when they become abundant during the wet season. For this reason it is doubtful whether they are of value in controlling important vectors of diseases many of which are phytophilous. Although there is a suggestion that larger fish eat more vegetation, phytophilous species and adventitious food the evidence for ontogenetic changes in the dietaries are very slight and fish in all the size groups eat minute food organisms such as copepods and also large ones such as fish including Tilapia. The possibility of combining Clarias with Tilapia in fish ponds is, therefore, worthy of consideration. The factors which cause expansion and contraction of food niches are discussed.																			0952-8369	1469-7998					1966	148		4				476	+																WOS:A19668079600007

The migration appears to be a well-oriented, non-random movement; it apparently commences from all lake regions at about the same time, suggesting a common triggering stimulus. When migrating, the smolts swim at a speed of 0.65 to 1.0 feet per second. The migration appears to take place primarily at near-surface depths; diurnally, most of the migration activity appears centered around the evening dusk period. There is a consistent increase in rate of travel as the season progresses; in large part this appears a result of increasing migration drive. Orientation tests with a view of only the sky show the smolts capable of time-compensated orientation in relation to celestial phenomena, and such tests at various points along the migration route show the preferred direction of smolts to correspond with the direction of most direct route to the outlet. Most smolts of the system show a constant preference for the northwesterly direction which would lead them rather directly to the outlet. However, one group which in the course of its migration to the outlet must make a 180[degree] turn clockwise from southeast to northwest is found to have a corresponding shift in directional preference with time. Simple one-direction orientation, in one case shifting with time, is sufficient to account for ability to find the outlet. A positive relation is shown between rate of travel of tagged smolts and the hours of sunshine on days subsequent to their release.																									1963	20	4					919	938		10.1139/f63-064	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f63-064													WOS:A1963WV54400004

The fluctuations in species diversity and cell numbers are attributed to changes in the nutrient status of the lake water and lake level.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1981	76	3					191	200		10.1007/BF00006209	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006209													WOS:A1981LB06500001

The influential role blue-green algal blooms exert on seasonal and annual lake dynamics was most obvious once nuisance populations were temporarily removed from the system. Differential sensitivity between algal species was observed. Cryptomonad flagellates were least sensitive to algicide treatment and were dominant during periods when dissolved organic materials appeared to increase. The effect of rotenone application on blue-green bloom species is discussed.																			0020-9309						1981	66	2					249	262		10.1002/iroh.19810660207	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19810660207													WOS:A1981LT82800005

INVESTIGATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND ASPECTS OF THE LIMNOLOGY OF THE LAKE	WATER SA												The biologically unfavorable physiochemical conditions which prevailed in Germiston Lake prior to 1969 resulting from mine and industrial pollution, have been reduced by control measures which prevented effluent from mines and industries and seepage waters from mine and ash dumps entering the lake. In addition, vast quantities of NaOH and agricultural lime were distributed through the lake during 1969-1970 resulting in an increase of the pH of the lake water from 4.5 to 7. These measures initiated the biological recovery of the lake which resulted among others in the large scale development of Potamogeton pectinatus L. This hydrophyte made its appearance during 1972 and within a few years invaded the littoral zone of the lake, virtually replacing Scirpus lacustris L. and Lagarosiphon major (Ridley) Moss ex Wager. Potamogeton biomass for each of the 4 seasons of 1978 was estimated and its possible effect on seasonal phytoplankton chlorophyll-a and soluble reactive phosphorus values is discussed. Physicochemical conditions of the lake water obtained during 1978 are discussed and compared with those of 1969-1970.																			0378-4738	1816-7950					1981	7	3					160	165																WOS:A1981LY81200005

Since the surface of the formerly intensively cultivated lake ground was not removed before impoundage, elevated concentrations of nutrients and high bacterial activities were observed even in the sediment of the shallow southwest bight. Interrelations between anaerobic respiration and methanogenesis, the effect of desulfurication on the sulfate content of the lake water and the relation between nutrient concentration in the sediment and primary production were discussed.																			0003-9136						1981	92	3					346	358																WOS:A1981MN01800005

The fishes used for investigation were held under optimized conditions (closed warm-water recirculation system) or they were caught in the Berlin lake Muggelsee. Seasonal changes in the histological structure of the liver parenchyma of Muggelseeroach were observed. Under warm-water conditions with ad-libitum feeding there was no seasonal influence on liver histology.

J	MORTON, FI				MORTON, FI			EVAPORATION FROM LARGE DEEP LAKES	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Derived insolation and water budget evaporation data for Lake Superior and Lake Ontario are analyzed in terms of both the regional and the water surface energy balances. The results indicate that the seasonal pattern of evaporation is governed by heat storage changes, and that these changes are closely associated with atmospheric energy export from the lake. This finding provides a physical basis for the simple empirical relationships between monthly evaporation and island-to-mainland temperature differentials that are developed from the water budget evaporation data. Substantial atmospheric energy export, a concomitant of heat storage changes, reduces the energy available for evaporation. Therefore, evaporation from a large deep lake is less than that from a large shallow lake under comparable climatic conditions. The analysis also provides speculative reasoning and evidence to indicate that evaporation from a large deep lake is closely related to the radiant at transfer to the sky.																			0043-1397	1944-7973					1967	3	1					181	+		10.1029/WR003i001p00181	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/WR003i001p00181													WOS:A19679185500020
J	GODSIL, PJ; JOHNSON, WC				GODSIL, PJ; JOHNSON, WC			PESTICIDE MONITORING OF AQUATIC BIOTA AT TULE LAKE NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE	PESTICIDES MONITORING JOURNAL												Because of pesticide poisoning of fish-eating birds, the Federal Water Pollution Control Administration established a water quality monitoring program at the Tule Lake and Lower Klamath Lake Wildlife Refuges in 1964. Over a 2-year period, samples of water, suspended material, submerged aquatic plants, clams, and fish were collected and analyzed for chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides. Results are reported from a typical station in the Tule Lake National Wildlife Refuge. Compounds DDE, [1,1-dichlora-z, z-bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethylene], DDD [1,1-dichloro-2, 2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane], DDT, chlordane, and endrin were found regularly in samples of both water and biota. Water contained a maximum of 0.100 ppb [parts per billion] of endrin in 1965, while tui chubs, Siphateles bicolor, accumulated a maximum of 198 ppb during the same year. Concentrations of endrin in the other strata of the biota were distributed between these extremes of the food chain. The occurrence of endrin was directly associated with contaminated irrigation return water supplying the Refuge lakes. As the concentrations of studied pesticides increased in the drainage water, the biota also became contaminated. However, at the end of the season, as the concentrations decreased in the water, the biota was cleansed. Concentrations in both water and biota returned to or near analytical sensitivity (water [long dash]0.007 ppb; biota [long dash]4 ppb) between growing seasons.																			0031-6156						1968	1	4					21	+																WOS:A1968B307100004
J	RUPP, RS; REDMOND, MA				RUPP, RS; REDMOND, MA			TRANSFER STUDIES OF ECOLOGIC AND GENETIC VARIATION IN AMERICAN SMELT	ECOLOGY												Introductions of American smelts, Osmerus mordax, from six established populations into eight new environments were made in Maine in 1957-62 to determine which characteristics of the parent populations would be altered by transfer to the new environments and which would remain unaltered. Four of the host lakes had not contained smelts previously, three had contained smelts which were removed by rote none, and one is thought to have contained a smelt population which disappeared 4 or 5 years before the experimental transfer. In several cases the growth rates, lengths, and longevities attained by smelts changed greatly with change in their environment. The time of the spawning season for one stock of smelts remained unaltered following transfer to an environment where the previous smelt population routinely had spawned much later. In one case smelts hatched from eggs of a stream -spawning population adapted immediately to the shore-spawning habit in a host lake where tributaries are absent. The success of smelts in the various new environments appeared to depend mostly upon the intensity of interspecific competition and other biotic factors, as with most fishes.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1966	47	2					253	+		10.2307/1933772	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1933772													WOS:A19667700600010
J	BOGARDI, I; DUCKSTEIN, L				BOGARDI, I; DUCKSTEIN, L			INPUT FOR A STOCHASTIC CONTROL MODEL OF P LOADING	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												In most lakes P appears to be the nutrient controlling eutrophication. Furthermore, half of the P-loading stems from non-point sources, especially agricultural fertilizers. For the purpose of controlling eutrophication, the uncertainty in P-loading is described in 2 separate categories: P dissolved in runoff and P fixed or sorbed by sediments. The stochastic model defines hydrologic events as follows: a source of P is available, transport is triggered by rainfall events, which cause both runoff volume V and sediment yield Z. Amount X1, duration X2, and interarrival time T are used to characterize rainfall events. The amount of dissolved P transported is estimated by multiplying the concentration C1 of dissolved P by runoff voume V; the amount of sorbed P is estimated by mutiplying concentration C2 of P fixed to sediments by sediment yield Z per event. The latter quantity is calculated by means of the Universal Soil Loss equation, while U.S. Soil Conservation Service empirical formulas are used to obtain estimates are used to obtain estimates of peak flow and runoff volumes. Total seasonal loading is calculated as the sum of a random number of random P-loading events. Then, loadings from subcatchments around the lake can be added under certain assumptions about the dynamics of the lake, which are discussed. Long-term P accumulation P in the lake is described in terms of solution of a 1st order difference equation in 3 extreme cases: no loading, constant loading and linearly increasing loading. Alternative P-loading control methods from non-point agricultural sources are presented and discussed. The case study of Lake Balaton in Hungary is used to illustrate the stochastic methodology; a numerical example using data from the Tetves subwatershed of Lake Balaton provides preliminary practical results.																			0304-3800	1872-7026					1978	4	2-3					173	195		10.1016/0304-3800(78)90006-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3800(78)90006-6													WOS:A1978ER44200006
J	CZAIKA, SC				CZAIKA, SC			CRUSTACEAN ZOOPLANKTON IN LAKE ERIE OFF CLEVELAND HARBOR	OHIO JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												Zooplankton samples were collected from 5 stations in Lake Erie off Cleveland Harbor [Ohio, USA] in June, Aug. and Nov. 1973 and April 1974. Identification of 26 zooplankton groups was made, the most common being (in decreasing order of abundance) copepod nauplii, bosminids with mucro, immature cyclopoid copepodids, Eubosmina coregoni, Daphnia retrocurva, Cyclops bicuspidatus thomasi, immature calanoid copepodids, D. galeata mendotae, C. vernalis, Ceriodaphnia lacustris, Mesocyclops edax. Crustacean zooplankton were most abundant in June (158,000/m3) and least abundant in Nov. (27,600/m3). Cladocerans were dominant only in Aug. Nauplii accounted for 82% of all zooplankton in April. Comparison of the seasonal abundance of immature dipatomid copepodids suggests that breeding seasons were probably similar in the 1950''s and 1970''s. It appears that the crustacean zooplankton community off Cleveland Harbor probably has not changed significantly since the mid-1950''s.																			0030-0950						1978	78	1					18	25																WOS:A1978EL64700003
J	NEY, JJ; SMITH, LL				NEY, JJ; SMITH, LL			SERUM-PROTEIN VARIABILITY IN GEOGRAPHICALLY-DEFINED BLUEGILL	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Blood serum proteins of mature bluegills, L. macrochirus, Rafinesque, collected from 2 stations in each of 2 E-Central Minnesota [USA] lakes were analyzed by polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis. Transferrin and prealbumin proteins were polymorphic. The transferrin polymorphism occurred only in Forest Lake fish and was extremely rare. Analogy with other fish species suggests that the bluegill transferrin system is controlled by 2 codominant alleles, 1 of which may be lethal in the homozygous state. Three prealbumin phenotypes consisting of single or double bands were observed at all stations. Phenotypic distribution did not conform to the expected Hardy-Weinberg proportion for a system of 2 codominant alleles at 3 of 4 stations and was independent of factors of size, age, season and method of capture at all stations. Phenotype varied significantly with sex at one Forest Lake station. Distribution of prealbumin phenotypes in female bluegills displayed a significant difference between Forest Lake stations but not between Big Carnelian Lake stations or between lakes. Electrophoretic analysis has the potential to clarify the adequacy of the geographic isolation concept in bluegill population definition.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1976	105	2					281	290		10.1577/1548-8659(1976)105<281:SPVIGB>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1976)105<281:SPVIGB>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1976CA80200014
J	SAKAMOTO, M				SAKAMOTO, M			CHLOROPHYLL AMOUNT IN EUPHOTIC ZONE IN SOME JAPANESE LAKES AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE IN PHOTOSYNTHETIC PRODUCTION OF PHYTOPLANKTON COMMUNITY	BOTANICAL MAGAZINE-TOKYO												The variation of the amount of chlorophyll-a in the euphotic zone was studied in some lakes of central Japan with special reference to the effect of factors controlling it; also, the significance of the variation of chlorophyll amount in the photosynthetic production of the community was examined. The large chlorophyll-a amount of the euphotic zone could be found in shallower eutrophic lakes (maximum value was 106.0 mg/m2 in Lake Suwa), but not in deeper oligotrophic lakes (minimum was 10.5 mg/m2 in Lake Motosu). The depth of the euphotic zone was shallower in the former and deeper in the latter. A definite relation could not be found between the depth of the euphotic zone and the chlorophyll-a of the euphotic zone. The optical mass of pure water (gamma De), of phytoplankton (< Ae) and of the other substances (Se) throughout the whole euphotic zone was calculated and compared with each other. The smallest was '' Ae, the largest Se. It was concluded that the substances responsible for the variation of the Se value had the largest Influence on the attenuation of underwater light and therefore the depth of the euphotic zone. The relations of the chlorophyll amount of the euphotic zone (Ae) to Se values and to the mean chlorophyll concentration of the euphotic zone were examined. A clear relation could not be found between Ae and Se. Between Ae and the mean chlorophyll concentration, an approximate proportionality existed in waters of low chlorophyll concentration, but not in those of higher chlorophyll concentration. It was concluded that the difference in chlorophyll concentration had a great significance in the variation of Ae in oligotrophic lakes. The relation between the chlorophyll-a amount of the euphotic zone and the daily net production rate measured in situ was studied. An approximately linear relation could be found between these variables. The production rate of the community per unit chlorophyll-a amount varied with waters and seasons. The range of the variation in the production rate per unit chlorophyll-a amount was generally smaller than the range of the amount of chlorophyll-a in the euphotic zone.																			0006-808X						1966	79	932-					77	+																WOS:A19668252500002

The species recorded were Eutropius niloticus (RUPPELL) 1829, Schilbe cf. mystus (LINNE) 1758, Physailia pellucida BOULENGER, 1901 and Eutropiellus buffei GRAS, 1960. These species accounted for 12.4% by number, and 4.7% by weight of all fish captured. E. niloticus and S. cf. mystus were the important species making up 85.2% by number, and 94.7% by weight of all schilbeids caught. The seasonal variations in the abundance of E. niloticus and P pellucida showed that these species were migratory, while S. cf. mystus was a resident in the river. Both E. niloticus and P. pellucida showed a diel pattern of abundance in catches, while no distinct pattern of diel variation was recorded for S. cf. mystus. The spatial distribution of E. niloticus, S. cf. mystus and P. pellucida was heterogeneous within the study stretch. E. buffei was a rare species. The ecology of schilbeids in River Ase has been discussed and compared with the findings of earlier studies conducted in River Niger and Lake Kainji in Northern Nigeria.																			0003-9136					MAR	1993	127	1					115	125																WOS:A1993KZ93800010

Periphyton biomass was determined indirectly by measuring the chlorophyll a of cells after separation from apical portions of the macrophyte and reported as mg chlorophyll a per g DW of macrophyte. The periphyton biomass, composed mainly of Cyanophyceae and Bacillariophyceae, changed seasonally depending on light intensity (r = -0.72, p < 0.01), temperature (r = 0.54, p 0.05) and water nutrients (O-PO4 r = 0.58, p < 0.05). A significant inverse relationship between periphyton and southern naiad biomass (r = -0.77, p < 0.01) was found. The shading caused by periphyton appears to promote the seasonal senescence of southern naiad, which releases nutrients and subsequently stimulates further periphyton growth.																			0146-6623					JAN	1993	31						84	88																WOS:A1993MU07900019

Dark fixation (DF) contributed an important part of the total primary productivity in Lake Kinneret. In addition, it was found that during the dark period the relative amount of fixed inorganic carbon depends upon the sampling depth and season. The DF contribution of the dominant phytoplankton species in Lake Kinneret (Peridinium gatunense) was found to be between 3 - 30% of the total light carbon fixation (LF) . Carbon uptake was dependent on the light history of the cells. DF and LF in photosynthetic bacteria was found to be equivalent.

Lake Kinneret suspended solids are of great potential value for estimating transport, exposure to water body elements, and fate of many toxic substances. Therefore the distribution of admixtures in two longitudinal and five vertical segmentation schemes were examined with the two-dimensional water body quality box model ''BETTER'' (Bender et al, 1990). The transects were taken in the north-western part of Lake Kinneret close to the Jordan River mouth and the National Water Carrier (NWC) head pumping station. The outflow volumes were given according to regular sampling of natural speed of water outflow from different lake layers under calm conditions. Temporal distribution of mixing concentrations as well as turbulent diffusion horizontal coefficients due to the spatial distribution of turbulent scale were obtained during the model's run with the December 1991 data.																			0273-1223						1993	27	7-8					381	385		10.2166/wst.1993.0573	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.1993.0573													WOS:A1993LL94300047

In the lake, pigments correlated positively with total organic production and total algal counts. Dissolved oxygen was also correspondingly high. Biochemical oxygen demand showed an inverse relation with dissolved oxygen. Standard bacterial plate counts were high both in the storm water channel and in the lake. Total and faecal coliforms, on the other hand, were high only in the storm water channel and gradually decreased in the lake with increasing distance from the entry point.

The weekly catches of the most abundant species and the sex ratios obtained in each trap are compared. Box traps could be emptied every second day without loss of insects but it was necessary to empty the funnel trap daily. Box traps of different sizes were compared and a trap covering 0.46m2 (5 ft2) found to give optimum results.

J	MCCLINTOCK, NL; WILHM, J				MCCLINTOCK, NL; WILHM, J			EFFECTS OF ARTIFICIAL DE-STRATIFICATION ON ZOOPLANKTON OF 2 OKLAHOMA RESERVOIRS	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Species composition and diversity of zooplankton were observed in 2 lakes undergoing destratification attempts. Twenty-five and 24 taxa were collected from Ham''s and Arbuckle Lake, respectively. Species composition and density were similar to other area reservoirs, while diversity values (d) were consistently lower. No correlation was observed between depth and number of species of depth and diversity. Density tended to decrease with depth. Densities were lowest in April and Aug. in Ham''s Lake and in Aug. in Arbuckles Lake. In both lakes, density was highest in May. Ham''s Lake was artificially destratified by the pumping, while Arbuckle Lake was not destratified during the study. Although some temporal variation in species numbers and densities possibly reflected limited O2 concentrations, the changes could not be directly related to physicochemical conditions of the lakes. Variations are probably due in part to seasonal population dynamics of the zooplankton. No correlation was observed between diversity and time.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1977	54	3					233	239		10.1007/BF00014290	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00014290													WOS:A1977DL18700007

The 2 populations show a series of characteristics, linked to their geographical isolations, which relate to the small size of the individuals and to the structure of their appendages. The population of D. cyaneus exhibits tychoplanktonic behavior and the individuals show great morphological variability, as in the North African populations (Morocco, Africa) and European populations (Dalmatia, Yugoslavia). Up to the present time, they are the smallest described. M. laciniatus has euplanktonic behavior and shows a seasonal dimorphism linked to its biological cycle with individuals morphologically close to 2 sspp. of Kiefer: M. l. laciniatus and M. l. atlantis. The validity of these subspecies as distinct taxa is questioned.

The effects of the treatments, particularly of suction dredging of lake bottom sediments and of a 2 stage whole-lake aluminum sulfate [alum] application, were assessed by analyzing population density and biomass fluctuations of Rotifera, Cladocera, and Eucopepoda from several years before and after the treatments were completed. Suction dredging had no apparent effect upon the zooplankton in Liberty Lake. The gross effects of aluminum sulfate applications on the zooplankton population were also minimal. A sharp decline in numbers was observed in all major groups immediately following each alum application, but recovery was evident in the maintenance of typical seasonal growth patterns. The Eucopepoda exhibited rapid recovery following both alum treatments, responding most favorably to the short term oligotrophic-like conditions apparently created by the treatments. Similarities in zooplankton response to the alum application and to the May 1980 Mt. St. Helens ashfall are briefly discussed.																			0270-5060	2156-6941					1984	2	4					393	404		10.1080/02705060.1984.9664617	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1984.9664617													WOS:A1984SJ49600009

Ripe females were present from April-Sept., coinciding with the hot season and rise in water level. First spawning took place at age II in females. No ripe males were found; this was attributed to their spatial separation. Absolute fecundity was related to length and ranged from 327-1466 in 46 females. Hyaline rings on the centra of lumbar vertebrae were counted to age 235 fish. The 1st ring is laid down at the end of the 2nd yr, after which the rings were formed annually, probably during the breeding season. The fish live for up to 6 yr. There is a good fit of the growth curve to the von Bertalanffy equation. Growth is slow and a smaller maximum size is attained than in rivers.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1984	14	1					43	51		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1984.tb00020.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1984.tb00020.x													WOS:A1984SA23300004

Two years before this investigation sewage from 2 villages had been introduced into the lake for several months from a broken sewage pipe under the lake. Although the lake had recovered from this overfertilization it exhibited high production rates and a hypolimnion free of dissolved O2 but rich in hydrogen sulfide. This was due to morphometric conditions (mean depth: 6.3 m) and a high P loading which reached 0.42 g P .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. a-1 and derived mainly from the streams running into the lake. In order to diminish the internal fertilization, hypolimnetic waters were removed through the bottom outlet of the lake regularly in the 2nd 1/2 of the year. This therapy showed 1st improvements of the water quality up to 1983 monitored by transparency measurements.																			0003-9136						1984	100	2					189	205																WOS:A1984SS17800004
J	ADAMS, L				ADAMS, L			AN ANALYSIS OF A POPULATION OF SNOWSHOE HARES IN NORTHWESTERN MONTANA	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												An isolated population of Lepus americanus was studied on a 100-acre island in a lake. Live-trap-mark-and-release studies were directed toward analyses of (1) census techniques, (2) factors affecting abundance and distribution, and (3) natural history of the hares. Recapture data analyzed in two ways, Lincoln Index and calendar-graph, were compared with fecal pellet estimates from sample plots. Factors for converting pellet numbers to hare numbers are 481 pellets per hare-day according to Lincoln Index estimates, 554 according to calendar-graph estimates. Hare abundance and distribution are related to a food-cover-predator relationship, cover density, and physical obstructions. Food grows in the open; when hares leave cover to eat they are more vulnerable to predators, particularly great horned owls. Hare abundance, indicated by pellet numbers, increases with increasing density of tree overstory through four density classes but decreased at the heaviest density. Effects of physical obstructions are qualitatively apparent, but showed no quantitative effect. Natural history: Productivity in 1953 and 1954 was 2.9 pregnancies x 2.6 young per litter, and 2.8 x 3.0, respectively. Average weights were 40 at birth, 1100 at maturity. Trapping records alone showed sex ratios different from the true 1:1 ratio. Mean home ranges were: adult males 25 acres, adult females 19 acres, immature hares 14 acres. Home ranges overlap, but individuals are dispersed by centripetal force of territoriality. Food habits records cover 21 species of plants. Reingestion was observed in the field. Probability of survival from birth to the first breeding season is 0.09 for young, 0.31 for adults during the same time. Mortality and morbidity factors were great horned owl predation, "trap sickness", ringworm and ticks.																			0012-9615	1557-7015					1959	29	2					141	170		10.2307/1942201	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1942201													WOS:A1959WV72100003
J	MAGADZA, CHD				MAGADZA, CHD			SYNOPSIS OF SCIENTIFIC RESULTS OF THE SAREC SPONSORED PROJECT ON THE ECOLOGY OF LAKE KARIBA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												A summary of current research on Lake Kariba is given. Lake Kariba is now a phosphorus limited oligotrophic lake, dependent on annual nutrient input for the maintenance of production. Nitrogen fixation by cyanobacteria has become an important source of nitrogen in the dry season and that fish harvesting is an important phosphorus sink. An up to date plankton composition list has been produced and plankton biomass determined. Diving studies indicate large biomass of bivalves. The aquatic vegetation displays both longitudinal as well as depth gradients, related to light regimes. Only preliminary data are available on mud/water interactions, but the available data indicate considerable fluxes in the river mouth stations and shallow protected littoral areas. The role of predatory birds and crocodiles in the fishery economy of the lake is evaluated and indicates no major conflict between these predators and human fishing interests. The research also draws attention to pesticides in Lake Kariba as indicated by work on fish eating birds and crocodile research. Since the publication of 'Lake Kariba' by Balon & Coche (1975) the research project, THE ECOLOGY OF LAKE KARIBA, being undertaken by the University Lake Kariba Research Station constitutes the first multidisciplinary study of the lake, 30 years after the Zambezi river was impounded at Kariba Gorge. It could have offered a unique opportunity of comparing the lake now with what it was soon after impoundment.

The changes in phosphate concentration together with data for silicate and nitrate are shown. Rainfall, temperature, and total diatom population are also included. An improved method for the determination of phosphate has made possible the recognition of a vernal decline and subsequent autumnal increase in the concentration of this constituent. The changes in the chemical composition of the water are attributed to the influence of conditions in the catchment area rather than changes in the lake itself.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1961	6	3					338	346		10.4319/lo.1961.6.3.0338	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1961.6.3.0338													WOS:A1961WU64700013

Over 90% of plerocercoids are identified as Diphyllobothrium dendriticum (Nitzsch, 1824) but their growth is retarded. Analysis has been conducted of the infection of C. inermis and C. grewinkii on the water area and at depths of the lake depending on the size and age of the fishes and season. The question whether C. inermis and C. grewinkii are additional or reservoir hosts of D. dendriticum in the Baikal ecosystem requires additional experimental studies.																			0031-1847					JAN-FEB	1992	26	1					53	61																WOS:A1992HT40800007

Organic matter in water samples were analyzed by gravimetry. Total organic matter and dissolved organic matter concentrations ranged from 74 to 7908 mg/L and from 23 to 7813 mg/L, respectively. Except for a set of observations which showed low concentrations during the flood season in November 1988, organic matter was regularly distributed throughout SLB. Domestic effluent and aquaculture are hypothesized as major sources of organic matter contamination. The levels of organic matter concentrations in SLB are significantly higher than would be expected for an area considered to be uncontaminated. The data also indicated a linear relationship between concentrations of suspended organic matter and suspended solids. This may be due to the organic matter associated with suspended solids.																			0167-6369					OCT-DEC	1991	19	1-3					457	467		10.1007/BF00401333	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00401333								24233961					WOS:A1991GW30800043
J	GERKING, SD				GERKING, SD			A METHOD OF SAMPLING THE LITTORAL MACROFAUNA AND ITS APPLICATION	ECOLOGY												A new method of sampling the littoral zone of lakes is presented. The method differentiates the bottom dwelling animals, or benthos, from the organisms living in association with the plants, or phytomacrofauna. Two types of samplers are described. In both cases aquatic plants are removed from a square frame which is about 90 cm high and open at both ends. By means of a sliding door at the base of the sampler, the phytomacrofauna is separated from the benthos without disturbing the mud. Samples were taken in 3 spp. of aquatic vegetation. It was found that (1) many more organisms were common on the plants than on the bottom, (2) different quantities of fauna were found on the different plants, (3) seasonal variation in abundance was demonstrated, and (4) preference of some organisms for certain plants was noted. The amount of benthos varied with the development of the plant root system.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1957	38	2					219	226		10.2307/1931680	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1931680													WOS:A1957WR62500004
J	SMITH, SH				SMITH, SH			TEMPERATURE CORRECTION IN CONDUCTIVITY MEASUREMENTS	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Electrical con-ductivity has been widely used in freshwater research but usual methods employed by limnologists for converting measurements to conductance at a given temperature have not given uniformly accurate results. The temperature coefficient used to adjust conductivity of natural waters to a given temperature varies depending on the kinds and concentrations of electrolytes, the temperature at the time of measurement, and the temperature to which measurements are being adjusted. The temperature coefficient was found to differ for various lake and stream waters, and showed seasonal changes. High precision can be obtained only by determining temperature coefficients for each water studied. Mean temperature coefficients are given for various temperature ranges that may be used where less precision is required.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1962	7	3					330	334		10.4319/lo.1962.7.3.0330	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1962.7.3.0330													WOS:A1962WU65100007

Throughout the whole examination periods, from January to May, a mode of body length was recognized in 25 cm to 26 cm mainly, although small number of smaller or larger fishes were caught up. However, the frequency of the appearance of small fishes started to increase in July and the mode was shifted to 18 to 19 cm. In November, large-sized fishes with the body length of 28 cm or more ascended a stream for spawning and disappeared from the lake or were remained in a small number. It can be assumed that the recruitment into the fishing ground as fishing resources starts mostly in May when fishes grow into certain size with the main group having 18 to 19 cm of body length, thus filling the space left after the ascending.																			0021-5392					AUG	1991	57	8					1427	1435																WOS:A1991GP40900002

Mosquitoes of 15 spp. [Aedes canadensis, A. cinereus, A. communis group, A. dorsalis, A. excrucians, A. fitchii group, A. flavescens, A. riparius, A. spencerii, A. vexans, Aedes sp., Anopheles earlei, Mansonia perturbans, Culiseta alaskaensis, C. inornata and C. morsitans] or species groups were collected in nearly the same proportions in the stable trap as on cattle in the open. Combined attack rates of all species were highest in late July and early Aug. when the mosquitoes arrived at a tethered calf faster than they could be collected. The stable trap caught more mosquitoes, but still underestimated the relative abundance of some species because it hindered their entry. The most abundant mosquitoes were A. vexans, A. communis group, C. inornata, C. alaskaensis, A. spencerii, A. fitchii group and A. flavescens. Cattle in field were severely disturbed by mosquitoes in late May (chiefly A. spencerii) and from mid-July to early Aug. (chiefly A. vexans, A. spencerii and C. inornata).

Gulls (218) were stained in different colors and marked with wing-tags to observe how they change their territories inside the colony. The functional center, pericenter and peripheral parts of this colony are separated from each other spatially. The number of intrusions in the center markedly exceeds those in the other parts of the colony. Many gulls which had their territories in the pericenter and peripheral parts resettle in the center and nest there. No resettlements from the center followed by nesting in any peripheral part of the colony were ever registered. The resettlements from the center to the adjacent pericenter can sometimes be observed due to competition for the places of nesting in the center of the colony.

The concentrations of soluble inorganic chemical species were determined by ion-chromatography, ion electrode, atomic absorption and emission spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry. The results were analyzed statistically using the principal component analysis, in order to know the source of the anthropogenic pollutants which made the lake one of the most polluted in Japan (by the COD value). The pollutant such as phosphate and ammonium ions were found to enter mainly from the two rivers, River O-hori and River Ohtsu. The population on the catchment of them were known to be high. These species which showed high seasonal variation and the variation between stations were supposed to be highly influenced by human activity. On the other hand, the concentrations of sulfate, sodium, chloride, calcium, strontium were found to show little variation with the respect of season nor of the stations. The concentration of trace elements such as iron, manganese and zinc always showed higher values in the river than in the lake water, while that of vanadium was higher in the lake. This fact might show that the high pH value of the lake (9.2 approximately 9.5) was the main factor in deciding chemical form of these elements in the lake. Discussions were done comparing the data with those of other researchers.																			0369-4577					MAY	1991		5					484	490		10.1246/nikkashi.1991.484	http://dx.doi.org/10.1246/nikkashi.1991.484													WOS:A1991FQ08800025

J	VAQUER, A; ELHAFA, M				VAQUER, A; ELHAFA, M			PRIMARY PRODUCTION OF PHYTOPLANKTON IN AN OLIGOMESOTROPHIC LAKE	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The seasonal and vertical distribution of chlorophyll-a concentration and primary production in the reservoir of Sainte Croix (Provence, France) were studied during the 1985-1986 period. The temporal variations of both chlorophyll-a concentrations and primary productivity were similar from one year to the next. Chlorophyll-a concentrations generally varied between 0.1 and 3.5 mg m-3. The average annual concentrations were quite similar between 1985 (0.99 mg m-3) and 1986 (1.08 mg m-3). The maximum concentrations were measured between 2.5 and 10m from January to June and on average at 15 m depth, coinciding with the mean depth of the euphotic zone, from July to November. Daily primary production (on average 245 and 93mgCm-2d-1 respectively in 1985 and 1986) ranged between 7.8 and 722 mg Cm-2d-1. Vertical profiles indicated a light inhibition of photosynthetic activity at the top of the water column and maximum values always in the upper 2.5-10 m. The seasonal development and vertical distribution of phytoplankton depend typically on temperature and irradiance during the mixing period and on nutrients and biological factors during the thermal stratification. Low mean levels of chlorophyll-a and primary production, found here, are typical of oligotrophic lakes. Total phosphorus (20.2 mg m-3) and Secchi disc transparency (5.4 m) are typical of mesotrophic lakes. This discrepancy between these usual factors indicates that some other important factors act on the functioning of the Lake Sainte Croix. Especially, the decrease of the N/P ratios from 10 to 6 indicates a possible nitrogen limitation during the stratification period in the epilimnion. Finally, the low water transparency suggests, as a hypothesis, that calcium carbonate precipitation limits the phytoplankton development and plays an important role against eutrophication.																			0003-9136					APR	1991	121	2					203	217																WOS:A1991FL44900006

GENERAL-ASPECTS	SCHWEIZER ARCHIV FUR TIERHEILKUNDE												The entire diagnostic material of the Fish Disease Laboratory at the University of Berne from 1979 to 1988, a total of more than 3800 cases, is presented. Not included is material of import controls and material from experimental work. The following criteria were evaluated: fish species, origin and length of fish, season, infectious and noninfectious diseases. Furthermore, the results were investigated for changes of the composition of fish species and number of diseases within the ten-year period and for a seasonal influence on the outbreak of diseases. More than 40% of all fish investigated were rainbow trout, followed by brown trout, ornamental fish and cyprinids. Over 40% of fish originated from private fishfarms whereas 20% were of governmental origin (governmental fishfarms, rivers, lakes) and 20% from aquaria. Parasites were present in more than 40% of all cases. Bacterial infections were diagnosed in nearly 30%, viral infections in 6% and fungal diseases in 5% of all cases. 20% of all cases concerning noninfectious diseases were caused by unfavourable environmental conditions whereas the incidence of diseases related to nutrition was less than 10%. The occurence of the different diseases was waxing and waning over the period of ten years but no definite tendencies could be emphasized. However, most of the diseases investigated demonstrated a significant seasonal influence.																			0036-7281						1991	133	9					441	449											1771407					WOS:A1991GP34800005

J	PENNAK, RW				PENNAK, RW			SPECIES COMPOSITION OF LIMNETIC ZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITIES	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The species composition of limnetic zooplankton communities in 27 Colorado lakes has been determined on the basis of 148 vertical series of plankton-trap samples. Each such series consisted of three or more evenly spaced samples taken from surface to bottom in the limnetic area. Comparable quantitative data for 42 selected lakes in other parts of the world are also considered, such samples having been taken with the plankton trap, pump, Clarke-Bumpus sampler, closing net, etc. Momentarily, the great majority of Colorado limnetic communities contained one or two species of copepods, one to three species of cladocerans, and three to seven species of rotifers. Comparable data for other small to medium-sized lakes of the world were one to three copepods, two to four cladocerans, and three to seven rotifers. From a species standpoint, therefore, these limnetic communities are remarkably simple. Depending on the complexities of cyclic and seasonal abundance, however, the individual species making up these communities change from one time of the year to another. The most common and widely distributed North American species are contained in the following genera: Cyclops, Mesocyclops, Diaptomus (Copepoda); Daphnia, Bosmina, Diaphanosoma, Ceriodaphnia, Chydorus (Cladocera); Keratella, Polyarthra, Filinia, Kellicottia, Conochilus, Asplanchna, Synchaeta (Rotatoria). It is unusual to find more than one species in the same genus in a limnetic community at the same time, at least when ordinary quantitative sampling methods are used. But when two species in the same genus do occur together, one is usually 20 or more times as abundant as the other. These and other phenomena are discussed with particular reference to the "niche" concept. In spite of the cyclic waxing and waning of populations of individual zooplankton species, the great majority of limnetic communities are characterized at any one time by one numerically dominant species of copepod, one dominant cladoceran, and one dominant rotifer. Thus, adequate sampling in "typical" lakes shows that, on the average, 80 per cent of all limnetic copepods belong to one species, 78 per cent of all cladocerans belong to one species, and 64 per cent of all rotifers to one species.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1957	2	3					222	232		10.1002/lno.1957.2.3.0222	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.1957.2.3.0222													WOS:A1957WX63500005
J	PYCHA, RL				PYCHA, RL			THE RELATIVE EFFICIENCY OF NYLON AND COTTON GILL NETS FOR TAKING LAKE TROUT IN LAKE SUPERIOR	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												The change from cotton to nylon twine for gill nets in 1949-52 resulted in a sharp increase in the efficiency of the most important gear used for taking lake trout in Lake Superior, and consequently, biased estimates of fishing intensity and abundance severely. From early May to the end of September 1961, short gangs (2000 or 4000 linear feet) of cotton and nylon nets were fished in parallel sets for lake trout. A total of 343,000 feet of gill netting was lifted. Nylon nets were 2.25 times as efficient as cotton nets for taking legal-sized fish and 2.8 times as efficient for undersized lake trout. The average lengths of legal, undersized, and all lake trout taken in nets of the two materials did not differ greatly. The percentage of the catch which was undersized (less than 1.25 lb, dressed weight) was 20.8 in nylon nets and 17.7 in cotton. The relative efficiency of cotton and nylon nets showed no trend during the season. The efficiency ratio determined in this study was closely similar to that obtained by earlier workers.																									1962	19	6					1085	1094		10.1139/f62-071	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f62-071													WOS:A1962WV54000009
J	AKSIRAY, F				AKSIRAY, F			ENVIRONMENTAL LIMITING FACTORS AFFECTING THE GROWTH AND SPREAD OF CHALCALBURNUS-TARICHI (PALL 1881) (PISCES, CYPRINIDAE) IN BURDUR LAKE	WATER RESEARCH												Burdur Lake, an entirely closed and brackis water lake, having an area of 190 km2 and 76 m depth, is located in the Lakes of Anatolia, 4 km from the west of Burdur city. Many attempts to breed an economically important fish population were made but all attempts were unsuccessful. From 1946-1948 hydrobiological investigations were carried out. Hydrobiological conditions of the lake suitable for C. tarichi (Pall 1881) (Pisces: Cyprinidae), a fish which is endemic to Lake Van in eastern Anatolia. Since 1966 an attempt has been made to breed C. tarichi artificially. This attempt was successful, but the economic productivity was not at the estimated level. These fish live at all depths of the lake, but during the breeding season, they go into freshwater streams flowing into the lake. Two research stations were chosen where water, plankton and bottom samplings were collected. Nansen bottles were used to take the water samples, in 10 m intervals, from the surface of water towards the bottom. The chemical analysis of water was done according to the standard methods given in Welcher (1963). The Winkler method was used to find out the amount of dissolved O2 (Welcher, 1963). Plankton was collected in 10 m intervals by usual type Closing net (20 cm diameter, mesh size of 0.05 mm). The amount of plankton per m3 was calculated according to the Settling methods of Welch (1948). Bottom samples were collected by Ekman''s Dredge at 4 different regions. Samples were wet sieved through 4 graded sieves (mesh sizes 0.5-2.0 mm). The number of the collected bottom animals per m2 were calculated. The direct flow of waste waters having organic materials from the Burdur Sugar Mill, Milk-Cheese factories and Attar of Rose industries and Hemp (Canabis sativa) maceration remnants go to the bottom of the lake forming an unoxygenated and hydrogensulfonized water layer. The unoxygenated water layer level increased 2-2.5 m/yr towards the surface. This pollution caused this unexpected loss of productivity of fish, for this water layer harms the bottom feeding and planktonic organism and restricts the spreading and development of the adopted C. tarichi. This situation is a threat to the future of the lake and its environment.																			0043-1354	1879-2448					1982	16	7					1107	1112		10.1016/0043-1354(82)90126-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(82)90126-9													WOS:A1982NT13500005

Rates of photorespiration and organic carbon release were very low in both species during most of the growth season and were not a factor in the difference in photosynthetic rates. Both species were growing under optimal conditions, and the superior photosynthetic capacity of Nymphaea appeared to be associated with phenological differences permitting this species to compete successfully (i.e. coexist) with the earlier emerging, broader leaved Nuphar species.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				JUN	1990	5	3					307	312		10.1080/02705060.1990.9665244	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1990.9665244													WOS:A1990DT31200007

Of the trout displaced about 1.8 km from their spawning ground from 1972-1975, 9-32% were recaptured 1-4 times within the same spawning season in trap nets set on the spawning ground. Eight of 14 trout tracked ultrasonically in 1975 homed in 2.5-10.0 h. Movements of the homing fish were variable; some trout homed paralleling the shoreline, others homed in open water or used a combination of near-shore and open-water movements. Behavior was similar between the sexes and during day and night, although 2 fish did begin to move just at sundown. Swimming speeds ranged from 15-35 cm s-1 and averaged about 0.6 body lengths s-1. Swimming directions were not influenced by wind and wave direction, nor were swimming speeds within individual tracks influenced by cloud cover, wave height, or water depth. Heavy overcast at night may have inhibited movement. Sunapee trout are apparently familiar with the entire lake and travel widely within it. Visual features are postulated as orientational cues, though use of such cues is not clearly demonstrated by the experiments.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1977	106	2					156	162		10.1577/1548-8659(1977)106<156:WHMODM>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1977)106<156:WHMODM>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1977DG03800006
J	THORNTON, JA				THORNTON, JA			ASPECTS OF THE PHOSPHORUS CYCLE IN HARTBEESPOORT DAM (SOUTH-AFRICA) - PHOSPHORUS KINETICS	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The role of biotic processes in a warm, monomictic, hypertrophic African impoundment (Hartbeespoort Dam) is examined using 32P radiobioassays. Phosphorus demand is assessed by phosphorus turnover times, alkaline phosphatase activity, cellular phosphorus status and the phosphorus deficiency index. Long turnover times indicative of an enriched system were recorded, ranging from 9 h to 1992 h, with no evidence of phosphorus stress being present. These turnover times support the hypothesis that the phosphorus cycle in Hartbeespoort Dam is dominated by the algal community which is shown to play an important role in phosphorus cycling within the water column. However, hydrological processes remain the driving force in phosphorus seasonality in the lake.

Eggs incubated at the Chautauqua Hatchery and transferred to other stations resulted in swimming fish, but those held at Chautauqua did not. The chemistry of lake and well water at the muskellunge hatchery showed no departures from normal. During the production seasons of 1974-1976 the hatchery was operated on a controlled, experimental basis to determine the cause of the fry losses. Fry die-offs could be correlated with neither the physical or chemical properties of the water nor with the presence of a fish pathogenic virus or pathological tissue changes. Controlled laboratory experiments strongly implicated bacteria as the agents responsible for the muskellunge fry losses. Organisms recovered included predominately Pseudomonas sp., although Aeromonas hydrophila was also isolated; both are well-known fish pathogens. UV treatment of lake and well water supplies during incubation and yolk absorption resulted in effective control of fry losses.																			0033-0779						1981	43	1					17	20		10.1577/1548-8659(1981)43[17:CACOMF]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1981)43[17:CACOMF]2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1981LE67000005

The seasonal growth cycle at each depth is discussed in relation to the more detailed sampling at shallow stations on these and other lakes and to the environmental factors. Growth of algae is considerably reduced at 6 m and below 8 m is practically nil. There was not a steady decrease in growth from 1-6 m. Growth was probably at its optimum at 3 m and at 2 and 4 m the population was reduced, possibly related to a physical removal of cells.

Most-intensive observations were made during the breeding season (Septebmer to February) at Lake Cowal, New South Wales. The repertoire of social displays is described for the royal spoonbill Platalea regia and the yellow-billed spoonbill P. flavipes. Their repertoires contain at least 17 distinct displays, 13 of which are similar to those previously described in the African spoonbill P. alba. Possible evolutionary pathways in the development of some of these displays are discussed. Some behavioral clues and morphological characters indicate that the royal spoonbill should perhaps be considered a separate species, from the Eurasian spoonbill P. leucorodia. Further study is needed to determine how closely related the royal spoonbill is to the black-faced spoonbill P. minor, of eastern Asia.																			8755-724X					WIN	1988	4	1					88	111																WOS:A1988L650800008

The results generally conform to an outline of seasonal changes previously recorded for 1952-4. At the period of strongest stratification a shallow and almost deoxygenated lower layer is marked off by a distinct but deep thermal discontinuity. The vertical distribution of the planktonic algae during the period of strong thermal stratification is described, with the effects of a later change to more isothermal conditions. Some conspicuous differences between the various species are recorded and classified; thus maximum densities of different species are variously found in upper, middle, and lower layers. These differences are considered to arise mainly from different sinking rates and capacities to withstand conditions in a deoxygenated lower layer. The relation between algal distribution and the photosynthetic zone is briefly discussed.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1957	2	3					213	221		10.1002/lno.1957.2.3.0213	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.1957.2.3.0213													WOS:A1957WX63500004

Due to the complex nature of the study area, a method was needed to map extensive plant populations while allowing simultaneous on-site inspections of the macrophyte communities. Within the open portions of the reservoir, the boundaries of macrophyte beds were identified and their coordinates determined by the Automated Positioning System (APS). However, due to line-of-slight limitations, the APS could not be effectively used in areas dominated by dense tree stands. For the 1983 growing season, we identified boundary coordinates for more than 200 individual macrophyte beds (subsegments), located within 13 segments of upper Lake Marion. The entire process required approximately 80 man-days of field effort. The time required for mapping was reduced to 40 man-days for the 1984 growing season.																			0146-6623					JAN	1988	26						38	43																WOS:A1988M449600007

To run these models, a variety of input data on receiving water-body properties and water-quality parameters that define a range of environments and influence the chemical-specific rate coefficients must be developed. A data base that contains selected hydrologic and water quality parameters has been developed by EPA for 15 major U.S. river basins. Called the Canonical Environments Data Base, the file brings together information developed by public and private organizations on each reach of the rivers as well as individual lakes and reservoirs in the basins. Coupling raw data with a data base management system in this environmental file will facilitate entry into and deletions from the data base and development of data input to the Exposure Analysis Modeling System (EXAMS) and other similar exposure assessment mathematical models. To assure compatibility with simplified process models, average monthly or seasonal values for each parameter are being stored in the data base. The structure of the data base is similar to that of the REACH File, and EPA-developed data base that defines the hydrologic connections between rivers, their tributaries, and associated lakes and reservoirs. This paper describes the development of the Canonical Environments Data Base and the hydrologic and water quality parameters that are included in the file.																			1093-4529	1532-4117					1988	23	2					103	126		10.1080/10934528809375397	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934528809375397													WOS:A1988M754100002
J	RUSSELL, JS; CHAPMAN, AL				RUSSELL, JS; CHAPMAN, AL			SULFUR DEFICIENCY IN RICE GROWN ON THE ALKALINE SOILS OF THE ORD IRRIGATION AREA, WESTERN AUSTRALIA	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE												Nutrient and acidification effects of sulfur (S) on the growth of flooded rice on Cununurra clay from the Ord Irrigation Area, Western Australia, were studied in pot experiments. An acute S deficiency in the surface horizon of Cununurra clay was found. This deficiency was extreme on virgin soil but was also evident on cropped soil that had received substantial amounts of S as superphosphate and ammonium sulfate in the past. The major effect of an application of elemental S on rice growth was as a nutrient. Irrigation water appears to be an important source of nutrient S in this remote area where annual atmospheric accessions of S are estimated to be about 1 kg ha-1. The S content of Ord irrigation water from Lake Argyle is relatively low (mean .+-. s.e. sulfate-S=1.7 .+-. 0.05 mg L-1) by world standards. Nevertheless, in this study, 62% of the S added with the Ord irrigation water was recovered in the plant tops. This indicates that factors which determine the amount of irrigation water applied are likely to affect the field incidence of S deficiency. In particular, decreased usage of irrigation water during the December-March wet season (when average rainfall is 630 mm) may increase the likelihood of S deficiency in rice.																			0816-1089	1836-5787					1988	28	1					111	117		10.1071/EA9880111	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/EA9880111													WOS:A1988N144000017

Fecal pellets of L. c. catascopium contain less organic detritus (50%) and more mineral particles (35%) than the digestive tract contents of Prosobranchia Viviparus malleatus (70 and 10%), sampled in 1 of the stations. The amounts of the total algae (16 vs. 20%) and those of each group and genus of algae are in the same order of magnitude in both.

VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION OF MICROBIAL-POPULATIONS AND CHEMICAL-ANALYSES OF THEIR ENVIRONMENTS	ECOLOGY												Flathead and Rogers Lakes, Montana, were compared chemically and biologically, with particular reference to the vertical distribution of bacteria and fungi. Chemically both lakes were alkaline, neither had an oxygen deficiency, CO2 as carbonate was present in significant amounts in Flathead Lake and even higher levels in Rogers Lake, ammonia was usually present, nitrite was absent except for 1 record in Flathead Lake, nitrates were present but variable and iron and phosphates were of sporadic occurrence in Flathead Lake and absent in Rogers except for a single record. The largest bacterial populations were found at the surface and adjacent to the bottom. Bottom mud populations exceeded water populations. Seasonal changes accounted for some differences in the water populations. Chromogens were characteristic of the water bacteria in both lakes. Some chromogens were found to be endemic to a given region. There is evidence that the bacterial populations of water and mud are autochthonous. There was no evidence of vertical distribution of the fungus population. The greatest diversity of species occurred in the open stations of both lakes. A total of 98 species was found in Flathead Lake and 36 in Rogers. From 20-54% of the Flathead Lake species were common to water and mud; and 41% in Rogers Lake. The fungus populations do not appear to be autocthonous for the two habitats.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1961	42	2					338	+		10.2307/1932084	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1932084													WOS:A19611611400021

The seasonal variation of the water temperature which ranged from 10.degree. C to 30.degree. C, alllied to the absence of a thermal stratification identifies this lake as a Third Order Tropical Lake. On the other hand, the acid reaction of the waters as well as the low conductivity, black colour and high amount of organic matter in the sediments and in suspension demonstrate that the lake waters belong to the series of the blackwaters. The lake biocensis shows an impoverishment of the species diversity when compared to the results available for other neighboring freshwater biocensis. The macrophytes and the local winds are considered to play a remarkable role in the quality of the lake waters.																			0001-3765	1678-2690					1987	59	1-2					121	128																WOS:A1987K332300011
J	JONASSON, PM				JONASSON, PM			GROWTH OF PLUMATELLA REPENS + P FUNGOSA ( BRYOZOA ECTOPROCTA ) IN RELATION TO EXTERNAL FACTORS IN DANISH EUTROPHIC LAKES	OIKOS												The usual poor development of ectoprocts in Lake Esrom, Denmark is associated with a lack of suitable substrata except along shores, where the wave action is too great for growth of these forms. Colonies of Plumatella repens and of Cristatella mucedo occurred in large numbers, however, on the metal gauze of insect traps placed in the lake, indicating that otherwise the conditions for the growth of ectoprocts is suitable. Colonies commenced growth in August. The seasonal trends of growth for P. repens in wet weight per trap are shown. Growth of ectoprocts oil nylon fishing traps used in lakes NOrre, SorO and Tis are discussed. Similar growths did not occur in previous years when the nets were made of cotton rather than of nylon. The species involved in this growth in the smaller, more sheltered lakes appears to have been entirely P. fungosa. In lakes SorO and NOrre the growth was very rapid, and was to be measured in kilograms, as compared to grams in Lake Esrom. This is thought to be caused by the much greater production of phytoplankton in the 1st 2 lakes than in the third; the main food of the ectoprocts under consideration is the phytoplankton. A very large primary production in lakes Pedersborg and Tuel, on the other hand, has not led to the development of ectoprocts. This is believed to be because of greater pollution in these lakes.																			0030-1299	1600-0706					1963	14	2					121	+		10.2307/3564968	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3564968													WOS:A19639546B00006
J	ARNOLD, CA; LOWTHER, JS				ARNOLD, CA; LOWTHER, JS			A NEW CRETACEOUS CONIFER FROM NORTHERN ALASKA	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												PARATAXODIUM wigginsii n. gen. et sp. is a member of the Taxodiaceae from the Upper Cretaceous of northern Alaska that is intermediate between Metasequoia and Taxodium. The material consists of leafy twigs, seed cones, and staminate inflorescences preserved in limestone. It resembles the debris on a forest floor that had been washed away by the seasonal overflowings of a sluggish stream and deposited in a shallow lake. The leafy twigs consist of deciduous long and short shoots that were borne and shed in the same manner as those of Taxodium. The leaves are predominantly alternate, but the angle of divergence and the shape of the leaves are strongly like Metasequoia. The small deciduous seed cones were borne on naked peduncles, like those of Matasequoia. The staminate inflorescences are branched like those of Taxodium mucronatum but the staminate cones are nearly opposite. Parataxodium may represent the actual ancestral stock of Taxodium and Metasequoia. It shows fewer resemblances with Sequoia which the fossil record indicates as having originated sooner.																			0002-9122	1537-2197					1955	42	6					522	528		10.2307/2438688	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2438688													WOS:A1955WN37700006

Observations from March 1973-Oct. 1974 are described; this is the 2nd part of a report on a project spanning 4 yr. Seasonal population densities of the more abundant species were essentially similar to those observed in the 1st part of the project, despite large changes in algal and predator populations. In the enclosures, fish (mostly Perca fluviatilis) populations were large in the period under consideration and small in the 1st part of the project.

J	MCCULLOUGH, FS				MCCULLOUGH, FS			LYMNAEA NATALENSIS AND FASCIOLIASIS IN GHANA	ANNALS OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY												The distribution of Lymnaea natalensis in Ghana is described, and is discussed in relation to the geology of the country and to the bionomics of the snails. There is little doubt that the snails will become more widespread in the future. L. natalensis in Ghana is restricted to permanent water-bodies, still or slowflowing, irrespective of whether they occur in forest or in savannah vegetational zones. In permanent swamps the species is rare. The seasonal population fluctuations of L. natalensis are descirbed in relation to the alternating wet and dry seasons. The snail population begins to increase during the latter part of the wet season, reaches a peak during the early dry season, and is in decline during the late dry season and the early-to-mid wet season. This pattern is considered in relation to the potential application of molluscicides. Factors governing the epidemiology of fascioliasis in Ghana are discussed. At present it is apparently not an important disease of livestock, nor is it likely to be so unless sites favorable both for the survival of L. natalensis and for the transmission of Fasciola gigantica are subsequently provided, in particular along the northern shoreline of the new Volta lake.																			0003-4983	1364-8594					1965	59	3					320	+		10.1080/00034983.1965.11686314	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00034983.1965.11686314													WOS:A19657008800008

A mean increase rate of 1.3 vegetative divisions per week for 7.5 weeks was recorded. When growth conditions were favorable, grazing, parasitism and wave action had little effect on population density. A mean decrease rate equivalent to a loss of 3.5 divisions per week was maintained for 3.5 weeks when adverse nutrient conditions were arresting growth.

CULTIVATION AND GENERAL OBSERVATIONS	JOURNAL OF PROTOZOOLOGY												P. palustris occurs more or less abundantly in Congers Lake, N.Y. throughout the year. In-vitro cultivation was established for the 1st time for this organism in the filtered lake water containing filamentous algae in Carrel flasks which are kept at 18-24[degree]C in diffused daylight. This allows observation of the organisms under a stereoscopic microscope without disturbing them. Ihgestion of foreign matter by individuals undergoing locomotion takes place in the posterior half of the body where frequently villous projections occur. Feeding is an extremely slow process and the organisms are incapable of capturing and ingesting actively motile organisms. Growth is also slow and plasmotomy occurs less frequently as compared with that of P. carolinensis or P. illinoisen-sis. Plasmotomy is the sole mode of multiplication. The findings and views of previous investigators on the geographical and seasonal distribution, longevity and behavior in the laboratory, and reproduction of this organism are reviewed and discussed.																			0022-3921						1957	4	3					154	164		10.1111/j.1550-7408.1957.tb02502.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1550-7408.1957.tb02502.x													WOS:A1957XE37900004
J	IMBER, MJ; WILLIAMS, GR				IMBER, MJ; WILLIAMS, GR			MORTALITY RATES OF A CANADA GOOSE POPULATION IN NEW ZEALAND	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Between 1957 and 1967 inclusive, 14,436 Canada geese (Branta canadensis) were banded in molt at Lake Ellesmere, New Zealand. Apart from a negligible proportion of residents, the birds were non-breeders, aged 1 year and older, of a migratory population. The 1st year recovery rate of bands from geese shot between 1957-62 was 4. 1 %; between 1963-66 it was 13.6 [degree]/o. Higher hunting pressure in the latter period was caused by annual special shooting seasons introduced to control the population. Mean annual mortality in the former period was 17 [degree]/o, comprising approximately 10 [degree]/o by natural mortality and 7 [degree]/o by hunting. First-year mortality is not known. Productivity is estimated to have been 2 young per pair from the age of 3 years. Mortality of about 75 [degree]/o in their 1st year would have stabilized the population which was certainly increasing at that time. In the latter period the mean annual mortality was 33 [degree]/o for birds over 3 years of age. Those between 1 and 3 years of age were subjected to higher hunting pressure but an estimated mortality rate for yearlings was the same as for adults. Up to 70 [degree]/o of geese aged over 1 year dying in this period were shot. Productivity of almost 3 young per pair from the age of 3 years would have maintained this population. Reasons are given for believing that adequate productivity could have been achieved.

Dispersal was in accord with bivariate density functions summed appropriately to give 25 discrete components, with the standard deviations related to observed swimming speeds. Directionally biased dispersal was simulated using the lognormal density function. Natural movement of sockeye underyearlings in Babine Lake suggests 3 seasonal periods: (1) May 25-June 12; (2) July 13-Aug. 28; (3) Aug. 29-Oct. 12. For (1), natural movement is best simulated by assuming that 90% of the fish move with a 10:90 bias toward southward movement, while 10% of the fish move at random; for (2), the best assumptions are that 50% of the fish move with a 90:10 bias for northward movement and 50% move at random; for (3), the best simulation assumed that 100% of the fry move at random. Considering the simplicity of the model assumptions, the fit to the data for natural movements is good. To construct a better predictive model, the directional bias mimicked by the lognormal density function should be divided into components related to physical circulation in the lake basin and components related to fry behavior. The architecture of the computer program is briefly described and could be applied to other salmon dispersal studies.																									1977	34	9					1379	1388		10.1139/f77-198	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f77-198													WOS:A1977DS97700010
J	MILLER, LF				MILLER, LF			ACUTE RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS IN NAVAL PERSONNEL	MILITARY MEDICINE												The problem of acute respiratory disease is of major importance and constitutes the principal cause of hospital and dispensary admissions in the Navy and Marine Corps. Recruits experience a disproportionate incidence of this illness. Evidence obtained by Naval Medical Research Unit No. 4 strongly supports the supposition that airborne spread is an important means of transmission of acute respiratory disease agents. Ultraviolet light irradiation studies have provided the most unequivocable evidence that droplet nuclei play an important role in recruit disease. Delineation of the comparative roles of direct contact, including droplet spread, and of spread by droplet nuclei requires further research. The availability of newer techniques and in particular, methods for studying of airborne Mycoplasma and viruses makes further study attractive and a relatively high priority should be given to a study of survival of adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae agents under conditions of varying relative humidity. Perhaps such a study would explain, at least in part, the reason these 2 agents have different seasonal peaks of incidence and serve as a partial explanation for the apparent occurrence of highest M. pneumoniae incidence in naval recruits at Great Lakes during periods of higher ventilation rates in their living spaces.																			0026-4075	1930-613X					1964	129	6					526	+		10.1093/milmed/129.6.526	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/milmed/129.6.526								14174095					WOS:A19648339B00016

Investigation in 1961, 1962, and 1963 of the taxonomic status of migrant sandhill cranes at Last Mountain Lake, Saskatchewan, indicated that color of primary feather shafts is not a reliable taxonomic character. Significant differences between adult males and females in weights, lengths of bill from tip to posterior of nostril, tarsus, mid-toe, and total length require that sexes be distinguished when these characters are used for taxonomic purposes, but broad overlap precludes their use for determining sex. Observed frequencies of weights and lengths of tarsus, bill, and bill from tip to posterior of nostril conformed to a normal distribution, but, using the existing criteria, 75% of adult males from Last Mountain Lake could not be classified as one of the reported subspecies. It is concluded that use of the existing criteria to differentiate the greater, the lesser, and the Canada sandhill cranes is unwarranted. There were few sandhill crane hunters during the 1964 and 1965 seasons in Canada. Most were seeking recreation; hunting success was low. Because recruitment rate of cranes is low, effective management requires a high degree of confidence in data on crane populations.																			0022-541X	1937-2817					1966	30	3					581	+		10.2307/3798751	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3798751													WOS:A19668077000019

USE OF ORGANIC MANURE, INORGANIC FERTILIZERS, AND COTTON-SEED ASH	EMPIRE JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE												On the hill-sand soils at Ukiriguru most soil treatments bring handsome rewards. There have been very good responses to applications of cattle manure, lasting with the heavier dressings for at least fourteen growing seasons. There have been responses to phosphorus applications, probably for more than three seasons. In most seasons there have been valuable nitrogen-phosphorus interactions. The mean responses, from cattle manure certainly, and phosphorus probably, over a succession of three-season cycles, indicate that a build-up in fertility takes place. The heavier dressings of phosphorus with top-dressed nitrogen, allowing for variations in application, have given mean responses of the order of 500 lb. seed cotton per acre per season. This tends to be slightly better than the responses to 6 tons of cattle manure per acre applied once in every three seasons - but withoutthe long-continuing residual benefits. The responses to nitrogen and phosphorus at more than one level are discussed, and recommendations are made on the use of cattle manure and inorganic fertilizers.																									1962	30	119					215	+																WOS:A19621240B00008

The role of water characteristics on fish population distribution and subsequent changes in the CUE was also noted.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1984	110	MAR					315	317		10.1007/BF00025803	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00025803													WOS:A1984SN32200035
J	SCOTT, DC				SCOTT, DC			ACTIVITY PATTERNS OF PERCH, PERCA-FLAVESCENS, IN RONDEAU BAY OF LAKE ERIE	ECOLOGY												In Rondeau Bay, Ontario, 2- and 3-yr-old perch from May to Sept. showed marked patterns of activity, as measured by gill-net catches. One group concentrated at end of bay nearer to Lake Erie migrated daily at sunrise to feed principally upon Daphnia pulex and returned before sunset. 2nd group remaining in bay differed by a greater length, a larger proportion of females and different feeding habits. All perch were very inactive at night. Times of migration changed according to seasonal changes in times of sunrise and sunset. A striking relationship between activity of perch and sunrise and sunset indicated that light was an important factor in timing of day''s activity.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1955	36	2					320	327		10.2307/1933239	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1933239													WOS:A1955WR61700018

A correction being made for a tag loss of 58%, it was estimated that 30% of the transplanted fish had appeared in the anglers'' catch. The mean catch of maskinonge from Pigeon Lake for the seasons of 1961-65 was estimated to be 1318 fish per year. About 4% of the annual catch from Pigeon Lake was attributed directly to fish transplanted from Nogies Creek. From a catch curve the rate of total mortality of Pigeon Lake maskinonge age V or older was estimated to be 43% per year. Partitioning this into mortality due to fishing and mortality from other causes yielded estimates of 24.5% for each of these components.																									1968	25	6					1145	+		10.1139/f68-100	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f68-100													WOS:A1968B308800004
J	FRASER, JM				FRASER, JM			THE SMALLMOUTH BASS FISHERY OF SOUTH BAY, LAKE HURON	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												The smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieui) population of South Bay, Lake Huron and the sport fishery imposed on it have been studied by means of marking and creel census carried out during the years 1947 to 1952 inclusive. Population estimates of legal-sized bass (over 10 inches-fork length), based on the recovery of marked fish, show a decrease from 5900 fish in 1947 to 2900 in 1949 with an increase again to 5700 in 1952. The number of bass caught per 100 rod-hours in these years was 89, 51 and 87, respectively. The recovery of the population from its low in 1949 was due solely to the 1947 year-class which dominated the fishery in 1950, 1951 and 1952, contributing 34%, 71% and 67%, respectively, of the anglers'' catch in these years. Analysis of scale samples of the anglers'' catch shows considerable variation in year-class strength. In constrast to the 3500 fish contributed to the anglers'' creel by the 1947 year-class, the 1945 year-class contributed only 400 fish. South Bay bass enter the sport fishery in small numbers at age III and 70% of the anglers'' catch consisted of age-III to age-V fish. 60 percent of the legal-sized population of bass present in South Bay in one year are taken by anglers in the succeeding 4-5 years at the present exploitation. A large percentage of the bass population is located in the Inner Basin of South Bay where they are dispersed in varying concentrations along the shoreline. During the 5-year study 3331 bass were tagged and, although the loss of tags was high, 692 were recaptured by trap nets in the same season they were released. Eighty-five percent of these were taken within 2 miles of their release point. Of 60 bass re- captured a year after tagging, 43 (72%) were taken within 2 miles of their release point. Only 5 percent of all recorded recaptures were caught over 5 miles from their release point. Larger bass tended to range farther than small bass.																									1955	12	1					147	177		10.1139/f55-012	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f55-012													WOS:A1955WZ51100012

Overall mortality occurring among the throwback fish in 3 days or less was found to be 11% or less. Greater losses (22%) were indicated in the late season than early season (10%). There was no significant difference in the mortality rates for the rainbow and hybrid trout or for different sizes of fish. Delayed mortality was somewhat greater than immediate mortality. It was concluded that losses would not significantly affect a quality fishing program in operation at the lake.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1966	95	3					326	+		10.1577/1548-8659(1966)95[326:MOTCOA]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1966)95[326:MOTCOA]2.0.CO;2													WOS:A19668010400015
J	MOORE, JN				MOORE, JN			THE ORIGIN OF CALCIUM-CARBONATE NODULES FORMING ON FLATHEAD LAKE DELTA, NORTHWESTERN MONTANA	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The subaqueous levees of Flathead Lake delta, Montana, are covered with calcareous nodules and crusts. Such deposits are unexpected in such large oligotrophic lakes with low ionic concentrations. Algal photosynthesis and metabolism concentrate calcium carbonate and silica where nutrients are continually supplied from the Flathead River. As the nodules accrete, carbonate and silica are dissolved and reprecipitated, forming a complex internal zonation. The nodules form only when high water levels correspond to seasonal peaks in productivity. Such a situation is a recent phenomenon occurring only since 1938 when Kerr Dam was built to control lake levels for the purpose of power generation.

Mature coho salmon (30) were collected at random from Lake Ontario during the spawning season. Intimal cushions of the coronary arteries were noted in 11 fish. The lesions were interpreted as early forms of arteriosclerosis. In all fish there was nodular hyperplasia of the thyroids, resembling adenomatous goiter. The changes in both organs were thought to be linked independently to the severe metabolic transformations taking place before and during the spawning season, followed by accelerated senescence. These explanations are contrasted against earlier reports of I deficiency and pollution as causative factors.																			0001-7280						1983		77					3	12																WOS:A1983RV15500001

The annuli are recognized by the markings resulting from the intersections of successive groups of circuli. The 1st annulus of the carp living in Hurleg Lake was not represented by such intersections and was determined by the interspace between the sparse and the dense zones of circuli. The annuli are formed toward the end of Sept. after the breeding season. The body-length was back-calculated. The length-weight relationship is expressed. Back-calculation showed that the annual increase in body length and in body weight are fast during the first 3 yr. The higher growth rate of the carps living in a plateau lake such as Hurleg Lake is apparently due to the high water temperature, abundant food and low density of the fish.																			0001-7302						1983	29	1					59	65																WOS:A1983QN36700011
J	STILLE, WT				STILLE, WT			THE NOCTURNAL AMPHIBIAN FAUNA OF THE SOUTHERN LAKE MICHIGAN BEACH	ECOLOGY												A study of the nocturnal Bufo w. fowleri pop-ulations visiting the beach of the Indiana Dunes indicates that this beach-frequenting behavior is related to the relative abundance of body water (measured by "plumpness," i.e., the wt. in gm./length in cm3. ). Beach density is greatest (and arrival after sunset earliest) in areas adjacent to higher elevations off the beach. It is presumed that such areas are drier and hence toads inhabiting such sites must replenish body water, by visiting the wet sand of the beach, more often than those occurring adjacent to lower areas. Feeding is now presumed to be an unimportant factor in beach visitation. By use of metal jaw tags it was found that home range of the toad includes much less than 500 ft. of beach with little change through the season or from year to year. Tracks in the sand can be followed 2-700 ft. perpendicular to the beach. In the first season toads may reach a length of 40 mm.; about 10 mm. may be added the second year and thereafter annual growth increment declines from 4 mm. to 1 mm. for toads over 60 mm. Rana catesbeiana, clamitans and pipiens were also noted on the beach. These frogs apparently find diurnal cover and reappear on the beach after dark on successive nights. Frogs enter the water; they do not sit on the wet sand as do toads. Amphibians are absent from the beach when air temperatures are below 15[degree]C.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1952	33	2					149	162		10.2307/1930635	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1930635													WOS:A1952XU89400001

The four outstanding habitats where most of the fur animals were taken were hedgerows, wood margins and roads; bottomland forests; marshy lake-border; and cultivated fields. The food habits of eight fur animals, (raccoon, red and gray foxes, mink, New York weasel, skunk, opossum, muskrat, and feral house cat) are discussed. The foods are given in % and vol. of plant and animal material for the different seasons. Important foods of the raccoon included insects, crayfish, snails, corn, acorns, wild cherry, grapes and persimmon. Rodents and rabbits were the important animal material in the food of red and gray foxes while beechnut, pokeberry, and persimmon were much used plant foods. Insects comprised the main food items of skunks followed by rodents, persimmon, and millipedes. Only a few mink samples were available and most of these contained small rodent remains. The opossum ate everything available, but insects, crayfish, millipedes, snails, birds, rodents, and berries make up most of its diet. Muskrat food habits are discussed from observation only and contains a wide variety of plants and some animal material. The house cat is included because preda-tion by both feral and domestic house cats is often claimed to be significant to wildlife populations. The major item found was rodents with the only other significant item being rabbit.																			0003-0031	1938-4238					1952	48	1					193	203		10.2307/2422142	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2422142													WOS:A1952YD06500015
J	BLAIR, AA				BLAIR, AA			BAY OF ISLANDS AND HUMBER RIVER ATLANTIC SALMON INVESTIGATIONS	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												Humber River is one of the important Atlantic salmon rivers of Newfoundland both from the standpoint of the angling in the river and the commercial fishery at the mouth of the river in Bay of Islands. The fishery was investigated in 1942 and a general survey was made of the main river and its tributaries in 1943 to determine conditions for spawning. The sea-age classes of Bay of Islands salmon and their percentage composition were 1, 57.2; 2, 32.8; 3, 0.5; and previously spawned, 9.5. The 1 sea-year or grilse class was less numerous in June than 2 sea-year class, but was more numerous during the rest of the season. The 3 sea-year class was not represented at all until August, whereas the previously-spawned class had a higher representation in the first half of June than it did later in the season. According to fishermen''s reports, the time of the run of the older salmon is usually from the last week of May to the first week of August with the peak around June 15, whereas grilse are caught from June 15 to the last week in August with the peak during the first half of July. The river-age classes of Bay of Islands salmon and their percentage representation were: 2, 2.1; 3, 42.1; 4, 51.6; 5, 4.0; and 6, 0.1. The average river age was 3.6 years. The average size of grilse was 52.8 cm and 3.4 lb (1.54 kg), and that of the sea-age class 2 was 75.3 cm and 10.6 lb (4.81 kg). Four per cent of the grilse and 28% of older salmon from Bay of Islands contained food; after July 22 no fish containing food was found. Capelin formed the predominant food item, and, almost always, the remainder was fish of other species. A survey of the main Humber River and its tributaries revealed a number of natural obstructions to the passage of salmon. A brief description of these is given, together with some suggestions for improvement. Access of anadromous salmon to Grand Lake and tributaries has been cut off by a dam. The lake now contains lake salmon, brook trout, and Arctic char.																									1965	22	2					599	+		10.1139/f65-051	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f65-051													WOS:A19656999600024

The previously reported distribution of fungi from the sand at 15 cm below the surface in two adjacent communities which represent these stages has been confirmed and the generality of the distribution established for other similar communities of this region and the Warren dunes state park in southwestern Michigan. A characteristic fungal flora was isolated from the sand of the Andropogon communities, and 5 fungal species were found to be part of the flora in every one of the communities investigated. No such characteristic flora could be detected in the Ammophila communities. Monthly samples indicated no seasonal variations in the numbers and composition of the fungal flora. The presence of a characteristic fungal flora in the Andropogon communities and its absence in the Ammophila communities indicates a successional trend from a harsh, unstable environment, low in available mineral and organic matter content, to one more stable and suitable for fungal growth.																			0002-9122	1537-2197					1965	52	10					1050	+		10.2307/2440136	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2440136													WOS:A19657145400011

Much that was unexpected occurred. An important feature has been the large amount of single-plant material, and reselections, that has been tested and later relegated, to achieve one pre-eminent family. This was from a reselection made nine seasons after the selection program had started, from segregating material from straight selection from MZ.561 made five seasons after the program had started. There have been five multi-line seed issues since the issue of MZ.561 in late 1939. Each issue has shown generally a lint yield improvement over the previous one. UK. 55, over four seasons, for the whole Province, showed a mean increase over MZ.561 of 31 per cent., 93 lb. of lint/acre/year. Percentage increases from poor land, with yields nearer the general level of the African cultivator, have been generally better than from well-farmed trials on richer land, though the total lint yield increases can be the greater from the higher level of yields. The benefits from the strain issues have been greater in the more difficult middle and south of Sukumaland than in the better Lake-shore areas.																									1961	29	114					119	+																WOS:A19611235B00008

Analysis of the microinvertebrate population formed an integral part of an intensive limnological investigation of the physical, chemical and biological characteristics of the lake prior to, during and following a series of restoration treatments completed during 1980-1981 (Funk et al. 1980). Seasonal variations in the composition, density and biomass of the major groups and species of the zooplankton are discussed in relation to patterns observed in other localities. The rotifers numerically dominated the community throughout the study period with the species Keratella cochlearis, Kellicottia longispina and Polyarthra spp. making up the largest share of zooplankton density. Cladocerans, primarily Daphnia pulex and D. galeata mendotae, accounted for the largest portion of total biomass. Copepods assumed an intermediate position between the other 2 groups in terms of both density and biomass. Effects upon the lake zooplankton community following the alum application phase of the lake restoration project are also presented based on preliminary data obtained during and after the treatment.																			0270-5060	2156-6941					1982	1	6					615	628		10.1080/02705060.1982.9664083	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1982.9664083													WOS:A1982PT75500008

Shoot standing crop ranged between 555 and 1234 g m-2, and was, in most cases, < 1000 g m-2. Seasonal changes in the above-ground standing crop were inversely related to those in the below-ground tissues for which the peak standing crop averaged at 697 .+-. 233 g m-2. Seasonal fluctuations in K, P and N concentrations of the above-ground tissues were inversely related to those in the below-ground tissues. Ca and Mg depicted such a pattern until June only, while Na was the only ion which persistently decreased from the initial high levels. Concentrations of K, P and N within the sediments were linearly related to the above-ground standing crop as well as the concentrations of the corresponding elements in the shoots. Shoot standing crop and P concentration within the shoots were directly related to the clay particle size of the soils, while the presence of other soil particles have been thought to modify the soil characteristics greatly.																			0304-3770	1879-1522					1982	12	4					375	387		10.1016/0304-3770(82)90029-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(82)90029-8													WOS:A1982NM24200006

Aquatic oligo-chaetes are more appropriate as fish food. They are better utilized by young fish than by old ones. Oligochaetes are avidly fed upon by some fish species but are of little interest to others. There are also differences in daily and seasonal utilization of this type of food. In reservoirs and lakes, oligochaetes form an important part of the fauna providing food for fish. Investigations made largely in the U.S.S.R. and Corroborated by work in other countries show that aquatic oligochaetes should not be neglected when considering reservoir biology. Lake Nasser will make an important contribution to the solution of protein deficiency in Egypt. Research on the biology of this lake should be begun on lines taking into consideration the use of aquatic oligochaetes.																			0033-0779						1966	28	4					206	+		10.1577/1548-8640(1966)28[206:TIOOIF]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8640(1966)28[206:TIOOIF]2.0.CO;2													WOS:A19668398600006

The early colonizers at all depths were diatom species; they gradually declined in diversity and numbers, and blue-green algae and green algae became more common. After 1 yr, the shallower (0-1 m) blocks were covered by a luxuriant growth of filamentous green algae although at lower levels diatoms predominated. Diversity and cell numbers of algae decreased with depth; this was most pronounced below 2 m.

NUMERICAL CLASSIFICATION OF PHYTOPLANKTON SPECIES BASED ON THE LIKENESS OF OCCURRENCE	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The brackish lake Nakanoumi is a typical transitional region between limnic and marine habitats. The phytoplankton distribution of the lake has certain seasonal and regional features. To find out basic patterns of species occurrence in this brackish water environment, a numerical classification of phytoplankton species was performed according to the likeness of occurrence. The patterns were related to major environmental factors (temperature, salinity, P, N) which appeared to be responsible for the species occurrence.																			0003-9136						1981	90	4					397	409																WOS:A1981LD70400002

J	POLL, M				POLL, M			COMPARATIVE ETHOLOGY OF AFRICAN FRESH-WATER FISHES AND LAKE-DWELLING FISHES	BULLETIN DE LA CLASSE DES SCIENCES ACADEMIE ROYALE DE BELGIQUE												Most African river fishes are teleosts of the superorder Ostariophysi; lake fishes are mainly Cichlidae (order Perciformes). The Ostariophysi are strictly intolerant to sea water, except for some adults which are tolerant within very narrow limits. Embryonic development always occurs in fresh water. The river habitat is low in salts and has low conductivity but absorbs carbonates of Ca and Mg from the soil. Water characteristics of a number of rivers and lakes are considered separately. The Cichlidae are not considered to be as intolerant to salt as the Ostariophysi. They may be found in the mouth of a coastal river or even along the salt water littoral zone: Tilapia mossambica, T. heudeloti, Hemichromis bimaculatus, H. fasciatus, etc. Oxygenation and turbidity of the water and seasons and reproductive behavior are discussed.																			0001-4141						1980	66	2					78	97																WOS:A1980KS57900002

Specimens captured in a bottom trawl ranged in size from 10-22 cm TL (mode, 15-18 cm) and females grew to a larger size than males. Length-weight relationships between sexes were different only in the Kenya waters and resulted in significantly different KTL. Based on gonadal stages, Xenoclarias matured between 14-16 cm (age 1). Fecundity of 6 specimens (stage VI) ranged from 744-1357 (mean 1009) and egg size from 1.45-1.98 mm (mean 1.79 mm). Based on gravid and spawning females, Xenoclarias spawned prior to the rainy season (Jan.-March) in Kenya and Uganda waters. During periods of increased reproductive activity females were consistently more numerous in samples (2:1) than males. Local meteorological and hydrological conditions may explain the apparently different spawning season in Tanzania waters of the Lake. This genus of small fish is not affected by the artisinal gillnet fishery but may be by the expansion of a bottom trawl fishery in Lake Victoria.																			0022-2933	1464-5262					1980	14	4					579	587		10.1080/00222938000770471	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00222938000770471													WOS:A1980KE35600009

The male fish begin to mature at 4 years of age with an average length of 242 mm. SL; the females at 5 years with an average length of 307 mm. SL. The drop in the ratio between gonad weight and total body weight indicates the start of the spawning season. Most spawning appears to take place during July although spent females were taken in early Sept. The majority of the females produced between 2 and 4 hundred thousand eggs. Just prior to spawning the average egg size was 1 mm. Before spawning there are three distinct egg sizes. Each female spawns once a season, leaving two egg groups in the ovaries. Evidence indicates a pelagic egg. Spawning takes place in the open lake and in the bays. Two 1948 collections of the young-of-the-year fishes were made up of at least 4 size groups, hence probably at least 4 sub-groups of adults spawned in the open lake. These may represent age groups.																			0003-0031	1938-4238					1953	50	1					159	171		10.2307/2422161	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2422161													WOS:A1953YC95500004

The range of density was of the magnitude of 2.0 mg/ml, at the temperatures of Lake Asejire (21-32.degree. C). Water densities were generally lower in the dry season when aquatic temperatures were high and generally higher in the rainy season when aquatic temperatures were low. During the dry season, the pycnocline was observed at 3-7 m in 1974 and 6-9 m in 1975. During periods of density stratification, the water body was clearly layered. Seasonal longitudinal differences in water density were such that during the floods of 1975 the inflow station waters had a higher density than the dam-site waters which had a concomitantly higher conductivity. The insignificance of conductivity in water density changes in a lake with rather low conductivity values is suggested.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1978	61	3					195	203		10.1007/BF00044445	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00044445													WOS:A1978GB25300001

Lakes were characterized by a low level of zooplankton production. The value of total production during the season in individual species and trophic groups was more or less constant during different years. Zooplankton communities were characterized by low G/W coefficients. Total production of non-predatory zooplankton was much less than the predators'' ration. This suggested that the predators use phytoplankton as an additional source of food. Similar phenomena were observed in other tundra lakes. Low productivity of the northern lakes might have been due to the low fecundity, small number of generations and short vegetation period.																			0044-5134						1978	57	3					375	384																WOS:A1978ES51400006

On individual trees, the number of stem whorls showing C. sororia infection increased significantly with increasing stand elevation and with decreasing exposure in crops on Alberta and Shuswap Lake provenances over 30 yr old, whereas in Shuswap, Long Beach and Vancouver Island stands < 30 yr old, increasing elevation and decreasing exposure had little effect on numbers of infected whorls. The numbers of infected whorls were not related to compartment aspect in crops of Alberta provenance, whereas in stands of Shuswap Lake, Long Beach and Vancouver Island provenances, W, SW and S-facing compartments showed fewer infections. In contrast the numbers of active cankers showed a positive correlation with increasing compartment elevation and exposure. In Zones B and C, cankers were concentrated on northerly and westerly aspects of individual stems. Particular climatic regimes in different zones of the tree and in different ages of crop may be critical in determining the success of failure of infection by C. sororia.																			0300-1237						1977	7	2					105	119																WOS:A1977DG52900005

These water bodies are essentially shallow, either temporary or perennially astatic, highly turbid, alkaline, with high levels of dissolved P and N. Primary production is near zero and zooplankton exhibit very low diversity. The fauna is supported by suspended particulate matter termed Feindetritus (Hutchinson, 1937) of bacterial and organic origin. The zooplankton association is characterized by 1 large species of Daphnia and 2 diaptomid copepods [Spicodiaptomus chelospinus and Rhinediaptomus indicus] of different sizes. They are seasonally augmented by anostracan and conchostracan phyllopods. The bottom fauna is represented by few chironomid larvae and insects. One such habitat in a pond situated in the green house of Madurai University campus, south India, is recorded for the 1st time. The report is based on the study of this pond from July 1973 to Feb. 1974. The comparative data on some of the physico-chemical parameters and fauna are provided.

During that period the salinity of the sea was always higher than that of the 2 lakes, of which Lake Veere always had the lowest salinity. Plaice were invariably hyposmotic to the surrounding sea or brackish water. The osmotic concentration usually decreased and never increased with plaice length. The influence of temperature on the total and electrolyte osmotic concentration is stronger in plaice from the North Sea than in those from both lakes, with the result that seasonal fluctuations in plasma osmotic values are more pronounced in the sea than in the lakes, although temperature in the sea fluctuated less than in both lakes. The interaction between temperature and salinity changes with plaice length. Within the length ranges studied, this interaction is strongest in fish from the North Sea and weakest in those from Lake Veere. Plaice that lived for a longer time in an unusual environment of abnormal salinity, Lake Veere, show the weakest reaction to changes in environmental factors.																			0077-7579						1977	11	2					168	183		10.1016/0077-7579(77)90004-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0077-7579(77)90004-7													WOS:A1977EP94200004

To assess the effect of such damage on mortality, height growth, and form of the trees an expt. was started on the Nicolet National Forest, Wisconsin. Nursery-grown trees of Pinus banksiana, Pinus resinosa, Pinus strobus. and Picea glauca were clipped one or more times below the terminal bud in the dormant season. The results, 6 yrs. after treatment, show that the removal of 1 in. of the terminal growth by single or repeated clippings reduces survival and height growth by planted stock. The spp. ranked as follows in descending order of sensitivity to clipping damage: red pine, white pine, jack pine, and white spruce. In general, it may be concluded that clipping had a greater effect on height growth than on mortality. No apparent effect on the form of the trees was noted since none became multiple-stemmed. The practical application of the findings is that the older classes of planting stock, especially transplant trees, should be used where deer and snowshoe hare damage may occur, because they can better withstand browsing. Browse-tolerant sp. should be selected where the problem is serious.																			0022-541X	1937-2817					1953	17	4					487	494		10.2307/3797056	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3797056													WOS:A1953XS09400011

J	MILLER, RB				MILLER, RB			PROBLEMS OF THE OPTIMUM CATCH IN SMALL WHITEFISH LAKES	BIOMETRICS												From time to time, one or another of the hundreds of widely scattered lakes of the Canadian prairies fails to produce white-fish (Coregonus clupeaformis) of commercial size when the fishing season opens. The lake is then declared "fished out" and is closed until tests show it to be yielding good fish again. Heavy plantings of "eyed" eggs or fry are made to help the restoration. These lakes offer opportunities to observe the effects of fishing pressure on populations known to be homogeneous. This paper discusses whitefish populations of 2 Alberta lakes: Lake Wabamun, which has been closed for part of the 7-yr. period of the study, and Pigeon Lake, which has been deliberately over-exploited. Data on annual catches and age composition of catches support the following conclusions:[long dash]In a fishery in which heavy exploitation has ceased, the avg. age of the population increases and the growth rate is slow and steady. In a heavily exploited fishery, the avg. age of the population decreases and the growth rate increases. Overfishing is not just decreased yield in the face of increasing effort; it begins when decreasing avg. age overtakes increasing growth rate and before decreased yields are evident. The fishery will not maintain production at max. growth rate; in order to produce sufficient thinning of the population to permit max. growth rate, fish of less than commercial size had to be taken, and the fishery collapsed. At the time of collapse, the growth rate decreased. This may be due to 1- and 2-yr.-olds surviving in enormous numbers when the older age groups are removed, thus producing a crowding effect. The collapse of the fishery was not due to brood failures,and hatchery plants can do nothing to prevent such collapses or assist in recovery following a collapse.																			0006-341X	1541-0420					1949	5	1					14	26		10.2307/3001889	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3001889								18130373					WOS:A1949UG24800002

Original data of the report are based on the 1944-51 seasons, during which time the occurrence of 46 of the 47 spp. previously reported for the region was confirmed and 27 additional spp. were taken. Of the total of 74 spp., 66 are known from Emmet Co. (40 added to previous records) and 70 from Cheboygan Co. (33 added). For each sp., earliest and latest dates observed in each of these counties are given, including (where an extension) data from the collections of the Univ. of Mich. Mus. of Zool. and the Univ. Biological Station and from the lists of Sherman Moore. Data obtained by the author in other n. Michigan counties are cited. For each sp. a list is given of the flowers (or other attractants) on which it has been seen, with an indication of any apparent favorites. There are occasional notes on taxonomic distinctions, unusual habits or habitats, annual population fluctuations, and abundance. Descriptions of significant locations for general collecting are provided, and exact localities for rarities.																			0003-0031	1938-4238					1954	51	1					87	104		10.2307/2422215	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2422215													WOS:A1954YC95700002
J	DAMANN, KE				DAMANN, KE			PLANKTON STUDIES OF LAKE MICHIGAN .1. 17 YEARS OF PLANKTON DATA COLLECTED AT CHICAGO, ILLINOIS	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Plankton records representing>12,000 individual samples collected during 17 yrs. (1926-42) from Lake Michigan at Chicago, Illinois, were analyzed. A total of 223 different organisms were reported. A survey of all known publications on L. Michigan plankton yielded a list of 363 genera and 784 spp. and vars. The diatoms occurred in the widest variety of forms, claiming 316 different kinds; Protozoa, 182; Green algae, 124; Rotifera, 67; Blue-green algae, 39; Crustacea, 37; Miscellaneous group, 12; and Schizomycetes, 7. Quantitatively, the diatoms dominated the plankton regardless of year or season. They accounted for 90% of the average total plankton, the Protozoa produced 6%> and a miscellaneous group, which included the Blue-green algae, was responsible for 3%. The Chlorophyceae produced about 1% and the Rotifera and Crustacea rarely produced significant percentage yields. Fragilaria, Tabellaria, Asterionella and Synedra produced 34, 20, 19 and 10% or 83 of the 90% attributed to the diatoms as a group. High and low productive yrs. among the individual diatom genera were noted. Between 1926 and 1938 such fluctuations in yield followed a biennial pattern in which 2 rather low productive yrs. were followed by 2 rather high productive yrs. which, in turn, were followed by low production. From 1938 through 1942, the total plankton produced annually continued increasing without reverting to any of the previous low productive levels. 1942 produced the maximum annual average yield of the 17 yrs. covered, but subsequent yrs. have produced even higher annual av. yields. The end of L. Michigan was suspected as the cause for the increased productivity of the plankton organisms at Chicago.																			0003-0031	1938-4238					1945	34	3					769	796		10.2307/2421101	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2421101													WOS:A1945YA68000012
J	Hovanitz, W				Hovanitz, W			Hybridization and seasonal segregation in two races of a butterfly occurring together in two localities	BIOLOGICAL BULLETIN												Two localities where the 2 races of Colias chrysotheme occur together are described (Mono Lake and Round Valley, Calif.). In these places the yellow race has definite broods during the season; the orange race apparently does not. The yellow race has more seasonal generations when a population is at a lower elevation (Round Valley) than at a higher elevation (Mono L.). This compares with latitudinal differences of the same type. The 2 localities are 50 miles apart but show no correlation in seasonal generations. The yellow race generations at the higher elevation are separated by interbrood periods with no adults. At the lower elevation, the generations merge one into the other. Hybrid intermediates are present at one locality rather constantly at a frequency of about 10%. The range of color intermediates is not trimodal but gives a U-shaped curve. This is probably due to a low viability of the F1. A trimodal curve is expected under conditions of very recent hybridization and all intermediates with long time hybridization. Several reasons are given to account for the lack of complete blending between the races after years of hybridization.																			0006-3185	1939-8697				AUG	1943	85	1					44	51		10.2307/1538267	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1538267													WOS:000201803300002
J	VERNON, RO				VERNON, RO			CYPRESS DOMES	SCIENCE												Observations made in Dead Lake and on the cypress domes of the Peninsula of Florida suggest that the domes originated in seasonal ponds or swamps, where the seed sprouted when not submerged, the seedling then growing high enough to stay above seasonal rises in water level. The dome is explained by a gradually deepening pond, the basin filling so slowly that adaptive changes in the plant could keep pace. The trees spread laterally, the seed floating into the wet area along the banks where germination is assured. Progressive growths of seedling,- sapling, and tree from the periphery toward the center of the pond result in a dome-shaped profile. The gradual deepening of the water in the Peninsula of Florida appears to be caused by a regional rise of the ground-water level.																			0036-8075	1095-9203					1947	105	2717					97	99		10.1126/science.105.2717.97	http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.105.2717.97								17809761					WOS:A1947UA62900007

J	DADE, E				DADE, E			SAMPLING RED CLOVER FOR NECTAR YIELD COMPONENTS AND COROLLA-TUBE LENGTH	CROP SCIENCE												Red clover heads were selected from a stand of ''Lakeland'' red clover when corolla coloration was apparent and before appreciable expansion of florets had occurred. The selected heads were covered with gauze bags to exclude nectar-collecting insects. Heads were collected on a schedule 3 to 9 days later. Average weight of head, number of functional florets, nectar volume, and nectar volume per floret increased to the 6th day after selection. Afterwards, there were no significant changes in the means of these characteristics. Percent sugar increased slightly with advancing age of head. Corolla-tube length increased to the 6th day. Corolla tubes borne on the mid-verticil were longer than those borne on the lower and upper verticils. During the season, average weight per head and number of functional florets decreased significantly. Corolla-tubes selected from the lower and mid-verticils were significantly shorter at the end of the season. Correlations between cumulative solar radiation and the measured characteristics and correlations among the characteristics were of limited value in explaining differences in nectar yield during the season. The importance of specific selection criteria and collection 6 to 7 days after selection is emphasized in sampling for red clover nectar yield and corolla-tube length.																			0011-183X	1435-0653					1967	7	2					160	+		10.2135/cropsci1967.0011183X000700020021x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1967.0011183X000700020021x													WOS:A19679238900021

Seasonal fluctuations of lake bacteria in relation to plankton production	JOURNAL OF BACTERIOLOGY												The quantity of total net plankton, plate counts of bacteria in the water, and microscopic counts of peri-phytic bacteria were detd. at intervals in a shallow, un-stratified seepage lake during a drought year when the lake received no surface drainage. The numbers of bacteria detd. by both methods followed closely the curve for total plankton. Production of organic matter by plankton organisms is evidently an important factor in determining the number of bacteria in the water.

Productivity increased as temperatures decreased until ice formation. The ice probably imposed the limiting factor of reduced light. Fluctuations in plankton diatom populations at various depths occurred before ice formation showing that variable currents existed in the lake. Uniform settling of plankton diatom species occurred after ice formation indicating no currents under the ice. There was no oxygen depletion even when 22 inches of ice and 6 inches of snow were present.																			0003-0023						1966	85	4					541	+		10.2307/3224479	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3224479													WOS:A19668389500007
J	Debenham, F				Debenham, Frank			THE WATER RESOURCES OF CENTRAL AFRICA	GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL												Investigations of the importance of the swamp or dambo in the conservation of water in Central Africa were made around Lake Bangweulu and the outflowing Luapula River. Dense growth of papyrus (Cyperus papyrus) gives a very slightly inclined surface to the extensive swamps which are actually a part of the lake. Irregularly clogged drainage due to floating masses of papyrus probably account for the hitherto unexplained fluctuations of the lake level and the submergence of previously cultivated sand banks within the swamp area. Similar long-term fluctuations in the level of Lake Nyassa from an 8.5-ft. lake gauge reading in 1915 to a 23.5 ft. max. in 1938, superimposed on a regular seasonal fluctuation of about 3 ft., were found to be due to gradual accumulation of papyrus-induced sandbars in the outlet Shire R. A subsequent lowering to 19 ft. in 1945 was due to channel cutting in these bars by water from the overfull lake. Two controlling factors are the phenomenal rate of growth of aquatic vegetation such as papyrus, and the tremendous floods in the rainy season which bring down silt from the mountains. A remedy for the Lake Nyassa fluctuations in level would be a regulating barrage near its outlet on the upper Shire R.																			0016-7398	1475-4959				APR-JUN	1948	111	4-6					222	234		10.2307/1789865	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1789865													WOS:000203706700005

Bichromate oxidation of the water of the upper 250-meter layer varied between 4.0 and 5.5 mg per liter of O2, which corresponds to 3 to 4 mg per liter of ashless organic material. A maximum of organic material for the entire year was found in the surface layer, where the seasonal variations were also most strongly pronounced. Curves are shown of the seasonal course of the oxidizability of the water on the surface and at a depth of 250 m. Average yearly figures for the oxidizability are shown for seven depths down to 250 m. It was noted that the ratio of the permanganate oxidizability to the bichromate oxidizability in the trophogenic layer of the water varied within broad limits (22 to 54%). The conclusion is drawn that the cycle of organic material proceeds at a higher rate in the upper layers of water down to a depth of 50 to 70 m.																			0002-3264						1955	101	2					359	362																WOS:A1955WN86100044

NICOTINIC ACID OF LAKE HERRING, CARP, COMMON SUCKERS, AND BURBOT	FOOD RESEARCH												Freezing, smoking, baking and seasonal and environmental conditions have been studied as they affect nicotinic acid content of lake herring (Leucichthys artedi), common suckers (Catostomus c. commersonii), carp (Cyprinus carpio), and burbot (Lota I. maculosa). The tissue was digested with enzyme (polidase-S) at pH 7 for 16-18 hrs. at 45[degree]C. A modification of the Dann and Handler (1941) cyanogen bromide colorimetric method was used. Series of lake herring from Saginaw Bay averaged 55, 31 and 23 [gamma] of nicotinic acid per gram of edible tissue; herring from Green Bay contained 27 and 23 [gamma] per gram. The significant difference is believed due to season and environment. Series of common suckers averaged 13 and 11, [gamma] of nicotinic acid per gram of tissue, carp 15 [gamma] and burbot 16 [gamma]. Freezing and subsequent storage of filleted fish caused insignificant loss of nicotinic acid in carp, common sucker and lake herring. Baking losses were insignificant in 4 series of fresh or frozen fish. Smoked herring retained an average of 66% of the nicotinic acid in the unprocessed tissue. Two series of common suckers retained 55 and 89%; the higher retention was in the series cured for a shorter period in a brine of lower salt cone. An average serving of the lake fish observed in this study would furnish approx. V10 of the daily nicotinic acid requirement of an average man.																			0095-974X						1946	11	2					179	186											21025062					WOS:A1946UY16700013

The tract yielded 392 fur animals, the pelts of which were sold at public auction for $1119. This resulted in an average income from trapping of approximately 40 cents per acre per yr.

J	Markley, KS; Sando, CE				Markley, KS; Sando, CE			Progressive changes in the cuticle of apples during growth and storage	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												Further studies on the changes in the waxlike coating on the shady side of the apple during growth and storage were made on varieties grown in 2 dissimilar apple regions (Wenatchee Valley, Wash., and the Finger Lake district of New York) . A method for the quantitative determination of cutin, present in the cuticle of apples, was devised and used. In confirmation of previous results obtained from fruit grown near Washington, D. C, it was found with New York and Washington fruit that quantities of ursolic acid, oily fraction, and total ether extract at maturity and at the end of the storage period were greater than in the early stage of growth and that the quantities of the constituents increased from the time of picking to the end of the storage period. With advancing maturity there was in general a progressive increase in the percentage of the oily fraction in the total ether extract. Quantities of cutin were greater at maturity and at the end of the storage period than in the early stage. The proportion of total ether extract to cutin varies considerably in individual varieties, but when these substances representing the mature stage are averaged for the varieties for which complete data are available, the ratio of total ether extract to cutin is about 44:56, indicating that the cuticle of apples, which constitutes the main outer protective coating, is composed of approximately 44% of ether-soluble constituents and 56% of ether-insoluble cutin. In considering comparable apples from each locality as a group, New York fruit in 1929 had higher amounts of ursolic acid, oily fraction, and total ether extract at the mature stage and at the end of the storage period than did Washington apples. Individually the same varieties from the 2 localities varied somewhat with respect to quantities of constituents. Data are given showing the quantities of constituents and percentage of oily fraction in the total ether extract at picking maturity for all varieties collected from 2 or more localities and the average daily rates of deposition of total ether extract for most of the varieties. These values may possibly be characteristic of varieties, since they reflect differences in quantities of total ether extract due to environment and hereditary tendencies independent of the length of growing season.																			0095-9758					JAN-JUN	1933	46						0403	0412																WOS:000188350500033

The socalled "single generation strain" of the insect in certain regions appears to be modifying its responses to environment, as a result of cumulative climatic influences rather than the more immediate weather effects of any single season in itself, and is showing a tendency toward an increased proportion of a 2-generation form, especially in its more southern distribution in Indiana, and in early sweet corn near Toledo, Ohio. The 2d generation of the borer, as it occurred near Toledo in 1936 and 1937, differed from the single generation in its responses to certain controlled developmental conditions in the laboratory, and these differences persisted from generation to generation.																			0022-0493	1938-291X					1939	32						83	90		10.1093/jee/32.1.83	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/32.1.83													WOS:000201404800016
J	Kenoyer, LA				Kenoyer, LA			A study of Raunkaier's law of frequence	ECOLOGY												On various plant associations in the Great Lakes region was tested Raunkiaer''s proposition that if sample plots of a given size are taken at random, and if A represents the number of species found in less than 20% of the plots, B the number found in 20% to 40%, etc., then A>B>C[image]D<E. The statement is true in most cases, when the sample area selected is of the proper size. The most satisfactory size is 0.1 sq. m., but with sparse vegetation or with large plants a larger area gives results closer to the Raunkiaer formula. When A is large, D tends to be larger than E. When the number of species is small, they tend to be distributed between A and E. The seasonal change in relative frequencies is slight. In general, A is larger and E smaller in the American associations tested than in the European associations reported upon by Raunkiaer and others, indicating that the American associations are less stabilized than the European. The formula holds good for the distribution of insects in grassland, that of microorganisms in an infusion, and that of characters on an ordinary printed page. This survey method is valuable for checking the uniformity of the various parts of an association, and may be used as a basis for estimating the actual number of specimens per species on a unit area.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1927	8						341	349		10.2307/1929336	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1929336													WOS:000200148100046
J	McKay, E				McKay, E			Salt tolerance of Ruppia maritima in lakes of high magnesium sulphate content	PLANT PHYSIOLOGY												Specific grav-ity, pH, osmotic pressure, and concentration measure-ments and quantitative analyses were made on water of lakes of high MgSO4 content and on the sap of R. maritima growing in one of the lakes. R. maritima and Artemia salina, the "brine shrimp," were found in a lake of concn. of 26%, and osmotic pressure of 58.0387 atm., in which 40.1% of the total molar conc. was Mg; 47.16% was SO4; and 9.96% was Na. Analyses of plant material and lake water showed Ruppia to have a greater osmotic pressure than the surrounding water early in the season and a lesser one later in the season. Relatively high internal content of Mg and SO4 showed R. maritima to be tolerant of these, evidently using them to build up its own pressure. Selective absorption was shown by R. maritima as it contained a higher proportionate amount of Ca, K, Cl, NO3, and PO4 than was present in the water and a lower proportionate amount of Mg and SO4. Analysis of 2 lakes, one of high conc. and one of low conc. in which R. maritima was not found gave greater proportions of Na and smaller proportions of Mg, indicating the toxicity of Na in place of Mg. Culture experiments with R. mantima and A. salina indi-cated Cl could not be used to replace SO4.

J	Clark, LB				Clark, LB			Seasonal distribiution and life history of Notonecta undulata in the Winnipeg region, Canada	ECOLOGY												The distribution of N. undulata was studied in the Winnipeg region in relation to temporary prairie pools, an intermittent stream, a permanent stream, and a series of 4 ox-bow ponds. The factors controlling distribution were essentially the same in all situations, namely, absence of current, absence of large masses of floating algae, and presence of abundant food, which usually implied a certain amount of plant material. The age of ox-bow lakes is related to abundance and distribution of Notonecta in them. N. undulata is parasitized by water-mites, and water molds may possibly attack the living insects. Observations on food and enemies indicate that certain organisms may at one period of their life history be food and at another period be enemies of N. undulata. Hibernation occurs at times in the bottom of pools in the mud. Experiments showed the relation of sight to securing food and mating, and observarions were made on oviposition.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1928	9						383	403		10.2307/1929407	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1929407													WOS:000200148200042

J	Mills, CA				Mills, CA			Climate as potential factor in the etiology of exophthalmic goiter and the other metabolic diseases	ENDOCRINOLOGY												Maps of N. America are presented showing the relative distribution of deaths from exophthalmic goiter, diabetes and pernicious anemia in relation to the total number of deaths. The climate of the continent is also considered with special reference to storm areas and frequencies and to the day-to-day variability of temp. From such maps it is observed that these 3 diseases are most severe in 2 areas, one centering around the Great Lakes, and the other covering the Pacific Northwest from San Francisco northward. The death rates in these regions are very much higher for these diseases than in the southern states or in the far north. Climate maps show that the Great Lakes area has the highest storm frequency in the northern hemisphere and great temp. variability as compared to the south. The Pacific coast, from San Francisco northward, shows a low variability of temp. and few storms, but remains at all seasons near the optimum for human activity. This finding of greatest metabolic break-down in the two areas where the climatic drive is exerting the greatest stimulation on humanity leads to the assumption of a causal relationship. Although infections may frequently act as the immediately exciting force to initiate these diseases, it would seem that climatic stimulation is the basic factor which determines the susceptibility of the population. Excessive stimulation brings a small number of the people near the limits of their metabolic capacity so that they are more sensitive to the results of infection.																			0013-7227	1945-7170				JAN-FEB	1932	16	1					52	64		10.1210/endo-16-1-52	http://dx.doi.org/10.1210/endo-16-1-52													WOS:000201667100006

PROCEEDINGS OF THE ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON												With material added since publication of Miller''s "Catalogue of the mammals of Western Europe," especially from Wales and Dobrudscha in Rumania, Miller''s conclusions are here supplemented. The author holds to his earlier position that the ferret (Putorius putorius furo) is the domesticated descendent of the European polecat (putorius), not of the Asiatic (eversmanni); seasonal and age variations of P. p. putorius are recorded. P. p. anglius* (p.694), Wales, is differentiated from the Continental race. Specimens of P. p. putorius from Spain, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, and Hungary are discussed. P. p. rothschildi* Pocock is also considered. [long dash]Under European and Asiatic polecats P. p. eversmanni* (Less.), P. p. hungaricus (Ehik), P. p. aureus* (p.703), Kazan, Central Russia, P. p. michnoi Kasht., P. p. tiaratus Holl., P. p. admiratus (p.706), N. Chihli, China, and P. p. larvatus Hodgs. are con-sidered, in some cases on the basis of additional ma-terial, including skulls. There also are notes on specimens of the American P. nigripes (Aud. & Bachm.). The author rejects Pohle''s view that Vormela Blas, is a synonym of Ictonyx. The subspecies of the only sp. recognized (peregusna Gueld.), are treated, including V. p. euxina* (p.718), Rumania (type), Macedonia, Ukraine, V. p. syriaca* (p.720), Syria and W. Meso-potamia, and V. p. ornata* (p.721), Lake Baikal, Siberia.																			0370-2774					SEP	1936	1936		3				691	+																WOS:000200393000009
J	Philip, CB				Philip, CB			Diurnal fluctuations in the hydrogen ion activity of a Minnesota lake.	ECOLOGY												The p H of a Minnesota lake was 7.5-8.3 while the corresponding shallow water showed a p H of 7.35-9.6. Maximum values were obtained during bright warm days favorable for photosynthesis and minimum values occurred during early morning hours when respiration was dominant. Surface exposed algal pads gave readings of at least p H 9.8, while the wind-mixed water 5 in. away was as low as p H 8.7. During these extreme fluctuations, top-minnows and other organisms remained throughout the day in the shallow waters. Because of these wide daily and seasonal variations, the p H index for many aquatic environments seems inadequate when based on 1 or 2 readings only.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1927	8						73	89		10.2307/1929388	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1929388													WOS:000200148100007

J	Mottley, CM				Mottley, C. M.			The effect of temperature on the number of scales in trout	SCIENCE												Kamloops trout (Salmo kamloops) from Kootenay lakes, obtained from eggs produced at the end of the spawning season, had fewer scales than the general run. A random sample of eggs spawned during the middle of the run were removed from the hatchery June 24, and reared at about 5[degree] C. above the water in the hatchery. In these fry the average number of scale rows was reduced by 10 from the normal average for the population. Eggs from one of the 6 pairs of fish procured at the end of the spawning season were divided into 2 lots, lot 1 being reared at ordinary temp., and lot 2, 5[degree] C. above the normal. The fishes resulting from lot 2 had the number of scale-rows still further reduced. The experiment demonstrates, not only why southern trout or those of warmer waters have fewer scales than those of colder waters, but also the variation in the same body of water, the trout from the later end of the spawning season, when the water has warmed up, having fewer scales than those hatching earlier.																			0036-8075	1095-9203				SEP 25	1931	74	1917					316	316		10.1126/science.74.1917.316	http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.74.1917.316								17840397					WOS:000202914600006
J	CAVEBROWNECAVE, TR				CAVEBROWNECAVE, TR			THE DRAINING OF BINLEY LAKE AND ITS ECOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES	NATURE												A 90-acre lake of distinctive shape near Coventry was drained in Nov., 1942, for camouflage. Nearly a million fish (20-lb. pike to 20-gm. bream) were transferred to neighboring waters. Channels were induced to dry the top of the 4-6 feet of soft mud, to kill the reflection. In July, 1943, the whole was covered by dense vegetation, including some 8-ft. willows. A crust supported walking. Owners reflooded the land in Oct., 1944, without cutting the vegetation, but in successive seasons protruding vegetation was pulled. In Mar. and Sept., 1946, 15,000 roach, bream, pike, rudd, tench, and golden carp were planted, and they have thrived. Fishing was made difficult in 1947 by strong growth of Ceratophyllum.

J	Riley, WA; Chalgren, W				Riley, WA; Chalgren, W			The pest mosquito problem in the Minneapolis - St. Paul metropolitan area	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY												Abnormally high precipitation during the season of 1938 and, to a less degree, 1937 resulted in a plague of mos-quitoes, of which more than 98% were the marsh-breeding, migratory Aedes vexans. 4 spp. of Anopheles[long dash]walkeri, maculipennis, quadrimaculatus and punctipennis[long dash]were taken, but represented less than 0.1% of the 337,960 specimens identified. Culicine mosquitoes were practically negligible in the areas studied. The most abundant in the trap catches was Culez tarsalis but in the hand catch it was represented by only one out of each thousand. This is in line with other evidence that the species feeds primarily on bird blood, rarely on man. Since the dominant pest mosquito here is Aedes vexans, commonly recommended scavenging operations would have little effect on the mosquito population during such seasons as the last two. Improvements incidental to the growth of our large, modern cities[long dash]building operations, well-kept yards, drainage operations and the clearing of many of our numerous lake shores[long dash]have undoubtedly accomplished much in the way of mosquito reduction but the problem of how these incidental aids can be speeded up for the purpose of mosquito control is complicated, quite apart from the question of expense, involving consideration of game and wildlife conservation, soil conservation, maintenance of lake levels, and of the water supply so vital to the cities.																			0022-0493	1938-291X					1939	32						553	557		10.1093/jee/32.4.553	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/32.4.553													WOS:000201404800104

Therefore his notes cover all seasons, but they mention only those spp. whose presence or behavior add something to what is known of their distr. or habits. In this area, water levels have been rising for about 20 yrs. At present the lake and swamp comprise an area probably greater than 1500 sq. mi., with depths of as much as 35 ft. Rains occur from Oct. to April, and high water is from Feb. to May. During that period the swamp area is almost a lifeless wilderness. When the water recedes, from Aug. onwards, the birds congregate in vast flocks around the permanent channels and the migrant waders begin to appear. It is possible to see thousands of open-bills and wood ibises in a days journey. The lake islands and higher mud patches in the swamps are always packed with people, and many usually shy birds inhabit the village thickets. Brief notes as to frequency and dates of occurrence are given for 131 spp. or subspp.																			0019-1019	1474-919X					1947	89	1					57	77		10.1111/j.1474-919X.1947.tb04917.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1474-919X.1947.tb04917.x													WOS:A1947XU12500004

In a season characterized by a light initial infestation but a heavy Aug. infestation, fairly profitable crops were harvested in all plats treated with Ca arsenate dust, a small profit was realized on plats sprayed with a mixture of Ca arsenate-syrup-water in the proportions 5:1 (gallons); 49 (gals.) Somewhat better results were given by increasing the arsenical content to 10 lbs. but difficulty was experienced in holding this quantity in suspension. Mopping with a Ca arsenate-syrup-water mixture in the proportions of 11/2:1 :1/2 gave satisfactory control of hibernating weevils and reduced 1st brood seasonal adults in numbers but failed to control late weevils. Results from this treatment as a seasonal treatment were little better than for unpoisoned cotton. Because of the susceptibility of Sea Island cotton to weevil attack, and the long fruiting and maturing season very heavy poison schedules are necessary to control weevils. On light soils insufficiently fertilized severe arsenical injury was noted. This injury was distinctly correlated with fertilizer deficiency (probably potash).

J	Breton, F; Martinez, C				Breton, Felipe; Martinez, Carlos			Persistence of harmful algal blooms under conditions of internal phosphorus loading	NONLINEAR ANALYSIS-REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS												Phosphorus release from sediments in lakes can trigger harmful algal blooms, significantly impacting lake ecosystems and necessitating effective management strategies. This study presents a mathematical analysis of a dynamic model incorporating such internal phosphorus loadings and their impact on algal growth. The model accounts for both light and phosphorus limitations on cell growth, as well as the seasonal variability of temperature and light, leading to a periodically forced non-linear system of ordinary differential equations. Using the theory of periodic semiflows and Floquet multipliers, we establish both necessary and sufficient conditions for long-term survival of algae (uniform persistence). This approach provides a threshold result for algae survival and the existence of a non-trivial periodic solution. Through numerical simulations, we illustrate our results and provide insights into the role of internal phosphorus loadings. In particular, our simulations illustrate that an integrated strategy reducing both watershed inflows and sediment phosphorus outperforms measures that focus on just one source of phosphorus.																			1468-1218	1878-5719				APR	2026	88								104479	10.1016/j.nonrwa.2025.104479	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nonrwa.2025.104479													WOS:001574280300001

The Potential Performance of Benthic Algal Community-based Biotic Indices for Assessing the Ecological Status: A Case Study of the Kamenica River (Serbia)	TURKISH JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												In most European countries, ecological status assessment of hilly-mountain rivers following the Water Framework Directive relies on diatom indices as parameters of phytobenthos. In contrast, only five of them use non-diatom algal-based indices. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of indices based on epilithic diatoms (IBD, IPS, IDG, SLAD, EPID, TID, TDI), non-diatom benthic algae (PIT, BI, NeD, RAPPER), and both groups (TI) for ecological status assessment compared to assessments based on the physical and chemical parameters of the water. The study was conducted in four seasons at six sites on the Kamenica River (Serbia). A total of 142 algal taxa were detected, including 85 diatoms and 57 non-diatoms, with 24 forming macroscopic aggregations. Among tested diatom indices, TDI and TID were most consistent with physical and chemical parameters-based assessment. Non-diatom indices PIT, BI and RAPPER method showed potential for broader application, although the indicator lists and the boundaries of the ecological status classes need to be adapted. The TI index provided more accurate results compared to the same index that only considers diatoms (TID), underlining the importance of including non-diatom algae as bioindicators in the ecological status assessment.

However, the processes controlling the distribution of physicochemical parameters and nutrients, as well as their influence on water quality, remain insufficiently understood. This study monitored water quality in the three sub-reservoirs of the Sidi Mohammed Ben Abdellah (SMBA) Dam in Morocco: Sale (S1), Digue (S2), and Confluence (S3) throughout the 2024-2025 hydrological cycle. The objectives were to assess the trophic status, examine the spatiotemporal variability of temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and nutrients, and evaluate the implications for raw water quality and trophic dynamics. These waters, once treated, supply drinking water to surrounding populations. Results showed persistent thermal stratification, seasonal fluctuations in dissolved oxygen, and marked variations in nutrient concentrations, especially phosphorus and nitrogen. Lake S2 displayed distinctly eutrophic conditions, while S1 and S3 were classified as meso-eutrophic. Correlation analyses revealed strong relationships among chlorophyll-a, nutrient cycling, and dissolved oxygen, highlighting the central role of internal phosphorus loading in maintaining eutrophication. Overall, the findings underscore the urgent need for sustainable management strategies, including reducing nutrient inputs and implementing continuous monitoring, to mitigate water quality degradation and ensure the long-term sustainability of the SMBA reservoir.																			1464-343X	1879-1956				JAN	2026	233								105876	10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2025.105876	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2025.105876		JAN 2026											WOS:001594578700002

However, previous eutrophication studies have focused mostly on lakes, with little attention paid to rivers, and the anthropogenic driving mechanisms of eutrophication heterogeneity between rivers and lakes within large-scale basins remain unclear. In this study, the seasonal and regional characteristics of eutrophication in rivers and lakes within the Yangtze River Basin were analyzed from 2021 to 2023. The relationship between anthropogenic activities and the eutrophication heterogeneity between rivers and lakes was determined by considering population and land use factors. The results showed that the eutrophication of both rivers and lakes was more severe in the downstream area than upstream and midstream area, and intensified during the wet season compared to the normal and dry seasons. On average, 63.2 % and 20.7 % of the river stations were at eutrophic and meso-eutrophic states, respectively; and an average of 26.3 % and 44.2 % of lake stations were at eutrophic and meso-eutrophic states, respectively. Correlation analysis revealed significant differences in human-driven eutrophication mechanisms between rivers and lakes. The trophic states of river systems acutely reflected short-term anthropogenic pressures, while lake systems predominantly manifest the long-term cumulative effects of nutrients generated by land use within the watershed. This study can provide reliable support for targeted management of eutrophication in different water bodies in large-scale basins.

However, research on the occurrence and bioaccumulation of antibiotics in aquatic organisms within shallow wetland lakes remains limited. This study investigated the occurrence and bioaccumulation of ten commonly used antibiotics in the Baiyang Lake, northern China's largest shallow wetland lake. The results indicated that sulfonamides and fluoroquinolones were the predominant antibiotics in surface water, whereas fluoroquinolones and macrolides were more prevalent in sediment. Fluoroquinolones demonstrated significant potential for bioaccumulation in targeted aquatic organisms, including both animals and plants (Carassius auratus and Phragmites australis). The bioaccumulation of antibiotics in Carassius auratus was correlated with their solubility, whereas in Phragmites australis, this was associated with their octanol-water partition coefficients and molecular weights. Ecological risk assessment indicated that most antibiotics posed minimal to low risk levels. However, four antibiotics were exceptions: clarithromycin (12.5 %) and sulfamethoxazole (6.25 %) presented a high risk in surface water samples, while norfloxacin (25.0 %) and ciprofloxacin (25.0 %) posed a high risk in sediment samples. Norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and roxithromycin were identified as key indicator antibiotics for enhancing the local monitoring and control of antibiotic contamination based on four criteria: (1) high concentrations, (2) frequent detection, (3) capacity for bioaccumulation, and (4) ecological risk levels. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the status of antibiotic contamination, bioaccumulation characteristics, and ecological risk in Baiyang Lake, thereby supporting efforts to monitor and regulate antibiotic pollution.

Taphonomy of soft-tissue preservation in ferricrete at the McGraths Flat Lagersta<spacing diaeresis>tte	GONDWANA RESEARCH												Locating new fossil sites with exceptional soft-tissue preservation is vital for addressing taphonomic bias and accurately reconstructing the fossil record. McGraths Flat, a Miocene rainforest lake Konservat-Lagersta<spacing diaeresis>tte, uniquely preserves nanometre-scale soft-tissue structures in laminated Fe-oxyhydroxide (goethite) or 'ferricrete'. However, constraints on the source of Fe, depositional conditions, and mechanisms that drove the exceptional soft-tissue preservation were lacking. Here, we demonstrate that warm, seasonally wet rainforest conditions generated acidic soils and transported dissolved Fe(II) from weathering basaltic bedrock into an oxbow lake. Fe(III)-oxyhydroxide precipitation then drove fossil burial and mineralization. Our findings suggest that 'McGraths Flat-type' fossil preservation may be common and could represent an untapped record of life on land.																			1342-937X	1878-0571				JAN	2026	149						429	444		10.1016/j.gr.2025.08.012	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gr.2025.08.012													WOS:001593239100001

Radioactive Cs transfer pathways to kokanee were examined in relation to water residence time, vertical temperature profiles, and water quality under operational and non-operational conditions. Two primary pathways originating from the contaminated forest surrounding the reservoir were identified. The first involves suspended detritus, primarily decomposed forest litter, which accumulates at the thermocline and facilitates Cs transfer to kokanee via interactions with plankton. The second pathway involves detritus deposited on the lakebed, consumed by chironomids, which serve as prey for kokanee. Radioactive Cs concentrations in chironomids were higher than those in plankton, suggesting that seasonal dietary shifts in kokanee contribute to observed variations in radioactive Cs accumulation. Power plant operations can transport part of the contaminated detritus accumulated at the thermocline out of the lake, thereby inhibiting its sedimentation on the lake bottom, reducing radioactive Cs availability to lower trophic organisms, and resulting in a marked reduction of radioactive Cs concentrations in kokanee. These findings highlight the influence of anthropogenic operations on Cs dynamics in aquatic ecosystems and have important implications for ecological risk assessment and management of radiological contamination.																			0265-931X	1879-1700				JAN	2026	291								107827	10.1016/j.jenvrad.2025.107827	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2025.107827								41066965					WOS:001593296600001

For the first time, this study investigates the impact of artificial surface water bodies on the mitigation of SWI within reclaimed coastal aquifers, using Huanle Binhai City (HBC), Jiaozhou Bay, China, as a representative study area. A coupled density-dependent groundwater flow and solute transport model was constructed and calibrated with field-derived hydrogeological parameters obtained from seasonal soil sampling. Numerical simulations assessed the influence of key parameters, including lakebed hydraulic conductivity, lake location, and reclamation area properties (hydraulic conductivity and length), on the dynamics of saltwater wedge retreat and salt mass removal. Results demonstrate that artificial lakes within reclaimed zones significantly enhance freshwater recharge and promote seaward saltwater displacement compared to conventional terrestrial recharge conditions. Sensitivity analyses identified reclamation area hydraulic conductivity and reclamation length as dominant factors governing saltwater retreat and desalination effectiveness, with salt mass removal efficiency increasing by up to 16 % as reclamation length doubled from 100 m to 200 m. Comparative analyses with recent literature validate model predictions, revealing that strategic configuration of artificial surface water bodies can optimize groundwater recharge efficiency, minimize saltwater intrusion risks, and support sustainable coastal management. This research provides valuable insights and practical guidance for managing SWI in reclaimed coastal aquifers, emphasizing the critical role of artificial freshwater bodies in maintaining hydrogeological stability under reclamation conditions.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				JAN	2026	664		A						134311	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.134311	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.134311													WOS:001594313000001

The objective of this study is to investigate the spatiotemporal variability and controls of DOM in the surface water and groundwater of a large river (area: 134,766 km2), i.e., the Wei River Basin (WRB) in China. Specifically, the effects of SGI on DOM sources and transport under drought and dam-regulated conditions are examined using fluorescence excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy coupled with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) and stable isotopes (delta 2H-H2O, delta 18O-H2O). Three fluorescence components were identified: microbial humic-like (C1), protein-like substances (C2), and terrestrial humic-like (C3), each showing distinct seasonal patterns corresponding to SGI variability. During the high-flow season, the dominant form of SGI was surface water recharging groundwater, contributing to 46 % of aquifer recharge and substantially enhancing the transport of fresh and humified DOM (C1 and C3) from surface water to groundwater. In contrast, the low-flow conditions decoupled surface water-groundwater exchange and amplified the contribution of fertilizer-derived DOM in groundwater, reaching up to 43 %. Notably, drought and dams critically influence DOM pathways by altering groundwater recharge and discharge. This study underscores the pivotal role of SGI in DOM transport and demonstrates the value of integrating optical and isotopic tools to unravel biogeochemical processes under changing environmental conditions.

Preemptive activation of hypolimnetic oxygenation improves control of Fe and Mn in drinking water reservoirs	WATER RESEARCH												Seasonal anoxia in the hypolimnion of freshwater reservoirs can degrade water quality by promoting the release of iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn). To address these issues, hypolimnetic oxygenation (HOx) is an engineered treatment that aims to prevent upward diffusion of reduced Fe and Mn from anoxic sediments and to oxidize reduced Fe and Mn in the water column, enabling sedimentation and removal. However, quantification of the effect of HOx on Fe and Mn concentrations is challenging without a reference ecosystem for comparison and multiple years of monitoring data. In this study, we monitored dissolved Fe and Mn in the water column and Fe and Mn removal through sedimentation for six years in two temperate reservoirs - one with a HOx system and one without. Our results show that HOx significantly enhances Fe and Mn sedimentation in freshwater reservoirs, but sedimentation of Fe was much greater than Mn. When activated before the onset of anoxia, HOx substantially decreased the rates of Fe release into the water column. In contrast, although early HOx activation delayed Mn release, it did not decrease the Mn release rate into the water column. However, early HOx activation increased the Mn sedimentation rate. When HOx was activated after the onset of anoxia, maximum total Fe and Mn concentrations in the hypolimnion were approximately 4x and 1.6x greater than concentrations in years with preemptive activation. Our study indicates that HOx improves water quality with respect to Fe and Mn, especially when activated prior to the onset of anoxia.

However, the combined effects of simultaneously reducing both N and P fertilizers remain unclear. Hence, we carried out a two-year field experiment (2020-2022) in the Dongting Lake region, China, to examine the impact of decreasing N and P fertilizer inputs on the soil properties, N and P runoff losses, and grain yields under rice-oilseed rape rotation in southern China. Compared to traditional management (rice, 210 kg N ha-1 and 105 kg P2O5 ha-1; oilseed rape, 180 kg N ha-1 and 90 kg P2O5 ha-1), the 10-30 % reduction in N and P inputs decreased total N runoff losses by 19.2-48.7 % (rice seasons; 3.12-7.92 kg ha-1) and 26.1-58.1 % (oilseed rape seasons; 1.17-2.61 kg ha-1), and total P losses by 35.5-59.7 % (rice seasons; 0.95-1.59 kg ha-1) and 30.3-58.5 % (oilseed rape seasons; 0.20-0.38 kg ha-1). Moreover, grain yields were maintained despite nutrient input reductions. The partial least square structural equation model showed that the soil total N, soil available N, and soil available P positively affected the grain yields, while the N and P runoff losses had a significant negative effect on the grain yields. In conclusion, the reduction of N and P fertilizer by 30 % achieved optimal outcomes, effectively reducing environmental risks while maintaining agricultural productivity.																			0167-1987	1879-3444				JAN	2026	255								106827	10.1016/j.still.2025.106827	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2025.106827													WOS:001562349800001

The Segment Anything Model (SAM) proposed as the first foundation model in image processing, provides a new opportunity for automated SGLs extraction. However, its potential has not been thoroughly explored, and the reliance on manual prompts heavily hinders large-scale mapping of SGLs. Therefore, we introduced an adapting SAM for automated SGLs extraction, and comprehensively assessed its potential across Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS). The adapting SAM was first fine-tuned on small datasets derived from Sentinel-2 imagery, and then was evaluated across five major basins of GrIS using Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 imagery. Results demonstrated strong generalization capabilities across varying training size, different regions, and multi-source satellite images, achieving an average F1-score of 87.77%, which represented an average improvement of 19.18% over UNet and DeeplabV3 + . Notably, even when fine-tuned with 20 samples, the adapting SAM maintained a high average F1-score of 85.73%. Furthermore, the adapting SAM was utilized to large-scale mapping of SGLs in Isunnguata-Russell glacier, and was superior to an existing product derived based on water index, identifying 5.14 times more lakes. Overall, this study offers valuable insights for SGLs mapping based on foundation model.

How microhabitat characteristics influence the females' nest site selection of the invasive alien species Trachemys scripta in the Angitola Lake (Calabria, Southern Italy)	EUROPEAN ZOOLOGICAL JOURNAL												The introduction of invasive alien species (IAS) poses a significant threat to global biodiversity, ecosystem functionality, and native species, particularly in protected areas. The red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta elegans) ranks among the 100 most harmful IAS globally due to its ability to adapt and widespread distribution. This study investigates the nesting ecology of T. scripta in Angitola Lake, a Ramsar site and WWF Oasis in Calabria (Southern Italy), to better understand its reproductive strategies and guide effective management actions. We examined 309 natural predated nests across diverse habitats, analyzing the role of microhabitat features such as vegetative cover, soil type, and distance from the shoreline in nest site selection. Our findings show a clear selection for mixed habitats with soil combinations like dirt/sand and dirt/clay, which offer optimal conditions for oviposition. Nesting activity was concentrated primarily within 30 meters of the shoreline, with habitat and soil selection shifting throughout the nesting season in response to environmental factors, such as water availability. However, the results of the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) indicate that while distance from the shoreline was significantly influenced by vegetation type (with greater distance in reforested sites), soil type and the continuous variables analyzed (depth, nest diameter, number of eggs) did not show significant effects on nesting distance. The ecological plasticity demonstrated by T. scripta, allowing it to exploit a wide array of nesting microhabitats, presents a significant threat to native turtle species like Emys orbicularis and overall local biodiversity. Consequently, this study provides valuable insights into the reproductive ecology of this invasive species, highlighting the necessity for integrated management strategies to address its ecological impacts within aquatic ecosystems.

Evaluating eDNA metabarcoding for fish biodiversity assessment in Nigerian aquatic ecosystems: potential, limitations, and comparisons with traditional methods	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Fishery resources in Nigeria are experiencing a rapid decline, underscoring the urgent need for effective biodiversity surveys and comprehensive species documentation to guide conservation and management efforts. However, traditional methods for fish surveys, such as gillnets and trawl surveys, are intrusive, time-intensive, and costly. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding has emerged as a non-invasive method for surveying fish diversity, yet its application in Nigerian aquatic ecosystems remains limited. This study evaluated the potential and limitations of 12S rRNA-based eDNA metabarcoding to survey fish communities across three water bodies (Jebba Hydroelectric Power Dam, Asa River, and Lagos lagoon). We also compared fish community composition obtained from our eDNA samples with previously published inventories based on traditional sampling techniques. Our study revealed several advantages of using eDNA metabarcoding for fish biodiversity surveys in Nigeria, including the rapid and non-invasive identification of fish taxa, the detection of differences in community composition and biodiversity metrics, the identification of species overlooked by traditional methods, and the ability to detect both threatened and invasive species. However, we identified three major constraints that must be addressed for the successful integration of eDNA sampling techniques in Nigeria. First are the logistical challenges, including determining the optimal number of replicates, selecting the appropriate water volume per site, determining the required number of sampling sites per study area, and identifying the most suitable time within the season for sampling. Second is the lack of a comprehensive DNA reference database for accurate species identification. Third are the issues with primer and marker specificity. Until a comprehensive regional DNA reference library is developed, suitable molecular markers are optimized, and standardized field protocols for eDNA sampling are established, we recommend using eDNA metabarcoding as a complementary survey tool rather than a replacement for conventional fish survey methods in Nigeria.					; Nneji, Lotanna/Z-4551-2019; Oladipo, Segun/AAI-5220-2020	Oladipo, Segun/0000-0001-7702-9491; 													0270-5060	2156-6941				DEC 31	2025	40	1							2541689	10.1080/02705060.2025.2541689	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2025.2541689													WOS:001544115600001

Chemical signatures of microbial life in an ecological end-member: Shifting hydroclimate and sediment fluxes influence DOM biogeochemistry in Lake Fryxell, a permanently ice-covered lake in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												The ice-covered lakes in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV) of Antarctica provide end-member ecosystems for understanding the production of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in aquatic ecosystems in the absence of vegetation on the landscape and under resource and nutrient constraints. Given these constraints, DOM in MDV lakes is derived solely from microbial phototrophs and heterotrophic bacteria, contrasting with the dominant terrestrial sources in temperate regions. Previous research developed fluorometric approaches for characterizing DOM, including in MDV lakes. In this study we leveraged these approaches along with contemporary molecular-based techniques to elucidate changes in DOM composition across the depth profile for Lake Fryxell in the MDV. The results showed that the presence of organic molecules containing sulfur increased at depth where anoxic conditions prevailed. To evaluate the influences of climate-induced rising lake levels and multiple flood events in the MDV, we compared recent and historical samples. The results indicated a remarkable consistency in source-related fluorescence metrics over time, whereas a twofold decrease in sulfur content of the fulvic acid fraction was observed in samples from above and below the oxycline. Biogeochemical processes associated with the influx of iron oxide-rich sediments during flood events may have contributed to this change, and similar processes may stimulate biogeochemical cycling and remineralization in temperate lakes during seasonal transitions.																			1523-0430	1938-4246				DEC 31	2025	57	1							2478678	10.1080/15230430.2025.2478678	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15230430.2025.2478678													WOS:001466670000001
J	Sommaruga, R				Sommaruga, Ruben			Survival strategies of planktonic organisms in alpine lakes and beyond	INLAND WATERS												Recent research on alpine lakes has revealed both novel adaptive strategies and established ones, now examined from a new perspective, that planktonic organisms use to persist under the harsh environmental conditions characteristic of these ecosystems. The 2024 Edgardo Baldi lecture addresses 3 major topics, namely, the multifactorial drivers of photoprotection, emerging mechanisms of microbial solar energy utilization, and virus-mediated facilitation of host survival. Photoprotective phenotypes, including the accumulation of mycosporine-like amino acids and carotenoids, are increasingly recognized as outcomes of complex interactions among ultraviolet radiation exposure, nutrient (particularly nitrogen) availability, temperature fluctuations, and predation pressure. Deciphering this interplay is critical for predicting planktonic responses to ongoing global environmental change. A significant advance in the understanding of microbial photoenergetics has been the recent discovery of dual phototrophy in certain bacteria that combine aerobic anoxygenic photosynthesis with rhodopsin-based proton pumping. This dual mechanism enhances energy acquisition and biomass production under conditions of fluctuating light intensity and limited dissolved organic carbon concentrations, with potential parallels in eukaryotic phytoplankton. Finally, the identification of novel viral groups in alpine lakes, such as Polinton-like viruses and virophages, suggests a protective role against host mortality induced by giant viruses. These interactions seem to stabilize microeukaryotic populations and may significantly influence ecosystem productivity and dynamics. Together these findings emphasize the ecological and evolutionary significance of such adaptations, extending beyond alpine lakes to other aquatic ecosystems, and improving our understanding of how plankton respond to environmental changes.

Field surveys of phytoplankton communities in typical lakes in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River were conducted to establish a phytoplankton-based biological integrity index (P-IBI), for evaluating ecological health of these lakes. To ensure the reliability of the evaluation results, we performed a regression comparison with the comprehensive trophic level index (TLI), and used redundancy analysis with linear models to assess the relationships between P-IBI, TLI and their respective component metrics with environmental factors during the dry and wet seasons. Indicating that the overall structure of phytoplankton communities in typical lakes in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River is characterized by a Chlorophyte-Diatom-Cyanobacteria type, with Chlorophytes and Diatoms being dominant. Redundancy analysis revealed that ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), total nitrogen, total phosphorus and Secchi depth were the primary environmental factors influencing P-IBI and its component metrics in this watershed. P-IBI and TLI correlated significantly and negatively during the dry season. Overall, P-IBI showed strong reliability for assessing the health status of typical lakes in the study region, thereby providing a reasonable assessment of water body-health status, responding sensitively to changes in water environmental factors within the watershed and providing relevant assistance for the research and management of eutrophic lakes and their similar counterparts in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River basin.

However, existing methods and datasets still face the challenge of eliminating interference features and extracting continuous river networks. Terrestrial river networks profoundly shape the landscape but are also constrained by the landscape. Informed by this hydrogeomorphology knowledge, we propose a method to extract continuous river networks integrating 10 m resolution Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and the 1.0" resolution Copernicus digital elevation model (DEM). The remotely sensed modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) is used to burn the DEM, representing the shaping function of rivers (water) on landscapes; height above the nearest drainage (HAND) topographic index is used to establish adaptively wide river areas of interest (AOIs), representing the constraint of landscapes on river morphology. Then, the remotely sensed water mask (RSWM) is extracted within AOIs by applying linear feature enhancements and adaptive thresholding. Subsequently, the RSWM and DEM-modeled drainage networks (DMDNs) are spatially overlaid to remove pseudo-river segments in the latter and connect river channel gaps in the former. Finally, isolated lakes are excluded because they do not intersect with the continuous river networks. We compare our mapping results with four 10 m resolution land use and land cover (LULC) datasets (FROM GLC10, ESA WorldCover, Esri Land Cover, and Dynamic World) across 16 diverse study sites globally, and investigate the ability of our method to extract multi-temporal river networks at two representative sites. The results show that, first, our method can accurately extract continuous river networks with highly sinuous channels, complex braided channels, and small rivers from heterogeneous image backgrounds, achieving Kappa coefficient of 0.840 +/- 0.114, F1-score of 0.868 +/- 0.111, overall accuracy of 0.961 +/- 0.022, producer's accuracy of 0.858 +/- 0.171, and user's accuracy of 0.901 +/- 0.066, all of which are consistently higher and more stable compared with those of the four LULC datasets. Second, our mapping results more effectively preserve the connectivity of river networks (quantified by fewer yet longer connected components) than do the four comparison datasets. Third, our method can effectively identify water infilling of braided rivers, and seasonal expanding and shrinking of narrow upstream rivers. Finally, our method can distinguish continuous river networks from isolated lakes, thereby achieving a preliminary water type classification. In summary, our proposed method extends our knowledge of terrestrial river networks to 10 m spatial resolution and can be applied to higher-resolution river network mapping with the availability of higher-resolution satellite imagery and DEM products.																			1548-1603	1943-7226				DEC 31	2025	62	1							2529620	10.1080/15481603.2025.2529620	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15481603.2025.2529620													WOS:001526995100001
J	Zohary, T; Gasith, A				Zohary, Tamar; Gasith, Avital			Opinion: multiannual water level regimes altered by climate change modify lakeshore structure and function	INLAND WATERS												Lakeshores are ecotones encompassing diverse habitats that support high biodiversity, interact with pelagic ecosystems, and provide desirable ecosystem services. Hydrological regimes altered by climate change significantly impact lakeshore ecosystems. In this opinion paper, we highlight ecological consequences of distinct multiannual hydrological regimes (superimposed on natural seasonal ones) that affect the lakeshore environment of stratified lakes. Under natural hydrological conditions (Regime A), lakes maintain a stable annual mean water level, supporting diverse biota adapted to the seasonal fluctuations of water level. By contrast, under multiannual drought, the annual mean water level continuously declines (Regime B), and the resulting exposed shores become covered with dense vegetation, dominated by a few species. As the waterline recedes, structural complexity in the shallow water is reduced, limiting populations of native invertebrates and fish and facilitating establishment of invasive species. Storm-induced rapid rises in annual mean water levels during extremely rainy years (Regime C) are the least studied. While lake refilling is intuitively beneficial, undesirable short-term effects are common, including organic matter accumulation and decomposition, temporary hypoxia, pungent odors, loss of fish habitat, and formation of mosquito-infested shore pools. Littoral zone recovery and alleviation of nuisances occur only after the extreme conditions subside. Under climate change, the frequency and intensity of Regimes B and C are likely to increase. From a management perspective, maintaining water levels close to natural amplitudes can minimize the adverse conditions and damage caused by Regimes B and C.																			2044-2041	2044-205X				2025 DEC 31	2025										10.1080/20442041.2025.2480886	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2025.2480886		DEC 2025											WOS:001585697300001

Baiyangdian Lake, the largest and most representative shallow lake in the North China Plain, lies at the core of the newly established Xiong'an New Area, where rapid urban expansion, wastewater discharge, agricultural runoff, and aquaculture activities intensify plastic inputs. To evaluate sources, transport, and risks, microplastics were sampled from overlying water and sediments at ten sites during the dry (October 2021) and wet (August 2022) seasons. Concentrations reached 500-16,000 n center dot m-3 in water and 167-5000 n center dot kg-1 in sediments during the dry season, with lower averages in the wet season (355 n center dot m-3; 2610 n center dot kg-1). Films dominated, indicating mulch film, packaging, and sewage as key sources. Seasonal hydrodynamics controlled vertical exchange: smaller particles (<= 100 mu m) remained suspended in water, while larger ones accumulated in sediments, especially under reduced flows in the dry season. Ecological risk assessment showed higher risks in the dry season, with the polymer hazard index classifying sediments as high risk. The present study elucidates microplastic pollution mechanisms in a representative lacustrine system, providing critical insights for development of targeted mitigation strategies at the water-sediment interface and informing ecosystem-scale management approaches applicable to comparable freshwater basins.																			2213-2929	2213-3437				DEC	2025	13	6							119574	10.1016/j.jece.2025.119574	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jece.2025.119574		DEC 2025											WOS:001592632900001

They play a pivotal role by rendering essential ecosystem services, however, their roles in governing the carbon dioxide (CO2) budget remain controversial and unclear, likely posing a significant challenge to the comprehensive understanding of CO2 cycling within lake ecosystems. To fill the knowledge gaps, the dynamic variability of CO2 within the submerged macrophytes habitats in a shallow subtropical lake located in eastern China was comprehensively investigated based on long-term (2005-2017) field measurements span different seasons. The findings revealed that the submerged macrophytes habitats were characterized by superior water quality, manifested as low nutrient loadings, reduced algal biomass, and heightened water clarity, when juxtaposed with open water regions of the lake devoid of macrophytes. The long-term measurements demonstrated that the submerged macrophytes habit functioned as relatively low CO2 source, with an annual mean emissions flux of 13.55 +/- 9.20 mmol m-2 d- 1. The presence of macrophytes and good water quality (e.g. low nutrient loadings) likely contributed to low emissions within submerged macrophyte habitat via increasing CO2 fixation and reducing CO2 production, respectively. The temporal fluctuations in CO2 emissions from submerged macrophyte habitats were closely associated with water clarity, which in turn highlighted the role of water quality in determining CO2 variability within submerged macrophyte habitats. Furthermore, the long-term measurements uncovered significant inter-annual variations in the CO2 emissions, highlighting the critical importance of longterm measurements to derive unbiased estimates of the CO2 budgets within the submerged macrophyte habitats of inland lakes.

This study presents the first comprehensive assessment of MP occurrence in the surface waters of Lake Singkarak, a nationally strategic ecosystem and habitat for endemic fish species. Surface water samples were collected from five monitoring stations (S1-S5) during both rainy and dry seasons. MPs were widely distributed across all stations, with average concentrations ranging from 250 to 1200 particles L--(1) , and abundance was generally higher during the rainy season, particularly at sites influenced by domestic activities, aquaculture, and agriculture. Station S2 (Muaro Paninggahan) exhibited the highest seasonal increase (approximate to 1000 %), while stations with minimal anthropogenic influence (S4 and S5) showed comparatively smaller variations (28-67 %). Fragments dominated MP morphology, and polyamide (PA) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were the most frequently detected polymers, suggesting significant contributions from domestic waste, aquaculture operations, and agricultural runoff. Although spatiotemporal variations were apparent, statistical analyses indicated no significant seasonal differences (p > 0.05), highlighting the influence of localized environmental factors, such as hydrodynamics and human activity, on MP distribution. These findings underscore the urgent need for targeted pollution control, improved waste management, and long-term monitoring to safeguard the ecological integrity and socio-economic value of Lake Singkarak.																			2352-4855					DEC 20	2025	91								104508	10.1016/j.rsma.2025.104508	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2025.104508		DEC 2025											WOS:001589551900005

This work involved the procurement of water samples from various points within the Nuozhadu Reservoir (NZD). During the rainy season, pronounced alterations in stratification were observed: the surface mixed layer ranging from 0 to 5 m in depth; the thermocline layer extended from 5 to 40 m; and the profundal zone, spanning from 40 m to the riverbed, was designated as the stagnant temperature layer. The spatiotemporal heterogeneity of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and its isotopic composition (delta 13CDIC) was pronounced, with delta 13CDIC values spanning from -9.04 %o to -3.00 %o. Spatially, the concentrations of DIC exhibited an increment with increasing depth across various vertical profiles. This variation was attributed to the thermal stratification within reservoirs, which modulated the intensity of photosynthetic carbon fixation. The nitrogen content exhibited a parallel trend to DIC concentration, with lower values in the upper layers and elevated levels in the deeper strata. This work revealed that photosynthesis and carbonate sedimentation might be an important carbon sequestration process in the large reservoir. Future research endeavors should focus on elucidating the migratory and transformational dynamics of carbon and nitrogen elements, to enhance the management and environmental surveillance strategies for deep reservoirs.					包, 宇飞/IUO-0856-2023; Liu, Xiaobo/OKS-3514-2025														0022-1694	1879-2707				DEC	2025	663		A						134195	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.134195	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.134195													WOS:001568361700001
J	Batina, A; Siljeg, A				Batina, Anja; Siljeg, Ante			Enhancing water quality monitoring in a coastal shallow lake using GIS and multi-criteria decision analysis	ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS												Water quality decline is a critical global issue affecting both aquatic ecosystems and human health. This study focuses on Vrana Lake, a coastal shallow lake in Dalmatia, Croatia, which is subject to seasonal water level fluctuations, salinization from the Adriatic Sea, and various anthropogenic and environmental pressures. To evaluate and improve water quality monitoring, a spatial assessment was conducted using a Geographic Information System-based Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (GIS-MCDA) integrated with the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (F-AHP). The analysis incorporated multiple criteria including electrical conductivity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, water temperature, distance from water resources, distance from land nutrient runoff, distance from environmental pollutants, wind, precipitation, and air temperature, using data collected from July 2023 to June 2024. The methodology included standardization of criteria in GIS software, weighting through F-AHP, and a sensitivity analysis using 1000 Monte Carlo simulations to assess model robustness. Results revealed spatial variations in water quality, with lower quality observed in the northwestern and southern regions, influenced by anthropogenic activities and seawater intrusion. An optimized monitoring network of seven stations was developed based on Jenks natural breaks classification, ensuring comprehensive lake coverage and efficient representation of all water quality classes. Three existing stations and two from previous networks were incorporated into the new network, with two additional stations proposed to maintain consistent spatial distribution. This study provides an adaptable decision support framework for improving water quality monitoring and management in coastal shallow lakes, offering a strategic approach to early eutrophication warning systems and informed resource planning.

This study conducts a comprehensive comparative analysis of CO2 emissions at the water-air interface between reservoir-regulated and natural river systems in Chongqing, China, focusing on regions influenced by Three Gorges Dam (TGD) operations. Results indicate that the average CO2 emission flux (FCO2) in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) area (37.07 f 28.51 mmol center dot m-2 center dot d-1) was significantly lower than that in natural river sections outside the reservoir (57.62 f 45.13 mmol center dot m-2 center dot d-1). Within the reservoir area, FCO2 during high-water-level periods (37.07 f 28.51 mmol center dot m-2 center dot d-1) was markedly reduced compared to low-water-level periods (44.35 f 47.20 mmol center dot m-2 center dot d-1). These spatiotemporal variations in FCO2 are primarily driven by seasonal hydrology and operational water-level fluctuations. In the reservoir, FCO2 dynamics during low-water periods (rainy season) were dominated by anthropogenic nutrient inputs and terrestrial CO2 loading via rainfall-mediated soil leaching. Conversely, reduced hydrodynamic conditions during high-water periods enhanced the coupling of aquatic nutrient cycling, photosynthetic metabolism, and carbonate buffering, collectively suppressing CO2 emissions. These findings demonstrate that periodic water-level regulation by the TGD fundamentally restructures biogeochemical processes, leading to significantly mitigated CO2 emissions-particularly during high-water phases-relative to natural riverine environments. This study elucidates the mechanisms through which large-scale hydropower operations modulate carbon dynamics across river-reservoir continua.

However, short-term changes in phytoplankton distributions are often overlooked, leading to underestimations in predictions and difficulties in lake management. Considering that potential information from abundant automatic monitoring datasets has not been fully explored, we developed an automated recognition method to identify diurnal variations in phytoplankton via time series clustering. The temporal and spatial characteristics of the diurnal patterns of the chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration in Taihu Lake were explored. Additionally, the contributions of environmental factors to the phytoplankton distribution were analysed. The results revealed that (1) the diurnal changes in the Chl-a concentration in Taihu Lake could be divided into four main patterns, each with unique potential hotspots that reflect different ecological responses; (2) these patterns revealed high spatiotemporal heterogeneity across the lake, highlighting the complex ecological dynamics; and (3) notably, strong winds, an increase in temperature, and abrupt environmental fluctuations at the day scale were identified as critical drivers of diurnal phytoplankton patterns. This study demonstrates the potential of employing unsupervised clustering algorithms for identifying the diurnal dynamics of the phytoplankton distribution under complex influences, which can aid in optimizing the management and monitoring of shallow lakes.

Two dueling Dolichospermum strains in an Oregon lake determine occurrence of blooms	HARMFUL ALGAE												There is a common perception that cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs) occur relatively consistently over consecutive years in a given lake or reservoir. Description of the CyanoHAB properties of a lake should thus be a useful managerial tool allowing the development of monitoring tools focused on problem cyanobacteria, particularly those producing cyanotoxins. We describe the characterization of CyanoHABs in Detroit Lake, Oregon, over a 12-year period. This time span encompassed two periods of relatively consistent CyanoHABs, but also a marked shift occurring between the two extended periods of stability. During 2012-2017, CyanoHABs in Detroit Lake consisted of short-lived (similar to 2 weeks) early-season blooms producing high levels of 7-epi-cylindrospermopsin (CYN); very little microcystin (MC) was present. 2018 was a year in which levels of both CYN and MC were high, with MC produced from mid-May through July. During 2019-2024, MC concentrations were typically higher than CYN, and the early season CYN peaks were much lower than in previous years. Detroit Lake thus appears to have experienced two distinct periods of CyanoHAB character during the decade of study. We infer these changes to reflect changes in the dynamics of the two known cyanotoxinproducing Dolichospermum strains, Dolichospermum sp. DET 69 (CYN-positive) and Dolichospermum sp. DET73 (MC-positive), which appear to be the only significant cyanotoxin producers among the lake's planktonic phytoplankton community. Occasional HABs dominated by nontoxigenic Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and Gloeotrichia echinulata were also a feature of the later years, although Dolichospermum spp. were the dominant cyanobacteria during most of the bloom season. This study illustrates how a lake's CyanoHABs profile can change even in the absence of obvious changes in management or surrounding land use, and how an in-depth study of the CyanoHABs occurring in a lake over a few years can identify the problematical cyanobacteria and provide the information for developing a monitoring program targeting the HABs they produce.																			1568-9883	1878-1470				DEC	2025	150								102993	10.1016/j.hal.2025.102993	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2025.102993													WOS:001594240700001

Existing estimation methods include water-energy balance modeling, eddy covariance, and vapor isotope mass balance. The isotope mass balance approach traditionally relies on hydrogen isotopes (delta D), oxygen isotopes (delta O-18), and the derived d-excess parameter (d-excess = delta D - 8 x delta O-18). However, the system is generally underconstrained and subject to substantial parametric uncertainty. We developed a method to estimate three important parameters: the fraction of recycled moisture in atmospheric vapor (F), evaporation rate (E), and the magnitude of kinetic isotope fractionation during evaporation (n, the diffusion-turbulence factor). Our model, applied daily to Lake Michigan (USA) from 2021 to 2022, leveraged delta O-18, d-excess, and triple oxygen isotope (Delta ' O-17) data from upwind precipitation, downwind precipitation, and lake water, as well as temperature and relative humidity data. The model identified 25 of 80 downwind precipitation events as influenced by lake evaporation (minimum F > 0.1). Fractional lake evaporation contributions were highest in the cold season, reaching up to approximate to 60 % of total water vapor. Evaporation rate ranged between 0 and approximate to 10 mm/day and overlapped with independent estimates. For kinetic fractionation, most events required a low diffusion-turbulence factor (0.05 <= n <= 0.5), contrasting with values of n >= 0.5 commonly applied in lake studies. We infer n likely varies through time depending on environmental conditions. Our isotope-based method addresses a need to estimate evaporation rates with robust error estimates, which is crucial for water resource management.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				DEC	2025	662		B						134002	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.134002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.134002													WOS:001559990700001

Understanding the interactions between watershed eco-hydrological processes and lake systems, particularly their impact on nutrient balance dynamics deserves further investigation. Employing seasonal-trend decomposition (STL), Copula modeling, and the Lindeman-Merenda-Gold (LMG) algorithm, this study systematically analyzed ecohydrological processes in Poyang Lake basin and identified hydrological regime as the key factor governing lake nutrient balance. Notably, over the past three years (2022-2024), water level fluctuations intensified with the annual coefficient of variation (CV) rising by 15 % compared to the 15-year average (2010-2024). Moreover, the average N/P ratio was 15.40 (ranging from 6.29 to 32.73) over the past 45 years, with a transition trend from N&P co-limitation to P limitation. Low water levels amplified both lake nutrient imbalance and eutrophication risk, with an approximately twofold increase in overall risk probability compared to normal level. River inputs dominated N/P variations during low water level period (55 %), whereas lake sediment release became predominant during high water level phases (42 %). By extending the analysis to subtropical lakes globally, this study provides a foundation for hydrological management strategies that address eutrophication and support ecosystem resilience in floodplain lakes.

Here, we present a palynological record from Lake Marmara, western Turkiye and a quantitative reconstruction of paleoclimate variables based on the variations of pollen taxa over the last 1100 years. The palynological records and paleoclimate reconstruction from Lake Marmara indicate that the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) was marked by low arboreal pollen (AP), high seasonality, and drier conditions, whereas the Little Ice Age (LIA) between similar to 300-100 cal. yr BP was characterized by high AP, low seasonality, and wetter conditions.

J	Leather, D; Brown, JF				Leather, David; Brown, John Flett			Gypsum pseudomorphs, subaqueous cracks, lake-bed morphology and palaeoclimate in the Middle Devonian lacustrine flagstones of Orkney, Scotland	SCOTTISH JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY												The studied succession, located on Mainland Orkney and the island of Westray, lies in cyclic flagstones of Middle Devonian lake laminites. The lake bed of each cycle is constrained above and below by marginal lake facies that reflect a transition from open playa to permanent lake and vice versa, referred to as transition sequences. Abundant sedimentary structures in these sequences, previously described as subaqueous shrinkage cracks or subaqueous cracks, are reinterpreted as gypsum pseudomorphs. The study shows the small structures to have prismatic, lensoid and clustered forms of gypsum in graded stages of growth and supports a new perception of the palaeoclimate and its close interdependence with periodic gypsum growth. A lake model reconstruction of lake floor morphology and its link to seasonal palaeoclimate illustrates the case for the presence of limited size pseudomorphs. It is suggested that the occurrence of consistently small pseudomorphs is a consequence of a strongly regular, wet-dry tropical monsoon palaeoclimate, coupled with an extremely low-gradient lake floor, allowing short-term gypsum growth in strongly evaporating conditions across widely oscillating lake shorelines, the remarkable preservation of pseudomorphs being a consequence of dolomitization.

However, existing studies have paid little attention to the correlation between lateral degradation of permafrost and vertical thickening of the AL, as well as the contribution of meltwater during the thickening of the AL to vegetation greening on a large scale. Using 1,053 records of AL observation data from 2000 to 2020, five causal relationship models, and three data-driven methods, this study estimates the relationship between the vertical evolution trend of ALT and the lateral degradation of permafrost, while also exploring the contribution of meltwater from permafrost to vegetation growth. The results indicate that the average ALT on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) ranged from 1.03 to 3.73 m during 2002-2020. Furthermore, the TP is delineated by the Yarlung Zangbo, Nujiang, Lancang, Yangtze, and Yellow River basins. Permafrost degradation in the northwest region accelerates the thickening of AL in permafrost areas at a rate of 0.006 m/a. In contrast, in the southeast, it accelerates the thickening of AL in degraded permafrost areas at a rate of 0.004 m/a. Meanwhile, frozen ground degradation is more susceptible to extreme values of temperature, Land surface temperature, precipitation, and wind speed. During the thawing process, soil moisture may accumulate in deeper layers, resulting in an average contribution rate of the altered hydrological environment caused by degraded permafrost to vegetation growth of less than 2.29 %. This research provides a deeper understanding of the interactions among frozen ground, soil, and vegetation at a large scale. The interannual variations in ALT will further reduce the uncertainty about the thermal state of permafrost and its future response.

J	Liu, ZH; Chen, MS; Song, LL				Liu, Zhenhai; Chen, Musong; Song, Lanlan			Mechanisms of antimony transport in sediment-water systems on an annual scale	WATER RESEARCH												Antimony (Sb) pollution has become a significant environmental concern in eutrophic lakes, yet the processes governing its migration and transformation in sediments remain poorly understood. Previous studies have primarily focused on static concentration monitoring, with limited attention given to the dynamic behavior and seasonal toxicity variations of Sb. In this study, high-resolution dialysis (HR-Peeper) and multi-spectral techniques simultaneously obtained information on the changes of Sb, Mn, Fe(II), and dissolved organic matter (DOM) in sediment pore water from Meiliang Bay in Taihu Lake throughout the year. We found that soluble Sb concentrations were highest in April, primarily due to the complexation with tryptophan. Random forest, principal component analysis (PCA), redundancy analysis (RDA), partial correlation analysis, variance partitioning analysis (VPA), partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM) also confirmed that the outbreak of Sb is related to tryptophan. Further analysis with synchronous fluorescence (SF), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS) revealed that Sb(V) was more stably bound to aromatic C-H, alcoholic C-O, alkene C = C, and aliphatic -COOH groups in the tryptophan-like. Additionally, the adsorption of algae, the reduction of microorganisms, and the effect of iron and manganese oxides caused the low mobility of Sb in other months. Our study effectively advances the understanding of Sb mobility and bioavailability in lacustrine sediments and highlights the potential for sudden Sb pollution events in eutrophic lakes, which is crucial for the effective prediction and management of Sb pollution.																			0043-1354	1879-2448				DEC 1	2025	287		A						124367	10.1016/j.watres.2025.124367	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2025.124367		DEC 2025						40829268					WOS:001553791600003

Isotope analyses for different waters were conducted in a pronounced drought-flood abrupt alternation period within the Wulanmulun River basin of the Inner Mongolia semiarid region. The evaporation characteristics of different waters in the basin were assessed based on isotopic records during this critical period. The results revealed that isotopes in lake water were the most enriched, followed by those in river water, and those in groundwater were the most depleted in both dry and wet periods. Conversely, the d-excess values exhibited the opposite pattern, indicating that the intensity of evaporation followed the order of lakes > rivers > groundwater. The spatial isotopic variation of river water was driven predominantly by evaporation, overshadowing the effects of elevation changes. The Craig-Gordon model revealed that evaporation losses for both rivers and lakes were significantly greater during the dry period than during the wet period. The evaporation loss in the mainstream Wulanmulun River water displayed marked spatial heterogeneity relative to the tributary, largely attributable to reservoirs that extended the water residence time, whereas impervious surfaces and urban drainage systems downstream accelerated the influx of "fresh" precipitation into the river. Lakes exhibited notable variations in their evaporation over inflow ratio (E/I) in both dry and wet periods, primarily due to their distinct functions as artificial urban lakes, which resulted in varying water renewal rates. Relatively weak evaporation observed in groundwater demonstrated its potential in regulating water resources seasonally. The findings of this study provide valuable insights for adaptive water management and reservoir operations in vulnerable semiarid basins.

This study focuses on Lake Urmia in Iran as a case study, unraveling the complex interplay between climate change, management strategies, and local farmer behaviors in shaping the lake's fate. Through comparative analysis with Van Lake in Turkey, we identify anthropogenic drought as a key driver of Lake Urmia's shrinkage, underscoring the need for proactive policy interventions. First, climate change in the region is measured using high-resolution climate data derived from five Earth System Models (ESMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) analyzing 20 dimensions (5 indicators x 4 seasons) for each grid cell to identify Climate Change Hotspots (CCHs) and assess their potential impact on the Urmia and Van Lake basins. Second, semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis reveal the economic priorities of farmers in the Mahabad Plain region, representing farmers in the basin, and highlighting a critical gap in water conservation attitudes. Our findings advocate for government intervention in promoting crops with low water needs and incentivizing sustainable water management practices. Additionally, we identify climate change hotspots in the Urmia Lake Basin, providing vital insights for policymakers to prioritize mitigation measures. We propose targeted information campaigns and workshops to foster environmental responsibility among farmers, particularly in vulnerable regions. Ultimately, this study advocates for a comprehensive approach to sustainable water management, offering valuable lessons for preserving fragile ecosystems like Lake Urmia in the face of climate change.

The goal was to identify precipitation-dissolution reactions linked to limnic biochemical processes and to evaluate their influence on water chemistry and sediment reactivity. Sediment samples were analyzed using SEM-EDS and XRD, supported by chemical analyses of water and sediment. Mine waters exhibited extreme salinity, with Na concentrations up to -11,500 mg/l and Cl up to -25,000 mg/l. Water hardness, expressed as CaCO3, ranged from 1010 to 8540 mg/l. Several secondary minerals were identified, forming an important fraction of the sediment (up to 94 wt% of crystalline phases) alongside mine-derived detrital particles. Their distribution varied between discharge zones (deltas) and deeper reservoir areas. Dominant secondary phases included Mg calcite (2.7-8.3 mol% MgCO3), Sr aragonite (1.2-2.5 mol% SrCO3), barite, framboidal pyrite, and amorphous silica in the form of diatom frustules. The presence of brackish diatom species such as Pleurosigma elongatum, Halamphora coffeaformis, and Navicula salinarum indicates water's chemistry influence on biodiversity and sediment composition. The mineral assemblage reflects both mine water chemistry and biological processes, which are modulated by reservoir geometry (e.g., depth, retention time, and flow) and seasonal climatic conditions. Precipitation of secondary phases alters water composition, reduces hardness, increases the Mg:Ca ratio, and affects the reactivity of suspended matter entering river systems. These (bio)geochemical transformations may influence the mobility and bioavailability of nutrients and trace elements. Climate-related dynamics of these processes require further investigation.

Study focus: WetSpass-M model was used to estimate recharge for the period between October 2016 to December 2017 during a period of groundwater level monitoring campaigns in the area. To account for model uncertainty, four global sensitivity analysis methods including Sobol, Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test, Random Balance Designs Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test, and Delta-Moment-Independent Measure were used. The model was validated using the water table fluctuation method. New hydrological insights for the region: Model sensitivities ranging from 0 to 0.7 were calculated. Except Sobol, the sensitivity results are comparable. The most sensitive parameters are average rainfall intensity in the wet indicating that recharge is rainfall-driven when moisture is abundant; the alfa coefficient in the dry season possibly because it is associated with land cover indices, number of rainy days. Sobol analysis produces well-distributed sensitivity indices suggesting its strength to capture interactions and variances across multiple parameters. Recharge estimates from WetSpass-M aligned well with those calculated using the water table fluctuation, at a specific yield of 0.005(-). The calculated maximum and minimum monthly recharge values are 120 mm and 15 mm in April and August 2017 respectively. As would be expected, enhanced recharge is received in rainy seasons and regions with sandy soil.																				2214-5818				DEC	2025	62								102823	10.1016/j.ejrh.2025.102823	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2025.102823													WOS:001588965900003
J	Neto, IEL				Neto, Iran Eduardo Lima			Two-dimensional modeling of the impact of surface coverage on the evaporation and hydrodynamics of a shallow tropical reservoir	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The effect of physical, chemical and/or biological covers on the reduction of evaporation in tanks, ponds and natural water bodies has long been studied. However, little is known about the impact of such devices on the hydrodynamics of reservoirs, specially under highly variable inflow conditions, as observed in tropical regions. The present study applied a two-dimensional model (CE-QUAL-W2) for simulating the impact of surface coverage (SC) from 0 to 100 % on the evaporation and hydrodynamics of a shallow tropical reservoir located in Fortaleza, Brazil, characterized by a high interannual and seasonal inflow variability. The effect of the placement and type of coverage was also tested. The model represented well the interannual and seasonal variations in evaporation, as well as the impact of SC, as compared to previous studies. Dimensionless correlations were proposed to predict the effect of SC on the reduction of evaporation (up to 91 %), surface temperature (up to 17 %) and horizontal velocity (up to 26 %). Seasonal variations in evaporation from the wet to the dry period ranged from an increase of 25 % to a decrease of 26 %, as surface coverage (SC) varied from zero (SC = 0) to full coverage (SC = 100 %). The results also indicated that the residence time (RT) increased with SC (up to 19 %) due to reduced temperature and horizontal velocity. A dimensionless correlation was also obtained to relate RT to SC. Additionally, the impact of SC on RT increased from wet to dry years (up to 16 %). Finally, the results showed that partial SC at shallower depths reduced evaporation (up to 6 %) compared to the other cases of surface cover placement and type. The 2D modeling approach and dimensionless correlations proposed in the present study not only advanced in the knowledge of evaporation and hydrodynamics of shallow reservoirs, but also serve as a practical tool to predict the potential impacts of physical, chemical and/or biological barriers on the water balance and water quality of such ecosystems.

Mesozooplankton grazing patterns and preferences during a cyanobacterial harmful algal bloom (cHAB) in a large eutrophic lake	HARMFUL ALGAE												Mesozooplankton (200-2,000 mu m) are an important link between primary producers and higher-level consumers and can influence phytoplankton biomass and community structure via grazing. Yet, during cyanobacteria harmful algal blooms (cHABs) we have a poor understanding of which food resources mesozooplankton use and their grazing pressure on phytoplankton. To investigate this, we conducted two gradient-grazer assays to measure mesozooplankton community grazing rates in western Lake Erie during the 2021 cHAB season. We measured mesozooplankton grazing on various food sources, including: total phytoplankton, phytoplankton major taxa (Cyanobacteria, Cryptophyta/Bacillariophyta, Chlorophyta), and autotrophic and heterotrophic picoplankton and nanoplankton. We used these data to estimate mesozooplankton feeding selectivity, the importance of each food source toward mesozooplankton carbon intake, as well as the percent standing stock and growth consumed by mesozooplankton. Mesozooplankton selected for autotrophic and heterotrophic nanoplankton, were neutrally selective for Cryptophyta/Bacillariophyta, and avoided Cyanobacteria and the total phytoplankton community. Mesozooplankton carbon intake was dominated by autotrophic nanoplankton and Cyanobacteria, indicating these food sources may be important in supporting zooplankton production during these cHAB events, although our understanding of the incorporation of Cyanobacteria carbon into mesozooplankton production is limited. While mesozooplankton grazed a small portion of total phytoplankton (1-12 % d(-1)) and Cyanobacteria (5-13 % d(-1)) standing stock biomass (<200 <mu>m), they exerted a relatively stronger control on the growth of total phytoplankton (4-38 % d(-1)) and Cyanobacteria (64-106 % d(-1)), primarily due to the low measured growth rates of these food items during the study. Our results demonstrate that mesozooplankton graze on Cyanobacteria during cHAB events, and under the right conditions influence cHAB dynamics through direct consumption of Cyanobacteria and indirect effects on Cyanobacteria grazers and competitors.
